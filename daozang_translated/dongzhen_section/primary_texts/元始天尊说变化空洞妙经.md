The Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning ascended his throne upon the Crimson Profundity of the Floating Crags of Yutian’s Yuji Mountain in the Western Heavens. Beneath the Seven-Jewel Forest of the *Qian* Tree, he wore a nine-hued *Liluo* mantle, a robe of soaring feathers, a crown of instantaneous transformations, and girded the Sword of Morning Radiance and Sunlit Chime.

The Perfected of the Highest Realms attended in assembly—fifty million strong. Then he commanded the Five Elders and the Supreme Perfected of the Left of the Immortal Metropolis to unfurl the Seven-Colored Jade-Frosted Phoenix-Feathered Casket, spreading forth the Five Scrolls of the Vermilion Writ of True Script. They chanted the *Upper Scripture of Transformative Emptiness*. Jade tones resonated in four directions; wondrous echoes filled the Eight Arrays. Crimson and white banners stirred the winds; myriad spirits convened in grand assembly. Mystic patterns flowed in elegance; the Purple Void adorned itself in splendor. The Supreme Sages rejoiced, scattering radiant jade light. All heavens leapt in exultation, none failing to awaken in clarity. Fragrant blossoms and celestial music abounded beyond measure. Celebratory mists gathered in eightfold assemblies; golden winds coursed in fourfold harmony. The Three Luminaries paused in their brilliance; the Seven Spirits gleamed in purity. The Eight Paths blazed in clarity; the cavernous vision knew no bounds. The Upper Metropolis resounded in crystalline song; divine grace extended into the distant vast. True essence congealed within, overflowing; the spirit roamed freely, unbound. *Qi* ascended through the heavy and light heavens; the body traversed the Five Phases. Dragon patterns gleamed upon the Azure Ford; radiant clouds shimmered above the verdant heights. Exquisite melodies flourished in the Orchid Grove; flying canopies feasted amidst the Eight Sceneries. Dragon reins were raised upon the Pure Ridge; phoenix chariots soared aloft. Treading the empty cavern to scatter clouds, swift crimson axles coursed in fluid motion. Treading the Nine Clouds with eternal gaze, ascending the Three Heavens to dissolve all thought. Long winds and mist drifted in floating shade; the sun’s brilliance unfurled to brush away all gloom. The Great Yang unleashed its majesty; lightning bolts surged in thunderous resonance. Flowing chimes intertwined in splendor; the Four Ultimates dispelled all obscurity. Roaming in mystic awakening, beholding the Great Image of Transformation, bathing in the Orchid Pool, washing away filth in the Vast Waves. Refining the soul in sapphire waves, ascending to the Daoist sanctuary. Golden spirits gleamed in radiance; the Six Perfections submitted in harmony. The principles of transformation governed the Nine Ultimates; harmonious *qi* endured eternally. Inner joy nurtured the heart; outer kindness fused with the world. The Cavernous Spirit shaped destiny; true essence was contained, scriptures uttered. Gazing above and below into the empty cavern, transformation reigned as sovereign. The Great Dao and its virtue crowned the divine lineage. In its towering majesty, it was revered by all heavens.

The wondrous truth now radiant, the myriad *qi* converged as one. Dark resonance achieved mystic communion; the Great Stillness penetrated the subtle. Principles of wonder infused harmony; profound clarity settled in purple radiance. Startling waves stirred the hidden void; all was held in the supreme mechanism. Vastly dispelling the Nine Nether realms, the Gate of the Sun opened wide. Wings folded in the Upper Palace; numinous transformation embraced the Two Modes. Jade tones chimed in resonance; ten thousand echoes arose in lament. Phoenixes sang in the Orchid Garden; dragons roared upon the cloud-ladder. Horses startled in the Ultimate Abode; dragons raced along the Mystic River. The Seven Primes stilled their canopies; the Three Luminaries paused in their course. The Immortal Sovereign loosened his reins; the Primordial Lady opened the gates. Above, the unformed was yet incomplete; below, the Four Limits were bestowed. In an instant, in the blink of an eye, the Nine Enclosures were traversed. The Eight Convergences met in darkness; the cavernous depths entered the infinitesimal. The Great Emperor steadied the wheel; the Five Elders grasped the banners. Golden tigers led the way; celestial escorts pursued from behind. Fierce steeds bared their throats; venomous beasts unleashed their might. Heavenly soldiers seized the deviant; the Vermilion Writ captured the false. Heavenly demons lost their *qi*; ten thousand spirits dissolved in ruin. Jade Perfected enforced discipline—great and small, none escaped. The Three Heavens’ true Dao surged forth; the Six *Qi* raced in tumult. Dark grace washed away filth; the Frigid Pool was cleansed and swept. The Dao beheld anew in radiance; numinous transformation circled ninefold. The Great Possession opened fourfold pathways; the Five Realms stood equal in peace. Winds roamed without hindrance, fulfilling every heart’s desire. Vast was the Great Beginning; boundless the distant clarity. The imperial current responded to destiny; myriad Perfected arose of themselves. The forest of existence flourished in splendor. Dragon trunks spread their glory; all species burst into bloom. Vermilion sceneries shook jade branches; wings soared into the Purple Empyrean. Ascending the Jade Clarity, the Two Modes shone lightly; the Eight Paths gleamed in lofty brilliance. The Moon Maiden nurtured her radiance; the Sun Youth exalted his essence. They poured forth upon all heavens, converging in the Eight Nether realms. A hundred harmonies scattered their fragrance; balmy winds rioted in delight. In serene clarity, the spirit soared; flying wheels bore azure plumes. Radiance blazed in resplendence, cascading upon the Seven Cities. Golden lads held the towels; purple consorts cradled the infants. They bathed in the Jade Empyrean’s ford, scattered blossoms in the Vermilion Court. The *Qian* Tree’s branches swayed; the Round Image flourished in beauty. The myriad existences opened wide; echoes resounded in the empty azure. Mournful tones arose in verse; phoenix songs joined in harmony. The subtle and constant hum merged; luan birds sang in unison. Celebratory mists intertwined in darkness; vermilion flames and golden bells. *Qi* admitted no obscurity; light emerged in self-generated clarity. The profound and distant Upper Void allowed all passions to be forgotten. High *qi* poured downward; the spirit journeyed into the distant vast. Grieving for the world, lamenting its customs, he inclined toward the harmony of all life.

Thus was the Yellow Register inscribed upon the jade tablets of the Upper Isles; the First Emperor recorded the name of the Great Possession. The Great Desert cradled the *qi* of the Jade Treasury; the Boundless grasped the eons of the Vast Kalpa. Those who could gather power amidst transformation would extend prosperity without end; those who cultivated the empty cavern would see the myriad spirits naturally at peace.

Chanting the verses of the Empty Cavern, ten thousand demons would find no form to exploit. Wondrous indeed was the numinous might—solemn and vast in its majesty. Towering was the lineage of virtue, the supreme spirit of the Highest Sages.

Thereupon, he commanded the Five Elders and the Supreme Perfected of the Left of the Immortal Metropolis to reveal the essentials of the Eight Paths of Transformative Emptiness and Wondrous Cavern, to be shown to the scholars of future generations, that they might cultivate its profound wonders and ascend as immortals.

On the day of the Beginning of Spring, at noon, the Highest Perfected and great spirits convened with the immortals in the Supreme Ultimate’s Upper Palace. They established jade tablets, golden slips, and purple script, recording the names of those who had attained immortality. These were inscribed upon the Mystic Register and arranged upon the Square Tablets.

On that day, the celestial, terrestrial, and aquatic officials; the true spirits of the Five Peaks; and the great deities of the Four Seas all rode upon eight-scened jade chariots, five-hued cloud carriages, or were borne by crimson phoenixes, some mounting flying dragons. Innumerable jade lads and maidens—ten million strong—held aloft banners and streamers, scattering blossoms and burning incense as they traversed the void, their radiance illuminating all heavens as they circled the eight directions. Each bore the registers of those who studied the Dao, ascending to the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate to review merits and transgressions, to examine good and evil. Those commended by the Three Officials and attested by the Five Emperors had their names inscribed upon jade tablets and recorded in the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate, then proclaimed to the myriad spirits, whereupon the Right Separate Bureau would receive them. Those who violated the precepts and prohibitions had their offenses listed in the Nine Bureaus, their punishments meted out by the Three Officials, seized by the Four Controllers, and censured by the Five Emperors—all were stricken from the registers and transferred to the ghostly officials, their fates of good and evil thus decided. For three days, the assembly deliberated, and none among the celestial bodies—sun, moon, and stars—or the myriad spirits upon the earth failed to tremble in solemnity.

On this day, those who pursued the Dao would bathe in purity and fast, entering their chambers at noon, then at midnight exposing themselves to the open air, facing north to bow twice, knocking their heads and striking their cheeks nine times. They would confess their hidden transgressions and grievous faults committed since beginning their study of the true Dao—offenses difficult to absolve, sins beyond pardon—acknowledging each in turn. They were to empty their hearts and still their minds, leaving nothing concealed within or without, beseeching release and deliverance, to draw forth the Seven Mysteries, that their hidden souls might ascend and their bodies attain flight as immortals. Upon completion, they would click their teeth nine times and softly intone:

"Northern Mysterious High Perfected, Supreme Immortals of the Supreme Ultimate,
Ten thousand ten-thousands of the Profound Void, a thousand thousands of numinous transformations,
Auspicious day, propitious hour, ascending to the lofty dawn,
Three luminaries merge in darkness, Eight Qi spread forth,
Four Controllers open the review, Five Emperors determine immortality.
I beseech the erasure of past transgressions, the uprooting of sin’s roots,
That my name be inscribed in the Nine Heavens, recorded in the Numinous Chariot,
My seven generations of ancestors released, to receive the profound grace.
May all ten thousand vows, when the moment arrives, be fulfilled without fail."

Upon finishing, they would ingest the talisman of the Supreme Ultimate’s refining transformation and true numinous life, swallowing nine times before ceasing. Practicing this Way for eight years, their jade names would be listed in the registers of the Supreme Ultimate’s Upper Observatory, and they would be counted among the immortals of the Supreme Ultimate. Their bodies would be deemed worthy of flight, ascending to the Upper Clarity.

On the day of the Vernal Equinox, at noon, the Great Simplicity Perfected of Kunlun’s Jasper Terrace convened with the various immortal officials upon the Terrace of Jade. There, they examined the true scriptures and the merits of scholars. On this day, the celestial, terrestrial, and aquatic officials; the Four Perfected of the Five Peaks; and the great deities of the immortals all arrived, riding cloud chariots and feathered canopies, twelve flying dragons. Jade lads and maidens scattered blossoms and burned incense, holding floral banners as they floated through the void, circling the eight directions before ascending to the Jasper Terrace. There, they itemized the weight of each scholar’s scriptural practice and conferred the rank of Upper Perfected. For three days, the assembly deliberated, and none among the celestial bodies—sun, moon, and stars—or the myriad spirits upon the earth failed to tremble in solemnity.

On this day, those who pursued the Dao would fast in purity, entering their chambers at noon, then at midnight exposing themselves to the open air. Burning incense and reciting scriptures, they would face north to bow twice, knocking their heads and striking their cheeks nine times. They would confess and repent the transgressions committed since beginning their study of the Dao—violations of precepts, breaches of scriptural statutes, careless divulgence of celestial texts—and beseech absolution. They would further implore the remission of sins and the lifting of punishments upon their seven generations of ancestors, to deliver their hidden souls from the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, that their destitute spirits might ascend and their bodies attain immortality. Upon completion, they would click their teeth nine times and softly intone:

"Great Simplicity’s Upper Perfected, lofty immortals of supreme numinosity,
Today I make my supplication above, as auspicious clouds turn their carriages,
Feasting in the radiant light of the Jasper Terrace, assembled in the Purple Court.
Registers are reviewed, sins expunged, lives recorded,
Five Emperors determine the records, Eastern Florescence inscribes the names.
The Dao aligns with my highest vow, I receive the wondrous scriptures,
Awaiting the ten thousand recitations for the divine chariot,
Hoping the Jade Emperor grants amnesty, that all my aspirations be fulfilled,
Transforming my radiance and altering my bones, to ascend in flight to the Great Clarity."

Upon finishing, they would ingest the Jasper Terrace’s talisman of true communication and immortal transformation, swallowing nine times before ceasing. Practicing this Way for eight years, they would cause the Great Simplicity Perfected to descend to their chambers, where they would behold their divine forms and attain ascent, flying to the Eight Simplicities’ Upper Palace of the Jasper Terrace.

On the day of the Beginning of Summer, at noon, the Five Emperors convened with the various immortals in the Palace of the Purple Tenuity, where the Four Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate were arrayed to review the registers of merits and transgressions of those who studied the Dao. On this day, the celestial rectifiers, the water deities of rivers and seas, and the spirits of the Five Peaks all arrived, riding cloud chariots, feathered canopies, flying dragons, and crimson phoenixes. Jade lads and maidens burned incense and scattered blossoms, floating through the void with floral banners and five-hued ringing bells, all arriving in solemn array. Ascending to the Palace of the Purple Tenuity, they itemized the merits and transgressions of scholars and reviewed the registers. For three days, the assembly deliberated, distinguishing good from evil. At this time, none among the celestial bodies—sun, moon, and five stars—or the myriad spirits upon the earth failed to tremble in solemnity.

On this day, scholars would fast in purity, entering their chambers at noon, then at midnight exposing themselves bareheaded to the open air, facing north to bow twice, knocking their heads and striking their cheeks nine times. They would confess the transgressions committed since beginning their study of the Dao—violations of precepts, lapses and carelessness, harboring dark malice, disloyalty and unfiliality, envy and harm, disbelief—and beseech absolution. They would plead for the deliverance of their seven generations of ancestors from the punishments of the dark prisons, to be lifted from the Three Paths and Five Tribulations, released from hidden servitude, and ascend to the Hall of Blessings. They would vow to attain the divine immortals and ascend in flight to the Upper Clarity. Upon completion, they would click their teeth nine times and softly intone:

"Five Qi return to the numinous, gathering the true in lofty purity,
Four Poles oversee and illuminate, proclaiming universally to the myriad spirits.
The Three Officials examine, the merits of the upper registers are itemized,
Those diligent are recorded, those without goodness are stricken from life.
Three luminaries bestow adornment, Five Emperors refine the essence,
Transforming radiance and altering bones, I receive the great numinosity.
My highest vow is to fly as an immortal, my body to dwell in the Purple Court,
My middle vow is for the Nine Heavens to inscribe my name in gold,
My lowest vow is for boundless eternity, the endless heavens unshaken.
May the three vows and nine unions all be fulfilled without fail."

Upon completion, they would then ingest the Purple Tenuity Numinous Capital True Talisman, swallowing it nine times in succession. Practicing this Dao for eight years would summon the Five Emperors to descend into their chamber, where they would commune with the numinous and exchange truth. Sins would disperse, and blessings converge, allowing them to ascend and fly to the Upper Clarity.

On the Summer Solstice, at noon, the Three Officials of Heaven would convene at the Upper Office of the Controller of Destinies, gathering the River Marquis and the Water Emperor of the Yellow River to review and determine the ledgers of merits and transgressions for all people, adding years or erasing lifespans. On that day, the Controller of Destinies of the Nine Heavens, along with all the Perfected of the heavens above, the numinous spirits of the Five Marchmounts and Five Emperors, would ride upon five-colored cloud chariots, with flying dragons and feathered canopies, led by attendant immortals, traversing the world and floating through the void, arriving in solemn assembly. The Controller of Destinies would then review the ledgers, reducing lifespans for those with transgressions and adding years for those with merits. For three days, they would deliberate and distinguish between good and evil. At this time, the sun, moon, and five stars of the heavens, along with all the spirits upon the earth, would tremble in reverence.

On that day, practitioners would purify themselves in fasting, enter their chambers at noon, and at midnight, expose their bodies, burn incense, and recite scriptures. Facing north, they would remove their headscarves, bow their heads, and strike their cheeks nine times. They would first confess the sins they had committed since beginning their studies—offenses of disrespect toward Heaven and Earth, violations against the Three Luminaries, leaking the true and exposing the Dao, carelessly revealing celestial texts, and transgressing precepts and commandments—and beseech forgiveness. They would pray for the release of their seven generations of ancestors, allowing them to depart from the midst of the Three Officials and from beneath the Five Tribulations, ascending to the Dark Palace, while their own bodies would ascend and fly. Upon completion, they would click their teeth nine times and softly intone:

"Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, Supreme Perfected and Hosts of Immortals,
Escorting the Radiant Emperor’s Chamber, the Controller of Destinies reviews the years,
Summoning the River Marquis and the Twelve Water Spirits,
Examining the registers of transgressions and the Jade Tablets,
Those with goodness are recorded, those who offend are noted.
Today, in this universal reckoning, I humbly implore the mysterious grace,
Beseeching the removal of past karmic obstacles, the dispersal of myriad transgressions,
May my seven ancestors obtain blessings, may my body ascend as an immortal,
My name inscribed in the Nine Heavens, preserving my truth in the Jade Dawn."

Upon completion, they would then ingest the Longevity Talisman of the Controller of Destinies, swallowing it nine times in succession. Practicing this Dao for eight years would ensure the Controller of Destinies finalizes their record, the Great One inscribes their merits, the Three Officials erase their sins, and their body attains the rank of Upper Immortal.

On the day of the Autumnal Equinox, at noon, the Perfected of the Five Marchmounts would visit the Yellow Court of the Yellow Elder Lord on Cloud Terrace Mountain, assembling with the various immortal officials to determine the divine charts and numinous medicines of the world. On that day, the Perfected of the heavens above, the Chancellors of the Nine Heavens, the Five Emperors of the sun and moon, the celestial beings of the Five Stars, would all ride upon eight-scene jade chariots, five-colored cloud carriages, flying dragons and phoenixes, their teams of four resplendent and abundant. Immortal youths and jade maidens, holding floral banners, would burn incense, scatter flowers, float through the void singing, traversing the various heavens and feasting upon the Five Marchmounts, arriving in solemn assembly. Ascending the Yellow Chamber, they would review the ledgers of the Perfected, the divine charts, and the numinous medicines, deliberating for three days. At this time, the Perfected of the heavens above and all the spirits upon the earth would tremble in reverence.

Practitioners traveling to famous mountains on that day would purify themselves in fasting, burn incense at the two daily periods, recite scriptures, ingest talismans, swallow qi to harmonize the fluids of qi, calm their minds, and focus their thoughts upon the mysterious and true. They would bow their heads and strike their cheeks, first confessing the sins they had committed—diminishing their spirit, defiling the Three Palaces, failing in visualization, neglecting the precepts, offending Heaven and Earth, the sun, moon, and stars, and accumulating past transgressions—and beseeching forgiveness. They would pray for the deliverance of their seven ancestors, allowing them to depart from the dark paths, their destitute souls to ascend, and their own bodies to attain immortality. Upon completion, they would click their teeth nine times and softly intone:

"The Supreme reviews the immortals, the Yellow Elder bestows talismans,
Universally announcing to the Five Marchmounts, opening the reckoning of divine charts,
Names recorded in the Emperor’s register, merits inscribed in cinnabar script,
Those diligent are noted, those with transgressions are erased,
An auspicious day, a propitious hour, the myriad qi pure and void,
Reciting to seek my wishes, the numinous medicines and mushroom blossoms,
Bowing to drink the essence of the moon, raising to sip the radiance of the sun,
Transforming form and radiance, ascending and flying to the Dark Capital."

Upon completion, they would then ingest the Middle Yellow Eightfold Secret Immortal Talisman, swallowing it nine times in succession. Practicing this Dao for eight years would allow them to behold their divine form, be granted cinnabar mushrooms and numinous medicines, and fly through the Great Void.

On the Autumnal Equinox, at noon, the Supreme August Emperor would ascend the Upper Clarity Numinous Gate of the Great Tenuity, convening with the Three Elder Lords of the Supreme, the Perfected Duke of the Northern Culmen, the Great Spirits of the Eight Seas, and the Venerable Spirits of the Five Marchmounts to collectively deliberate upon the sins and blessings of the world’s myriad beings, recording the diligence or negligence of Dao practitioners, and submitting these to the Controller of Destinies. On that day, they would visit the Primordial Honored Ones of the Nine Heavens, the Heavenly Parents of the Nine Heavens, the High Immortals and Perfected, the Nine Numinous Immortal Mothers, the Great Spirits of the Southern Culmen and Upper Prime, and the Wondrous Practitioners of the Five Emperors and Four Poles. All would ride upon eight-scene jade chariots, wheels of purple clouds, five-colored cinnabar carriages, with framed dragons and mounted phoenixes, flying immortal feathered canopies stacked ninety thousandfold. Immortal youths and jade maidens, numbering ten billion, would hold nine-colored staffs and ten-fold floral banners, their luminous fire bells resounding, singing and chanting in the cloud palaces. They would burn incense, scatter flowers, and fill the Upper Clarity and Great Tenuity Palaces, reviewing the merits and transgressions of the world’s myriad practitioners, deliberating for three days. At this time, the sun and moon would incline their canopies, the stellar lodges would halt their mechanisms, and all the spirits of Heaven and Earth would tremble in reverence.

Practitioners on that day would purify themselves in fasting, enter their chambers at noon, and at midnight, expose their bodies, burn incense, and recite scriptures. Facing north, they would remove their headscarves, bow their heads, and strike their cheeks. They would first confess the sins they had committed—disrespect toward Heaven and Earth, the sun, moon, and stars, defiling the Three Luminaries, leaking secret texts, violating precepts and commandments, and all their myriad transgressions—and beseech forgiveness. From that day forward, they would begin anew, humbly imploring the Supreme Saints to grant them compassion, beseeching the ascent of their seven ancestors’ destitute souls to the Hall of Blessings, and their own bodies to ascend as immortals. Upon completion, they would click their teeth nine times and softly intone:

The August Supreme Thearch, the Mysterious Numinous of the Grand Tenuity, the Ten Thousand Spirits audit the registers, the Directors of Destiny measure life, the Great One grasps the tally, the Upper Prime preserves essence. Today at the Eight Assemblies, the host of perfected beings converges in numinosity. Obstructions from past roots and stagnations are all dissolved and purified. Inscribe my name in the Mysterious Record, erase my transgressions from the ledger. The White Prime Youth shall ever stand beside me, the Three Primes merging as one.

Behold the divine forms, set my purple mist in motion, and soar into the Imperial Court.

Upon completion, ingest the *Lingdu You Sheng Fu* (Mysterious Ascension Talisman of the Numinous Capital), and swallow nine times while gazing upward.

Practicing this Way for eight years, the myriad spirits will record and recognize me, my name inscribed in the Nine Heavens. Perfected beings will descend, enabling my ascension as an immortal.

On the day of the Beginning of Winter, at noon, the Perfected of the Yang Terrace convene with the host of immortal officials and jade maidens upon the Yang Terrace to audit and register the names of those who have attained the Dao in the various sacred mountains. On that day, the sagely perfected of the myriad heavens, along with the great spirits of the Five Marchmounts and the Four Waterways, all ride feathered canopies of flying immortals, twelve soaring dragons, five-colored streaming bells, and ten resplendent banners. They burn incense, scatter blossoms, and traverse the world, testing and observing all people, who assemble in solemn array. Ascending the Yang Terrace, they examine and verify the registers of names.

For those who cultivate the Way, on that day they must fast in purity, enter their chambers at noon, and at midnight, expose their bodies, burn incense, and recite scriptures. Visualizing the divine perfected, they face north, bow their heads, and strike their cheeks. First, they confess the accumulated transgressions and karmic obstructions they have committed, freely declaring their faults and beseeching forgiveness. They implore the release and deliverance of their seven ancestors’ destitute souls, their liberation from the dark realms, and their ascent to the Southern Palace, while their own bodies attain immortality.

Upon completion, they click their teeth nine times and softly intone:
*The Sun tests and observes, the myriad spirits stand in solemn purity. The Four Controllers and Five Thearchs, the Upper Simplifier of Mysterious Names, the Primordial August One opens the true, erases sins, and inscribes life. Proclaiming to the Eight Assemblies, may my aspirations be fulfilled. The host of spirits reverently protects, enabling ascent to the Grand Numinosity.*

Upon completion, ingest the *Yangtai Ling Sheng Yu Fu* (Numinous Life Jade Talisman of the Yang Terrace), and swallow nine times while gazing upward.

Practicing this Way for eight years, one’s name will be inscribed in the Nine Heavens, and perfected beings will descend, enabling flight to the Imperial Chambers.

On the day of the Winter Solstice, at noon, the host of celestial perfected and immortals all proceed to the Eastern Flowery Palace of the Square Cauldron in the Eastern Sea, where the Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea engraves and finalizes the names of the immortals in golden script within the registers. On that day, the great sagely host of heaven, the August Ones of the Nine Mysteries of the Numinous Capital, all ride eight-scene jade chariots, flying immortal feathered wheels, and golden mist-purple canopies. The radiance of the entire sky shines forth, five-colored streaming bells resound, and the spirits of the Five Marchmounts, Four Waterways, rivers, and seas are summoned. They burn incense, scatter blossoms, and traverse the void. Heaven and earth test and observe as the myriad immortals ascend to the Square Cauldron to engrave and finalize the mysterious names, gathering for three days of deliberation.

On that day, the myriad numinous beings of heaven and earth stand in solemn reverence. For those who cultivate the Way, on that day they must fast in purity, enter their chambers at noon, and at midnight, expose their bodies, burn incense, and recite scriptures. Facing north, they remove their headscarves, bow their heads, and strike their cheeks. First, they confess all the sins they have committed since gaining consciousness, freely declaring their faults and beseeching forgiveness. They implore the release and deliverance of their seven ancestors, their ascent to the Southern Palace.

Upon completion, they click their teeth nine times and softly intone:
*The wondrous observation of the Celestial Perfected, the Square Cauldron’s audit of immortals. The day is auspicious, the hour harmonious; ten thousand aspirations unfold. The time is pure, the day propitious; I receive the supreme grace. Inscribed in golden script and jade characters, my name is listed in the numinous registers. The Five Thearchs reverently protect, the Four Controllers guard the spirit. I attain the eight-scene chariot, ascend through the numinous mist, soaring to the Three Clarities, to pay homage at the Jade Dawn.*

Upon completion, ingest the *Tianzhen Qing Ling Ba Jing Yu Fu* (Pure Numinous Eight-Scene Jade Talisman of the Celestial Perfected), and swallow nine times while gazing upward.

Practicing this Way for eight years, one’s name will be inscribed in the Azure Palace of the Square Cauldron. With unwavering sincerity, one will attain the rank of upper immortal.

The Eight Nodal Days are the days of celestial court assemblies, the grand celebrations of the opening of the true. At these times, the myriad spirits gather in deliberation. The great sages of the myriad heavens, the celestial perfected, the numinous beings of wondrous conduct, the sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the Five Marchmounts and Five Thearchs, the spirits of rivers and seas, and countless multitudes all assemble in solemn array for three days of celebration. They calculate and determine the celestial perfected, distinguish good and evil, record merits and transgressions, and differentiate diligence from negligence. The records of merits and demerits are all listed in the Nine Heavens, each copied to the Three Palaces, Nine Bureaus, the Offices of Destiny, and the Upper Courts. Matters great and small, light and heavy, are all fully recorded.

On these days, those who cultivate the Way must fast in purity, first confess their transgressions, burn incense, recite scriptures, and earnestly recite incantations and precepts. They beseech the numinous spirits above, seeking the aid of the Four Controllers and the assistance of the Five Thearchs. Their names are preserved and recorded in the jade registers, enabling the descent of divine beings and the attainment of flight in broad daylight.

For those who cultivate the Way yet remain unaware of the grand celebrations of the myriad heavens or the times when the supreme sages gather in deliberation, who do not know the method of first confessing transgressions and faults, how can their past examinations be resolved? How can their transgressions be absolved? In such cases, their seven ancestors will long remain mired in hell, and the hope of ascending as immortals will be in vain.

The spring and autumn equinoxes are the days when the Celestial Prime judges the mutual overcoming of life and transgression, when the true are tested and the myriad immortals observed. On these days, one must not be negligent or distracted but should focus the mind, contemplate with utmost sincerity, and constantly abide in the Dao. The body must not transgress, and one must not rashly engage in cultivation. First, one must confess the transgressions one has committed.

Once the vows are firmly established and the Celestial Prime engraves the records, if one remains free from transgression from beginning to end, then the attainment of upper immortality may be anticipated. If, however, one confesses and then transgresses again, the officials of the bureaus will impeach them, and the Celestial Prime will no longer accept their confessions. The Dao of immortality will then become distant, and the body will descend to the realm of lesser ghosts. This is the manifest distinction between sin and fortune, arising from a single day. Those who cultivate the Way must proceed with utmost caution.

In all matters of cultivating the supreme Dao, visualizing spirits, contemplating the perfected, and mastering the empty and wondrous transformations of the four seasons’ forms and appearances, if one seeks the essentials of ascending as an immortal yet remains ignorant of the practice of repentance and confession during the Eight Nodal Days, of earnestly reciting incantations and declarations to erase sins and determine life’s true register, then the divine perfected will remain distant and unseen. With faint thoughts and rare feelings, the hoped-for response will be difficult to attain.

On this day of repentance and confession, no sin will fail to disperse, no spirit will fail to protect, and the incantations and declarations, once uttered, will evoke a response. Through such visualization of spirits, within less than a decade, one will behold the true divine, and the seven generations of ancestors will be delivered from the three paths of suffering, their dark souls restored in form to receive transformation in the Southern Immortal’s realm. The body will dissolve without obstruction and soar aloft, riding the empty skies in flight.

This is the primordial supreme Dao, concealed within the Great Abundance Palace above the Nine Heavens. According to the statutes of the Luminous Perfected, it is transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas. Should one lightly disclose its sacred texts, calamity will extend to the seven ancestral lineages, and the hope of immortality will be lost.

The Right *Lingzhen Badao* Transformative Cavernous Jade-Scenic Hidden Talisman originates from the Supreme Jade Canon, serving to aid the divine scriptures. It should also be inscribed on silk according to its color and worn on the body for eight years, whereby one may attain the perfected’s absolution of retribution and assuredly achieve transcendence as an upper immortal.

For all who practice the Dao, visualize, and aspire to authenticity, yearning for ascension and dispersal of their names from the registers of transgressions—inscribed in golden tablets—must ingest the talisman and perform the rites. On the years of *Taisui*, one’s life destiny, *Jiazi*, and *Gengshen*, one should prepare in advance and ingest the talisman in accordance with the nodal periods, not solely on the exact days of the nodes.

Those who cultivate without obtaining this text will find their sins unresolved, the divine perfected will directly expunge them, and transcendence will remain distant. Those who attain it shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight—truly, this is the *Transformative Cavernous* [teaching].

The *Wondrous Scripture of Transformative Cavernous* as expounded by the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning concludes here.
