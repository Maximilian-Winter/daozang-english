At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy had perfected the lands of the five directions. If there were good men and good women who perfected their lands, together with the great assembly, recited and chanted this sutra, received, upheld, and made offerings to it, then in times of drought, rain would come, and winds would cease. Wherever good men and women dwelled in their lands, among those beings who received, upheld, recited, transcribed, explained, or listened to this sutra, know that such persons were virtuous. The divine power of the Dao would constantly guard and protect them. Why was this so?

Within the sacred scriptures, there were myriad holy powers capable of broadly delivering and saving living beings. At that time, the Heavenly Worthy fully expounded for them:

*The Heavenly Worthy, with great compassion,*
*Universally pities all living beings.*
*The Dao speaks of all merits and virtues,*
*Subtle and wondrous, beyond thought or discussion.*
*All who seek shall receive response and resonance,*
*Sweet rain swiftly bestowed.*
*Diligently and earnestly follow this mindfulness,*
*For all ten thousand dharmas are thus.*

The Dao declared: Good men and women who recite, transcribe, or write the *Sutra on the Dragon Kings* shall be praised by the great assembly. If there were lands where rain was sought, on the six days of purification, one should purify the land, sweep clean, burn incense, make offerings, bow in reverence, and earnestly pray. The Heavenly Worthy would respond and summon the Dragon Kings to descend with rain and dispel disasters, universally bestowing sweet moisture. Then the names of the Dragon Kings were proclaimed:

Pure Dragon King, Great Earth Dragon King, Dharma Ocean Dragon King, Wondrous Net Dragon King, Cultivated Auspiciousness Dragon King, Beloved Dragon King, Great Sea Dragon King, Fierce and Stern Dragon King, Pure-Eyed Dragon King, Lion Dragon King, Conch-Sound Dragon King, Golden Dragon King, Golden Radiance Dragon King, Black-Haired Dragon King, Great Rain Dragon King, Heavenly Master Dragon King, Thunder and Lightning Dragon King, Nine Rivers Dragon King, Water Emperor Dragon King, Winged Dragon King, Mount Sumeru Dragon King, Great Brahmā Dragon King, Wish-Fulfilling Dragon King, Ila Dragon King, Rain-Bringing Dragon King, Ganges Dragon King, Wondrous Dharma Dragon King, Heavenly Flower Dragon King, Jeweled Canopy Dragon King, Sweet Dew Dragon King, Immortal Perfected Dragon King, Pure Moon Dragon King, Non-Human Dragon King, Virtuous Dragon King, Heaven-Descending Dragon King, Earth-Descending Dragon King, Left and Right Dragon Kings, White Tiger Dragon King, Azure Dragon King, Scaled Dragon King, Venerable Sage Dragon King, True Sage Dragon King, Yama Dragon King, Supreme Emperor Dragon King, Yellow Dragon King, Dharma Gate Dragon King, Transformative Dragon King, Myriad Dragon Kings, Heavenly Dragon Kings, Heaven-Resonant Dragon King, Earth-Resonant Dragon King, Majestic Virtue Dragon King, Dharma-Body Dragon King, Sutra-Reciting Dragon King, Rainwater Dragon King, Four Great Dragon Kings, Dārika Dragon King, Crown-Bowing Dragon King, Great Dharma Dragon King, Wondrous Virtue Dragon King, Supreme Dragon King, Land-Ruling Dragon King, Most High Dragon King, Dao and Virtue Dragon King, Proclaiming Transformation Dragon King, Perfected One Dragon King, Lord Lao Dragon King, Household Commanding Dragon King.

Upon hearing these praises, all such Dragon Kings would manifest their responsive powers, rising with clouds and rain, showering the human realm, rescuing the parched and withered, all reviving and sprouting, spared from seasonal harm, with no damage to crops. Rivers and streams would flow freely, their sources nourished and moistened.

The merits and fruits of this sutra were beyond praise, delivering and saving the multitudes with such sacred power. If there were good men and good women who, for the sake of their country or region, encountered drought and aridity, untimely rains, imbalance of yin and yang, and the people in distress, transcribed this sutra, purified and upheld it, and invited a high and virtuous Dharma master to establish a ritual arena, adorned with banners and flowers, and recited this sutra, then their prayers would ascend, and Heaven would send sweet rain, the earth would well forth with numinous springs, grasses and trees would flourish, fields would yield abundant harvests, people would be free from sorrow, the year would be secure and peaceful, disasters would forever vanish, the land would always be auspicious, households would rejoice, blessings and benefits would be boundless, myriad virtues would adorn them, and the hundred spirits would revere and protect them. Once the rains were sufficient, one should cultivate sincere devotion, repay the numinous responsiveness above, and constantly recite and uphold it.

At that time, the great assembly, having heard this sutra, rejoiced and put it into practice, paid their respects, and withdrew.
