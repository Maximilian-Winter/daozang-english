At that time, the Original Celestial Worthy was expounding the Dao upon Jade Capital Mountain, accompanied by all the celestial great sages, perfected of wondrous conduct, and the hosts of celestial dragons, ghosts and spirits, celestial immortals, flying immortals, divine immortals, celestial youths, jade maidens, the Supreme Venerables, and the Two Masters, bestowing vast salvation and kindness.

At that moment, celestial flowers rained down, and the earth turned golden. The Celestial Worthy emitted a great radiance, illuminating boundless worlds in the ten directions—above, reaching the palaces of the thirty-six celestial emperors, and below, extending to the innumerable hells of the nether realms—all universally pervaded, rescuing and gathering sentient beings, granting them peace and stability, allowing them to receive wondrous bliss. Heavenly incense suffused all, the hungry feasted on jade grains, the thirsty drank golden nectar, and the hosts of hungry ghosts were all sated, swiftly delivered from suffering. They beheld the Celestial Worthy face-to-face and were reborn in the pure and ever-joyous realm, forever abiding in the Dharma assembly.

At that time, from the lower realms, there came a perfected one named Moonlight, riding a white crane and holding a jade blossom. Arriving at the Dharma assembly, he adjusted his robes and cap, paid reverent homage, knelt with head bowed, and addressed the Celestial Worthy: "I now cultivate the Dao, desiring to save and succor all sentient beings, yet I lack divine powers, expedient means, and wisdom. I observe that in the Jambudvīpa world below, myriad evils abound—some are swept away by floods, some suffer fire disasters, some face famine, some encounter bandits, some endure epidemics, and some suffer great droughts. Grass and trees wither, the five grains do not ripen, the state is unsettled, and the people live in fear. How may they be rescued?"

"I only wish that the Celestial Worthy would broadly expound expedient means to protect and deliver sentient beings, sparing them from these calamities."

Then the Original Celestial Worthy addressed the Moonlight Perfected, saying: "Excellent! Excellent! You now strive to bring great benefit to the beings of the earth, sincerely saving and protecting them. I possess countless celestial soldiers and warriors, perfected of wondrous conduct, perfected of compassion, Jade Purity Perfected, August Grotto Perfected, and hundreds of thousands of others; two hundred thousand Jade Purity youths; celestial numinous red officials, merit-recording scribes, longevity marshals, Lord Han the Elder, and hundreds of thousands more; two hundred thousand celestial immortals, flying immortals, and divine immortals; mighty sword spirit-kings, great strength spirit-kings, toxin-seizing spirit-kings, demon-dispelling spirit-kings, evil-devouring spirit-kings, demon-smashing spirit-kings, fire-hurling spirit-kings, water-sprinkling spirit-kings, spirit-consuming spirit-kings, plague-collecting spirit-kings, flying immortal spirit-kings, and hundreds of thousands more; the Three Masters of Precepts and the Eight Divisions of Clouds and Thunder. They constantly dwell in the world, rescuing beings from all calamities and hardships.

If floods or fires are encountered, recite this scripture. If bandits are encountered, recite this scripture. If epidemics are encountered, recite this scripture. If droughts and disasters are encountered, recite this scripture. If the state is unsettled, recite this scripture. If the five grains do not yield, recite this scripture.

If one copies and recites this scripture with utmost sincerity, boundless merit will be attained. All malignant poisons will be utterly dispelled, all bandits will be scattered and broken, all epidemic toxins will be naturally eradicated, disasters of fire and water will spontaneously cease, an unsettled state will attain peace, the four barbarians will submit in reverence, foreign lands will come to pay homage, epidemics will swiftly heal, quarrels and slander will vanish, legal shackles will quickly dissolve, severed relationships will be restored, demonic and perverse influences will not arise, and epidemic toxins will depart afar."

Then the Moonlight Perfected again addressed the Celestial Worthy: "In the world below and in foreign lands beyond, when calamitous droughts strike, causing such suffering, what ritual should be performed to swiftly bring harmonious rain, ensuring the five grains flourish and the people are sated?"

The Celestial Worthy instructed the Moonlight Perfected: "Receive my teaching. Within Jambudvīpa, whether in villages, upon high mountains, by water’s edge, within grottoes, or in pure and serene places, establish an altar, arrange the sacred images, hang banners and canopies, burn incense and light lamps, bathe in fragrant water, and don fresh, clean garments. Recite this scripture, and for the sake of all beings, prepare various flowers, fruits, and fine incense, offering them in season. Hold grand vegetarian feasts, presenting them to the boundless Celestial Worthies of the ten directions, the thirty-six celestial emperors, the celestial meritous parents, and all the divine immortals, dragons, spirits, and numinous sages, for the sake of great benefit. The Celestial Emperor will then dispatch the eight great dragon kings of the eight divisions, along with the cloud and thunder masters, to stir the mists and clouds, swirling around the world. In but a moment, rivers, streams, and ditches, as well as the fields above and below, will be drenched with rain. Grass, trees, forests, all flowers, fruits, and the five grains will flourish, their branches and leaves lush and abundant."

Thereupon, the Moonlight Perfected bowed in gratitude to the Original Celestial Worthy and praised him in verse:

From the northern clouds, dark and dense, they come,
From the west, the howling clouds arrive.
The southern rivers pour forth their waters,
The nine spirits of the east.
The true dragon king of the center
Saves and aids all sentient beings.
The five dragons descend as one,
Drifting o’er the Supreme Capital.
Heaven sends forth great rain,
Shading Mount Kunlun.
With this scripture’s teaching,
May it ever be practiced together.

At that time, the Moonlight Perfected again addressed the Celestial Worthy, saying: "From kalpas immeasurable I have rarely encountered such a sight—today I have heard this wondrous sutra, witnessed the Great Medicine King, and beheld the myriad transformations of all the holy assembly, all beyond conception. By what name should this sutra be called? And how should we receive and uphold it?"

The Celestial Worthy replied: "This sutra shall be named *The Celestial Merit Sutra for Protecting the State, Praying for Rain, and Dispelling Demons*. You should diligently propagate it, reverently uphold it, and hold it in highest esteem. If any foolish person should slight or disdain it, they shall fall into the evil destinies and suffer in endless darkness."

All the devas, humans, dragons, Brahmā deities, and immortals in the assembly received these words in faith, made obeisance, and departed, bowing their heads in reverence to put them into practice.

Here ends *The Supreme Sutra for Protecting the State, Praying for Rain, and Dispelling Demons*.
