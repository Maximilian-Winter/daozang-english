**The Jade Pure Primordial Mysterious Yellow Nine Radiance True Scripture**

In the lofty heavens of Great Luo, the mysterious yellow jade script unfolds.
Coiling and binding the myriad *qi*, gold and jade gleam resplendent.
The golden lad attendant of incense, the jade maiden transmitter of words—
Flying clouds form canopies, scattered fragrance constructs towers.
Within, a divine lord stands as my peer.
The Primordial One preserves life; the Most High governs the throat.
The azure-clad maiden of alchemy, the pure yang jade lad—
Together they refine the true *qi*, returning to the ancestral Dao.

Tier upon tier, towering and majestic, the jade capital’s celestial palace.
Vast and misty, the great Brahma transcends all heavens.
Neither non-being nor being—its true body is spontaneous.
Descending as spirit to flow through the world, becoming the essence of humanity.
The yang soul guards the essence; the yin *po* nurtures the blood.
When essence and blood are pure and whole, the utmost yang is inwardly complete.
Riding this mortal vessel, one returns to the formless.
The vast true body merges with the great void.
Within emptiness, there is image; the true body fuses with the mysterious.
Embracing the One and guarding the true, the true body remains unchanging.
Having come, it does not follow; swiftly departing, it holds no attachment.
Within non-being, there is being; its body models true emptiness.
The wondrous principle of true non-being aligns with the Dao.
When sagely conduct is pure and complete, merit and virtue reach perfection.
Emerging and vanishing at will, transforming the vulgar into the true.
When the conditions of transformation are exhausted, one returns to the lofty purity.
In the heavens of lofty purity, above, there is no further form.
The spirit is the body; emptiness is the dwelling.
My spirit pervades the void, like the moon contained in waves.
The Dao harmonizes with non-action; seek the true and inquire of the dwelling.
The great demons of the three realms gaze in reverence and bow.
Beyond the ken of demons, all delusion is dispelled.
The true sages of the nine heavens chant and recite this scripture.
Reciting the scripture brings blessings, aiding the true and transcending the divine.

The utmost spirit has no self; the utmost Dao has no name.
Vast and towering, the great Dao is the true source of the myriad dharmas.
The true ones of the nine yang heavens, the hidden ghosts of the six yin realms—
Their karmic fortunes differ; they hear my wondrous incantation.
Both ears are opened; I now bow in reverence.
To the Dao Ancestor of ten thousand kalpas, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy;
The Most High Dao Lord, the Most High Lord Lao;
The Five Palace Yellow Elders, the Three Mysteries Venerable Ones;
The Flying Heavenly Spirit Kings, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct;
The Perfected Ones of the Left and Right, the Great Monad True Lords;
The Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, the Divine Emperors of all heavens—
All suffering and distress, and all that is sought,
Preserve the body and nurture life, penetrating the bright and the obscure.
Hearing and reciting it once, all join in protection and defense.
The jade lads and jade maidens record the transgressions and inscribe the names.
Names entered in the registers of immortals, all endeavors shall succeed.

The Perfected of the Primordial Terrace directly memorialized the Heavenly Palace, saying: This scripture is the marrow of the Jade Scriptures. Among the heavenly perfected with duties, the great scriptures number over two hundred and sixty fascicles, making frequent recitation difficult. Extracting its essential wonders into over three hundred characters, one may recite it constantly. As your heart yearns for the great Dao and admires the jade script, I unlock the seal of my heart to open your resolve, enabling you to recite it. Essence and blood congeal inwardly; form and spirit harmonize. Demons and evil spirits retreat; the two *qi* intermingle in purity. Naturally, the spirit hears the jade scripture, rejoicing and cherishing the mortal shell. Over time, spirit and *qi* unite, congealing spirit into body and gathering essence into substance. This spirit is not the visible spirit; this essence is not the tangible essence. Truly, it is the spirit within spirit, the essence within essence. Whatever is grasped is not what I speak of. Practice diligently, treasure and uphold it. Keep it in your home for one or even two cycles of twelve years, awaiting the celestial mandate to choose one of the Dao.

The Heavenly Lord of Life-Preservation of the Primordial One, the Perfected Lord of the Left Terrace of the Most High, descended and said: There is also a secret incantation directly memorialized but unspoken. As this jade scripture is not to be presumptuously employed, in former times, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy once dwelled within the Primordial Azure Heaven, expounding the great Brahma true sound to universally deliver the myriad spirits. The divine incantation states:

**Oṃ**, the Primordial One generates heaven;
**Oṃ**, the Primordial One generates earth;
**Oṃ**, the Primordial One generates humanity.
The three powers are complete in their stations; the myriad things flourish in abundance.
Humans fail to preserve life, transforming into yin spirits.
Spirit and *qi* incomplete, they flow as lower ghosts.
**Oṃ**, when lower ghosts hear my jade sound, their ghostly forms instantly vanish.
Abandoning that ghostly form, they are born in my heavenly dwelling.
**Oṃ**, when those in the human realm hear my jade sound, they instantly abandon human karma,
Attaining long life as divine immortals, sharing the lifespan of heaven and earth, merging brightness with the sun and moon.
The body is enveloped in blessings; the seven ancestors receive glory.
Having delivered the seven ancestors from the kalpa of the Jade Purity,
**Oṃ**, when those in the heavenly realm hear my jade sound, their heavenly blessings instantly increase.
Past karma is forever exhausted; they do not fall to the lower heavens but constantly dwell in the Jade Purity.
**Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the strict command of the Primordial Emperor!**
**The two teachings unite as one Oṃ! Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the command of the Great Saintly Lord Vairocana of the Pure Dharmakāya!**

This incantation is named *The Primordial Kalpa-Uniting Universal Deliverance of the Myriad Spirits Divine Incantation*. It is the ancestor of the myriad spirits, the source of the one *qi*. **Oṃ** is the *qi* of the seed of the world’s truth. Chanting it preserves life, repelling all and accomplishing all. It generates heaven and earth, nurturing the multitude of beings, serving as the foundation of blessings and grace. It resolves calamities and extends life, liberates from past karma, and bestows blessings upon the living. Form and spirit are both wondrous; the one *qi* is wholly pure. Gradually entering the realm of non-action, nature is unburdened by virtue, merging with the Dao in brightness. The myriad spirits return in reverence; the host of demons restrain their forms. Diligently reciting this scripture, none shall fail to be delivered.
