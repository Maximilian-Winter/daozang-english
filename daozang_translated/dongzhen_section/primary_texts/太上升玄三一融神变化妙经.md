**The Wondrous Scripture of the Supreme Ascent to the Mysterious, the Three-in-One Fusion of Spirit and Transformation**

**Scripture Title:** *The Wondrous Scripture of the Supreme Ascent to the Mysterious, the Three-in-One Fusion of Spirit and Transformation*. Author unknown, likely composed during the Tang dynasty. Possibly a revision of *The Scripture of the Ascent to the Mysterious Inner Teachings*. Two fascicles. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Benwen* Category.

**Fascicle One**

At that time, the Celestial Venerable of Original Beginning sat upon the Seven-Treasured Throne of the Void, Spontaneous, Mysterious, and One. Collecting his spirit in distant contemplation, he wandered serenely through the Mysterious Wastes, expounding the Great Dharma for all worthies and sages, the hosts of devas and humans. He discoursed on the gradual and sudden, the advancing and retreating, the causes and conditions, the profound stillness and non-action, penetratingly observing all the immeasurable Dharma gates—void and solid, empty and existent, true and false, deviant and upright, good and evil, pure and turbid, high and low, noble and base, inner and outer, civil and martial, great and small—all the ten thousand Dharmas, boundless and innumerable, impossible to recount in full.

Each follows the karmic habits to which it clings, their phenomenal forms differing. Now conjoined, now separated; now present, now absent; now coming, now going; now emerging, now submerging; now advancing, now retreating; now arising, now perishing; now existent, now nonexistent; now true, now false; now noble, now base; now suffering, now joyful; now poor, now rich; now male, now female; now civil, now martial; now fair, now foul; now inauspicious, now auspicious; now in the mundane, now in the sagely—such karmic retributions and their manifold conditions are impossible to recount in full.

All arise from the Dharmas great and small practiced in past causes, the karmic recompense ripening to yield the differing circumstances of today. Failing to awaken to the Mahāyāna teaching of non-action, they find liberation difficult. Abiding in the Hīnayāna, their knowledge and vision are scant, their minds bound and attached. They do not clearly comprehend, suddenly awaken to the Mysterious Principle, or penetrate non-action. Fusing with the emptiness of Dharma-nature, they concentrate their spirit in profound illumination, practicing non-action to seek liberation. Yet they merely encounter Dharma and abide in Dharma, failing to recognize the originally pure essence of the true nature. Forcibly generating greed and attachment, they strike the fetters of clinging to causes and conditions, unaware of the supreme, perfectly complete, and utterly true Great Dao of the original vehicle. They accomplish all spiritual powers, the merits of virtue and wisdom, and the causes and conditions of liberation, yet their partial views and attachments give rise to discrimination, further generating slander. They do not recognize that the principle-nature is fundamentally the One Vehicle without duality. Temporarily following the transformations of the mundane, their activity and stillness alter causes and effects, their suffering and joy differing. Truly, due to the karmic habits of past lives, they receive such retribution today.

At that time, the Dao Lord of the Mysterious One arose from the assembly, circumambulated the precious throne, raised his fists in reverence, prostrated himself, and addressed the Celestial Venerable: "O Supreme Great Dao, Most Honored of the Void, whose spirit and wisdom are lofty and vast, whose Mysterious penetration is unobstructed! Great Sage, you govern all, above and below the heavens. Fusing with the emptiness of Dao-nature, you divide the immeasurable Dharma gates, stabilizing the empty and the existent. Penetratingly observing all karmic retributions and their causes, you discern their phenomenal forms, mystically illuminating the karmic conditions. With great compassion, you transform and deliver, widely opening the Dharma gates.

We only pray for your benevolent salvation. Today, this assembly is most fortunate after ten thousand kalpas, the recompense of past karmic virtue allowing us to behold the august countenance of the Supreme Great Dao and receive the exposition of the Dharma teaching. May all beings universally accomplish their aspirations, guiding the lost multitudes to swiftly ascend the Dao’s shore and together enter the Great Vehicle.

The Dharma’s forms are majestic, its merits perfected, its virtues accomplished. You fully comprehend the essentials of the non-action Mysterious Understanding and the Great Vehicle’s root origin. Your wisdom and virtue are perfectly complete, aiding the Dao in its propagation and transformation, universally delivering devas and humans, rescuing all immeasurable beings. May all universally accomplish their aspirations, together entering the Dharma gate. We bow in attendance before your august countenance, personally receiving the Great Dharma, making offerings and practicing reverence. May our wishes follow our hearts, our merits and virtues fulfill our aspirations, our wisdom and practice both be complete.

We only pray that you broadly transform all, universally ascending the Great Dharma.
We only pray for accomplishment, merging with the Dao as one."

At that time, the Celestial Venerable of Original Beginning addressed the Dao Lord of the Mysterious One, saying: "Excellent, excellent! Your question today is of the utmost importance. The causes and conditions of the Great Dharma are most profound and wondrous, difficult to conceive.

Return to your seats and listen carefully. I shall expound for you the Supreme Great Dharma, the accomplishment of all immeasurable Dharma gates. There is success and failure, arising and perishing, emerging and submerging, advancing and retreating, right and wrong, good and evil, long and short, foolishness and wisdom, brightness and darkness—all due to the differing karmic habits of the past.

Cultivating minor Dharmas is but the branches and leaves of the Dao. All the merits practiced temporarily yield the blessings of humans and devas. When the causes and conditions of retribution are exhausted, they return to annihilation, unavoidably revolving through the six paths, receiving all manner of retributions. The affairs of good and evil never cease, life after life and death after death, experiencing birth and death, creating good and evil. The retributions are endless and innumerable, liberation difficult to attain.

Without the supreme Dharma and superior conditions to deliver and swiftly liberate, abandoning all karmic paths, departing from the Three Evil Realms, the Five Paths, the Nine Dark Regions, the Eight Difficulties, the Three Wretched Realms, and the Five Sufferings, transcending above the Three Realms, one cannot escape the path of birth and death. Liberated from non-action, all the teachings of conditioned Dharmas practiced yield blessings that are finite, ultimately returning to destruction and annihilation, like clay and earth sharing the same Dharma. True and proper liberation is unattainable, for the mind and wisdom do not penetrate, clinging to conditioned pursuits and seeking blessings. When the merits of retribution are exhausted, they return to dispersion and destruction. Such toil is inescapable, subject to impermanence and transformation, drifting with the karma that comes, unable to be free, bound by others, without respite.

Yet the great beings of superior wisdom, those who comprehend and awaken to the nature of the Dao, practice all merits without seeking retribution, their minds free from attachment. All the conditioned merits they practice are merely to manifest phenomenal forms, upholding the Dharma teaching to guide the foolish, enabling their liberation and gradual benefit, entering the Dharma gate."

By virtue of these merits, blessings and virtues adorn and perfect, forming karmic bonds through the Dao. All causes and effects cultivated serve to preserve the root of life, seeking the karmic conditions for rebirth and retribution. Only I act as the guiding master, within which I transform and teach through manifold phenomenal conditions. Together with all offerings and dedications—whether to the deities of heaven and earth—I deliver the six realms, the nine ancestral generations and seven lineages of the past, all departed ancestors, and sentient beings burdened by transgressions, leading them out of the sea of suffering and into the Dao gate, that all may attain liberation.

Only I abide in non-action, returning to the root and reverting to the origin, settling my spirit and consciousness, purifying my qi-nature, and guarding my body and mind. Within, nothing arises; without, nothing is defiled. The mind dwells nowhere, yet pervades and fulfills all. No single dharma gives rise to dharmic appearances, nor does attachment to any single dharma produce bondage. No single thought arises seeking blessings or karmic retribution. What I practice and study appears as if without cultivation; what I enact and perform are all meritorious deeds. It is as though no merit exists, and I dare not seek reward, instead dedicating all to the worlds of humans and devas.

May these merits be scattered and prepared for all, bestowing blessings and virtues upon the six realms, adorning and uniting with me in liberation, together entering the ultimate truth and ascending the shore of the Dao.

The Most High addressed the Great Dao Lord of Primordial Unity, saying: "You and your assembly, in all your efforts to assist the Dao, transform and awaken the deluded, acting as a great Dharma vessel for all men and women—like the vast Dharma ocean that encompasses and embraces the myriad rivers, or as heaven and earth shelter all things—should universally bestow benefit, teaching and transforming humans and devas, responding to conditions and adapting to circumstances. Observe their roots—whether keen or dull, foolish or wise, pure or turbid, dark or bright—and guide them gradually or suddenly toward awakening, measuring their bodies and minds, instructing them in accord with their capacities, that all may grasp the essential meaning.

Those who awaken little are transformed little; those who awaken greatly are transformed greatly. The turbid are transformed in turbidity, the virtuous in virtue, the wicked in wickedness. Through skillful means, lead them to the other shore, where they encounter the Dao, perceive the Dharma, and realize the conditions for liberation, accomplishing the great vehicle of the Dharma-body—the majestic, unsurpassed Dao."

*Thus concludes the Upper Scroll of the* Wondrous Scripture of the Most High’s Ascension to the Mysterious, the Three-in-One Fusion of Spirit and Transformation. *The Lower Scroll follows.*

The Dao speaks: Among the ten thousand things, humans are the most noble; among the ten thousand dharmas, only the One is noble; among the ten thousand Ones, only the True is noble; among the ten thousand Trues, only the Sage is noble; among the ten thousand Sages, only the Dao is noble. These are called the Mysterious One, the True One, the Great One, and the Three-in-One.

The Mysterious is emptiness—void, profound, and boundless, governing above without limit, governing below without foundation, observing within without boundary—thus it is named the Mysterious One. The Mysterious is the distant. Its essence is without substance, containing and concealing all things, unobstructed by the ten thousand beings—thus it is named the Void and Nonexistent. The Void is that which penetrates; the Nonexistent is that which is empty. Its nature and body are without form—thus it is named Emptiness. The Mysterious is the One; the One is the Dao; its nature is purity; the True One is reality; its principle is correctness—thus it is named the Orthodox One.

The Great is vastness, able to generate the ten thousand things, encompassing and governing all—thus it is named the Great One. The Three-in-One is the Child, who above inherits the numinous *qi* of the Mysterious Father and below receives the primordial essence of the Mysterious Mother, nurturing and forming its body. Thus, it takes two parts *qi* from the Mysterious Father above and one part *qi* from the Mysterious Mother below, uniting them. Harmonizing the Middle Dao, they together form one image—thus it is said that two halves become one. The One is the Child, hence named the Crimson Infant. The Child resembles the state of newly born life, receiving the third *qi*—thus it is named the Three-in-One Crimson Child.

The first is the Mysterious Father, formed from the *qi* of the Mysterious Void’s potent yang—thus it is named the Mysterious One. The second is the Mysterious Mother, formed from the *qi* of the receptive yin—thus it is named the Feminine One. Able to generate the ten thousand things and nurture all with affection, she is named the Mysterious Mother and titled the Great One. The One is great—thus she is named the Mother of the Dao.

Therefore, the Mysterious One is the Heavenly Honored One’s position; the Mysterious Mother, the Feminine One, is the Heavenly Sovereign’s position; the True One and the Imperial One are the Dao Lord’s position; the Three-in-One is the Crimson Child Perfected One’s position; the Orthodox One is the Great Dharma Master’s position. The Nameless, Eternally Abiding Three-in-One is the undifferentiated *qi* of the Dao in the chaotic emptiness before form and appearance were established—thus it is named the Primal Chaos, the Nameless, Eternally Abiding.

The *qi* of the Three-in-One divides and transforms, manifesting a hundred million divine powers—thus it is called the Empty Cavern’s Transformations. After the Three-in-One separates yin and yang, it generates and completes the ten thousand things, spreading transformation throughout the ten directions—thus it is called the Yin-Yang Three-in-One.

The first is the Nameless Three-in-One;
The second, the Void and Spontaneous Three-in-One;
The third, the Empty Cavern’s Transformative Three-in-One;
The fourth, the Mysterious One;
The fifth, the True One;
The sixth, the Primordial Sovereign Three-in-One;
The seventh, the Great One;
The eighth, the Orthodox One;
The ninth, the Yin-Yang Child—
Thus it is called the Nine Ones of the Dao.

Emptiness possesses the Nine Ones, eternally riding the Nine *Qi*. The Dao has the Nine Ones, and positions have the Nine Honored Ones; Heaven has the Nine Ones, and above are the Nine Pures; Earth has the Nine Ones, and below are the Nine Springs; humans have the Nine Ones, and above their heads are the Nine Palaces.

The Three-in-One is called the Three Treasures. The Upper Void’s Three Treasures are the Mysterious, Primordial, and Originative Three *Qi*; within Heaven are the Three Treasures—Heaven has the Three Realms, Earth has the Three Treasures of mountains, rivers, water, and fire; humans have the Three Treasures—the upper, middle, and lower cinnabar fields, the Mud Pill Palace, and the Crimson Palace.

The so-called Three-Five: the Three are the Mysterious, Primordial, and Originative Three *Qi*; the Five are the *qi* of the Five Phases. In emptiness, they are the Five *Qi*; in Heaven, the Five Stars; in position, the Five Emperors; on Earth, the Five Directions; in humans, the Five Viscera.

The Dao speaks: The Three-in-One’s moving palace ceaselessly transforms, dwelling in different places—sometimes stationed in the Seven Treasures Palace of the Mysterious Heaven, sometimes spreading transformation upon Kunlun, roaming the Mysterious Capital, or governing the Great Luo while gazing upon the Mysterious Terrace. It administers the Heavenly Court’s Grotto Chamber and Bright Hall, traversing the Six Directions, encircling the Jade Emperor’s secluded chamber, the Mysterious Pass, and the Canopy Palace.

The Nine Ones are nine sons and nine daughters. The Nine Sovereigns enter and exit Kunlun, governing the Nine Heavens, illuminating the Nine Heavens’ sun and moon. They emerge from the Heavenly Pass and enter through the Secluded Gate, sometimes dwelling between the Heavenly Reed and the sun and moon, or descending to govern the Yellow Court, Mud Pill Palace, and Crimson Palace, or concealing themselves within the Great Spring of the Northern Culmen.

Inhaling and exhaling essence-*qi*, riding the Six Dragons, they journey to Tortoise Mountain, or mount the numinous waves to command the Nine Dragons, soaring with the Nine Phoenixes. They dispatch the Great One, the Originative Elder, and the Imperial Duke, traveling to the Three-in-One’s realm between the third and third months, blending the ten thousand transformations, refining the hundred passages, opening and guiding the fluid essences, calming the spirit and stabilizing the body.

The Central Yellow Elder governs the Jade Emperor, the divine spirits of the fifth and sixth stems. The Original One, the Imperial Perfected, governs the secluded valley, nourishing the flourishing plain, riding the *qi* to absorb the True, entering and exiting the path of life. Sometimes dwelling in the Gate of Destiny, closing the Dao’s door, essence does not scatter, and evil does not intrude.

The Primal Simplicity flows with rosy clouds, riding the wind and dispersing mist, floating through the void, ascending to the Cloud Court. Opening and closing, coming and going, they enter and exit the reed chambers. A thousand spirits and a hundred numina pay homage at the Imperial Court. City towers interlace, curtains form clouds. The Celestial Perfected gather the *qi*, ascending to the Sacred Pass. The Mysterious One’s perfect Dao comes and goes without difficulty.

Swallowing pearls and concealing jade, amidst white stone peaks and cliffs, pavilions rise in ten thousand tiers—the Yellow Emperor’s abode. The Sweet Abyss is boundless; the Mysterious Mushroom transforms and grows; golden nectar and jade dew—immortal elixirs of deathlessness. Restoring years and preserving life, bones transform and ascend within. Roaming the eight directions, ascending to pay homage to the Three Pures, descending to govern the Three Realms, transforming the ten thousand directions, assembling at the Mysterious Terrace, paying homage to the Sacred Sovereign, circling the Golden Gates, descending to govern the Imperial Realm.

The Five Peaks and Four Streams bring peace to the lands; all the myriad peoples eternally preserve auspicious goodness.

The Upper First Nine Emperors’ Heavenly Lord, whose taboo name is Congealing Heaven, styled Mysterious Foremost.

The Second Emperor’s Minister initiates and governs the essence. Accompanied by twelve thousand celestial immortals and divine soldiers. The Middle Primordial Three-One Emperor Sovereign, whose taboo name is Divine Pearl, styled Zidan. The Emperor’s Minister, Perfected One Guangjian. Accompanied by twelve thousand divine immortals and soldiers. The Lower Primordial True One, whose taboo name is Divine Essence, styled Guxuan. The Emperor’s Minister is Guishangming. Accompanied by twelve thousand earthly immortals and soldiers.

The Upper One measures nine inches and nine fen, clad in a purple embroidered golden robe, wearing the Dark Heaven Treasure Crown, seated upon a seven-jeweled throne, or at times riding a nine-dragon chariot, roaming the Three Realms. In hand he holds the Heavenly Treasure Brazier, governing and transforming the Jade Purity.

The Middle One measures three inches and three fen, clad in a cinnabar brocade mantle, wearing the Nine-Phoenix Crown, seated upon a seven-jeweled throne, or at times riding a nine-unicorn chariot, roaming the ten directions. In hand he holds the Golden Brazier, governing and transforming the Upper Purity.

The Lower One measures five inches and five fen, clad in a yellow brocade mantle, wearing the Nine-Dragon Far-Roaming Crown, seated upon a seven-jeweled throne, or at times riding a five-colored lion chariot, patrolling the Five Peaks. In hand he holds the Treasure Incense Brazier, governing and transforming the Great Purity.

When the Three Ones assemble, at dawn they pay homage to the Supreme Emperor Sovereign. Exchanging and refining divine qi, they replenish the marrow of bones, absorb our radiant essence, filling the body with divine qi until it overflows, and the form blooms with luminous freshness.

At midday they assemble at the Middle One’s Crimson Palace, training the crimson youths, restoring souls and reviving spirits, reversing age to return to infancy, extending life and restoring years, preserving life without end.

At dusk they assemble at the Lower Primordial True One’s palace, cleansing and purging filth and impurity, shedding the old and absorbing the new. They generate the Five Elder Thearch Perfected Ones within, transforming and renewing the marrow of bones, transmuting intestines into sinews, forming golden bones and jade marrow. In harmony with the Dao and attuned to the True, they naturally undergo boundless transformations, eternally preserving the root of life together with the Three Treasures.

The Three Ones, each one transforming into three, and the Three Ones together transforming, give rise to the Dao of the Nine Ones. The Upper One, Mysterious Venerable, has two great ministers, together forming three persons. The left minister is titled Mysterious One Dao Lord; the right minister is titled Supreme Harmony Elder Lord. Supreme Harmony has a white head and wears white garments; Mysterious One has both head and attire in dark blue, serving as the soul and spirit of the Dao.

The Middle One, Primordial Venerable, has two great ministers: the left is titled Perfected One, the right is titled Guangjian. The Lower Primordial True One Emperor Venerable has on his left Youjing and on his right the Emperor’s Minister, and others.

The Upper, Middle, and Lower Three Ones Venerables each have two great ministers attending to their left and right, forming one body with three persons, thus completing the Three Ones. With nine persons, this is called the Dao of the Nine Ones. They exist in formless emptiness.

The Upper is titled the Nine Mysteries, the Middle the Nine Voids, the Lower the Dao of the Nine Qi—hence they are named the Formless. The Three Ones transform within the Nine Mysteries: the Nine Mysteries govern the Dao realm, the Nine Voids govern the Sacred realm, and the Nine Blacks govern the True realm—these constitute the Nine Ones within the Dao.

The Nine Mysteries are titled the Nameless Eternally Abiding Heavenly Venerable; the Nine Voids are titled the Cavernous Void August Heavenly Venerable; the Nine Qi are titled the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Venerable.

The Upper One transforms into the Three Pures; the Middle One transforms into the Three Realms; the Lower One transforms into the Three Wheels. The Upper Three Pures constitute the Sacred realm; the Middle Three Realms constitute the True realm; the Lower Three Wheels constitute the Immortal realm. The Wheels are the mundane, sometimes ascending, sometimes descending, sometimes in the middle, coming and going in ceaseless rotation—hence they are called the Three Wheels. The Lower Wheel enters the earthly prisons; the Middle Wheel generates heaven; the Upper Wheel enters the True realm—thus they are called the Three Wheels.

Therefore, the Dao has Nine Ones, Heaven has Nine Ones, Earth has Nine Ones, and Humans have Nine Ones. Four Nines combine to form thirty-six qi, assembling the thirty-six heavens. Each one transforms to generate Nine Ones, and nine nines make eighty-one primordial qi. In emptiness there are eighty-one Dao qi; in heaven there are eighty-one sacred manifestations; on earth there are eighty-one true qi; in humans there are eighty-one immortal qi—altogether assembling three hundred and sixty qi.

In the Upper Dao there are three hundred and sixty formless, naturally empty, and mysterious Dao; in heaven there are three hundred and sixty sacred transformation Dao; on earth there are three hundred and sixty cavernous true Dao; in humans there are three hundred and sixty bone joints soaring and transforming into flying immortals’ Dao. Endowed with their qi and nature, they call out in great and small voices.

The Upper call summons thirty-six thousand spirit cognitions; the Middle call summons three thousand six hundred spirit cognitions; the Lower call summons three hundred and sixty spirit cognitions—gathering the three hundred and sixty days of a year, all prepared within the body as required.

If one can cultivate the True and study the Dao, then the thirty-six thousand spirit cognitions will come to be prepared, naturally making the body light, ascending in broad daylight, merging and uniting with the Dao.

The Dao states: These three hundred and sixty qi are divided and transformed. Above there are thirty-six voids; in the middle there are thirty-six heavens; below there are three hundred and sixty famous mountains. The mysterious transformations correspond to humans in thirty-six lands.

The Dao has thirty-six thousand divine transformations and mysterious images; heaven has thirty-six thousand palaces; earth has thirty-six thousand cavernous abodes; humans have thirty-six thousand spirit cognitions.

The Dao is the utmost essence of the mysterious void; humans are the numinous essence of heaven and earth. Heaven and earth correspond to the great image of the mysterious void, and the Dao communicates and transforms through the mysterious void.

Heaven is endowed with pure nature and attains clarity; earth is endowed with congealed qi and takes form; humans are endowed with essence and cognition and thus obtain life.

The Dao, without primordial qi, would have no transformations; heaven, without primordial qi, would not be mysteriously clear; earth, without primordial qi, would be unable to generate and complete the myriad things; humans, without primordial qi as the root of life, would not exist.

Therefore, for humans to cultivate the Dao and nourish life, one must first understand how to preserve primordial qi and nourish the spirit. If spirit and qi can reside within a person, life will attain longevity.

Spirit is cognition; cognition is rectitude; rectitude is truth; truth is sageliness; sageliness is nature; nature is the Dao.

The Dao is emptiness; emptiness is mystery; mystery is the Void; the Void is spontaneity; spontaneity is true constancy; true constancy is namelessness; namelessness is primordial chaos—thus it is called "primordial chaos," formless and traceless, boundless and infinite.

Qi is voidness; qi is nothingness; qi is pervasiveness; qi is wind; qi is movement; qi is image; qi is transformation; qi is breath; qi is lightness and ascent; qi is soaring; qi is dispersion; qi is life; qi is opening; qi is illumination; qi is radiant image; qi can conceal form and hide shadow; qi can circulate and revolve.

Its divine qi’s transformative powers are unfathomable and beyond measure.
