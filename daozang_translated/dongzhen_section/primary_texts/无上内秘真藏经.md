**The Supreme Esoteric Treasury of the Inner Truth Sutra, Fascicle One**
**Manifesting the Dao**

At that time, the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning traversed the Dharma realms, arriving beneath the Eightfold Auspicious Trees of Lingjie Mountain in the Jeweled Grove of Seven Treasures. He transformed into manifold forms, revealing a mind of extraordinary wonder. His radiant light universally illumined, pervading even the minutest dust-motes, and immeasurable lands all received his grace and moisture. Immeasurable beings turned in faith toward him; immeasurable perfected immortals awakened to the Great Vehicle; immeasurable superior beings realized emptiness as non-emptiness; immeasurable middling beings understood liberation from existence and extinction; immeasurable inferior beings awakened from delusion and knew to return.

As in all Dharma realms, adorned with perfect majesty, the fragrance of meritorious virtues universally suffused. Naturally, they beheld wondrous signs, each perceiving their own reflection, free from all extraneous thoughts, without any defiled conceptions.

Then, the Celestial Worthy addressed the four assemblies and his great disciples: "You dwell in the pure and adorned lands within the Treasury of Truth Dharma, free from sorrow and affliction, cutting off the bounds of birth and death, and entering the path of the Great Vehicle."

The assembly of immortal disciples, having heard this teaching, rejoiced and bowed in reverence, then addressed the Celestial Worthy: "For long have we heard of *The Wondrous Treasury Sutra*, yet never before have we beheld its sound. Today’s discourse, today’s hearing—we extol this rare and extraordinary Dharma, marvelous beyond words, inconceivable. We only pray that the Compassionate Venerable will resolve the true nature for us. Though we, the ignorant, receive its moisture, we remain unaware. Though abiding in the Treasury of Truth, we still dwell in defiled dust. Our bodies endure the last kalpa, the five aggregates each stained. Tainted emotions arise upon contact, and thus we perceive the bodily form. Our wisdom and power remain obscured—how then may we manifest clarity?"

The Celestial Worthy replied: "Excellent, excellent! The Treasury of Truth is profound and mysterious, encompassing all sutras, serving as the vessel of the Dharma, rescuing those drowning in suffering. Its meritorious virtues run deep and far, beyond all analogy. Listen carefully and contemplate well—I shall expound it for you.

Beings of myriad forms, each with distinct inclinations, engage in varied actions, their choices tangled and diverse, all for the sake of reality. If this were so, beings would have no cause, no effect, no going, no coming. There would be no beings, no true Dao—how then could one speak of beings and karmic fruits? I only pray that the Great Compassion will enlighten the ignorant."

The Celestial Worthy said: "Within the Treasury of Truth Dharma, the original bodies of all beings are neither empty nor existent, neither true nor real. The sufferings and joys of beings are neither empty nor existent. All actions, without exception, are truly real.

Beings presently existing are equal to the nature of the Celestial Worthy—neither empty nor existent.
Future beings are equal to the nature of the Celestial Worthy—neither empty nor existent.
Past beings are equal to the nature of the Celestial Worthy—neither empty nor existent.
How then can there be distinctions to give rise to discrimination?

Without birth, without extinction, without cause, without effect—this is the true fruit. The names and forms of all dharmas are the actions of the Great Dao. Simply reflect inwardly and look back upon the former ground.

Good men, close your eyes and listen carefully. In but a moment, suddenly you shall see in the four directions the pure and adorned lands, the lion thrones beneath thousand-petaled lotuses scattered throughout empty space. The celestial musicians and immortal assemblies, innumerable, each perfectly adorned with meritorious virtues. In the blink of an eye, the light of heaven was eclipsed.

The great assembly choked with emotion, tears streaming, praying: 'May our Divine Venerable open the radiant light and sever the dense web of ignorance!'

Before the words were finished, a light shone through, neither the light of form nor the light of marks. The great assembly rejoiced, each perceiving their own reflection. The earth transformed into gold, trees into pearls and jade. All noxious grasses turned into sweet dew. The assembled multitudes, endowed with extraordinary wisdom and power, perceived the markless as the one mark, equal to all marks, merging in purity and freedom. Unobstructed, they could transform, and through transformation, all was transformed—yet nothing was transformed.

Good men and women, follow the teaching of your master without deviation. Do not generate divergent views or doubts, supposing there to be no cause and effect. As for cause and effect: not giving rise to the original mind is the wondrous cause; because nothing is attained, it is the wondrous fruit. Why is this so? The mind is the cause of good and evil; intention is the fruit of good and evil. The nature of the mind is quiescent extinction, without learning or comprehension—this is called the wondrous cause. The root of intention unmoved, good and evil both extinguished—this is called the wondrous fruit. Wisdom and liberation are without fruit or thought. Cause does not obstruct fruit; fruit does not obstruct cause. Cause is the fruit of the Dao; fruit is the cause of the Dao. Cause and fruit are of one mark, yet without any mark. The true Dao is quiescent extinction, extinction without anything extinguished. Advancing into empty space, therefore nothing arises. The original mind is the wondrous cause; because nothing is attained, it is the wondrous fruit. If one abides by this Dharma, it is called the practice of the Dao. Not arising is compliance and penetration; nothing attained is illumination and quiescence. Penetration and quiescence are non-dual—this is called the arising of the Dao’s practice, then without thought or念. Without thought or念, not abiding in the source of arising. The source of arising forgotten, the fruits of the three realms are lost. Blocking the mind and extinguishing intention, conditions and movements both stilled—this is called the arising of the Dao’s practice. The practice of the Dao transcends emptiness, without mind, without intention, without awareness, without observation, without waves, without movement. The ten thousand things share a single source—this is the true Dao. Profoundly comprehending and realizing, embodying natural understanding, inwardly illumined with clarity, penetrating heaven and earth, all marks exhausted, ultimately free and at ease, liberated and unconditioned."

At that time, the great assembly, having heard the profound Dharma, all realized the true Dao and attained liberation. Having attained liberation, they gained the Dao-mind, the Dao-intent, the Dao-eye, the Dao-sound, the Dao-fragrance, the Dao-taste—all was thoroughly penetrated.

Then, the Immortal Youth rose from his seat, prostrated himself with eyes closed, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "All dharmas possess the twelve seals. I only pray that the Great Compassion may expound the treasury of the Dharma, that all beings may attain clarity."

The Heavenly Worthy then further instructed the Immortal Youth: "Your question brings vast benefit. In the degenerate age, beings who hear this will merge with stillness, and their karmic fruits will transform and vanish. Why is this so?

One who awakens to the Dao-mind—mind is like the Dao-mind. Seeing all kinds of beings, the countless multitudes, their right and wrong, gain and loss, mutual distinctions—all are the Dao-mind. This is called the Correct Seal.

One who awakens to the Dao-intent—intent is like the Dao-intent. All beings and miscellaneous things, their right and wrong, gain and loss, inverted distinctions, all unwholesome states—all are the Dao-intent. This is called the Correct Seal.

One who awakens to the Dao-eye—the eye is like the Dao-eye. All beings, with their various views—all are the Dao-view. This is called the Correct Seal.

One who awakens to the Dao-sound—sound is like the Dao-sound. All beings, with their various kinds, the sounds of birds and beasts—all are the Dao-sound. This is called the Correct Seal.

One who awakens to the Dao-fragrance—fragrance is like the Dao-fragrance. All beings, with their various incenses—all are the Dao-fragrance. This is called the Correct Seal.

One who awakens to the Dao-taste—taste is like the Dao-taste. All beings and miscellaneous things, with their various odors and aromas—all are the Dao-taste. This is called the Correct Seal.

These twelve seals are united into six seals, universally sealing all dharmas, and are called the One Seal."

As this Dharma was being expounded, the Immortal Youth again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "Why speak of twelve seals, using what is not right as what is right?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Excellent, excellent! You have asked well about this meaning. Now I shall distinguish and explain it for you."

Just as a great physician observes all herbs and plants, incorporating them into medicinal formulas, employing various expedient means to cure illnesses—all thereby achieving healing and recovery.

When disciples seek a master to learn the arts of the Dao, after three years of study nearing completion, the master deliberately tests them: feigning illness and lying abed, he tells the medical disciple, "I now suffer gravely. You must find a useless herb for me to take, and my illness will be cured. If you cannot find it, I shall surely die. I have a fine steed—take it as you will." The disciple, accepting the master’s command, saddles the swift horse and sets forth in earnest search, traversing wherever he wills. Yet within ten days, though he scours the entire earth, he cannot find the useless herb. Weeping, he returns home and reports to his master: "I have searched the world over for the useless herb, yet it cannot be found. What now is to be done?" The master then rises abruptly and tells all his disciples: "I was not truly ill—I merely tested you. Now your medicine is complete, and you are capable of saving others. Employ your expedient means to heal the sick abroad, discern the roots of illness, and cure all afflictions. Know that this sutra is supreme, the unsurpassed King of Medicine.

By this proof, one who awakens to the Dharma searches throughout empty space, ascending to the Nine Heavens, descending to the Nine Hells, seeking that which is not the Dharma—yet it cannot be found. Know that one who awakens to the twelve seals is unimpeded in spiritual penetration, serene and still, equal to the One Non-Action."

At that time, the assembly of immortal youths, hearing this parable and the profound nature of the Dharma revealed, became luminously clear, free from doubt and obstruction. Their six senses exhausted of defilement, they advanced directly to the Great Vehicle, entering the Way of Equality. The assembly bowed in reverence, overwhelmed with gratitude.

Then the immortal youths offered a verse in praise:

Great compassion manifests a boundless body,
All beings hear and universally awaken.
Within the treasury of truth, a thousand-petaled flower,
Its blossoms scatter and fill every land.
Radiance shakes the earth, all turning to gold,
The Great Vehicle of Equality pervades all.
The nature is subtle and wondrous, without form or semblance,
The Correct Seal follows form yet remains unseen.
Beings lie dormant, unaware of rising,
Lost in long night, without refuge or support.
The Great Master skillfully expounds expedient wisdom,
Guiding the deluded toward the true principle.
The multitude wails, choked with sorrow,
Heaven’s light dims, their vision obscured.

When this verse was spoken, they addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "We only pray that your great compassion may bestow mercy, that the immortal youths may rejoice without limit, and all beings receive benefit—attaining long life, birthlessness, and extinction, all awakening to the Great Vehicle, equal and unimpeded, each fully endowed with radiant brilliance beyond all comparison."

Thereupon, the immortal youths returned to their seats, listening attentively and reflecting deeply.

**Chapter on Distinguishing the Three Treasures**

At that time, among the assembly was a youth named Unique Liberation, vigorous and diligent, who rose to resolve the doubts of the multitude: "We do not yet understand—are the Three Treasures the Dao-Treasure, Dharma-Treasure, and Master-Treasure, or are they inherently possessed by all beings? If beings lack them within, how can they settle their spirits? Confused and distressed, they sink deeper into worldly burdens. Why? All actions and expedient means of beings arise from within. If the Three Treasures exist externally, they are not inherent; if not inherent, they are impermanent. The ignorant remain unenlightened, like drunken men lying senseless, unable to rise. We only pray that your great compassion may take pity, rescue, and protect us, dispelling the net of doubt so that we may awaken."

Then the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, hearing this question, rejoiced greatly. Radiating five-colored light, he smiled and said: "Excellent, excellent! Your great compassion, boundless in pity, asks to open the unenlightened—such a question! Now settle your spirit in great stillness, and do not seek externally. Why? If listening is not attentive, the Dharma does not stain the spirit. Even subtle thoughts drifting become entangled in defilement.

You ask whether the Three Treasures are the Dao-Treasure, Dharma-Treasure, and Master-Treasure, or if beings inherently possess them. You further argue that if the Three Treasures exist externally, they are not inherent, and if not inherent, they are impermanent. Why? You raise this doubt again."

The Three Treasures are none other than greed, hatred, and delusion. Why? When the nature of greed is quiescent and extinguished, free from the dust of defilements, with precepts unbroken—this is called the Dharma-Treasure. When the nature of hatred does not arise, unprovoked by external dust, with concentration unshaken by birth and death—this is called the Master-Treasure. When the nature of delusion takes nothing, free from vexation and affliction, with wisdom unobstructed—this is called the Dao-Treasure.

These Three Treasures are neither internal nor external, neither sound nor form, neither fragrance nor touch, neither long nor short. Though shown as three names, they truly have no three bodies; neither three nor one, this is the true reality. The true reality is neither born nor destroyed, without the marks of greed, hatred, or delusion. All dharmas are free and at ease, cool and harmonious, equal and unconditioned.

Dutuo the Youth again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "The profound Dharma-Treasure Your great compassion has expounded resides within each root. Yet beings of dull faculties, burdened by heavy delusion, though possessing the Dharma-Treasure, remain utterly unaware. They wander through the long night, recklessly following false paths, revolving through the Three Realms—how may they come to understand?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Recklessly following false paths is called external seeking, lacking the power of inward reflection. You speak of the true reality as indestructible, abiding in serene constancy. Yet beings flow in motion, and the nature of motion is ever one; within each arising life, there is no defilement. Simply practice expedient means and skillfully contemplate—then the wondrous path will be seen, and the Dao is not distant. From ancient times to the present, a thousand sages and ten thousand saints have all returned to the true Dao.

Within the karmic tendencies of all beings, within each root, all return to the true Dao, pervading empty space; all karmic tendencies return to the true Dao. Those who awaken to the true Dao advance like the bright sun, without form or mark, without evil karmic tendencies, without good karmic tendencies, without tendencies of greed or hatred, pervading empty space—yet without tendencies toward empty space, all return to the true Dao. Without tendencies toward the true Dao, they are utterly pure and clear. Without losing the opportunity, each root follows its own tendency, returning to its original source."

The assembly, including Dutuo, shuddered with awe, their hair standing on end. They addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "The Dharma-body is pure, revealing the source of the Three Treasures. Yet we remain uncertain: are the Three Treasures indeed greed, hatred, and delusion, or does each root possess its own Three Treasures? If each root possesses its own Three Treasures, why manifest three?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Earlier I spoke of showing three names while truly having no three bodies. Since there are no three bodies, how can one point to three names? All beings, driven by the six senses and moved by the four great elements, are called the Three Treasures. Why? The nature of the roots is empty, without defilement. Without defilement, this is called the Dharma-Treasure. The Dharma-Treasure is pure, each self-existing—this is called the Master-Treasure. The Dharma is unobstructed, all-accomplishing—this is called the Dao-Treasure.

Within each mote of dust, the Three Treasures are present; within birds and beasts, the Three Treasures are present; within fish and turtles, the Three Treasures are present; within insects and ants, the Three Treasures are present; within grasses and trees, the Three Treasures are present. The Three Treasures are boundless and immeasurable, inconceivable.

All good men, do not leak the mind and lose the Three Treasures. Simply reflect inwardly, diligently practice offerings, and skillfully apply the power of the mind to directly reach the original source. If a single thought falters, all roots are severed, bound by dust and realms, blocking the source of the Three Treasures. The true Dao is forever cut off, and though one remains within the Dao, one wanders in confusion, unable to recognize it. Failing to recognize the Dao, the power of wisdom is weak, and one suffers affliction. All good men, listen carefully and contemplate well."

Then the Youth of Solitary Liberation rejoiced boundlessly and spoke these verses:

"The Heavenly Worthy, compassionate, opens the treasure store,
Universally bestowing upon all beings the sweet-dew medicine.
All roots receive its moisture,
Naturally attaining the great bliss of non-arising.
The nature of the three poisons purified—true treasure gate,
The power of wisdom and insight can dispel them.
The deluded multitude awakens to the Great Vehicle’s teaching,
Even the crawling insects leap for joy.
Broadly expounding the luminous path of the Three Treasures,
In every mote of dust, no metaphor suffices.
Within affliction, the true Dao is ultimately realized,
Birth after birth, quiescent extinction—no coming, no going.
Karmic appearances dissolve into the sea of nature,
Washing away boundless thoughts, transcending all deliberation.
Beings who distrust the source of the Three Treasures
Waver with dualistic minds, clinging and rejecting.
The Great Master pervades the five uninterrupted hells,
Not a hair’s breadth escapes his reach.
Earnestly exhorting to guard the source of the mind,
Awakening to the Great Vehicle, returning to the One.
We, your disciples, all rejoice,
Celebrating that the deluded multitude has found refuge.
The Great Master’s heart utterly rejects none,
Like parents gazing upon their children.
Yet parents’ thoughts for their children are not constant,
While our Master’s resolve is truly comparable.
Having spoken these verses, he addressed the Heavenly Worthy:
This humble immortal, though lowly and unworthy, has received the grace of your moisture,
Having revealed the Three Treasures and the ultimate true source,
The subtle and wondrous meaning—overjoyed, I cannot contain myself.
This is not something my dull wit can compare or illustrate,
Nor can I manifest its merit.
All beings receive benefit,
Awakening to the gate of the Three Treasures, entering the true treasury of the Dao.
Each bows their head and returns to their original place.

**Expounding the Four True Aspects**
Furthermore, the Youth of Solitary Liberation addressed the Heavenly Worthy: As stated above, the bodies of beings possess the Three Treasures and all dharmas. If this is so, then within the bodies of beings, there should be Four True Aspects.
The Heavenly Worthy said: Excellent, excellent, just as you have asked. For all beings, the Four True Aspects are the foundation. In walking, standing, sitting, lying, eating, resting, and play—all depend on the Four True Aspects.
He further asked: What are the Four True Aspects?
The Heavenly Worthy said: The mysterious essence and wondrous qi are the Four True Aspects, transforming below to give life. Cold qi is not cold, hot qi is not hot, moving qi is not moving, still qi is not still. The four qi are empty and quiescent, without obstruction, without anger or joy, without greed or rejection, without going or coming—thus they are called the Four True Aspects.
He again asked: If all beings possess the Four True Aspects, there should be no karmic retribution, nor any results of action. Those who cultivate goodness should enter hell; those who commit evil should be born in heaven. If this were so, cause and effect would be destroyed, the practices of beings severed, and there would be no cultivation of the Dao. Beings of shallow wisdom and weak roots, hearing this, would surely generate slanderous thoughts. I only wish the Compassionate Worthy would clearly reveal this for understanding.
The Heavenly Worthy said: It is like a man traveling on the road who picks up an abandoned box. Opening the box, he sees a mirror and beholds his own reflection. Mistaking it for the owner of the box, his mind fills with terror. He bows his head in apology and flees. Beings, deluded, abandon the true and grasp the false, forsaking the root to seek the branches—it is just like this.
You say: Those who cultivate goodness should enter hell; those who commit evil should be born in heaven. Those who doubt thus will all enter hell, suffering afflictions that cling to the body. Why? I reveal the true: the nature of beings is pure, without defilement or attachment. There is neither heaven nor hell. All dharmas are of one nature, neither cause nor effect—what destruction could there be?
The fleshly eyes of beings never awaken to this. Like blind men, though they dwell in the world beneath the sun and moon, they never know the light of the sun and moon. Why? The sun’s light shines brightly, yet the blind do not see. The original nature of beings is just like this. In walking, standing, sitting, and lying, it constantly follows them, yet they do not see it themselves. It is like a treasure hidden in a room where a poor man starves, never seeing the treasure. Suddenly, a wise teacher arrives, divining with an earth-mirror. Knowing the treasure is there, he digs four *zhang* deep and obtains it. Broadly performing meritorious deeds, he universally saves all beings, and all receive benefit.
The Youth of Solitary Liberation again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: Your great compassion is vast and far-reaching; the metaphors are profoundly deep. Now, having received this benefit, all doubts are instantly dispelled. The jade maidens and immortals each receive its moisture, boundless and immeasurable, all attaining fulfillment, their merit complete.
At that time, the Heavenly Worthy again addressed the immortals and all good men and women: The true Dao is neither words nor speech. Though metaphors were used earlier, they were displayed according to capacity. Why?"

All beings, with shallow roots and feeble faculties, cannot bear direct exposition. Should one speak directly, the multitude would grow deluded and confused, turning to disbelief. Those who realize the Dharma do so neither through metaphorical instruction nor through direct speech; they accord with the Dharma and immediately attain realization, directly entering the Great Vehicle, entering the root of merit, entering the unenterable, realizing the unrealizable.

The assembly led by the Youth of Solitary Liberation again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "Beings’ karmic actions vary—some refined, some coarse, some long, some short—with manifold distinctions. How can they be made equal? If they are not equal, then metaphorical instruction, though given, is neither the realized Dharma nor the Great Vehicle. How, then, does it benefit them? It is like branches swaying in the wind while the root remains still. Branches do not depart from the root, nor the root from the branches; only when the root is attained do the branches cease to sway. Beings do not depart from the Great Vehicle, nor the Great Vehicle from beings; only when realization is attained do they rest. Without realization, they drift upon the waves of birth and death—how can they find stillness? Yet, O Merciful One, your metaphors are not the Great Vehicle. How, then, do they not lead beings into further delusion?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Listen carefully, and I shall explain clearly. Beings’ actions vary—some refined, some coarse, some long, some short—all arising from karmic causes. Yet those who realize the fruit of the Dao are neither refined nor coarse, neither long nor short. You further question: if metaphorical instruction is not the Great Vehicle, how does it not lead beings into delusion?

"Good sons, do not cling to words. If one awakens through metaphorical instruction, there is nothing that is not the Great Vehicle, nothing that is not true reality, nothing that is not the One Mark, nothing that is not quiescence. Why then insist on making distinctions?"

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy spoke a gatha:

The immortals’ wondrous understanding is the true nature,
Their decisive questions open the lineage to awaken beings.
Beings’ faculties are fundamentally pure,
Yet deaf, blind, lame, and crippled, they cannot walk.
Though many expedient metaphors are employed,
They ultimately return to inner practice, free of attachment.
The true treasury shines brightly throughout empty space,
Filling the six sense-roots to overflowing.
The Three Treasures are not revealed in three separate places—
All things in the ocean of nature are equal and level.
Only through skillfully accumulating effort in the square inch of the heart,
Day and night drilling without hardness,
Does one suddenly awaken to the Merciful Father,
Transforming and departing without contention.
The foolish and benighted lie ever upon the ground,
Unaware that birth and death are ever pure.
The Four Truths form the basis of all appearances,
Yet beings seek outwardly, vainly sighing.
Solitary Liberation asks this to resolve doubt—
I now broadly open the treasury of all Dharmas.
In each and every mote of dust, the nectar of medicine,
Beings’ wisdom unfolds without sorrow.
Day and night before the True Lord,
The four demons are forever destroyed, free of calamity and obstruction.
The three karmas ultimately attain the pure fruit,
All Dharmas return to the source, free of delusion.

The Heavenly Worthy, having spoken this gatha, addressed the immortal youths, the Youth of Solitary Liberation, and the great assembly: "Compose your minds in the true realm; be vigilant against external distractions. I have now clearly expounded and opened the treasury of the true Dharma, equalizing all Dharmas. Each and every grain of sand is made real; the manifold thoughts of beings are made real; the delusions of beings are made real. The true nature is empty—unborn, undying, neither one nor different, without going or coming.

"All forms and appearances, though differing in suffering and joy, and all karmic retributions, are ultimately real—unborn and undying. Good sons, do not entertain heterodox views. If one perceives bodily forms as having going and coming, this is slandering the Dharma, this is destroying the Dharma, this is not seeing the Great Vehicle. Beings who slander the Dharma do not believe that the Three Treasures abide within their own faculties; they do not believe that going and coming are real; they do not believe that the Great Vehicle is the root; they do not believe that beings are equal in nature to the Heavenly Worthy; they do not believe that all Dharmas are quiescent and without marks, without cause or effect; they do not believe that beings, through countless kalpas, manifest in various forms yet remain unborn and undying. Such disbelief is called slandering the Dharma, destroying the Dharma, annihilating the Dharma.

"The Dharma cannot be annihilated; to obstruct and fail to see it is called annihilating the Dharma. Having annihilated the Dharma, one yet clings to bodily forms—this is birth and death, an unending cycle of rebirth, inevitably leading to hell, with no means of escape. Good sons, with diligence return home, practice offerings, and be vigilant against seeking externally, thereby slandering the Dharma."

As this Dharma was expounded, immeasurable lands radiated light, all entering the true treasury. Seated upon jeweled lotuses, lions and white cranes filled the empty sky. Countless celestial musicians entered the true treasury, free from constraint, their bodily forms unbroken yet becoming the true treasury; their bodily forms unbroken yet pervading all lands; their bodily forms unbroken yet filling the empty sky; their bodily forms unbroken, unborn and undying; their bodily forms unbroken, seated upon lion thrones; their bodily forms unbroken, emitting thousand-petaled lotuses.

"Good sons, listen carefully and reflect well. The excellent marks do not arise apart from beings; the pervasion of all lands does not occur apart from beings; the lion throne is not occupied apart from beings; the thousand-petaled lotuses do not emerge apart from beings; the filling of the empty sky does not happen apart from beings; the true treasury does not exist apart from beings; the radiant lights are not seen apart from beings.

"Good sons, do not give rise to disbelief or doubt. The Golden Mouth’s exposition is without falsehood or error. If one reveres, recites, and practices this sutra, and makes offerings, the merit is immeasurable, beyond all metaphor. All beings, even the crawling creatures, will receive benefit."

The True Immortal Youth of Solitary Liberation joyfully received the command, bowed, and departed, each returning to their original abode.

Thus concludes the first fascicle of the *Supreme Esoteric Treasury of the Inner Secret*.
The second fascicle of the *Supreme Esoteric Treasury of the Inner Secret* begins.

The "Chapter on Beneficent Blessings"

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable, together with his retinue and great disciples, dwelt upon Spirit-Solving Mountain, manifesting all dharmic signs and revealing a wondrous, singular body—subtle and supreme beyond compare.

The immortal youths filled the empty sky, encircling him a thousandfold; a hundred million lions stood guard to his left and right; fierce beasts and venomous creatures each presented rare treasures; the heavens emitted auspicious omens, and spontaneous music arose in manifold wondrous forms, beyond all conception.

Then the Heavenly Venerable scattered his original subtle blossoms. The blossoms drifted lightly, pervading the entire dharma-realm—neither blue nor white, neither red nor black, neither long nor short, neither large nor small, neither broad nor narrow, entering into the minutest subtlety, free from all form and appearance.

Within the blossoms appeared fruits of spontaneous origin. These fruits were perfectly round and pure, possessing all flavors yet not any single flavor; possessing all sounds yet not any single sound; possessing all colors yet not any single color; possessing all fragrances yet not any single fragrance; possessing all tactile qualities yet not any single tactile quality; possessing all dharmas yet not any single dharma; possessing all wisdom yet not any single wisdom.

The fruit is named the Fountain of All-Compassionate Sweetness. Those who taste this fountain’s flavor become naturally sated, free from hunger and thirst, their countenance upright and refined, wondrously fair and rare. Arriving at Spirit-Understanding Mountain, they abide in the unborn and undying, serene and ever-present, realizing the fruit of the unborn.

At that time, the four assemblies witnessed this divine transformation—the scattering of the original subtle blossoms, revealing future events—and rejoiced immeasurably, their joy beyond conception. Yet among them, doubt and confusion arose, unable to fathom this matter: they wondered where the Heavenly Venerable’s assembly was held, for the earth was all lapis lazuli, its radiance illuminating everywhere, and the hells were all at peace. The blossoms drifted lightly, pervading the entire dharma-realm—neither blue nor white, neither red nor black, neither long nor short, neither large nor small, neither broad nor narrow, entering into the minutest subtlety, free from all form and appearance. Again it was said that within the blossoms appeared fruits of spontaneous origin, perfectly round and pure, possessing all dharmas yet not any single dharma. Those who tasted this fountain’s flavor became naturally sated. Arriving at Spirit-Understanding Mountain, they abided in the unborn and undying.

They only wished the Merciful Venerable would reveal what they had not yet understood. The Heavenly Venerable said: "Excellent, excellent! Your question is most fitting, most fitting indeed. Listen carefully and reflect well, for I shall now reveal to you the original subtle blossoms. These blossoms are profoundly mysterious; even after kalpas of explanation, they cannot be exhausted. I shall briefly convey their essential mechanism, showing you their single source. My emanations pervade the dharma-realm, filling all of empty space—nothing is too vast to be covered, nothing too minute to be entered. Those who awaken to these blossoms see rightly with every glance.

Yet beings, deluded and lacking deep faith, cling to love and attachment, disrespecting the Three Treasures. Indulging in wealth and ease, they revolve in the cycle of birth and death, lost in an endless dark night, without awakening or escape, entangled in suffering and affliction, habituated to all manner of evil deeds. Their karmic retribution manifests as poverty and sickness, hunger and thirst, cold and heat. Such sufferings cannot be fully described; myriad causes and conditions follow their karmic consequences.

At that time, among the assembly, a youth named Good-Penetration rose from his seat and addressed the Heavenly Venerable: 'I do not understand—these original subtle blossoms, within which appear fruits of spontaneous origin, scattered throughout the dharma-realm, filling every mote of dust, nothing too vast to be covered, nothing too minute to be entered—are they blue or white, red or black, long or short, large or small, broad or narrow? Are they perceived or heard, come or gone, of heaven or earth? Such blossoms and fruits, vast and all-pervading, filling the dharma-realm, are beyond conception. Yet if all beings receive the same blossom, why do their conditions vary so widely? Why do good and evil differ, karmic bonds of birth and death diverge, forms of suffering and joy differ, cycles of rebirth repeat, and births take such varied forms—some among border tribes, some in the central lands, some as slaves, some as kings, some in poverty, some in wealth, some lame, some whole, some foolish, some wise, some stingy, some generous, some murderous, some compassionate, some committing the five grave offenses, some filial, some suffering, some joyful, some deaf and blind, some keen and discerning, some as birds and insects, some as fish and turtles? Such karmic retributions differ in countless ways. We only wish the Merciful Venerable would explain these distinctions.'

The Heavenly Venerable said: 'Excellent, excellent! Your question is most timely. I shall now reveal to you these causes and conditions. All dharmas differ in their marks and excellences; suffering and joy vary in their distinctions, all due to causes and conditions. From their karmic actions and unequal faith, whether evil or good, they receive corresponding retribution, like a shadow following form, like an echo responding to sound. All dharmas arise from one source—the one original subtle blossom—yet manifest in myriad forms. Beings, deluded, do not awaken to this truth. Within true reality, they generate inverted views. Once inverted views take shape, they suffer the signs of affliction, naturally becoming unfilial, their kindness and love far removed. Losing their root, they seek the branches; lost in darkness, they do not awaken, dwelling long in obscurity without liberation. Out of compassion, I employ various means to save them, revealing the causes and conditions of the Dharma. Yet among you, doubt remains, unable to fathom karmic conditions.

All dharmas are empty and quiescent, ultimately without self. If we inquire into the east, where living things arise—does it have a boundary? In the south, where illumination shines—does it have a limit? In the west, where decline and decay occur—do beings transform? In the north, where darkness prevails—does it have an end or passage? Do form, sound, fragrance, taste, and touch have inherent fragrance, sound, or touch? Do greed, hatred, and delusion have inherent bonds? Do good and evil actions have inherent practices to cultivate?'

'No, Great Compassionate One. As you have revealed, when we inquire into the actions and practices of all dharmas, nothing can be grasped. How then can there be distinctions, differing sufferings, and varied karma?'

The Heavenly Venerable said: 'All dharmas arise as illusions; illusions arise and illusions cease. All dharmas cease as illusions; illusions cease and illusions arise. Such illusory appearances arise and cease, yet in illusion there is no arising or ceasing; illusory appearances come and go, yet in illusion there is no coming or going; illusory appearances of greed and delusion, yet in illusion there is no greed or delusion; illusory appearances of grasping and rejecting, yet in illusion there is no grasping or rejecting; illusory appearances of afflictions, yet in illusion there is no affliction; illusory appearances of love and attachment, yet in illusion there is no love or attachment; illusory appearances of distinctions, yet in illusion there are no distinctions. All beings’ karmic conditions are upright—arising and ceasing are not illusory, coming and going are not illusory, greed and delusion are not illusory, grasping and rejecting are not illusory, afflictions are not illusory, love and attachment are not illusory, distinctions are not illusory. Thus, in such emptiness and quiescence lies the ultimate bodhimanda.'

Upon hearing this, Good-Penetration suddenly awakened. Sitting upright, he reflected inwardly, prostrated himself in silence, and did not rise from his seat. The four assemblies composed themselves, each collecting their countenance. In an instant, the Heavenly Venerable manifested the original subtle blossoms, which sprang forth from the earth, filling the entire dharma-realm—nothing too vast to be covered, nothing too minute to be entered. Within each blossom appeared a jeweled seat, each a square zhang in size. The devas gathered like clouds, without crowding or constraint."

Within each seat appeared a Heavenly Venerable, and at each Venerable’s place, various dharmas of the secret true treasury were expounded. All dharmas were utterly unobstructed—neither empty nor existent, neither long nor short, neither departing nor arriving, neither high nor low. Embracing all dharmas yet not all dharmas, this is called the true Dharma. Embracing all forms yet not all forms, this is called the true form. Embracing all sounds yet not all sounds, this is called the true sound. Embracing all fragrances yet not all fragrances, this is called the true fragrance. Embracing all flavors yet not all flavors, this is called the true flavor. Embracing all tangibles yet not all tangibles, this is called the true tangible. Embracing all knowledges yet not all knowledges, this is called the true knowledge.

Such dharmas, subtle and wondrous in their original essence, give rise to the dharma-realm. Within the dharma-realm, they give rise to the multitude of sages. The multitude of sages become the mothers of the Dharma, penetrating all without hindrance. Neither arising nor ceasing, neither inner nor outer, neither long nor short, neither departing nor arriving—this is called the Mother of the Dao. The Mother of the Dao gives birth to the cause of wisdom, and the cause of wisdom gives birth to the fruit of wisdom. Through the fruit of wisdom, all dharmas are purified; with all dharmas purified, there is neither cause nor fruit.

How then can there be distinctions among sentient beings? How can there be grasping and rejecting among sentient beings? How can there be craving among sentient beings? How can there be karmic retribution among sentient beings? How can there be those who uphold the precepts? How can there be those who break the precepts? How can there be those who attain the Dao? How can there be those who lose the Dao?

Such is the secret true treasury, the Mahāyāna sutra, rare in the world. Yet sentient beings, narrow and inferior, generate delusion on their own. Upon hearing this secret true treasury of the Mahāyāna, they instead slander it, thereby incurring karmic transgressions. They sink into darkness, like the blind who cannot see the light or the deaf who cannot hear the bell and drum.

Good-Penetration, though you have now awakened, the source remains unexhausted. Though you have comprehended all appearances, your mind is not yet fully clear. Within the true reality, vast and boundless, you have instead become confused.

Upon hearing this, Good-Penetration suddenly awakened anew. Overjoyed and exultant, he marveled at what he had never before encountered. The four assemblies, bewildered, each reflected inwardly. Bowing their heads to the ground, in but a moment, a youth named Appearance-Penetration rose from his seat. Bowing to the Heavenly Venerable, he said: “All sentient beings are born from the One. Having arisen from the One, what is good and what is evil? If they arise from the One, then the mind, too, arises from the One.”

Since the mind arises from the One, all actions—whether good or evil—are the mind’s doing. If all is the mind’s doing, then all is the work of the One. If all is the work of the One, how can there be suffering or joy? Yet since suffering and joy exist, they arise from causes and conditions, from karmic deeds, from the retribution of suffering and joy. If the One has retribution, it cannot be called the One. Once it is called the One, there is no retribution. How then can there be distinctions of good and evil, suffering and joy?”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “So it is, so it is. All sentient beings arise from the One, and the One is without form. Since arising is without form, the mind, too, is without form. Since the mind is without form, all actions—whether good or evil—are but emptiness and stillness. What then is good, and what is evil? Sentient beings, deluded and benighted, think a thousand thoughts and ten thousand considerations, yet do not abide in the One Source. Since the source is not abided in, all deeds vie to receive their due: good and evil take distinct forms, and beings bring upon themselves karmic retribution. Within the One Form, they suffer manifold afflictions.

Sentient beings harbor evil, entangled in greed and attachment, unable to comprehend. Since they do not comprehend, their evil accumulates day by day. In the long night of darkness, how can they recognize their origin? Having lost sight of their origin, they depart from the great compassionate source. Since the source is far departed, they lose their father and mother. Having lost their father and mother, brothers bear resentment and hatred, turning against one another. They harbor manifold evils, their minds ever vigilant, heedless of life and death. Once evil karma is complete, the obstruction of ignorance grows heavy, and affliction arises. Drawn by affliction, they drift and wander through birth and death, forcibly generating love and attachment. Clinging to love and attachment as if a fish out of water, how can they endure for long? As love and attachment gather, transgressions and karma accumulate day by day. Before long, karmic conditions each arrive, and according to their portion, they receive retribution, enduring manifold evil karma. They cycle through the Three Realms, falling into manifold sufferings, and distinctions thus arise.”

He further addressed the youth Wisdom-Power: “Can the karma received by sentient beings be traced? Can the mental formations of sentient beings be traced? Can the afflictions of sentient beings be traced? Can the karmic retribution of sentient beings be traced? Can the delusions of sentient beings be traced? Can the falsehoods of sentient beings be traced? Can earth, water, fire, and wind be traced? Can the three times—past, future, and present—be traced?”

“No, Great Compassionate Heavenly Venerable. In the questions you have posed, is there truly nothing to be attained, or is there truly something to be attained?”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “All dharmas are subtle and wondrous, neither illusory nor non-illusory, neither false nor non-false, neither long nor non-long, neither short nor non-short, neither going nor non-going, neither coming nor non-coming, neither external nor non-external, neither internal nor non-internal. All sentient beings, through karmic conditions, attain liberation. They possess the bodies of the three times, yet do not possess the bodies of the three times—this is called the true body. They possess the marks of the Three Treasures, yet do not possess the marks of the Three Treasures—this is called the true mark. They possess the three poisons and karma, yet do not possess the three poisons and karma—this is called the true karma. Such profound and esoteric scriptures are forever beyond the hearing and sight of the followers of the Lesser Vehicle. Even if they were to hear or see them, they would ultimately not believe or turn toward them, but instead generate slander, bringing upon themselves transgressive karma.

Wisdom-Power, you and your assembly should diligently practice the Great Vehicle, sever all outflows of thought, observe the mind without the mind, extinguish all minds—this is called the true mind. Observe the body without the body, extinguish all bodies—this is called the true body. Observe form without form, extinguish all forms—this is called the true form. Observe sound without sound, extinguish all sounds—this is called the true sound. Observe fragrance without fragrance, extinguish all fragrances—this is called the true fragrance. Observe taste without taste, extinguish all tastes—this is called the true taste. Practicing thus, realize the Dharma of Non-Arising. Not the Dharma of Non-Arising—this is called the realized Dharma, the Great Vehicle.”

“Good sons, you and your assembly should cultivate and practice thus. Do not grow lax or generate doubts, falling into erroneous views.”

At that time, the youth Wisdom-Power said: “I do not yet understand: observing the mind without the mind, extinguishing all minds—is this called the true mind? Observing the body without the body, extinguishing all bodies—is this called the true body? Are such practices the Great Vehicle?”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “They are not the Great Vehicle. The Dao of the Great Vehicle is to depart from all marks, depart from all practices, depart from all observations, depart from all wisdom, depart from the mind of emptiness and existence, depart from true actuality—this is called the Great Vehicle.”

Wisdom-Power said: “I do not yet understand: departing from all marks, all practices, all observations, all wisdom, the mind of emptiness and existence, and true actuality—are such practices the Great Vehicle?”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “They are not the Great Vehicle. The Dao of the Great Vehicle is neither departure nor non-departure, neither practice nor non-practice, neither observation nor non-observation, neither emptiness nor non-emptiness, neither truth nor non-truth—this is called the Great Vehicle.

Good sons, you and your assembly have heard this esoteric and true treasury of the Great Vehicle scripture. By virtue of past conditions, you are fortunate to encounter this true scripture. Each of you should vow to propagate it, cultivate the Great Vehicle, and not grow lax.”

Thereupon, Wisdom-Power and his retinue, together with the great disciples, vowed: “We shall cultivate the Great Vehicle, vowing never to retreat, comprehending the nature of all dharmas, reaching the ultimate limit, without obstruction, benefiting all beings, including those who come after. We shall delight in the profound Dharma, penetrate the principle of the Double Mystery, abide in single-minded clarity, exhaust the source and empty all, awaken to the Great Vehicle, accomplish the unsurpassed Dao, ascend the Mountain of Spiritual Understanding, attain ultimate perfection, fulfill all merits, and realize the fruit of non-doing.”

Next, the youth Treasure-Luminosity, having heard the esoteric and true treasury of the Great Vehicle scripture, vowed to propagate the Great Vehicle Dharma, vowing to deliver sentient beings to the place of liberation and accomplish the unsurpassed Dao. Such vows are of profound and far-reaching merit, beyond all comparison.

Furthermore, the youth Mountain-Edge, having heard these vows, roused himself with heroic vigor and resolute progress, awakening the vast vow-mind. He studied the Great Vehicle Dao, cultivated the Four Great Citadels, decisively overcame the Five Treacherous Bandits, expelled the Seven Deluded Ghosts, slew the Seven Obstructive Demons, carved away the barrier of ignorance, and chiseled out the hearts of the Three Bandits. Unyielding and unretreatable, he reached the Mountain of Spiritual Understanding, where there is neither birth nor extinction, abiding in serene constancy and ultimate purity.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy, seeing these youths make such vows, marveled at what had never been before: “From of old, I have seen sentient beings practice only the lesser Dao, disbelieving in the Great Vehicle, with none awakening such vows. You youths are most rare indeed.”

Then the Heavenly Worthy divided his form and scattered his body, pervading the entire Dharma-realm. From every single pore, great radiance streamed forth, illuminating the boundless depths, filling the empty sky and the limitless multitude of beings. By the awe-inspiring power of the Dao, they departed unknowingly and arrived together before the Dao, wielding effortless spiritual might.

Suddenly, from among the assembly, a youth named Golden Lamp rose from his seat and dared to ask the Heavenly Worthy: “From whence arises this auspicious radiance? By what cause does it arise? How does the Heavenly Worthy’s form scatter and pervade the Dharma-realm? By what karmic conditions have all these great assemblies arrived here through spiritual penetration?” He entreated the Heavenly Worthy to distinguish and explain, that they might awaken to understanding.

Upon hearing Golden Lamp’s inquiry into these auspicious signs, the Heavenly Worthy marveled at what had never been before: “Excellent, excellent! You fourfold assembly, listen with reverence to these decisive words. Receive them with neither hearing nor non-hearing, and I shall expound them with neither speaking nor non-speaking. Now I shall briefly explain the causes and conditions of these auspicious signs.

Out of great compassion, I emit the power of spiritual penetration, pervading all Dharma-realms, universally raining sweet dew upon every mote of dust, arising from neither arising nor non-arising as the cause and condition. Those who have gathered here are all beings who, in distant kalpas past, have already heard the esoteric treasury of the *True Treasury Sutra*. Thus, they assemble by the light, delighting in the Great Vehicle, wielding spiritual freedom and attaining fearless power. Those who do not assemble do not believe in the Great Vehicle; their karmic conditions are shallow, and though bathed in the light of compassion, they cannot awaken to understanding. It is like seeking treasure without a guide—utterly without recognition.

The nature of the Dharma is profoundly subtle. To awaken where there is nothing to awaken is called true awakening; to attain where there is nothing to attain is called true attainment. Such is the esoteric treasury. Lesser Vehicle beings cannot hear it, cannot see it, cannot cultivate it, cannot practice it, cannot believe in it. Now, for the sake of hearing and understanding, I cause immeasurable multitudes to awaken to the truth of the Dao.”

Then the great assembly, having heard these words, leapt with joy, attained spiritual power, and by the awe-inspiring light of the Dao, offered this gāthā:

The Compassionate Worthy reveals the True Treasury,
Abiding on the Mountain of Spiritual Understanding.
All immortals gather like clouds,
Manifesting their original subtle blossoms,
Drifting and filling the world,
Mysterious and inconceivable.
Within each blossom, a fruit—
Naturally pure and perfect.
Neither blue nor colored in form,
Neither long nor short in cause.
Possessing the Dharma of all wisdom,
Subtle and beyond seeking.

Sentient beings, lost in delusion,
Cling to kindness, love, and kinship;
Cherishing wealth and self-mastery,
They enter the long night of death at the end.
Drawn by karmic ties, they cultivate evils,
And the retribution of deeds births poverty.
Ever harboring hunger and thirst,
Suffering and affliction cannot be dispelled.
Their faith is not sincere and deep;
Lame, crippled, blind, and deaf,
They stray far from the Dao,
Never seeing the light of sun or moon.

The Heavenly Worthy reveals the True Treasury,
Neither illusory nor real.
All dharmas attain mastery,
Good and evil are equally balanced.
Within the square zhang chamber,
Countless as sands can be contained.
Coming and going without constraint,
Expounding the Dharma to deliver devas and humans.
The assembly rejoices,
Each awakening to the causes of the Great Vehicle.
Clearly seeing the nature of the Dharma,
Nothing is not a forest of merit.
Heroically awakening vast vows,
Vowing to deliver all beings,
They realize the unsurpassed Dao,
Ultimately becoming citadels of the Dharma.

We, the immeasurable assembly,
For countless kalpas have studied the lesser,
Lost in darkness, unable to practice.
Seeking the Dao apart from the body,
We toiled in doubt, losing the mountain path.
Enduring hunger and cold without reward,
Unaware that the inch of the heart could give birth.
All dharmas arise from the mind,
The mind realizes the Dao.
Awakening in an instant,
Suddenly spiritually numinous.”

Then the great assembly, having spoken this gāthā, once more admonished body and mind, manifesting the power of the Heavenly Worthy—merits boundless and inconceivable, which even if expounded for kalpas unending, could not be exhausted. They only entreated the Heavenly Worthy to reveal what had not yet been heard, to manifest the signs of causes and conditions, that all beings might awaken to understanding and fathom the Great Vehicle.

Then the Heavenly Worthy, hearing the assembly’s gāthā, marveled at what had never been before: “Excellent, excellent! Swiftly you have manifested and understood, deeply inquiring into its meaning, from root to branch, without omission. Now, you fourfold assembly, receive these words with neither hearing nor non-hearing, and I shall expound them with neither speaking nor non-speaking.”

Then the great assembly, having heard these words, awakened to the nature of the Dharma, fathomed the source of the True Treasury, and realized the fruit of non-arising.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy once more proclaimed this meaning in a gāthā:

The True Treasury, subtle and without form or semblance,
Without shape or name, never decaying.
Flowing and merging, ever natural,
Its tranquil wisdom-light shines unobstructed.
The perfect Dharma, ultimate as a model,
Ever serene, pure, and skillfully bestowing.
Countless sages awaken thereby,
For ten thousand kalpas, unmoved and untroubled.
The model Dharma dissolves the forest of merit,
Extinguishing the paths of the Three Poisons—greed, hatred, and delusion.
Gentle and mighty, the Dao-eye opens,
The five senses become vast and unobstructed.

Now, with great compassion, I save all,
Universally bestowing the true and wondrous medicine of sweet dew.
Naturally flowing into the sea of nature,
With heroic vigor, subduing all demonic bandits.
Through immeasurable skillful means,
I reveal the original subtlety, most marvelous.
The ten thousand appearances profoundly pour into the true nature,
Coming and going, ever following the model.

Beings, deluded and faithless in the true,
Foolish in the world, insatiable in craving.
Now I take refuge in the sea of true nature,
All dharmas quiescent and still—so too am I.
The six senses receive and accept, ever unstained,
The empty sky and Dharma-realm are the Dao-body.

Beings, long deluded by false confusion,
Thought after thought chasing pleasure, habituated to karmic causes.
In the dark and shadowy hells, boundless in suffering,
Pain and torment—unheard, unbearable to approach.
You, my assembly of disciples, each strive with effort,
Cut off thought and conditions, seek within.
The square inch of the heart, free and indestructible as vajra,
Attains truth and verifies fruit without wearying the mind.

Having spoken this verse, the Heavenly Worthy saw the assembled immortals and youths struck with awe and alarm, each reforming themselves, each awakening to the Great Vehicle, their joy boundless. They said: "We do not yet understand the sutra-teaching just expounded by the Heavenly Worthy. All beings are an assemblage of dharmas. If all beings are indeed an assemblage of dharmas, we only pray the Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion, will expound it, so that the immeasurable great assembly and all beings below may comprehend the ultimate assemblage of dharmas within themselves, cease external seeking, and behold their true knowledge."

The Heavenly Worthy again addressed the assembled immortals and youths: "All beings are boundless in form, named the sutra-teaching, also named the assemblage of dharmas. Why? When delusion is resolved, names are established; when understanding differs from the body, it is ultimately named the secret true treasury. When delusion establishes names, understanding accords with the body’s forms—this is named ‘beings,’ also named ‘birth-and-death,’ also named ‘suffering assemblage,’ also named ‘inversion,’ also named ‘external seeking.’ Why? Beings, not understanding, are named ‘deluded’; for this reason, they do not recognize themselves. Within themselves, there is an immeasurable assemblage of dharmas, complete with the Three Clarities’ realms. Beings, deluded, thus seek externally, disbelieving the true Dharma, not seeking good friends. They are named ‘beings,’ chasing dharmas with dharmas, drowning in the world, from kalpa to kalpa, never attaining clarity. If they encounter a good friend, this is named ‘past conditions,’ planting blessings and virtue. Why? Past causes yield present fruits; meeting the Heavenly Worthy, they receive the teaching, revealing the supreme true treasury, the secret and profound mystery, understanding past causes, verifying present fruits.

"Good sons, if you wish to seek, first seek within yourselves. If you seek within, the secret Dharma manifests, widely opening the true treasury, revealing the source of the Three Treasures. With this Dharma-treasury, all dharmas are gathered and encompassed, without limit or end."

The youth Huili addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "Great Master, in teaching all beings that those who seek the Dharma must first seek within themselves, and if they seek within, the secret Dharma manifests, widely opening the true treasury, revealing the source of the Three Treasures—though we have heard this sacred teaching, we cannot comprehend it. We do not know: What is the Dao? What is the Dharma? What is the Master? What is the assemblage? What is within? What is without? Because we do not know, we pray you will expound it."

The Heavenly Worthy told the youth Huili: "Good friends, what you ask concerns the manifestation of the true treasury when one seeks within. Now compose your spirit and still your mind; I will expound it widely for you. All beings, their nature pure, the celestial true Dao hidden within—this is named the true treasury. This true treasury is without inside or outside, without assemblage of Dharma, without assemblage of beings, without assemblage of Dao or virtue, ultimately quiescent and extinguished—this is named ‘secret.’ Concealed, it is profound stillness; revealed, it is responsive and wondrous, widely demonstrating many paths, able to open obstructions of things, deeply and distantly benefiting. The assembled immortals and youths, along with their retinues—celestial immortals, earthly immortals, and immeasurable assemblies—rejoiced and exclaimed: 'Excellent! Excellent! The Heavenly Worthy’s virtue universally illumines without end, moistening and benefiting all beings, equal and unobstructed.'"

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the four assemblies and great disciples: "In the future, if there are beings who read, recite, receive, uphold, and expound the *True Treasury Sutra*, their merit will be inconceivable, and they will see my body attain the supreme Dao. Why? This sutra expounds the root of all dharmas, its benefits profound, its merit vast and far-reaching, difficult to compare. If beings, with faith in their hearts, read and recite it, casting aside all other thoughts, they will immediately attain the Dao-eye, illuminating the causes and conditions of the three times, equal and unobstructed, awakening to causes as non-causes, fruits as non-fruits, comprehending the forms of body and mind. Not the mind, not non-mind, nor even non-non-mind—this is the true form of the mind. Forms without form, the mind of no-form pervades the Dharma-realm. The form of the Dharma-realm is unborn and undying; the prior limit does not depart, the later limit does not arrive; the present does not go to the past, the past does not come to the present. Past and present are one form, one without form, liberated according to their portion, profoundly still and unconditioned, with virtue complete."

Then, the four assemblies in unison chanted, praising the subtle wonder of the Dharma, the Great Vehicle of the true treasury, its merit rare and precious. Taking leave of the Worthy’s august countenance, they wept and returned to their lands.

Thus concludes *The Supreme Secret Treasury Sutra*, Scroll the Second.
Here begins *The Supreme Secret Treasury Sutra*, Scroll the Third.

**The Liberation Chapter**

At that time, the Primordial Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning roamed and dwelled in the Land of Salvation and Life, within the Grove of Almsgiving. With all his retinues and the cloud-gathered assemblies from the four directions—countless multitudes, each adorned in splendor—they arrived at the Grove of Almsgiving to hear the Celestial Worthy expound the Dharma.

Then, the Celestial Worthy, motionless in the empty sky, resplendent in wondrous majesty, sat upon the lion throne and proclaimed the true Dharma.

At that moment, the Youth of Good Luminance, amidst the great assembly, suddenly arose, bowed his head before the Dao, and addressed the Celestial Worthy: "Great compassion is rare! You skillfully ferry sentient beings across, mindful of all disciples, inspiring them to arouse the good mind, to cultivate the supreme Dao. Yet, what practices should they undertake? What Dharma should they contemplate? How should they harmonize body and mind?"

The Celestial Worthy replied: "Excellent, excellent! As you have asked, in the Land of Salvation and Life, I proclaim the true Dharma to deliver all beings. Now listen carefully, and I shall explain for you.

"Good men and women, each arousing the good mind, cultivating the supreme Dao, should subdue their conduct, extinguish all demonic thieves, and abide in the One to save living beings, equal and without duality. Practicing thus, contemplating thus, all sentient beings—whether endowed with consciousness or not, whether possessing form or not—shall all attain right wisdom and accomplish the supreme Dao.

"In this way, the boundless Dharma-realms and all heavenly ranks, all sentient beings, are in truth without sentient beings, and those who attain the Dao—why is this so? If there were sentient beings who could practice or contemplate, who possessed bodily marks, who could attain extinction or accomplish the Dao, who could lose the Dao, this would destroy the worldly Dharma.

"It is called entering all Dharma-realms and practicing wisdom, entering all afflictions and practicing wisdom, entering all births and deaths and practicing wisdom, entering all craving and attachment and practicing wisdom, entering all lands and practicing wisdom, entering all mountains and forests and practicing wisdom, entering all different kinds and practicing wisdom, entering all non-Dharma and practicing wisdom, entering all uninterrupted hells and practicing wisdom. All Dharmas are subtle and profound, entering without entering—this merit is inconceivable.

"Good Luminance, how can you seek attainment through the five colors, the six senses, and the four delusions? Can one with a body realize and accomplish the Dao? Can one with marks seek the markless? Can one with sentient beings seek the nature of the Dao?"

"No, Celestial Worthy."

The Celestial Worthy said: "All Dharma-marks are not Dharma. If one reflects upon all Dharmas as quiescent, extinguished, without birth, without abiding, without cessation, then one sees the fruit of the Dao.

"Good men and women who hear this great vehicle secret treasury sutra yet do not believe it—such persons, for immeasurable kalpas, have taken the bodies of the six kinds of livestock, giving rise to arrogance, not believing in the Three Treasures, not believing in the true sutra.

"I proclaim this secret treasury of the true treasury. There are great disciples who cultivate, recite, and expound this revered sutra. Those who can arouse faith in this true treasury, constantly practicing without negligence—know that such persons, in the presence of all Celestial Worthies, perform meritorious deeds and plant fields of blessings. For immeasurable kalpas, they have followed the great vehicle. Now, encountering this sutra, they arouse faith.

"They do not abide in emptiness or existence to seek the Dao; they do not abide in neither emptiness nor existence to seek the Dao; they do not abide in neither neither-existence nor neither-emptiness to seek the Dao; they do not abide in form or sound to seek the Dao; they do not abide in neither-form nor neither-sound to seek the Dao; they do not abide in neither neither-form nor neither-sound to seek the Dao; they do not abide in wisdom to seek the Dao; they do not abide in neither-wisdom nor neither-insight to seek the Dao; they do not abide in neither neither-wisdom nor neither-insight to seek the Dao.

"Again, I tell you, Good Luminance: My perfect responses fully know and see, thoroughly understanding sentient beings, discerning their root natures, illuminating the causes of the three times. Why is this so? Seeing and knowing sentient beings who grasp at marks with the mind gives rise to afflictions, gives rise to inversion, gives rise to the destruction of birth and death. If one does not grasp at marks with the mind, does not grasp at Dharma, does not grasp at attachment, does not grasp at views, this destroys the worldly Dharma and severs all good marks.

"You should not grasp at existence and abandon emptiness, nor grasp at emptiness and abandon existence. Because of this principle, I constantly reveal the Dharma—Dharma after Dharma is ever luminous. The luminous Dharma is without marks, without non-Dharma marks, without neither-marks.

"You, my disciples, understand my intent. It is like an empty boat, floating to ferry the drowning. Without intention, it drifts east or west, and when one reaches the shore, one abandons the boat and departs—how much more so if it were not a boat?

The Youth of Good Luminance asked the Celestial Worthy: "Is there a realization of the fruit of the Dao? Is there a Dharma that is expounded?"

The Celestial Worthy said: "All Dharmas have no fixed marks, nor is there any fixed Dharma, ultimately quiescent and still. If one says that I have expounded something, this slanders my Dharma. If one says there is a Dharma by which the Dao is realized and accomplished, this destroys the worldly Dharma."

Why is this so? All Dharmas are subtle and wondrous, without non-Dharma, without neither-Dharma, all constituting virtue, without distinction. The reason for this is that all sentient beings, through differing karmic practices, arise from the subtle and wondrous, yet manifest distinctions. Know that distinction is non-distinction.

Good Luminance Youth, how do you consider this: if one were to practice such virtue in the Five Confusion Worlds, giving away gold, jade, and treasures in abundance—would the merit thus obtained be great?

Good Luminance Youth, the merit spoken of by the Celestial Worthy is most extraordinary and rare. If one were to lecture on, transcribe, receive, uphold, and make offerings to this sutra, the merit thus obtained would surpass the former by a hundred thousand myriad times. Why is this so? All immortals, perfected beings, and supreme sages attain the fruit of the Dao through this sutra. If one were to attain the Dao without this sutra, it would never be so. Know that the merit of this sutra is beyond measure.

That which is called the fruit of the Dao is not the fruit of the Dao, yet it is the fruit of the Dao. That which is called the Three Emptinesses and Four Confusions, though having something to receive, is not the fruit of the Dao, yet it is the fruit of the Dao. Why is this so? My single practice severs all outflows, and among all Dharma marks, it is foremost.

Good Luminance Youth, let each of you purify your lands, depart from form, fragrance, and touch, adorn them with wondrous beauty to become the Dharma realm, and polish your minds—this mind is not mind, yet it is called the Great Mind. This is called virtue, inconceivable.

If there are good men and women who wholeheartedly make offerings, lecture on, recite, and uphold this sutra, know that such persons’ merit is foremost, accomplishing the rare Dharma for all beings. Wherever this sutra resides, there is Dao wisdom, wondrous spiritual power, and the banner of good salvation. The Vajra Youth emerges everywhere to protect and uphold the Dharma treasury, which must not be lightly disclosed.

At that time, Good Luminance Youth again addressed the Celestial Worthy: "How should one cultivate this sutra? How should we, your disciples, receive and uphold it?"

The Celestial Worthy said: "To cultivate this sutra is to be without text or words, to sever all outflowing practices, and to realize the treasury of true Dharma. This sutra is called the *City of Wisdom Power*, which protects all beings and removes delusions and hindrances. I speak of all Dharmas as not being Dharmas, hence it is called the *Dharma City*. I speak of all dust-motes as not being dust-motes, and because they are not dust-motes, it is called the *Dharma City*. I speak of all differing kinds and lands as not being differing kinds and lands, and because they are not lands, it is called the *Dharma City*.

Good man, if you and others can practice even a single word within the treasury of true Dharma, or lecture on it for others in other realms, its blessings will be vast and immeasurable. If one cultivates half the Dharma and realizes the whole Dharma, the merit is most weighty, equal to that of the boundless.

Upon hearing this sutra, Good Luminance Youth awakened to its meaning, weeping tears of sorrow that he had not earlier heard the Celestial Worthy expound such a rare and profound treasury of true Dharma to liberate all beings: 'In the past, I practiced the lesser vehicle, and though I attained the Dharma eye, my understanding of the principle was not deep. I had never before heard such a secret and great Mahayana sutra. Now, having encountered the Celestial Worthy, I receive this wondrous medicine, allowing me to uphold it with steadfast faith and adorn my virtue—most rare and foremost.'

The Celestial Worthy said: "The true mark of spoken merit is not the true mark of merit. It is neither mark nor non-mark, and this is called the true mark of merit. If one can subtly contemplate and comprehend the true mark of merit, realizing the Dharma is not difficult. Why is this so? Because departing from all dust-mote marks, one is all true and correct Dharmas.

Good man, if one hears this sutra, that person gains the power of vajra and attains fearlessness. Know that this person has cultivated this sutra for countless kalpas, practicing diligently without laxity.

Again, he addressed Good Luminance Youth: "All sentient beings are neither existent nor non-existent, neither non-existent nor non-non-existent, neither mind nor non-mind—this is called awakening, this is called truth, this is called virtue.

Good man, I do not speak falsely, nor do I speak delusion, nor do I speak confusion, nor do I speak differently. If there were a Dharma that could be cultivated, received, abided in, departed from, acted upon, or attained, it would destroy the true and correct, bind the nature of all Dharmas, lose all merit, fail to see the source of the Dao, lack compassion and filial piety, dwell in dark ignorance, and have no liberation or escape.

Furthermore, Good Luminance Youth, if one suddenly hears this sutra and does not reject it in mind, know that this person’s merit is boundless—how much more so for those who transcribe, recite, and lecture on it for others, whose merit is inconceivable.

Good man, this sutra exists everywhere. Why is this so? Not receiving through hearing or seeing, not receiving through fragrance or taste or touch, yet penetrating the nature of all Dharmas—such a person sees this sutra everywhere and obtains merit, which is called making offerings and called upholding.

Good man, one must revere and make offerings, for the merit is most weighty.

Furthermore, good men and women, if one constantly practices the Great Mind, encourages others to cultivate goodness, and recites this sutra, the merit will be vast and immeasurable.

Furthermore, all good spiritual friends, each must be cautious and not lightly disclose it. Those who lightly disclose it commit grave offenses, difficult to describe—even if expounded for kalpas, it could not be exhausted. Such persons lack roots, have no past good thoughts, and only accumulate offenses. If they hear good Dharma, their minds become wild and doubtful, wavering in disbelief. Know that such persons are difficult to convert, and their karmic retribution in birth and death is boundless."

At that time, Good Luminance Youth again addressed the Celestial Worthy: "All sentient beings, good men and women, who aspire to the supreme Dao—how should they arouse the aspiration?"

"How does one practice the practices? How does one regulate and refine? How does one realize the Dao? How does one extinguish the activities of sentient beings and attain the fruit of the Dao?"

The Celestial Worthy replied: "All sentient beings, good men and women, who arouse the aspiration for the supreme Dao—why do you harbor such doubts and pose these questions? I am originally unborn, and thus without extinction. All sentient beings are likewise: without birth, without extinction, without abiding, without departing, without person, without self, ultimately equal, truly without any dharma. Those who arouse the aspiration for the supreme Dao—all the abodes and gatherings I dwell in are the root of great wisdom.

"Good Luminance Youth, before you understand thus, understand this meaning. Good Luminance Youth, in what you understand of the Celestial Worthy’s discourse on the abode of great wisdom, there are truly no sentient beings who seek the Dao, nor are there sentient beings who attain the Dao."

The Celestial Worthy said: "Without speech, without hearing; without speech, there is nothing to hear and receive. Without sentient beings, there are no sentient beings to receive it. Without dharma, there is no dharma to receive. Without destroying worldly dharmas, one attains the fruit of the Dao. Attaining the fruit of the Dao is without gain, without loss, without birth, without diminution, without sorrow, without suffering, without confusion, without inversion. All dharmas are the true Dao. What is called the true Dao is without all dharmas, and also without the true dharma—this is named the true dharma. Neither true nor not true, yet named the fruit of the Dao."

Good Luminance Youth asked the Celestial Worthy: "Does the great wisdom possess the five eyes?"

The Celestial Worthy replied: "Truly, it possesses great wisdom: the flesh eye, the dharma eye, the wisdom eye, the virtue eye, and the Dao eye. Why is this so? The flesh eye is itself the dharma eye, the wisdom eye, the virtue eye—this is called the Dao eye. Sentient beings are themselves the dharma body, the wisdom body, the virtue body—this is called the Dao body. Why is this so? The entire dharma realm is named the Dao body. As numerous as the sands of the Ganges, their count cannot be exhausted. All sentient beings, with diverse minds and varied forms, gathered in groups and divided by kind—the Dao eye knows them all. Why is this so? What the Celestial Worthy reveals of forms and diverse minds is not truly a mind, not a mind of forms; not mind yet not no-mind, nor not no-mind; not form yet not no-form, nor not no-form; not the past mind, nor not the past mind; not the future mind, nor not the future mind; not the present mind, nor not the present mind. Know that the power of dharma is profoundly deep, its virtue subtly wondrous, its secret true treasury beyond compare, attaining its boundless edge."

Good Luminance Youth rejoiced and exclaimed: "Excellent! Excellent!" The four assemblies prostrated themselves on the ground, praising in unison, and recited these verses:

"The Celestial Worthy reveals the Dharma King,
Subtly wondrous, without falsehood.
Virtue follows the mind’s sovereign,
The source of wisdom pervades all.

With varied forms and excellent marks,
The great mind’s land of equality.
Liberating all sentient beings,
Dispelling the sufferings of the three realms.

The four assemblies each attain the Dharma,
Naturally beholding the Dharma city.
The deluded do not trust the true,
Sinking and striking in the five destinies.

The Celestial Worthy skillfully expounds,
Teaching the Dharma without partiality.
The Dao’s light shines in an instant,
Washing away all doubts.

The five aggregates open clearly,
The six senses remain unstained.
The square inch firmly attains the Dao,
Subtle thoughts manifest the aspiration."

At that time, the great assembly, having recited these verses, praised the Celestial Worthy of Great Compassion for revealing the nature of all dharmas, his autonomous spiritual power, which we disciples cannot fully comprehend. Why is this so? The Dharma spoken by the Celestial Worthy is not truly Dharma-speaking. If one says the Celestial Worthy speaks, this is to destroy the Dharma, to slander the Dharma, to extinguish the Dharma. Why is this so? Because one does not understand the Celestial Worthy’s intent. We only beseech the Celestial Worthy to expound according to our capacities."

The Celestial Worthy said: "What I have attained as the supreme Dao is without attainment. Awakening to the emptiness and quiescence of dharmas, awakening to what is without awakening, quiescence without quiescence—awakening yet without awakening, quiescent yet without quiescence—realizing the principle of dharma, this is called the supreme Dao. Without dharma to realize, without Dao to reveal—this is named attaining the Dao.

"Furthermore, good sons and daughters, all dharmas are equal, without high or low, without birth or extinction, without going or coming—this is called the fruit of the supreme Dao. What I now speak is not Dharma, yet named the Dharma King, all is autonomous. If there is one who, within this sutra, practices a single phrase, expounds it to others, encourages them to uphold, read, and recite it, the merit gained will be millions and billions of times greater, beyond compare, unable to be exhausted even by the sands of the Ganges. Some may offer their bodies, crushing them to pieces; some may cast themselves to starving tigers; some may burn their bodies and lives; some may, bound by karmic causes and effects, relinquish and give to seek blessings—such merits are meager, their dharma power unfulfilled. Why is this so? Because they lack wisdom and understanding, lack thorough comprehension, self-realizing and self-seeking, self-attaining and self-binding, thus falling into the obstruction of ignorance. Even if one were to crush one’s body into dust as fine as the sands of the Ganges, turning dust to ash, it would never be exhausted. Because it is inexhaustible, karmic bonds are not severed; karma upon karma entangles—how can one attain liberation?

"You, my disciples, each reflect within yourselves. Do not grow lax. Diligently practice wisdom and realize the fruit in an instant."

The Celestial Worthy then recited these verses:

"The Dharma King pervades the dharma realm,
Ferrying and liberating all sentient beings.
Compassionate grace and blessings universal,
Severing delusions to build the Dharma city.

The jewel is neither within nor without,
Radiant and luminously clear.
You, my disciples,
Deluded and unable to practice.

In vain you cultivate ascetic practices,
Even after ten thousand kalpas, no glory.
Forgetting the self and the absence of self,
Virtue lies level and serene.

Ever practicing without laxity,
Spirit and soul remain undisturbed.
I now reveal the Dharma King,
Ever clear and constantly pure.

Awakening and understanding arise from the square inch,
Conditions and causes equally without affliction."

Virtue pervades the dharma realm,
Why feign sighs and chants in vain?
You, my disciples, must strive with diligence,
Cultivating without hardness or obstruction.

After reciting these verses, the Celestial Worthy addressed the assembly: "You, with profound sincerity, listen attentively. I now expound the dharmas—neither external nor internal, neither long nor short, neither departing nor arriving, neither empty nor false. Subtle and wondrous, adorned with a hundred treasures, virtue is fully complete, yet cannot be named.

What is called 'virtue' is not virtue—it is named 'virtue.'
What is called 'attainment of fruit' is not attainment—it is named 'attainment.'
What is called 'obtaining the Dao' is not obtaining—it is named 'obtaining.'
Deep understanding and profound realization—this is called the Great Vehicle.
What is called the 'Great Vehicle' is not the Great Vehicle—it is named the 'Great Vehicle.'
What is called the 'dharma realm' is not the dharma realm—it is named the 'dharma realm.'
Pervading every grain of sand, it is not the sand—it is named the 'sand.'
Such subtle and wondrous virtue cannot be likened to anything."

Upon hearing these words, the assembly of immortals and others trembled in awe, sweat streaming down to their heels. Each reflected inwardly. In but a moment, an eon passed, and they awakened to the Great Vehicle, realizing the supreme Dao.

The Celestial Worthy declared: "One does not attain the Dao through perfect wisdom, nor through perfect marks of excellence, nor through the fullness of afflictions, nor through the fullness of all dusts, nor through the adornment of dharma treasures, nor through the fullness of the dharma realm, nor through the fullness of generosity. If there are good men and women who awaken to the Great King of Self-Mastery over all dharmas, equal and ultimate, their virtue is inconceivable.

Those who attain the Dao do not accept virtue, do not accept wisdom, do not accept all practices, do not accept compassion, do not accept forbearance."

The youthful Śramaṇa Śuddha-prabha then asked the Celestial Worthy: "Why do the immortals who study the Dao not accept virtue, not accept wisdom, not accept all practices, not accept compassion, not accept forbearance?"

The Celestial Worthy replied: "The seal of the Great Vehicle severs all outflows. How could one greedily accept virtue? How could one greedily accept wisdom? If there are good men and women who say the Celestial Worthy should be seen as coming or going, such persons are deluded and do not understand my teaching. Know that the Celestial Worthy is equal and non-dual—thus is he named the Celestial Worthy. If one regards the dharma realm as a speck of dust, would the number of such dusts be many?"

The assembly replied: "Exceedingly many."

The Celestial Worthy said: "In my exposition of the dharma, even a hundred billion suns and moons, a hundred billion stars, do not equal a single one of them. Why? The dharma realm I speak of is not the dharma realm—yet it is called the dharma realm. The sentient beings I speak of are not sentient beings—yet they are called sentient beings. The attainment of the Dao I speak of is not attainment—yet it is called attainment. Sentient beings, clinging and grasping, accepting and rejecting in every matter, undergo birth and death, transformation and change, deluding their spirits and souls, losing the nature of equality.

If there are men and women who give away their bodies and all the treasures of every world in generosity, would their virtue be great?"

The assembly replied: "Exceedingly great."

"If there are those who receive and uphold this sutra, expounding it to others, without attachment to any marks, without grasping at any marks, without realizing a self or others, without unifying all principles—such virtue is immeasurable, surpassing the former by a hundred thousand myriad billions. Even a fraction of it cannot compare. Know that the virtue of this sutra is most weighty, beyond measure."

At that time, the four assemblies on Mount Lingjie and all the heavenly beings fully awakened. Together they praised and bowed, exclaiming: "The Celestial Worthy broadly expounds the Great Vehicle, delivering boundless multitudes. Each of us vows to repay our king, for through his protection and nurture we have been able to seek the truth and study the sacred Dao. Following conditions, we have attained awakening—hard to conceive indeed!

Good men and women, the human body is hard to obtain. Strive diligently, do not grow lax. Once the good path is lost, ten thousand eons will pass without hope."

The Celestial Worthy said: "Excellent, excellent! All you disciples possess karmic affinities from the past, with faculties easily awakened. Hearing this Great Vehicle, you believe and practice diligently, with profound intention and distant mindfulness, transcending the marks of emptiness and existence, realizing the dharma of non-arising. You, the four assemblies, each lead your conditions, adapting to circumstances to teach and guide. Do not stagnate in one place, but awaken to the principles of all conditions.

I now reveal the treasury of the true Great Vehicle sutra, entrusting it to the king and my great disciples, to be transmitted and proclaimed, delivering those drowning in suffering. The sweet dew of the Great Vehicle is rare indeed. Those who taste it abide in the unborn and unceasing, without going or coming, serene and ever-present, in the ultimate bodhimanda.

If there are those who slander and disbelieve this sutra, such persons, in this life, are sown with evil karma. Upon death, they enter the central prisons of Fengdu, suffering the torments of wind and blades, condemned by spirits to labor in fourteen courts. Each court has one chief examiner, one hundred twenty examining officers, one thousand two hundred examining soldiers, twelve thousand examining lords. Across the Three Rivers and Nine Streams, the Four Seas and deep waves, the dead souls toil as servants. Such trials and punishments are unbearably painful.

Then the Celestial Worthy, further expounding the suffering of lost souls, recited these verses:

Those who, as humans, disbelieve the Dharma,
Slander the virtuous and good,
Receive the retribution of Fengdu in death,
Their forms shattered on the sword trees.
For ten thousand eons, endless eons,
Their souls endure agony, hearts torn.
Their cries resound without cease,
As hell-wardens plunge them into boiling cauldrons.
Suffering without respite,
Eyes of wrath glare from all sides.
Who could endure such torment?
Deluded, they rage in madness.
I exhort the practitioners:
Cultivate blessings, forever free from calamity."

After reciting these verses, the Celestial Worthy addressed the four assemblies: "Good men, each of you must practice diligently, restrain the four afflictions, cultivate the mind of equality, study the Great Vehicle, forever ending the three defilements, attaining the six spiritual penetrations and the wisdom of fearlessness."

The Venerable Youth Shànmíng and all four assemblies rejoiced immeasurably, their reverence boundless. With wisdom settled and resolve firm, they received the teachings and vowed to practice them, from life to life, from kalpa to kalpa, pledging never to retreat. Bowing in homage, they each returned to their native lands.

*Thus concludes the third scroll of The Supreme Esoteric Treasury of Inner Secrets.*

*Scroll Four of The Supreme Esoteric Treasury of Inner Secrets: The Chapter on Discerning Forms and Illuminating the Canon*

At that time, the Most High Primordial Celestial Worthy sat in serene tranquility upon Spirit-Solving Mountain, bestowing merit universally. He revealed the forms of all scriptures and manifested the source of the true Dao: all dharmas, in their nature and appearance, are empty and quiescent, neither arising nor ceasing.

Why is this so?
The Dharma is inherently subtle, its merit profound and far-reaching.
Yet sentient beings, deluded and confused, fail to embrace the Dharma with purity. They slander of their own accord, losing the source of the Three Treasures.

Why is this so?
The hindrance of afflictions runs deep, and the source of wisdom remains obscured. They revolve through the three evil destinies, forever without liberation.

Then the Venerable Youth Shànmíng, having heard these words, addressed the Celestial Worthy: "Today, attending your seat, my joy is beyond measure. I venture to ask the Celestial Worthy: how many are the names and forms of the scriptures? Are they divided into sections, or are they a single all-encompassing title of the Dharma-realm? My foolish mind does not comprehend; I only beseech the Celestial Worthy to expound and distinguish them for us."

The Celestial Worthy replied: "Excellent, excellent! Your question is most timely. All dharmas are but the titles of scriptures—neither inner nor outer, neither long nor short—subtle, pure, eternally abiding, and indestructible.

Why is this so?
Because the nature of the Dharma is emptiness.
The shallow-minded, failing to awaken to the great Dao, lose the true and constant nature, wandering in delusion from the correct scriptures.

They are thus divided into sections:
First, *Supreme Purity*;
Second, *Wondrous Perfection*;
Third, *Great Unity*;
Fourth, *Wondrous Grove*;
Fifth, *Transformation and Enlightenment*;
Sixth, *Immortals*;
Seventh, *Yellow Grove*;
Eighth, *Supreme Perfection*;
Ninth, *Daoist Teachings*;
Tenth, *Supreme Refinement*;
Eleventh, *Supreme Wondrous Merit*;
Twelfth, *Virtue and the Dao*.

These twelve divisions of scriptures are treasured within the Great Cavern’s Jade Purity Realm, indestructible and unchanging, neither arising nor ceasing, abiding in serene constancy, pervading all gates of wondrous mystery.

First, *Cavern Mystery*;
Second, *Primordial Yang*;
Third, *Original Constellations*;
Fourth, *Great Kalpa*;
Fifth, *Supreme Audition*;
Sixth, *Inner Tone*;
Seventh, *Refinement of Life*;
Eighth, *Spiritual Secrets*;
Ninth, *Dispelling Demons*;
Tenth, *No Heat*;
Eleventh, *Anointing*;
Twelfth, *Supreme Penetration*.

These twelve divisions of scriptures reside within the Great Cavern’s Supreme Purity Realm, subtle and pure, the root of all heavens and the foundation of the myriad existences.

First, *Great Purity*;
Second, *Penetrating Vision*;
Third, *Assembly of Immortals*;
Fourth, *Cavern Abyss*;
Fifth, *Inner Secrets*;
Sixth, *True Unity*;
Seventh, *Assembly of Spirits*;
Eighth, *Central Essence*;
Ninth, *Boundlessness*;
Tenth, *Assembly Palace*;
Eleventh, *Yellow Court*;
Twelfth, *Lesser Kalpa*.

These twelve divisions correspond to the Great Cavern’s Grand Purity Realm, ferrying the living across death, the vessel of all dharmas.

Within these three esoteric treasuries of the Three Purities, names and traces are revealed, manifesting the wondrous scriptures. They encompass all without exception, subtly penetrating the finest details. Should one receive, uphold, transcribe, expound, recite, or study them, that person’s merit would be inconceivable, beyond analogy or measure.

Why is this so?
For the golden mouth has spoken, and there is no falsehood in it. All the sages and immortals of the Dao have never attained the Dao without relying on these scriptures.

Why is this so?
These scriptures are subtle and wondrous, containing the titles of all scriptures. The youthful immortals of the heavens, the mighty ones, spirits, vajras, and lions all guard and protect them, forbidding their careless disclosure. Should one slander or disbelieve them, that person would immediately incur grave illness, suffering the retribution of past karma. Though temporarily born as a human, they give rise to slander and disbelief in the Great Vehicle. After death, they shall enter the Yellow Springs, abiding forever in the dark prisons, without liberation.

Venerable Youth Shànmíng, you and your assembly must deeply ponder these scriptures. Do not harbor disbelief or follow perverse views.

Why is this so?
Because of lack of faith, or because faith is not profound."

Without wisdom, or because wisdom is not profound;
Without understanding, or because understanding is not profound;
Without reflection, or because reflection is not profound;
Without concentration, or because concentration is not profound;
Without penetration, or because penetration is not profound;
Without severance, or because severance is not profound;
Without facility, or because facility is not profound;
Without realization, or because realization is not profound;
Without subtlety, or because subtlety is not profound;
Without the Dao, or because the Dao is not profound.

You and your assembly have endured hardships through kalpas, practicing the lesser vehicle, yet ultimately failing to attain the Dao. Why is this so? The liberation of all dharmas is inherently contradictory; any movement strays from its source, losing the origin of the true Dao.

Venerable Youth Shànmíng, humbly receiving the teachings, said: "What was never spoken before has now been spoken; what was never heard before has now been heard; what was never seen before has now been seen." The four assemblies rejoiced, the multitudes found peace, yet many remained perplexed. They dared to ask the Heavenly Worthy: "The scriptures encompass all dharmas—do they have a fixed number, or are they numberless? If they have a number, they cannot encompass all dharmas; if they are numberless, then there are no scriptural collections. Why is it said there are thirty-six named scriptures? If they have a number, that number must be finite—how then can they be subtle and wondrous, delivering beings from suffering and distress?" The assembly, still unenlightened, entreated the Heavenly Worthy to expound according to their capacities.

The Heavenly Worthy smiled, his entire body radiating light, illuminating all lands and boundless worlds, so that all saw him without his leaving his original realm. Arriving at Língjiě Mountain, they listened as the Heavenly Worthy spoke:

"What you ask has not grasped the essence of the scriptures. I shall explain for you. All dharmas are but the titles of these scriptures. Beings, benighted and ignorant, do not comprehend their origin, losing the true and constant Dao. To guide them, I provisionally expound the scriptures, manifesting various collections and explaining them according to conditions. Sometimes I teach the Great Vehicle; sometimes the Middle Vehicle; sometimes the Lesser Vehicle. Some awaken through the Great Vehicle; some through the Middle Vehicle; some through the Lesser Vehicle. Yet the principle of awakening transcends the traces of the three vehicles.

Know that all scriptures are wondrous, neither numbered nor unnumbered, neither great nor not-great, neither middle nor not-middle, neither small nor not-small. Though their collections are finite, their subtlety penetrates the most minute, delivering those drowning in suffering. The numbers are but a brief indication, a finger pointing to the moon. If one awakens, perceiving the original subtlety beyond appearances, one attains perfect fulfillment, thoroughly understanding all dharmas. There is no grasping or rejecting, no greed or attachment, no delusion or desire, no anger or joy, no killing or stealing—all is of one equal nature. This principle of equality, according to one’s portion of merit, is fully possessed by each, with wisdom and understanding boundless.

Beings, failing to comprehend, violate it themselves. It is like oil that fuels a lamp: the lamp’s light consumes itself, and when the oil is exhausted, the lamp goes out. The delusion of beings is likewise. They create their own retribution, like a shadow following form. When the form is straight, the shadow is upright; when the form is crooked, the shadow is bent. The karmic retribution of all dharmas follows from its causes.

If no being practices, how can the Dao be seen? It is like planting: if one sows grain, grain sprouts; without sowing grain, there is no grain, no sprouts—how then can grain be obtained? The cause and effect of beings are the same. Without planting good causes, there are no good effects; without good effects, evil causes arise. Evil effects grow, and evil grows in turn, karma begetting karma, cause and effect unending. They sink into the three realms, falling into evil destinies. Later, reborn among humans, none pay them respect—how then can they believe in the Dao? How can they practice the Dao? How can they awaken to the Dao? Why is this so? Because they lack good causes and lack wisdom."

Venerable Youth Shànmíng and the four assemblies listened earnestly, reflecting deeply without doubt. "This scripture is profound and wondrous, most revered and noble; all heavenly spirits and sages honor it without exception. You and your assembly, by virtue of past causes, are fortunate to have heard it, entering the realm of merit—there is no comparison."

Venerable Youth Shànmíng, humbly receiving the teachings, still had unresolved doubts and dared to ask: "This scripture, like all dharmas, is without distinction. If it is without distinction, why is it said to be most revered and noble? If it alone is revered and noble, it is not equal to other dharmas. If it is not equal, there are differences; with differences, there are superior and inferior; with superior and inferior, there is greed and desire; with greed and desire, there is birth and death; with birth and death, there are attachments; with attachments, one follows perverse views—how then can the Dao be attained?"

The Heavenly Worthy said: "The scriptures are equal to all dharmas; all dharmas are equal to the scriptures. The Dao is equal to all scriptures; all scriptures are equal to the Dao. The Dao is equal to birth and death; birth and death are equal to the Dao. The Dao is equal to greed and desire; greed and desire are equal to the Dao. The Dao is equal to love and affection; love and affection are equal to the Dao. The Dao is equal to coming and going; coming and going are equal to the Dao. The Dao is equal to wealth and nobility; wealth and nobility are equal to the Dao. The Dao is equal to poverty and lowliness; poverty and lowliness are equal to the Dao. The Dao is equal to foolishness and wisdom; foolishness and wisdom are equal to the Dao. The Dao is equal to beasts; beasts are equal to the Dao. The Dao is equal to birds and insects; birds and insects are equal to the Dao. Thus, equality is without any equality. How then can dharmas have distinctions?"

Venerable Youth Shànmíng addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "If the Dao is equal to nothing, is this equality not a singular equality, or not?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "It is not a singular non-equality."

Shànmíng asked: "If it is not a singular non-equality, how can it be called the Dao?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "The non-Dao is the Dao."

Shànmíng asked: "If the non-Dao is the Dao, is it the true Dao?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "It is not the true Dao."

Shànmíng asked: "Why is it not true?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "All dharmas are non-dual, neither true nor conventional, neither great nor small, neither long nor short. Beings, benighted and obscured, like the sun and moon veiled, lie dormant, never rising—like the blind who do not see, like the deaf who do not hear."

Such a sutra as this is rarely heard even in billions of kalpas—how could mere tiles and shards comprehend it? Long ago, on Mount Lingjie, I expounded this sutra. At that time, the master of the assembly was named Dahui, who widely gathered disciples, drawing crowds from the four directions. Arriving at Mount Lingjie, they took their seats in order, and all were provided with clothing and food in abundance. Merit and virtue were universally bestowed, leaving none hungry or thirsty. Then the great earth of the ten directions trembled entirely, and lions and fierce beasts all came to guard and uphold it.

There was a worthy one named Facai, whose heart delighted in the Dao and virtue. His father was a king who forbade him, leaving him weeping in sorrow: "What sin have I committed that my heart’s aspiration remains unfulfilled? I only pray that the Heavenly Worthy’s sacred Dao may pity my foolish heart. Though I do not attain it in this life, may I in future lives encounter the Heavenly Worthy, be taught to leave the household life, and study the Great Vehicle Dao." After making this vow, he constantly practiced a heart of compassion, meditating on the Dao day and night. Now he has met me, who reveals and expounds the Great Vehicle, enabling him to cultivate the undefiled Dharma.

Let the Venerable Youth Shànmíng and all the great assembly know that the True Treasury Youth here today is none other than Facai of former days. Facai’s vow spanned countless kalpas before he could at last hear and see this. Know then that this sutra is most noble, its principles profound and far-reaching, difficult to encounter even briefly—how much more so for those of shallow understanding to believe and comprehend it.

Then the True Treasury Youth rose from his seat, bowed deeply, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "This humble one is fortunate to awaken to the Great Vehicle. Though in former days I dwelt among the deaf and common, my vow was never slight. At that time, my aspiration was unfulfilled, yet the descent of the Dao was without error. Now I have met the Heavenly Worthy, who reveals the Great Vehicle Dao, bestows the supreme medicine, awakens understanding of all dharmas, and enables me to fathom past causes, realize the unborn Dharma, and deeply reflect on my good fortune—so profound it cannot be described. I wonder, Heavenly Worthy, regarding the expedient means of this sutra and how later learners should practice it: is it to be selectively transmitted, or universally delivered?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Excellent, excellent! Your compassionate practice, self-cultivation and cultivation of others, bridges past and future, serving as a ladder and stepping-stone for the Dharma. Such merit is vast and boundless, beyond all praise. This Great Vehicle sutra encompasses all that is great and penetrates all that is subtle. It rescues those drowning in suffering and universally saves all beings—how could there be selective transmission?"

The True Treasury Youth bowed again and asked: "Yet all beings’ faith is unequal, each according to past causes, cultivating good deeds and accumulating merit over kalpas to attain the fruit of the Dao. If one attains the Dao without cultivating good, then there would be effect without cause, or cause without effect—fruit and karma would be inverted, so that those who cultivate good should fall into hell, while evildoers should ascend to heaven. Moreover, it is said that all beings are universally delivered, their drowning suffering rescued. If this is so, and beings do not cultivate, does the sutra itself deliver them, enabling them to attain the fruit of the Dao?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "The Great Vehicle is equal and universally saves all beings to the ends of empty space. It is like the sun and moon, which ride the heavens and universally illuminate—yet the blind do not see, not because the sun and moon fail to shine. It is like the great earth, which nurtures all conditions, so that whatever is sown bears fruit—yet the foolish do not sow, not because the earth fails to produce. It is like a loving mother who cherishes her child—yet if the child is unfilial, it is not because the mother’s love is lacking. Know that this sutra is likewise: all must make offerings, clear their eyes and vision. When the eyes and vision are pure and bright, one sees the original source, and the dust of delusion is forever extinguished. Thus, pure cause yields pure fruit; cause is fruit, and fruit is cause. Cause and fruit are of one form, equal and non-dual.

This non-duality is neither cause nor fruit, yet it is the fruit of the Dao;
neither high nor low, yet it is high and low;
neither long nor short, yet it is long and short;
neither seeing nor hearing, yet it is seeing and hearing;
neither fragrance nor flavor, yet it is fragrance and flavor;
neither wisdom nor virtue, yet it is wisdom and virtue;
neither sutra nor Dao, yet it is sutra and Dao;
neither mind nor thought, yet it is mind and thought.

Through such insight, one realizes the living Dharma, skillfully upholds and maintains it, and merit is fully perfected. You, disciples of this assembly, must diligently study and practice, cultivate the supreme Dao, and never heed perverse words or accept defiled karma. When illness comes, myriad afflictions arise; in an instant, life suddenly ends. Forever unaware, one remains deluded throughout life, revolving through the three evil destinies, forever parted from the good Dao."

Then the True Treasury Youth and all the four assemblies, having heard these words, rejoiced and praised:

"The Heavenly Worthy on Mount Lingjie,
Preaches the Dharma, teaching gods and humans.
Revealing the marks of all sutras,
The four assemblies all come seeking.
Merit universally bestowed,
Neither long nor short in cause.
The Three Clarities sever the four delusions,
Virtue and Dao renew with the sun.
The sutra spreads throughout the Dharma realm,
Its volumes pointing the way.
We, all disciples,
Are good neighbors to the Dao.
Severing all defilements forever,
Evil karma cannot invade.
Accumulating good, fearless power,
Naturally a forest of merit.
The Heavenly Worthy skillfully expounds,
Dispensing medicine that flows everywhere.
The foolish cannot drink,
The wise feast on sweet dew.
The deaf and blind do not see,
Skillful teaching remains ungrasped.
The Great Vehicle is inconceivable,
Serene and universally delivered."

Then the True Treasury Youth and all the four assemblies, having spoken this praise, found their merit vast and far-reaching, beyond all description: "We, all disciples, together praise the Dharma King, extolling the virtue of the Heavenly Worthy. Even if we spoke of it for kalpas, we could not exhaust it. Dare we ask the Heavenly Worthy: regarding the sequence of this precious sutra, the stages of merit and virtue—what comes first? For those who swiftly realize the fruit, which Dharma is easiest? We only pray that the Heavenly Worthy, in compassion, will explain the distinctions among the assembly, the difficult and easy to awaken, though our repeated requests may offend your august countenance."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "In ancient kalpas beyond measure, there was a sage named Xianling. He did not believe in the Great Vehicle, but constantly practiced the lesser path. He observed long fasts and ascetic practices, dwelling in the mountains and forests, consuming pine needles and herbs, studying the ways of other immortals..."

Through kalpas of toil and hardship, the Dao could not be ascended by stages, and liberation remained forever beyond reach. Though one might gain extended years and prolonged life, not all three blessings would necessarily follow—still one would sink and drown in suffering. The *True Treasury of the Great Vehicle* encompasses all without exception, penetrating even to the tip of a hair. Those who practice the inner practice awaken in but a moment. The various scriptures and their volumes reveal forms to the ordinary and foolish; their merit and conditions adapt to each region, guiding and enticing as needed.

Turn the mind inward in illumination, and the true path to the Dao-field appears. Cut off all signs of leakage—no before, no after, no inside, no outside, no stages, no ranks. Merit surges vast, weightier than the Dharma-realm. Within the Dharma-realm’s manifold regions, there is no inside, no outside, no seeing, no hearing, no thought, no conception—merit arises according to one’s portion. When merit is complete, there is no going out, no coming in, no departure, no arrival.

You, the four assemblies, must not doubt the merit of this precious sutra. There is no treasure without distinction; the depth or shallowness of the teaching’s traces is spread and arranged as it should be. Why is this so? Because the true nature of the Dharma is thus—it does not receive defilement. Without wisdom and understanding, the Dharma-nature remains obstructed. The six senses become stained, giving rise to the six dusts that do not cease. The mind-consciousness does not abide, thought after thought clashing. As habitual actions accumulate, one revolves through the five destinies. Afflictions, anxieties, and fears press upon the body; illness assails it. The bonds of affection between father and child snap at the end of life. The soul drifts and scatters, falling into the three evil destinies. Such suffering and pain are beyond conception.

Good men and women, practice diligently with vigor; do not grow lax. Each of you, arouse the good mind and cultivate the supreme Dao. When merit adorns you, the six senses remain unstained. When the six senses are unstained, the six dusts become pure. When the six dusts are pure, the six consciousnesses flow freely. When the six consciousnesses flow freely, wisdom is complete, and the fruit of the Dao is attained. Once the fruit of the Dao is attained, one gains a fearless mind, ultimate equality, and thorough understanding of all dharmas. One moves with ease and freedom, without residual sorrow, without residual joy, without residual pleasure, without residual suffering, without residual greed, without residual love, without residual vexation, without residual anger, without residual thought, without residual conception, without residual seeing, without residual hearing, without residual touch, without residual engagement, without residual grasping, without residual relinquishing, without residual increase, without residual念. One attains mastery over the Dharma, called the Forest of Merit—this is the true Dao.

Good men, you of the four assemblies, arouse the mind of the Great Vehicle, awaken to all residual principles, and constantly practice the four foundations of mindfulness. Deliver all beings, relieve those in poverty and distress. Your blessings and virtue will be immeasurable, beyond all description.

At that time, the Youth of the True Treasury and the four assemblies, hearing these words, marveled at what they had never before encountered. Joyfully they paid homage and offered this gatha:

The Dharma King’s wisdom and grace know no bounds,
Expounding the Dharma without end to liberate beings.
The lame, the hunchbacked, the deaf, the blind—all attain realization,
The five desires and four inversions lie level and at peace.
We, your followers, rejoice with gladness,
Awakening to the Great Vehicle without surfeit.
Birth and death, change and transformation—no turning or moving,
Drowning in waters that reach the heavens, yet unalarmed.
The Dharma King’s power is like a square inch,
Great wisdom and great practice equal the dew of life.
The Heavenly Worthy’s vast and far-reaching compassion,
Scatters fine dust, transforming it into sweet dew.
Beings receive its moisture yet remain unaware,
Lost on the path, committing evil, never awakening.
We, with skillful means and wisdom,
Each exhort and guide, spreading and transmitting it.
The sun of wisdom, the sound of wisdom—its tones never cease,
The foolish gradually become imbued, their faculties blessed.

That day, the Youth of the True Treasury and the four assemblies praised and recited the Heavenly Worthy’s virtues and powers, which pervade the Dharma without interruption, beyond all comparison. Having grasped the root of these virtues, they declared: such merit is inconceivable.

The Heavenly Worthy said: All dharmas are the Dharma-body of the three times, and the body possesses the wisdom-eye of the three times. Without the wisdom-eye, how could one discern and distinguish? Lacking discernment, one loses one’s original body, deluded about all dharmas—this is inversion. Once inversion is seen, afflictions arise. From afflictions, habitual actions form, and suffering and pain cut into the body. Birth and death revolve endlessly, with no liberation.

Good men, cultivate your actions with sincerity and care. Do not harbor dual minds, slander the worthy and good, turn from good to do evil, or wound others with double-tongued speech. Such karmic retribution brings suffering and poison difficult to endure.

The Youth of the True Treasury and the four assemblies, hearing this wondrous teaching, rejoiced immeasurably. They dared to ask the Heavenly Worthy: Is the wisdom-eye of the three times one that opens into three, or three that merge into one? If one becomes three, then three lack the one; if three become one, then one lacks the three. How can one possess the three wisdoms? If one has three, should one eye also have three bodies? Such are our doubts. We only pray that the Heavenly Worthy will clearly distinguish and explain.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Excellent, excellent—just as you have questioned and doubted. The dharmas are measureless, merit is measureless. Sometimes one becomes three, yet one and three have no substance; sometimes three become one, yet three and one have no name. Sometimes one eye forms countless shapes, sometimes one shape forms countless eyes. Such skillful means and merit are inconceivable.

What is called “one becoming three” is all for the sake of conditions, revealing the obstruction of ignorance. When the obstruction of the conditioned eye is extinguished, the three and the one are not real. Why is this so? It is essential to rely on this sutra. This sutra can open the wisdom-eye, for it is beneficial. All immortals and sages attain the fruit of the Dao through this sutra.

Good men and women, I cherish all beings as a mother loves her child. With earnest devotion, I transform, guide, and entice them. Thus I expound this sutra, making its true and essential meaning clear and easy to understand. If there are those who hear this sutra, believe in it with reverence, the divine youths and mighty good spirits will naturally protect them. At such a time, if a king or emperor upholds this sutra, no man or woman in the land will die prematurely. The nation will be wealthy, its people prosperous. War will not arise, winds and rains will come in due season, and all will live in peace. Know that this sutra possesses great spiritual power. Its merit is vast and far-reaching, beyond all comparison.

The Heavenly Worthy then spoke these verses:

The Great Vehicle’s teaching of equality
Universally transforms all beings.
It is neither external nor internal—
Its virtue lies in perfect evenness.
Fools do not believe in the Dharma,
While the wise are awestruck upon seeing it.
Those who awaken to the truth of the Real Treasury
Naturally realize the Dharma-realm.

I am not form or appearance;
The nature of Dharma is utterly nameless.
You vainly recite and chant,
For the mind’s understanding cannot fathom it.

When the Heavenly Worthy had finished speaking these verses, he addressed the four assemblies, the mighty spirit-kings, the vajra-lions, and the virtuous guardians, urging them to uphold and practice the true Dharma.

At that time, the Youth of the Real Treasury and the four assemblies, upon hearing these wondrous words, experienced divine awakening and understanding. With joy, they received and upheld them, each guarding their original unity and cultivating the supreme Dao.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Having attained the fruit of the Dao, one abides in stillness, free from self. This is ultimate purity. Such purity and subtlety give rise to all dharmas. Each dharma attains its own arising, and in this arising, there is neither cessation nor birth, neither birth nor cessation. The autonomous Dharma-king is replete with virtue.

All beings, benighted and unenlightened, obstruct their six senses. Their faculties become defiled, and in their defilement, they are deluded. This delusion is transmitted through mutual confusion, so they fail to awaken. They revolve through the five destinies and do not believe in the Great Vehicle. Why is this? All beings delight in conditioned pleasures—how could they relinquish them? Even if they were to abandon existence, they would grasp at emptiness. Grasping at emptiness as emptiness, emptiness does not depart from existence, nor existence from emptiness. The two names—emptiness and existence—strike and bind the body with karma. How then can one escape and transcend, entering the source of the Dao?

The Youth of the Real Treasury then respectfully asked the Heavenly Worthy: Are the two names—emptiness and existence—the essence of the Dao? Are they true emptiness? Are they the wondrous principle? Are they purity? Are they the ultimate? Are they quiescence?

The Heavenly Worthy replied: Excellent, excellent! Your question is most timely. The two names—emptiness and existence—though they pertain to the fruit of the Dao, are ultimately true emptiness. Beings, failing to understand, cling to existence and become attached, and thus it is not the fruit of the Dao. Why is this? All beings are ultimately pure, neither empty nor existent, neither long nor short. If one grasps at appearances, one harms the true and real, deviates from the original ground, and thus it is not the fruit of the Dao. Why is this? Beings are neither empty nor existent—how then could they know emptiness and existence? How could they know the nature of the Dao? How could they know the true Dharma? How could they know the ultimate?

The Youth of the Real Treasury and the four assemblies, having heard this wondrous Dharma, each reflected inwardly. They bowed their heads and withdrew.

Thus concludes *Fascicle Four of the Supreme, Esoteric, Real Treasury Sutra*.
*Fascicle Five of the Supreme, Esoteric, Real Treasury Sutra* begins.

**The Universal Illumination Chapter**

At that time, the Primordial Celestial Venerable roamed the land of Xina, the Great Blessing Hall, his form without fixed appearance—now hidden, now manifest, now coarse, now subtle—abiding at ease and free upon Lingjie Mountain. That mountain was vast and towering, pervading the Dharma Realm, its forests and thickets dense and tangled. Tigers, wolves, lions, venomous insects, and fierce beasts harmed and devoured living beings.

Within the mountain, there were also reclusive sages who meditated and cultivated the Dao, studying the Great Vehicle’s practices with unwavering resolve. They guarded the city of the mind and crushed the demonic thieves. Moreover, thirty-six thousand beings there pursued their karmic conditions, each following different paths.

The Primordial Celestial Venerable, amidst the great assembly, suddenly transformed his body and entered a jeweled pearl, motionless and silent. The four assemblies were startled, not knowing where he had gone. For seven days and nights, his light and form vanished. The fierce beasts and venomous creatures grew even more rampant, and the men and women of the land wailed to the heavens and knocked their heads upon the earth, finding no refuge.

Then, the Youth of the Real Treasury, serene in meditation amidst the great assembly, prostrated himself upon the ground and entreated the Celestial Venerable, beseeching him to save all beings and, in his great compassion, to reappear. Before his plea was fully uttered, suddenly a radiant light shone from the mountain, illuminating the ten directions and the boundless worlds. Even the suffering beings in hell were all liberated.

At that moment, the Celestial Venerable sat upon his original subtle flower, motionless and composed, his spirit at peace, his face smiling, his virtue and light resplendent. The fierce beasts and venomous creatures were all subdued.

Then the Celestial Venerable addressed the Youth of the Real Treasury: "You should now proclaim to the great assembly the profound and supreme wondrous Dharma of the Real Treasury, so that all beings may awaken to the nature of afflictions, comprehend the mind of emptiness and existence, purify the five emotions, and realize that birth and death are of one nature, that being and non-being are equal."

The Youth of the Real Treasury, empowered by the Celestial Venerable, slowly ascended into the void, transforming and appearing at will. Amidst the great assembly, he manifested the light of wisdom and expounded the principle of non-arising. The light of wisdom shone universally, penetrating all things—nothing vast was unilluminated, nothing minute was unentered. It surpassed the light of a hundred thousand suns and moons, and according to the aspirations of all beings, they attained boundless worlds. Those with karmic affinity and those without, all were fully provided for. Those with deep faith came to listen, and the four assemblies gathered in great numbers.

The Celestial Venerable transformed into a great radiant light, cool and wondrous, revealing the nature of beings as tranquil and unconditioned, without arising, without ceasing, without going, without coming. Those with karmic affinity all understood the true Dharma, awakened in stillness, severed the bonds of conditioned thought, and ceased all discrimination.

Why is this? Because the Dao is non-dual. Birth and death are non-dual, going and coming are non-dual, foolishness and wisdom are non-dual, high and low are non-dual, grasping and relinquishing are non-dual. Beings, deluded, provisionally speak of causes and conditions to guide and instruct the lost, like leading one by the hand along a railing.

The faculties of beings vary in countless ways. Briefly speaking, their paths differ and can be divided into three grades. The superior-grade beings comprehend the nature of form, neither entering nor departing from virtue and the Dao, neither arising from nor passing into birth and death. They transcend the boundaries of virtue and the Dao, of birth and death, of self and others, of dust and defilement, of karmic actions.

The middle-grade beings renounce birth and death and seek virtue and the Dao. They have exit and entry, boundaries of virtue and the Dao, of birth and death, of self and others, of dust and defilement, of karmic actions.

The lower-grade beings are heavily obscured by ignorance, unaware and unknowing, sinking in the sea of suffering, lost in an endless dark night with no hope of escape.

All in the four great assemblies and the men and women present, listen carefully: contemplate whence this light of wisdom arises. Examine its coming and going—it is neither internal nor external, profoundly clear and pure, the ultimate Dao-ground, a single radiant light, equal and non-dual.

Those who enter wisdom through the eye comprehend the wondrous principle of form. Those who enter wisdom through the ear comprehend the wondrous sound. Those who enter wisdom through the nose comprehend the wondrous fragrance. Those who enter wisdom through the tongue comprehend the wondrous taste. Those who enter wisdom through the body comprehend the wondrous body. Those who enter wisdom through the mind comprehend the wondrous mind. All dharmas are thus pervaded and entered.

Evil ghosts, venomous creatures, those with perverse views, beings in hell, hungry ghosts, jailers, and animals—all generated wholesome minds and partook of the sweet dew medicine.

The good men and women, deeply entering the Dharma-nature, abided in unconditioned freedom. They skillfully examined the source of the mind, which was bright and unobstructed. They studied the great expedient means, neither abandoning conditioned action nor dwelling in the unconditioned. Their virtues were complete, and they attained the supreme Dao.

The great assembly was filled with doubt. A youth named Good Sound asked: "I venture to ask the Youth of the Real Treasury: you have revealed the virtues of the Celestial Venerable and proclaimed the light of wisdom, which universally pervades all. Is this a single light encompassing all, or does each being possess this light?

If it is a single light that pervades all, then it comes from without, and all beings receive it from outside, which would make it impermanent. If each being possesses it individually, then why is it also said that the light of wisdom universally pervades all? We are perplexed by this. We only wish for you to resolve it."

The Youth of the Real Treasury replied: "All of you in the great assembly, listen clearly. Since time without beginning, I have vowed to practice the Great Vehicle. Only now have I heard and understood the causes and conditions, recognizing the retributions of karma.

You ask whether beings receiving it from without makes it impermanent, and if each being possesses it individually, why is it also said that the light of wisdom universally pervades all. The light I manifest nourishes all beings. The great wisdom-light of the Celestial Venerable is neither internal nor external, neither long nor short, neither manifest nor hidden. It wondrously forges all beings, and all benefit universally.

Those who receive its benefits—all beings—are not the slightest bit different from the Celestial Venerable. How then could there be an external entry that is impermanent? How could there be a light that can be manifested?

You further ask: if there is no difference, then they are the Celestial Venerable. Why then are there deluded beings? Why do beings suffer? Why do beings cultivate the Dao?

I say to you: you are gradually sinking into delusion and raising such objections."

All sentient beings who experience suffering and joy share the same source of wisdom, differing not even a hair’s breadth from the Celestial Venerable. You should practice the Six Practices to penetrate the Way of the Six Harmonies.

What are the Six Harmonies?
The eye harmonizes with form, yet the mind does not cling to form—by not clinging to form, one forgets form.
The ear harmonizes with sound, yet the mind does not cling to sound—by not clinging to sound, one forgets sound.
The nose harmonizes with fragrance, yet the mind does not cling to fragrance—by not clinging to fragrance, one forgets fragrance.
The mouth harmonizes with flavor, yet the mind does not cling to flavor—by not clinging to flavor, one forgets flavor.
The body harmonizes with touch, yet the mind does not cling to touch—by not clinging to touch, one forgets touch.

In this way, with every step, coming and going remain constant; grasping and releasing remain constant; sitting and lying remain constant; movement and stillness remain constant—this is true constancy. The fortress of the mind stands firm, cutting off all external thieves. The hordes of demons and their followers are all ground to nothingness. The Dharma King is free, like a luminous pearl, transparent within and without. Seeing the Dharma clearly and purely, unstained by dust or filth, one enters the Gate of the One Mark—this is called the Great Dao, the Mother of Dharma, who gives birth to all dharmas. All dharmas possess the thirty-two marks and eighty-one excellences, adorning the radiant form, replete with merit and virtue.

If there are good men and women who, with tranquil minds, direct their thoughts single-mindedly, ever practicing loving-kindness, neither covetous nor desirous, they overturn the six thieves, enter the city of the five penetrations, shatter the three armies, and render the four fortresses unassailable. They gain the power of fearlessness, and afflictions do not arise; bonds of love and attachment are forever severed.

The assembly of Good Sound and others rejoiced and exclaimed: "Excellent! Excellent! True Treasury Youth has expounded the wondrous meaning, broadly revealed the causes and conditions, opened the gate of the Great Vehicle, rescued those drowning in suffering, and served as the ladder and bridge of the Dharma."

The Celestial Venerable addressed the assembly: "Good Sound Bodhisattva, let none of you doubt True Treasury Youth. This one, for immeasurable kalpas, has aroused the aspiration for the Dao, accumulating vast and boundless merit and virtue. Now, for your sake, I shall broadly expound the profound mind and secret practices: return to guard the old fortress, patrolling day and night, allowing no breaches or leaks. All the holy ones constantly practice this Dharma. This Dharma is most wondrous, the root of all practices. Through it, I attained the Dao and awakened. Let none of you, my assembly, grow lax. Diligently practice this practice, subduing the six gates. The Dharma has no fixed form; do not cling to it as

"All of you, my assembly, diligently practice with vigor, taking but a single word of mine, and let no other thoughts arise. Why is this so? The Dharma admits no duality of thought.

Know this: within the Three Realms, sentient beings with outflows, lacking skillful means and wisdom, are scorched by the fires of affliction, blazing fiercely and difficult to extinguish. Though taught in myriad ways, they never awaken or comprehend.

Good sons, with right mindfulness, contemplate and penetrate the nature of affliction. When affliction is purified, the wisdom-eye is purified; when the wisdom-eye is purified, the power of skillful means is attained; with the power of skillful means, the six consciousnesses constantly transform; when the six consciousnesses constantly transform, there is no reception, no defilement, no bondage, no liberation. Attaining mastery over the Dharma, one is called the Dharma King.

True Treasury Youth then addressed the Celestial Venerable: 'Today, the great assembly, by the majestic countenance of the Dharma, has gained the wisdom of skillful means, awakened to the understanding of sentient beings, and penetrated the nature of all faculties, entering the gate of true reality. The Celestial Venerable’s skillful exposition has perfectly met the conditions, making the Dharma easy to comprehend. Yet we wonder: in the future, what Dharma should sentient beings receive and uphold? What Dharma should they practice? Which Dharma is easy to receive, and which is easy to practice? Which is difficult to receive, and which is difficult to practice?'

The Celestial Venerable replied: 'Excellent, excellent! Your great compassion seeks benefit for sentient beings. Future beings will lack the wisdom-eye. Listen carefully, contemplate well, and bear this in mind. I shall now expound for you the *True Treasury Sutra*, which is neither arising nor ceasing. Future sentient beings, by relying on the meaning of this text, will naturally attain understanding.

I reveal a single word—neither past, nor future, nor present; neither internal nor external; neither long nor short. This single word is easy to receive and easy to practice, the foremost among all contemplative methods and manifold skillful means. This contemplation begins with counting the breaths.

The mind-Dharma does not abide; because the Dharma does not abide, there is no fixed Dharma; because there is no fixed Dharma, the wisdom of seeing the Dao arises. One who attains the wisdom of seeing the Dao is the original self, neither arising nor ceasing.

Furthermore, there are three kinds of adorned wisdom that enter the supernatural powers of the Dharma: first, attachment; second, anger; third, delusion. These three Dharmas are the forerunners of practice and the grounds of realizing the Dao. Why is this so? Because the Dharma is free from attachment, the nature of attachment is extinguished; because the Dharma is free from anger, the nature of anger is purified; because the Dharma is free from delusion, the nature of delusion is liberated. One who realizes this nature enters the gate of the Three Treasures, penetrates the Dharma of the True Treasury, and is called the Great Dharma King, fully endowed with all virtues.'

At that time, Good Sound Youth and the great assembly, having heard this wondrous Dharma, each reflected: 'What we have never heard before, we hear today; what we have never seen before, we see today.' The profound Dharma treasury of the sages of the ten directions is inconceivable, all made accessible by the Celestial Venerable’s great compassion, which opens the essential gate, enabling all to comprehend with ease.

Then Good Sound Youth and the great assembly, rejoicing, bowed their heads and offered this verse:

*The Dharma King’s Dharma drum resounds boundlessly,
The four demons and eight thieves are all subdued.
We, our assembly, all awaken with ease,
All Dharmas ultimately have no distinction.*

*The lamp of wisdom, the torch of wisdom, ever bright,
Illumining all beings without omission.
The Great Vehicle’s great practice knows no bounds,
The wheel of Dharma’s voice skillfully expounded.*

*Beings and their karmas, karmas intimately linked,
The net of consciousness, lost on the path, without reality.
The Celestial Venerable’s divine power and virtue protect and sustain,
Skillfully teaching the deluded to abandon their coarse nature.*

*Greed, anger, attachment—seeking nothing,
Transformed into the True Treasury, ever joyful.
Bowing in reverence, with minds of right mindfulness,
We constantly practice offerings without fail.*

Then the Celestial Venerable addressed the great assembly: 'Good Sound Youth, excellent, excellent! You have praised the wondrous *True Treasury Sutra* and exhorted the assembly to diligently cultivate and practice, turning inward to contemplate the light of wisdom, adorning the six practices, quieting the mechanisms of the world, and preventing the arising of attachments and bonds. The mind’s wisdom becomes clear and bright. Why is this so? Because the nature of the Dharma is pure, the nature of affliction is pure, and the nature of desire is pure.

Furthermore, there are good sons and daughters who, though they leave the household life and study the practices of the Lesser Vehicle, sit in stillness without activity, eat but one meal a day, and teach sentient beings to follow their ways. They exalt themselves and belittle others, calling themselves 'sentient beings' rather than 'good persons,' and are not my disciples, nor am I their teacher. They exhaust themselves in vain, never attaining the Dao.

In kalpas past and immeasurable, I too was like this. I practiced austerities with diligence, secluding myself in the mountains and forests, seeking the wondrous fruit of the Dao. After countless kalpas of toil, the Dao remained unattainable. Later, I encountered an unsurpassed venerable teacher, a great good-knowing advisor, who resolved my doubts, guided my deluded mind onto the path, entered the five uninterrupted hells, slew the five demon-thieves, guarded the One without change, and attained spiritual freedom. With right mindfulness and contemplation, I awakened to the unsurpassed Dao.

At that time, thirty-six thousand beings followed me to learn the Dao. Emerging from the city of discrimination, they realized the principle of no-form, sat upon the lion’s throne, proclaimed the wondrous Dharma, broadly saved sentient beings, and universally covered them with compassion.

All of you, my assembly, subdue all appearances, seek good-knowing advisors, cultivate equality and uprightness, understand the right causes of the world, rouse sentient beings, cause the sprouts of Dharma to grow, open the wisdom-eye, enter the gate of skillful means, skillfully accumulate deep wisdom, and accomplish the unsurpassed Dao.

Furthermore, all Dharmas are like reflections in a mirror—neither empty nor existent, ultimately without self. Furthermore, the form and mind of sentient beings are like reflections in a mirror—neither empty nor existent, ultimately pure. Furthermore, the traces of the Three Vehicles’ teachings are like reflections in a mirror—neither empty nor existent, ultimately liberated. Furthermore, the three karmas of sentient beings are like reflections in a mirror—neither empty nor existent, ultimately quiescent.

Good sons, know that this sutra is the Great Vehicle, free from outflows. It is not a teaching that obscures reality, nor is it false or provisional. It reveals the nature of all Dharmas and enters the gate of true reality, foremost among all sutras.

Furthermore, in kalpas past, there were five impoverished men who constantly harbored arrogance and did not believe in the sutras and Dharma. Upon hearing this Great Vehicle, they generated slander, extinguished the gate of the Three Treasures, and did not believe that sentient beings possess the true nature of the Dao, nor that sentient beings possess the wondrous Dharma of the sutras. They did not believe that sentient beings are without self and quiescent, nor that sentient beings are equal in the Great Vehicle, nor that sentient beings are neither arising nor ceasing. They did not believe that the minds of sentient beings are vast as the sea, nor that sentient beings are equal to the Celestial Venerable’s practices, nor that sentient beings are equal to all sages and worthies, nor that sentient beings are great aggregates of emptiness.'"

Such disbelief immediately brings grave illness, entering the dark prison in life, entering the dark prison in death, entering the dark prison in movement, entering the dark prison in stillness, entering the dark prison in sitting, entering the dark prison in lying down, entering the dark prison in eating, entering the dark prison in rest. All good men and women, cease such reflections and do not generate disbelief. If one fails to comprehend yet maintains a straightforward mind, refraining from slander, this person gains boundless merit and virtue, with blessings vast and far-reaching. Why is this so? Because the Dharma is without form, the Dharma is without fixation, the Dharma is liberation.

Know that the Dao-ground of straightforward mind does not destroy all dharmas but enters wondrous quiescence; does not destroy birth-and-death but enters true suchness; does not destroy grasping-and-rejecting but enters all wisdom; does not destroy hatred-and-delusion but enters all liberation; does not destroy greed-and-desire but enters all Dharma-treasures; does not destroy right-and-wrong but enters all correct paths; does not destroy sounds-and-forms but enters all fields of merit; does not destroy the six senses but enters all that is untainted; does not destroy the five aggregates but enters great wisdom; does not destroy the four elements but enters all spiritual penetrations. This Dharma is subtle and wondrous—even if expounded for kalpas without end, it could not be exhausted. If there are sentient beings who readily awaken, a mere half-word suffices to directly realize the Great Vehicle and comprehend the supreme Dao. Even if the Dharma were preached as numerous as grains of sand, sentient beings lost in darkness would still fail to understand. The teachings are likewise immeasurable—how much more so for good men? If one has faith, receives, upholds, reads, and recites this sutra, expounds and makes offerings to it, skillfully dissolves the mind’s attachments, and washes away the dust of the heart, the merit and virtue will be vast and far-reaching, beyond conception.

At that time, there was a king named Great Penetration, who deeply believed in the Dao and virtue, constantly practiced reverence, received and upheld the True Treasury Sutra, and propagated it throughout his realm. The ministers, their descendants, and all the people of the land likewise received and upheld this sutra. In that era, the kingdom prospered, the people thrived, men and women rejoiced, lifespans were long, and none suffered premature death. Know that the majestic power and profound virtue of this sutra are such that none attain the Dao without it. This sutra is the most venerable and precious, opening eyes and ears; it is the boat and ferry of the Dharma, rescuing those drowning in suffering; the ladder and stairway of the Dharma, transcending the five sufferings; the father and mother of the Dharma, universally liberating sentient beings; the very body of the Dharma, granting complete freedom. Why is this so? Because all the sages of the ten directions protect and uphold it, employing skillful means to subdue demons and reveal the subtle and wondrous medicine.

Then the Youth True Treasury addressed Good Sound and the assembly: "You, the great assembly, on Spirit Understanding Mountain, heard the Celestial Venerable speak of a luminous pearl within this mountain—radiant and pure, neither external nor internal, neither high nor low, revolving and coming and going, yet utterly still and unmoving. Did you, the fourfold assembly, see this pearl?" Good Sound and the assembly exclaimed: "Excellent! Excellent! We, your disciples, have sought the Dao for kalpas without number. Though we heard of this luminous pearl in this mountain, we have never beheld it. We only pray that the Great Being, by the power of the Celestial Venerable, may reveal the luminous pearl and clearly confirm its reality." The Great Being True Treasury addressed those who had come: "Each of you turn and look back, prostrate yourselves, and contemplate deeply—the luminous pearl will manifest of itself." Having spoken these words, in an instant, light illuminated within and without. Each was lost on their path, wild and deranged, losing their nature. Yet each saw themselves, their traces cut off without origin, alone and liberated, returning home, naturally awakening, and clearly recognizing that the precious pearl cannot be revealed by proclamation.

Then the Celestial Venerable, immeasurably joyful, spoke these verses:

I expound the Great Vehicle’s essence,
Discerning and revealing all marks,
Skillfully guiding sentient beings—
The jewel’s light is boundless.

The wise understand clearly,
While fools slander of themselves.
I reveal the True Treasury Sutra,
Washing away the obstructions of ignorance.

You, all, cultivate well,
Nurturing within a single word.
All dharmas lack fixed form,
Like reflections in a mirror.

The precious pearl is neither within nor without,
Yet with a darkened mind, the inner spirit shines.
Virtue and merit pervade the heavens,
The Great Vehicle is without partiality.

The Dao of all sages in the ten directions
Receives and upholds the True Treasury Sutra.
Ever practicing without laxity,
They attain the supreme Venerable One.

Now I speak a parable,
Revealing the provisional to illuminate the real.
Sentient beings, not believing in the Dao,
Are bound by karmic causes of affection and habit.

Each cultivates skillful wisdom,
Seeking within the five aggregates.

At that time, the Most Venerable Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning expounded half a verse upon Spirit-Solution Mountain, addressing all men and women: "By well establishing the field of merit, practicing offerings and cultivation, one attains liberation without departing from body and mind. Those who attain liberation dwell in the tranquil Dao-ground, enter the true seal of dharma, realize the causes of the three times, and accomplish the supreme fruit."

Again, he addressed the Youth of Auspicious Sound: "All sentient beings—liberated in mind-nature, liberated in bodily form. The mind becomes verbal teaching; the body becomes written script. Chasing words and pursuing characters, one forgets the traces of teaching; awakening to these words, one enters the gate of liberation and realizes the supreme Dao."

The Youth of Auspicious Sound respectfully inquired of the Celestial Worthy: "I do not understand why the minds of sentient beings become verbal teaching and their bodies become written script. The minds of sentient beings are deluded minds; their bodies are nets of darkness. How can they be instructed to learn from their deluded minds and seek the nets of darkness? If seeking the nets of darkness leads to the attainment of the Dao, then since sentient beings’ deluded minds do not know how to learn, should they not also attain the Dao? Yet those who do not learn do not attain the Dao. If they learn from the deluded mind, they still do not attain the Dao. Why is this? Learning delusion through delusion, the nature of wisdom does not arise—how then can the Dao be attained? The deluded minds of sentient beings, deluded and without learning, also do not attain the Dao. It is like fire within wood: fire does not arise on its own but must rely on human effort to be kindled. The deluded minds of sentient beings must rely on a guiding master to attain awakening and understanding. I only hope the Dharma Master will take pity on us and explain this."

The Celestial Worthy said: "Excellent, excellent! I shall explain it to you. All dharmas are pure, neither arising nor ceasing—how then can there be sentient beings who attain the Dao? How can there be sentient beings who lose the Dao? How can there be sentient beings enmeshed in the net of delusion who learn and attain the Dao? How can there be sentient beings with deluded minds who do not learn yet attain the Dao? Dharmas have no inherent nature; ultimately, there is no self—how can there be distinctions among sentient beings to raise such questions? I speak of words: when their nature is apart, they are thus. [Not liberated in nature, provisionally guiding and enticing, enabling recognition of words; when nature is apart, they are thus,] liberated in dharma-nature, provisionally guiding and enticing, enabling recognition of the true sound. Those who realize the sound of dharma realize that there is no dharma to be realized, no dharma to be cultivated, no dharma to be learned, no dharma to be practiced, no dharma to be received—ultimately pure, merged and not one.

The listeners of the Two Vehicles, upon hearing these words, were startled and terrified, their bodies left without place to stand. At that time, the assembly led by Auspicious Sound suddenly understood, awakening to the great vehicle’s teaching, equal and without duality. They bowed in reverence, forgetting their forms, and departed.

Thus concludes *Fascicle Five of the Supreme Esoteric True Treasury Sutra*.

*Fascicle Six of the Supreme Esoteric True Treasury Sutra: "Manifesting Meritorious Virtues"*

At that time, the youth Auspicious Sound and the assembly of immortals, dwelling in the Fragrant Grove Park, approached the Heavenly Worthy to study the Great Vehicle. Thereupon, they became perplexed and inquired: "We venture to ask—all sentient beings universally receive the light, yet why do the benefits differ, and their rebirths vary? If all equally receive it, their faculties and capacities should be the same, and there should be no difficulty or ease in awakening. If they are not equal, then the luminous wisdom is not all-pervading, and the Heavenly Worthy’s teaching is partial."

They further asked: "Sentient beings necessarily require this sutra to attain the Dao. Without this sutra, there is ultimately no liberation."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Excellent, excellent! As you have asked—emptiness questioning emptiness, emptiness has nothing to question. What I answer is emptiness answering emptiness, emptiness has nothing to answer. All sentient beings differ in kind and distinction, their faculties unequal. Because they are unequal, they are empty; emptiness has nothing equal. Because there is nothing equal, this is called liberation. Sentient beings, deluded and unaware, all possess the light of wisdom, yet their eyes do not perceive it. Their original nature is pure, but their minds and consciousness are benighted. They necessarily require this sutra to open their ears and eyes. When ears and eyes are clear and pure, they illumine the root of all dharmas, without distinction or difference. You should know that all sentient beings equally partake of the source of the Dao; their awakening and understanding merely differ in sequence. It is like a dark pearl lost in the Red River—though sought in myriad ways, it cannot be obtained. You should know that the original nature of sentient beings is empty and quiescent, neither empty nor existent, neither internal nor external. Those who seek with intention can never obtain it; those who do not seek with intention also cannot obtain it. It necessarily requires skillful means, artfully accumulating the source of wisdom, to naturally attain the fruit.

"If one claims that I expound the Dharma, this slanders the true Dharma and destroys wholesome roots. You should know that what is spoken is not speech, neither speech nor non-speech—equal and of one form, without any form whatsoever.

"Good sons, you inwardly cultivate stillness and illumination, yet cling to emptiness and existence. Heaven and earth take form, the Dao and virtue become scripture. The wise awaken to it, the benevolent practice it. They see what is not seen, do not see what is seen; know what is not known, do not know what is known. They reverse common perception, reverse common hearing. All conditioned and unconditioned dharmas are entirely reversed. Those who practice thus embody the Great Vehicle and realize meritorious virtues."

Upon hearing this, the youth Auspicious Sound and the great assembly were startled in mind, bewildered and terrified, losing their bearings. They inquired: "We venture to ask—if all dharmas are ultimately neither empty nor existent, how can there be a Dharma that, when reversed, allows entry into the Great Vehicle? If there is no Dharma, how can one realize meritorious virtues?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "What I speak is a single word, endlessly turning without limit. Sentient beings, deluded by falsity, forget existence and are blind to non-existence. Clinging to falsity, they become confused; falsity gives rise to inverted delusion. What I call ‘reversal’ is to realize that falsity is without falsity, that falsely existent is not existent, that falsely non-existent is not non-existent. Those who contemplate thus return to the root. They enter the Great Vehicle and realize meritorious virtues."

They further asked: "Sentient beings are deluded by falsity, and falsity is itself without Dharma. How can what is without Dharma be reversed? If there is no Dharma to reverse, how can there be a Great Vehicle to enter? How can there be meritorious virtues to realize?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "So it is, so it is! All dharmas are liberation. To realize the principle of liberation is to enter the Great Vehicle and realize meritorious virtues."

They again asked: "If all dharmas are liberation, then to enter the Great Vehicle and realize meritorious virtues is merely to be called such. All sentient beings, without cultivation or study, are called the Great Vehicle and realize meritorious virtues. Birds, beasts, and杂类, without cultivation or study, are called the Great Vehicle and realize meritorious virtues. All dharmas whatsoever are called the Great Vehicle and realize meritorious virtues. Why then are there sentient beings deluded by falsity? Why are there sentient beings with inverted views? Why are there sentient beings with grasping and rejecting? Why are there sentient beings with coming and going? Why are there distinctions among sentient beings? Why are there immortals and sages who transform and liberate?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "So it is, so it is! As I have said, all dharmas are perfectly contained in a single word. If there were a single Dharma not endowed with great wisdom and meritorious virtues, this would slander all dharmas and destroy the Great Vehicle. Why? All sentient beings, in walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, all enter the Great Vehicle and realize meritorious virtues. The five aggregates and six senses all enter the Great Vehicle and realize meritorious virtues. Greed, delusion, grasping, and rejecting all enter the Great Vehicle and realize meritorious virtues. All conditioned and unconditioned dharmas all enter the Great Vehicle and realize meritorious virtues.

"The Great Vehicle that is spoken of is not the Great Vehicle—this is called the Great Vehicle. The meritorious virtues that are spoken of are not meritorious virtues—this is called meritorious virtues. All dharmas are subtle and wondrous, free and unconditioned. All speech is merely names and designations, not the true Dao. Those who awaken to this principle gain the power of fearlessness. Their minds accord with the virtue of Heaven, the virtue of Earth, the virtue of sages, the virtue of the sun and moon, the virtue of the stars and constellations, the virtue of the myriad kinds. All dharmas accord with virtue, without harming the nature of beings—this is called the ultimate meritorious virtue of the Great Vehicle.

"Sentient beings, deluded by falsity, falsely receive the manifold existences and lose the power of meritorious virtues. It is like a painter who depicts forms that are not true forms. Or like an echo, which is not a true sound. You should know that all dharmas are like illusions, like transformations—neither empty nor existent. Sentient beings, inverted in delusion, falsely receive afflictions. Afflictions falsely arise, falsely become suffering. Separation from loved ones, endless suffering—yet in an instant, all vanishes without trace. The wandering soul and consciousness drift, increasing suffering and affliction.

"Good sons, do not generate disbelief and lose the power of loving-kindness. I speak to you thus: the great person can endure the world’s humiliation; the person of great virtue can endure the world’s evil. Why? The greatly awakened, free from falsity, can endure humiliation and can endure evil. What they endure is all meritorious virtue, adorned with the majesty of great wisdom and blessings, perfectly and completely achieved."

Furthermore, by being without action (wuwei), it can give birth and nurture growth; by being empty and nonexistent, it can embody and traverse; by being tranquil and detached, it can receive and expand; by being still and silent, it can resound and conceal; by being serene and indifferent, it can gather and disperse; by being pure and undefiled, it can spiritually manifest and radiate light; by being sincere and earnest, it can attain and follow; by being harmonious and balanced, it can transform and unite.

Know that the esoteric true treasury is foremost among all sutras. Through non-action, one nurtures nature; through emptiness and nonexistence, one preserves life; through tranquility and detachment, one secures the body; through stillness and silence, one attains glory. Through serenity and indifference, one delights the will; through purity and clarity, one pacifies the mind; through sincerity and earnestness, one guards integrity; through harmony and balance, one preserves the spirit.

Plants and trees grow from the earth and die when separated from it; fish and turtles live in water and die when removed from it; humans live by qi and die when deprived of it. The sage cherishes qi and guards essence, regarding them as treasures of the body. Above, there is nothing to point to; below, nothing to measure. The mind holds no thoughts, and the intent flows like water.

Good sons, know that the inherent nature of all dharmas is serene and indifferent, all entering the Great Vehicle. Sentient beings, deluded and confused, fail to comprehend the essence of life, losing the path of the Great Vehicle. Through countless kalpas, they wander in ignorance. You, the assembly, each awaken through conditions and transformations—your merit and virtue are profound, beyond measure.

At that time, the Youth of Auspicious Sound and the great assembly rejoiced immeasurably, all generating wholesome minds, and spoke in verse:

The Heavenly Worthy reveals virtues,
Subtle and wondrous, beyond fathoming.
Bestowing and expanding throughout the Dharma Realm,
Lush as a fragrant garden grove.
The wise skillfully enter,
Cultivating good causes through expedient means.
The foolish, long deluded,
Dwell near loss and separation.
We now generate faith and practice,
Together studying the ferry of the Great Vehicle.
The Dharma King, sovereign and free,
Liberation intimately close.
The Great Vehicle’s path of equality
Saves and ferries gods and humans.
With minds obscured, naturally aligned,
The heart’s inch follows daily renewal.

At that time, the Youth of Auspicious Sound and the fourfold assembly spoke this verse in praise of the Heavenly Worthy, extolling virtues and manifesting merit to save and ferry sentient beings. The merit spoken of is not merit—it is called merit.

Each awakened to see a single red pearl, neither inside nor outside, suspended in empty space, its radiant light shining brilliantly, illuminating all realms. Without large or small, all were of one kind. Together they entered the pearl, neither arising nor ceasing. In an instant, it suddenly vanished. The fourfold assembly, bewildered, knew not where it had gone. Each looked to themselves but found nothing. In the fleeting moment, the Dharma Realm was clearly present within the jewel. The fourfold assembly gazed again but found nothing. Neither empty nor existent, neither long nor short, neither subtle nor coarse, neither vast nor narrow—detached from all characteristics, all characteristics detached.

The Dharma Realm spoken of is not the Dharma Realm, yet it is the Dharma Realm, which is the jewel. The jewel spoken of is not the jewel, yet it is the jewel, which is the Dharma Realm. Know that the jewel does not depart from the Dharma Realm, nor does it reside within or without. Neither inside nor outside, neither not inside nor not outside—beyond words and speech, cutting off all outflows.

Such merit and virtue are subtle, profound, and far-reaching, beyond description.

**Manifesting the Precepts and Practices**

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning addressed the fourfold assembly: All sentient beings, attached to conditioned existence, delight in life and fear death. Though they seek life, they create the karma of death. Without upholding precepts and practices, even if long-lived, they are no different from an old tree—what distinction is there? If one upholds precepts and practices, upon death, they may ascend to heavenly offices or attain the freedom of immortality. Though one may hold the rank of king or lord, without upholding precepts, death brings grave offenses, offering no benefit to the soul. The soul suffers unbearably.

Good sons, you should reflect: diligently uphold precepts and practice the Way with a straightforward mind. I tell you, nothing in the world endures forever. There is birth and death, success and failure. The sun rises and sets; the moon wanes and waxes. From ancient times to the present, who has endured forever? Only the Dao and virtue are neither born nor destroyed. Cultivate goodness and accumulate virtue—today is good, this month is good, this moment is good. Accumulate goodness and virtue in all actions, perfecting all practices. Guard wholesome thoughts and allow them to enter the Dharma treasure.

The precepts state:
Do not steal or take others’ property,
Do not falsely seize others’ wealth,

Do not engage in deceitful speech or frivolous talk,
Do not kill out of hatred,
Do not indulge in greed, anger, delusion, or cruelty,
Do not disrespect the elderly or deceive others,
Do not curse with venomous intent,
Do not shout abusive language,
Do not slander or defame others,
Do not sow discord with double-tongued flattery,
Do not exploit others’ faults,
Do not delight in speaking ill of others,
Do not destroy goodness to praise yourself,
Do not be arrogant or self-conceited,
Do not keep poison to harm others,
Do not send slanderous letters,
Do not disdain or belittle scriptural teachings,
Do not slander sacred texts,
Do not rely on power to oppress beings,
Do not indulge in lust or lewdness,

Do not become intoxicated with wine,
Do not kill for licentious sacrifices,
Do not burn wild forests or hunt in mountains,
Do not criticize your teachers and elders,
Do not greedily hoard wealth,
Do not reveal others’ hidden affairs.

The Heavenly Worthy says: These precepts, briefly stated, each bear their own retribution.
Good sons, listen carefully and take them to heart. I shall now explain:
Those who steal others’ property will, upon death, enter the Metal Hammer Hell;
Those who wrongfully take even a single coin from others will, upon death, enter the Cauldron of Boiling Water Hell;

Those who exploit others’ faults will, upon death, enter the Pestle and Mortar Hell;
Those who delight in speaking ill of others will, upon death, enter the Dark Hell;
Those who destroy goodness to praise themselves will, upon death, enter the Great Sword Hell;
Those who are arrogant or self-conceited will, upon death, enter the Frigid Ice Hell;
Those who keep poison to harm others will, upon death, enter the Ash and Charcoal Hell;
Those who send slanderous letters will, upon death, enter the Yellow Springs Great Dark Hell;
Those who disdain or belittle scriptural teachings will, upon death, enter the Obstructed Light Hell;
Those who slander sacred texts will, upon death, enter the Copper Fire Hell;
Those who rely on power to oppress beings will, upon death, enter the Blazing Furnace Hell;
Those who indulge in lust or lewdness will, upon death, enter the Dark and Cold Hell;
Those who take pleasure in killing living beings will, upon death, enter the Uninterrupted Hell;
Those who become intoxicated with wine will, upon death, enter the Thirst and Cold Hell;
Those who kill for licentious sacrifices will, upon death, enter the Boiling Mountain Hell;
Those who burn wild forests or hunt in mountains will, upon death, enter the Dismemberment Hell;
Those who criticize their teachers and elders will, upon death, enter the Grinding Mountain Hell;
Those who greedily hoard wealth will, upon death, enter the Hungry Ghost Hell;
Those who reveal others’ hidden affairs will, upon death, enter the Black Water Hell.

These precepts must not be lightly violated. Those who violate them, whether lightly or heavily, will find retribution following them as a shadow follows form, as an echo responds to sound—loud voices yield loud echoes, soft voices yield soft echoes. The retribution for good and evil is likewise.

Good Youth of Virtuous Sound, you and the four assemblies should diligently practice these precepts, gradually accumulating merit to realize the fruit of the Dao. All dharmas are gathered in these precepts. A few examples are shown to distinguish good from evil. If one fully observes even a single precept without violating any others, one attains mastery over self and dharma, liberation, and non-action.

The Good Youth of Virtuous Sound then addressed the Heavenly Worthy: I venture to ask about the retribution for violating these precepts—how is it that offenses and retribution follow like a shadow? How is the severity of retribution determined for those who violate the precepts? Is the sin grave for violating a single precept, or is it grave for violating many? If violating a single precept is grave, then the precepts should not be numerous. If violating many precepts is grave, then the first violation of a single precept should incur no sin. The assembly is perplexed; we beseech the Heavenly Worthy to clearly enlighten us.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Excellent, excellent. The karmic actions of sentient beings vary infinitely, and their retributions differ accordingly. The precepts are expounded broadly to benefit beings according to their conditions. For those who violate the precepts, retribution follows the severity of the offense, regardless of whether one or many precepts are broken. Violating a single grave precept incurs grave retribution; violating many grave precepts incurs retribution for each. Violating minor precepts results in lighter retribution. Just as a tall person casts a long shadow and a short person casts a short shadow, so too is the retribution for violating precepts.

I teach these various precepts to sever all杂念 and eliminate杂烦恼.
Someone asked: Are afflictions real or unreal?
I replied: They are neither real nor unreal.
Someone asked: If they are neither real nor unreal, why are they called afflictions?
I replied: To mistake the unreal for the real and the real for the unreal—when one imposes false notions of existence upon true dharma, this becomes affliction.
Someone asked: If true dharma is neither real nor unreal, how can it be subject to such false impositions? If it is subject to false impositions, then it is either real or unreal and cannot be called true dharma.
I replied: True dharma is without characteristics; within the absence of characteristics, it is mistakenly perceived as real.
Someone asked: If dharma is without characteristics, how can it be perceived as real within the absence of characteristics?
I replied: It is falsely perceived as real, but this "real" is not truly real.
Someone asked: If this "real" is not truly real, then the false perceptions of sentient beings would be true dharma; the violations of precepts by sentient beings would also be true dharma. How then can there be karmic retribution? How can there be deluded sentient beings? There would be no karmic retribution, and the law of cause and effect would be inverted—cultivating goodness would incur sin, and committing evil would yield goodness.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Why do you entertain such doubts? The law of karma is upright, and cause and effect never err. The wondrous principle of retribution leaves nothing unaccounted for. Good actions yield good results; evil actions yield evil results. It is like planting grain and reaping grain, or planting hemp and reaping hemp. If cause and effect were inverted, know that the seeds would not differ, and so too with cause and effect.

All good men and women, listen well to my words. The true Dharma I teach does not depart from emptiness or existence yet remains the true Dharma; it does not depart from birth and death yet remains the true Dharma; it does not depart from afflictions yet remains the true Dharma.

The Heavenly Worthy said: The true Dharma I teach does not depart from going and coming yet remains the true Dharma; it does not depart from grasping and relinquishing yet remains the true Dharma. I speak of grasping and relinquishing, yet it is not grasping and relinquishing, and thus it is grasping and relinquishing; I speak of going and coming, yet it is not going and coming, and thus it is going and coming; I speak of afflictions, yet they are not afflictions, and thus they are afflictions; I speak of birth and death, yet they are not birth and death, and thus they are birth and death; I speak of emptiness and existence, yet they are not emptiness and existence, and thus they are emptiness and existence.

Know that the Dharma is not two, nor is it one or non-dual; being neither one nor non-dual, it abides serenely and eternally. Why is this so? When the karmic actions of sentient beings are purified, grasping and relinquishing are purified; when going and coming are purified, craving and desire are purified; when afflictions are purified, birth and death are purified, and thus the ultimate truth is realized. There should be no attachments. Know that this sutra is the most exalted and precious. The Heavenly Worthies of the three times all attained the Dao through this sutra; the great sages of the ten directions also practiced this sutra to attain the Dao; beings in other realms likewise practiced this sutra to attain the Dao; the heavenly emperors of all heavens also practiced this sutra to attain the Dao.

This sutra encompasses all without exception. Wherever it resides, all who encounter it attain accomplishment. The majestic power of this sutra is vast and boundless, delivering countless sentient beings—its merit is beyond description. Good men and women, if you can believe in and uphold this sutra with faith, your blessings and virtue will be profound and immeasurable, reaching its very limits.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy was at Mount Lingjie, expounding the true Dharma to the great assembly, and spoke these verses:

I speak of the root of merit,
Cultivated through kalpas of ascetic practice.
Without encountering the True Treasury Sutra,
Diligent practice never regresses.
Free from transgressing the precepts,
One later awakens to the supreme Dao.
All arises from past causes—
You must study with utmost diligence.
Merit renews daily,
The wondrous Dao is neither near nor far.
Seek within the five aggregates,
Though each step is arduous,
Realizing the principle requires no toil of mind.

Then the Heavenly Worthy addressed his retinue and great disciples: I have spoken half a verse to reveal the fundamental causes. People arise from faith, people arise from understanding, people arise from ascetic practice—entering the joyous cause of the true path, establishing the root of goodness, and the wisdom of the Dao becomes self-evident. All dharmas are without inherent nature, ultimately quiescent and empty. Those who realize this principle are the cause of fruition, which is the true result.

All sentient beings, deluded and attached to external phenomena, give rise to the six thieves, each clinging to love and desire, discriminating the world—all fall into the wrong path. Those on the wrong path give rise to false thoughts, bound by karmic causes, which in turn entangle them in karmic consequences. Birth, aging, sickness, and death follow without resolution. Ignorance veils them, craving runs deep, and all manner of right and wrong accumulate, increasing their karmic burdens. Such actions bring afflictions upon themselves, and the retribution of the ten evils follows.

You, the four assemblies, must carefully examine karmic causes and clearly understand dependent origination.

Then the Youth of Auspicious Sound and the great assembly grasped the subtle meaning, awakened to the bodhimandala, and joyfully praised:

The supreme Heavenly Worthy, true eye of the Dao,
Illumines the Dharma, perfectly pure, revealing the bright pearl.
All beings who hear it awaken,
Free from defilements and desires, equal and without remainder.
Our assembly all benefits,
Seeing the eight-angled script on our bodies.
Observing the world as true reality,
Abiding serenely without grasping or relinquishing.

The Heavenly Worthy expounds the precepts and practices equally,
Free from transgressions, free from outflows, karma dissolves.
All fill the room of a square zhang,
Illusory transformations, self-mastery, equal to empty space.

The Heavenly Worthy cultivated ascetic practice through kalpas,
Later encountering the supreme Mahayana vehicle.
Revealing it to sentient beings to deepen their faith,
Roaming the mind in the Dharma-realm, the One Vehicle’s gate.
All dharmas neither arise nor cease,
Naturally liberated, quiescent and wordless.

At that time, the Youth of Auspicious Sound and his retinue, having recited these verses, marveled at what they had never before encountered. The Mahayana teachings save and deliver without limit; their profundity and mystery are beyond worldly knowledge. They dared to ask about the causes and conditions of practice and the methods of the Mahayana.

Sentient beings have shallow roots and lack deep wisdom. They are entangled by contact with existence, their six senses stained. Being so inferior, they do not recognize the sutra’s teachings, do not believe in the Mahayana, and reject transformation and guidance. Though they hear the True Treasury, their minds ignore it. How can they be skillfully guided?

Furthermore, the three vehicles’ teachings guide the three types of roots: Those of superior wisdom, upon hearing of the True Treasury, naturally awaken and enter the Mahayana, reaching the Heavenly Worthy’s realm. They are liberated into the unconditioned, neither arising nor ceasing, seal the marks of all sutras, and can enter and exit with skillful means. Their merit is profound and immeasurable.

Those of middling wisdom rely on the text, uphold the precepts and practices, gradually accumulate merit, and enter the Middle Vehicle. Though they toil through many stages, they never awaken.

The inferior beings know only greed and love. Though guided and taught, they give only external wealth, their minds stingy and attached. Their ignorance is deep and dull. Though they belong to the Lower Vehicle, they have not yet attained any merit.

Sentient beings’ roots are thus sharp or dull, and their benefits differ. How can they enter the great wisdom?

The Heavenly Worthy said: Excellent, excellent! Youth of Auspicious Sound, you grasp the world’s opportunities and ask skillfully. I will explain for you—listen carefully and contemplate inwardly.

The supreme Dao is profound and obscure, cutting off all emotional attachments. The Mahayana’s mysteries are beyond sight and hearing. All sentient beings arise from the Dao and perish in the Dao; karmic conditions are all encompassed, threaded through a single gate. It is like a mother who gives birth to a child, yet the child, unfilial, abandons its mother, wanders in all directions, and commits sins, ensnared in nets. The mother longs for the child, her bowels torn with grief, yet the child remains unaware, suffering torment that is unbearable.

Sentient beings, deluded and inverted, have lost their root—it is just like this. Their souls endure suffering, the pain cutting deeply into their bodies. They bring affliction upon themselves. The Mahayana’s profound teachings bestow virtue according to roots, yet they remain unaware.

Though unaware, they are delivered according to their roots; all sentient beings receive its moisture, abiding in the True Treasury, where life is mysteriously nurtured. They emerge from suffering into joy, never departing from the True Treasury.

Yet sentient beings, deluded and confused, cling to illusory existence and never awaken within the True Treasury. Why is this? Because the true nature of dharma is real, and in truth, what is received as "being" is but a mass of suffering—this is suffering and affliction.

I expound the Three Vehicles as a celestial net, vast and encompassing, spreading forth to benefit beings according to their roots. I perceive all as the great kindness: without birth or extinction, without suffering or affliction, equal in coming and going, equal in entering and exiting, equal in receiving karmic retribution, equal in suffering and joy, equal in the Three Vehicles.

For those of lower roots, bestowal is given, yet in receiving, there is no receiver—this is equality. For those of middling roots, precepts are observed, yet in observing, there are no precepts—this is equality. For those of higher roots, wisdom is attained, yet there is no wisdom and no self—this is equality.

Sentient beings receive joy, yet in receiving joy, there is no receiver—this is equality. Sentient beings undergo karmic retribution, yet in retribution, there is no karma—this is equality. The roots and natures of sentient beings differ, yet in their differences, there is no difference—this is equality.

All dharmas are equal, yet there is nothing to equal; because there is nothing to equal, it is called the Great Dao.

Good Sound Youth, you and your assembly must diligently practice teaching and transformation, relying on this Mahayana. Do not entertain divergent thoughts—this is skillful means, the gateway to entering the great kindness of dharma. By this, merit and mastery arise, and with the power of mastery, you will be unborn and undying, able to deliver sentient beings and extinguish the karma of afflictions.

You, my disciples, must not harbor inverted thoughts.

At that time, Good Sound Youth and the great assembly, having heard these words, rejoiced immeasurably, their joy beyond conception. Each prostrated themselves to the ground, bowed their heads in reverence, and withdrew.

Thus concludes *Fascicle Six of the Supreme Inner Secret True Treasury Sutra*.

*Fascicle Seven of the Supreme Inner Secret True Treasury Sutra: The Chapter on Wondrous Virtue*

At that time, True Treasury Youth, together with his retinue, celestial immortals, earthly immortals, and an innumerable assembly, all approached the Heavenly Worthy. They traversed the worlds above and below, even descending into the boundless hells of the nether realms, circling completely through the heavens and the earth.

They saw a land named Ever-Extending. Its men and women were tall and large, standing thirty *zhang* in height, with lifespans of eight thousand years, all studying the Dao and cultivating virtue.

They saw another land where men and women were pure and simple, without written script. Though distinctions of high and low existed, each honored the other with reverence, never failing in dignity.

They saw yet another land where clothing and food arose naturally. Men and women rejoiced together, free from sorrow or grief.

They saw a land named Blocked River, where people stood thirteen *chi* tall, possessing the strength of beasts. Yet they knew neither Dao nor virtue, nor did they observe human rites.

They saw a land where men and women had but a single foot, subsisting on self-growing grain, and wore no clothing.

They saw a people nine *cun* in height, dwelling among the trees, neither clothed nor fed.

They saw a land where men and women practiced reverence and studied the Mahayana, transforming themselves through non-action.

They saw a land where men and women had the heads of birds and the faces of humans, wearing naturally grown garments, resembling birds and beasts.

They saw a land where men and women enjoyed long life, born without ever dying.

They saw a land where men and women had three feet and two heads, their bodies bare and unclothed, like wild deer.

They saw a land where men and women had but a single eye, located atop their heads. Their bodies grew feathers and fur, and they walked on one foot, their speech resembling birdsong. They knew neither father nor mother.

They saw a land where, within its mountains, golden trees stood on either side, each towering some three hundred *zhang*. Their fruit surpassed sweet springs in flavor, and those who ate of it for a thousand days all attained the immortal Dao.

Even in the boundless hells of the nether worlds, the retributions of suffering and bliss differed. Some embraced copper pillars, some climbed trees of swords, some plunged into cauldrons of boiling water, some ascended mountains of blades. Some were torn limb from limb, some had their tongues pierced with iron awls. Each was assigned to a tribunal of judgment: some to the Northern Yuan Bureau, some to the Nine Treasuries Bureau, some to the Bureau of Dark Night, some to the Bureau of Suffering Spirits, some to the Bureau of Poisoned Blades, some to the Bureau of Vast Darkness, some to the Bureau of Rightful Examination, some to the Four Limits Bureau, some to the Bureau of Long Kalpas, some to the Three Perils Treasury, some to the Bureau of Ten Thousand Torments, some to the Bureau of Endless Suffering, some to the Bureau of Boundless Kalpas. Such were the unimaginable torments of karmic retribution. These were but a brief account of what they witnessed—each realm distinct, none alike.

I venture to ask, Heavenly Worthy: does the Great Vehicle Daoist teaching pervade all things without exception? If it does not pervade all, it cannot be called the Great Vehicle. Yet if it does pervade all, then all beings should know the Dao, and those who know the teaching should be free of karmic transgressions, each possessing virtue/power, with neither good nor evil existing.

I only pray that the Heavenly Worthy will deign to instruct us with compassion, that all may hear.

The Heavenly Worthy replied: Why do you ask this again? I shall explain it to you. Consider the myriad creatures: though all grow from the same earth, they differ in countless ways—some large, some small, some long, some short, each distinct in its kind. The same holds for the manifold forms of existence. The Great Vehicle’s transformative power produces beings of different ranks; lands vary in their conditions, and forms differ in their appearances. The Heavenly Worthy, adapting to each kind, manifests superior or inferior marks according to what is fitting, guiding each to follow its inherent vocation. Once they attain their inherent vocation, they take form in accordance with their kind. All who receive form are endowed with virtue/power and all enter the Great Vehicle.

Know then that the secret treasury of true virtue/power is vast and boundless, beyond all measure. All sentient beings share the same mind in mind, yet their karmic actions differ: some commit evil, some practice good, their deeds manifold, all arising from the mind. The Dao is ever mysteriously communicative—neither within nor without. It is like the light in a dark room, shining through every aperture: though the rays are myriad, their source is one.

True Treasury Youth, you and the others should reflect deeply on the wondrous and subtle power of the Great Vehicle, which cannot be fully grasped. If one could grasp this power, then all good and evil would no longer be good and evil but would become virtue/power; all karmic transgressions would no longer be transgressions but would become virtue/power; all hells would no longer be hells but would become virtue/power; all Dao-fields would no longer be Dao-fields but would become virtue/power; all sentient beings would no longer be sentient beings but would become virtue/power; all dharmas would no longer be dharmas but would become virtue/power; all birth and death would no longer be birth and death but would become virtue/power; all coming and going would no longer be coming and going but would become virtue/power; all Heavenly Worthies would no longer be Heavenly Worthies but would become virtue/power; all sages would no longer be sages but would become virtue/power; the Great Vehicle itself would no longer be the Great Vehicle but would become virtue/power; all foolishness and wisdom would no longer be foolishness and wisdom but would become virtue/power; all manifold kinds would no longer be manifold kinds but would become virtue/power.

This pervading power is all the Dao’s grace—it is also called the Dao’s root, liberation, ultimate attainment, great penetration, universal virtue/power, mysterious quiescence, far-reaching transcendence, Dharma Mother, the generative, the wondrous mark, egress and ingress, true treasury, Dharma jewel, sentient beings, good and evil, birth and death, grasping and relinquishing, manifold kinds, discrimination, self and others.

This subtle and wondrous power is beyond conception, manifesting in countless forms, inexpressible in words.

Then True Treasury Youth and the four assemblies, hearing of such power, were struck with awe and confusion, losing their way in the great Dao. They could not discern whether the merit of accumulating wealth in the world or the merit of cultivating the Dao’s practice truly constituted merit—or whether merit even existed. If merit did exist, then the Heavenly Worthy’s discourse on the subtle and wondrous power of the Great Vehicle would be mere empty deception, deluding sentient beings without truth. Yet if merit did not exist, then beings who did not cultivate or perform meritorious deeds should attain the Dao’s fruit.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Excellent, excellent! The subtle and wondrous power of the Great Vehicle that I expound pervades the entire realm of empty space, leaving not even a mustard seed unfilled. As for your question about accumulating wealth and cultivating practice—these too are merit. Why? Because accumulating wealth is not wealth, and cultivating practice is not practice. With no self and no others, the three poisons purified, this is subtle and wondrous merit—it is also called the Great Vehicle, attainment of the fruit, wisdom, liberation. All dharmas are likewise: ultimately pure, ultimately the Dao-field, ultimately merit.

You of the four assemblies, reflect deeply and maintain single-minded focus. The merit is profound and far-reaching; you cannot grasp it all at once. It is like digging a well: the deeper you dig, the greater the effort, and the harder it becomes to remove the soil. Yet once you reach the spring, you quench the thirst of all, leaving none hungry or parched. The labor of digging the well vanishes with the spring’s emergence.

Cultivating the Dao and accumulating practice is likewise. Through hidden kindness and secret grace, you delve to the source, thoroughly understanding nature and emotions. At ease and unconstrained, the traces of effort disappear, and you attain the Great Vehicle, with merit fully perfected.

It is also like a long journey, traveling ten thousand miles, enduring every hardship, witnessing all things. Cultivating the Dao and accumulating practice is the same: enduring hardships and austerities, traversing the world, erasing the traces of worldly toil, attaining the faculties of the roots, and realizing the Dao’s fruit.

The faculties of sentient beings are driven by the six thieves, bound by the four māras, their three karmic actions grasping and relinquishing, entangled in the five aggregates. Every movement, every deed, becomes karmic transgression.

Good sons, you and your assembly must delve deeply into the numinous mysteries, anchoring your minds beyond worldly affairs. Do not cling to self and others, lest you become entangled in worldly dust, with enmity and resentment arising, your minds deluded and confused, a hundred demons assailing you, your lives cut short, and you fall into evil destinies.

All sentient beings are likewise, adrift in the waves of birth and death, craving love and desire, their every thought and deed devoid of awareness. It is like a monkey, leaping and bounding in reckless confidence, suddenly caught in a trap, losing its very life.

The mind-thief of sentient beings is the same. You must resolve your will as if treading on ice over a chasm. I have spoken for your sake.

Long ago, there was a man who, ignorant of inner cultivation, drilled into wisdom and sought goodness externally. From dawn to dusk, he knelt in worship before a withered tree, praying for longevity. For twenty-eight years, he never wearied, not even for a moment. Suddenly, the withered tree blossomed, and within it flowed sweet nectar, its taste honeyed. The man drank of it and attained the rank of earthly immortal.

Know this: when the heart’s resolve is sincere and steadfast, the Dao does not fail one. Even a withered tree responds to a straight heart—how much more so when one cultivates inner practice, naturally attaining liberation.

At that time, the Youth of True Treasury and the fourfold assembly, hearing this parable, were deeply moved beyond measure. They awakened to the Great Vehicle, their understanding equal in depth, their merit and virtue wondrous and distinct, each entering the proper discipline.

Then the Heavenly Worthy spoke these verses:

The subtle forms of all dharmas
Are the natural root of merit and virtue.
The teacher of liberation for living beings,
Realizing the Dao is not far.

I reveal the return to the ancient source,
Merit and virtue are never too late.
Diligently practice accumulating good deeds,
The Great Vehicle turns with all things.

Within afflictions, seek the true;
The six senses merge in stillness.
Each of you reflect for yourselves—
Fools never contemplate.

In other worlds, vast and varied,
Merit and virtue fill all.
Though beings differ in kind,
True power remains unblemished.

I expound the *Sutra of True Treasury*,
Liberation is equal for all.
Those of the Lesser Vehicle do not believe,
Yet compassion nurtures within.

Through skillful means, they are made to receive and uphold,
Merit grows with each passing day.
You must diligently advance,
Realizing the Dharma as swiftly as echo follows sound.

The five aggregates are a fragrant garden,
Guard and hold them firmly in hand.

The Heavenly Worthy spoke these verses, extolling merit and virtue, and addressed the Youth of True Treasury and his retinue: All sentient beings, though they seek the fruit of the Dao through teachings and words, do not depart from scripture—this itself is merit and virtue.

Then the Youth of True Treasury respectfully asked the Heavenly Worthy: If men and women seek to study scriptures and teachings, how should they inquire into these words and texts? Where do words and texts reside? Are they in the past, the future, or the present? If in the past, the past has already gone, and there is nothing to seek; if in the future, the future has not yet come, and they cannot be attained; if in the present, the present does not abide, and being unabiding, there is nothing to seek. I pray the Heavenly Worthy will clearly reveal this.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Excellent, excellent. Those who have not yet sought the Dao should depart from all appearances and sever the mind of emptiness and being. The words I speak transcend teachings; they are empty yet not empty, not empty yet not not-empty. These very words are the fruit of the Dao, also called inner seeking.

Again, he asked: The faculties of all sentient beings differ, and their minds and perceptions are hard to know. If one expounds the principle of emptiness, it may offend the ignorant; if one clings to assertions of being, it contradicts the wise. How, then, can it be taught?

The Heavenly Worthy replied: Observe their conduct and whether they possess the Six Right Practices—only then may it be imparted.

He asked: What are the Six Right Practices?
1. The eyes do not grasp forms, the eye faculty is liberated;
2. The ears do not grasp sounds, the ears are keen and bright;
3. The nose is free from foul odors, the nose penetrates all stenches;
4. The mouth is free from careless speech, the mouth eloquently expounds the Dharma’s root;
5. The body does not grasp touch, the body’s nature is empty and unobstructed;
6. The mind is free from burdens, wisdom and understanding are boundless.

These Six Right Practices are the conduct of superior beings, aligning with the Great Vehicle and entering the root of merit and virtue.

Furthermore, there are Five Good Practices worthy of teaching others. What are the Five Good Practices?
1. Skillfully departing from worldly adornments and sensual pleasures;
2. Skillfully practicing kindness and love, aiding others according to conditions;
3. Skillfully establishing merit and virtue, constantly embracing forbearance;
4. Skillfully serving enlightened teachers, cultivating the true Dao;
5. Skillfully employing expedient means, consulting wise friends.

These Five Good Practices are the work of middling beings, aligning with the Middle Vehicle and ascending to the realm of the Dao.

Furthermore, there are the Nine Precepts. What are the Nine Precepts?
1. Precepts for the body: the body does not kill wantonly, cherishing and nurturing all beings;
2. Precepts for the mind: the mind does not covet wantonly, refraining from all evil;
3. Precepts for the feet: the feet do not tread carelessly, avoiding harm to life;
4. Precepts for the hands: the hands do not grasp wantonly, not accepting others’ belongings;
5. Precepts for the heart: the heart endures like the earth, free from resentment;
6. Precepts for the ears: the ears do not receive wantonly, free from sounds of good and evil;
7. Precepts for the eyes: the eyes do not gaze wantonly, free from the five colors;
8. Precepts for the mouth: the mouth does not speak carelessly, free from slander of the good;
9. Precepts for the nose: the nose does not smell wantonly, free from defiling fragrances.

These Nine Precepts are for the lower grade; when beings cultivate and uphold them, they firmly receive blessings and virtue, establishing this *True Treasury* as such. Skillfully adapting to conditions, they spread and apply them fittingly.

You, my assembly, should receive and uphold these teachings. The merit and virtue are boundless, beyond all description. If there are those of good understanding who explain them to others, enlightening the deluded, the merit and virtue are profound and far-reaching. Why? Because as they are transmitted continuously, the teachings remain unbroken. It is like passing a lamp: one lamp kindles a hundred thousand lamps, all illuminating at once, their light undiminished. The former lamp and the latter lamp are neither superior nor inferior. The transmission of wisdom is likewise.

Then the Youth of True Treasury and his assembly spoke together: We are all in accord, and we each possess past blessings to have encountered the Heavenly Worthy, who has revealed merit and virtue, taught us in detail, and awakened our understanding of conditions. Each of us will resolve our wills, from body to body, from kalpa to kalpa, traversing and experiencing without retreat. Furthermore, we each vow to deliver sentient beings, leading them out of the sea of suffering. If we encounter urgent dangers, we shall recite this sutra, and the danger will immediately vanish. If we see a land plagued by calamities or malevolent omens, we shall recite this sutra, and the omens will cease of themselves. If there are floods, droughts, or warfare, we shall recite this sutra, and weapons will not be raised.

If one encounters illness, decline, or misfortune, one should recite this sutra, and the ailment will naturally dissipate and heal. The divine power of this sutra is vast and far-reaching. The heavenly youths, mighty ghost-kings, and lion vajras all join together to guard and protect. Let us maintain right mindfulness and not betray our vows. Each of us should reflect inwardly, heart to heart in accord, calming the spirit and settling the mind, and with joyful praise say:

The Dharma King’s power, the Benevolent Honored One,
Unfolds and expounds virtue throughout the Dharma realm.
All beings and all practices receive its grace,
Even the lowliest creatures find refuge and support.
The Great Vehicle’s Great Way, the Equal Teacher,
Universally instructs the deluded, leaving none behind.
Yet foolish people, benighted and untrusting of truth,
Abandon the compassionate mother, clinging to love and attachment.
The compassionate mother, ever merciful, constantly liberates,
Moving in and out, coming and going without hindrance.
We reflect inwardly on our own conduct,
Accumulating merit over a thousand kalpas.
The Lesser Vehicle’s shallow understanding yields not an inch of merit,
Stubbornly untransformed, forever unchanged by self.
The ten directions’ ten sages all uphold it,
Attaining fruition without limit, achieving freedom.

At that time, True Treasury Youth and his assembly spoke this hymn of praise, addressing the Heavenly Worthy and consulting on the wondrous Dharma: All sentient beings, each clinging to self and others, practice the ways of beings. Even those of the Lesser Vehicle and the dualistic-minded lead the deluded multitudes, each claiming, “What I expound is true in word and straight in principle, unmatched in the world, most exalted and wondrous, the root of all sutras.” There are also various kinds of ghosts and spirits who likewise declare, “What I expound is true in word and real in principle, rare and supreme.” Furthermore, in other lands, malevolent ghosts abound, yet the people delight in the Lesser Vehicle, single-mindedly contemplating the cessation of evil and aspiring to good fruits. Insatiably craving goodness and refraining from all evil, they too consider themselves correct. Such people, each devoted to their own way—how can beings, shallow and inferior, easily swayed by petty words and aspiring to cultivate goodness, ever depart from the Lesser Vehicle and practice the Great Way?

The Heavenly Worthy said: So it is, so it is. Sentient beings are deluded, easily led and easily deceived. Led and deceived, they all enter the wrong path. Why is this so? In ancient times, there was a kingdom called Self-Revealing, whose people constantly practiced good deeds, yet their wisdom was shallow and not profound, and they believed in deceptive good teachings. There was a wild fox, the fox king, full of cunning and deceit, possessing various arts of illusion. Wishing to transform the king, it said to its fox followers: “In the kingdom of Self-Revealing, the king delights in goodness and abandons evil, but his wisdom is shallow and not deep; he believes whatever he hears as good. I possess wondrous arts—able to fly and become invisible, keen and bright in wisdom. I shall fly before the palace, transform into a human form, most handsome and upright, and suspend myself in midair a hundred *zhang* above the ground. Reciting wondrous sutras, discoursing on emptiness and explaining principles, distinguishing yin and yang, my voice resonant as a bell, my words flowing like a river, I shall speak without cease. The palace attendants, consorts, concubines, and all the royal household, along with the kingdom’s ministers and people, will surely gather, gazing up to listen to my words, considering them rare and wondrous. Whatever I desire, they will surely heed. I shall then persuade them to relinquish their lives, remove their clothing, and hand over their treasures. Collecting these, I shall return home, enter the marketplace to trade, and buy fat meat to feast upon with my wives, children, and kin—is this not the most excellent and joyous of undertakings?”

The fox king’s followers all voiced their approval, saying to the king: “Your followers constantly steal and seize wild things, ever fearful of being caught and losing their lives. We endure immeasurable hardship to serve the great king, yet gain no benefit. The king possesses such surpassing and rare talents—why not act swiftly?” Hearing these words, the fox king set his mind to it. Secretly reciting the scriptures of illusion, abandoning evil and embracing goodness, for three days and four nights he recited over a hundred volumes, mastering them all with skill. He then transformed his body, flew through the air, and arrived before the king’s palace, a hundred *zhang* above the ground, seated in midair. Reciting scriptures aloud, he did just as he had said. The king, palace attendants, consorts, concubines, and tens of thousands of the royal household all gathered at once, raising their eyes to gaze upward. Seeing the fox king’s extraordinary preaching, they wept and wailed, moved to tears, exhorting goodness and forsaking evil. The palace attendants, concubines, and all the ministers sighed without end. “A sage has appeared in the world—rare and seldom heard!” The kingdom’s treasures and all its people were entirely offered in alms. Moreover, over thirty people relinquished their lives before the king’s palace at once. The fox king said to the assembly: “To relinquish one’s life in this way is the mark of a superior person. With my divine power, I shall take them away and install them in the Jeweled Hall of Jade Mountain, where they shall be constantly revered.”

Having spoken thus, he transformed into a swift wind, seizing the corpses and treasures without a single loss, and returned to the fox den. There, they feasted on human flesh and fed the fox cubs. Transforming into human forms, they carried the treasures and poems to the market to sell, using the proceeds to buy meat. Arriving at the butcher’s row to negotiate the price, among the butchers were several fierce dogs fighting over bones. Seeing the dogs, the fox cubs panicked, and before they knew it, their forms reverted. The dogs then bit and killed them. The butchers, alarmed, obtained these treasures but dared not keep them secretly. They immediately reported to the market officials, who in turn dared not conceal them and reported to the prefecture. The prefecture then memorialized the king, presenting the fox’s treasures and detailing the circumstances. Seeing the memorial and the treasures, the king suddenly awakened, recognizing them as the playthings of his youngest child, previously offered to the sacred path. “Why are they in the fox’s possession?”

At that time, a wise and discerning man named Immortal Spirit prostrated himself before the king and said: “Grant your servant ten thousand deaths; I dare to speak frankly.”

The king then showed mercy, sparing him a hundred deaths, and said: "If you have further insights, speak freely without restraint."

Immortal Spirit knelt and addressed the king: "The one who preached the sutras and taught transformation in the empty sky was none other than a fox spirit employing demonic sorcery. Your servant wished to inform Your Majesty but feared contradicting your will and dared not speak."

The king asked: "How do you know this?"

Immortal Spirit replied: "They recite the words but do not grasp their meaning, urging others to abandon evil and follow goodness while their hearts and mouths are at odds. Moreover, their ability to fly through the air reveals their emptiness and falsity. All great sages dwell in quiescence without origin—how could such delusion be theirs?"

The king asked: "What should be done about this error?"

Immortal Spirit said: "Gather the army, surround that great mound with many fierce dogs, sever the remaining demonic lineage, and let the true Dharma spread."

The king immediately commanded his troops, setting a fixed time to encircle the hill. The fox then transformed into human form, prostrated twice, and bowed to welcome the king. But as the fierce dogs closed in, it reverted to its fox shape, and the dogs bit and killed it. The king ordered his ministers to dig into the underground chambers, certain they would find treasures. The ministers excavated and reached the fox’s den, where they recovered a great trove of treasures. The king then issued an edict throughout the land, summoning all to identify the objects. Those who came to claim them all recognized their own.

Know this: in the world, discernment is difficult. Mouths speak truth while hearts harbor falsehood; deceptive paths are falsely proclaimed, and minds are deluded and confused. You, the four assemblies, must observe carefully for yourselves. Within the six upright Dharmas, take but one principle—unbroken, uncorrupted, free from perversion and delusion.

What is this one principle? The Heavenly Worthy said: "Do not cling to existence, do not cling to emptiness. Forget the self, be without ego, and abide in ultimate quiescence—this is the foremost principle."

Someone asked: "If one forgets the self and is without ego, who then realizes the meaning of emptiness to attain the foremost principle?"

The Heavenly Worthy answered: "Only the self realizes it."

Again, they asked: "If the self realizes it yet is without ego, how can there be a self to realize it?"

Thus indeed: there is no self—this is the foremost principle, unborn and undying, perfectly serene. Hence it is called "self-realization."

Furthermore, the minds and actions of all sentient beings are deluded and confused, flowing through the sixty-five paths, entangled in heterodox views. Demonic spirits enter their minds, constantly speaking ghostly words, yet they remain unaware. Hearing superficial words, they take them for goodness. But when they encounter the secret treasury of truth, its harshness grates upon their ears, and they refuse to believe. Heretical and external paths craft deceptive words that penetrate to the marrow. Delighted, they praise and extol them, telling their wives and children to revere this teaching, believing it will lead to enlightenment.

Why is this so? Such teachings appear pleasing to people, and false words are easily embraced. But when they hear the true treasury—detached from all appearances, extinguishing the mind of existence and emptiness—they immediately slander it.

Moreover, among all good men and women of the past, there was a kingdom whose king was named Tuao. He was sovereign among men, discerning the principles of all things. Heretics and external paths, with their heterodox views and demonic arts, came with various doctrines to convert the king, practicing false ways. Among them was one man, the most learned, who performed sorcery and transformed his shape, soaring freely through the air. The sounds of bells and music filled the sky as he approached the king, chanting praises in tones beyond description. The palace women, concubines, and all the ministers, witnessing this dharma-sound, became bewildered, maddened, and deluded. For twenty-one days, none awoke from their confusion.

The king said to him: "You are a heretic and demonic fiend. Leave at once. I shall destroy you. You have come to confuse my ministers and ruin my kingdom."

The man replied: "I am the true Dharma, come to see the king. Observe the king’s cultivation of goodness. Let him listen carefully as I expound the teaching."

The king said: "You practice false arts, displaying various transformations among men—none surpass you in deception. In my kingdom, there is the treasury of the Great Vehicle sutras, the dharma-mirror for all beings, which contains no such superficial words. You deceive and confuse me. I have heard that those of the true Way conceal their names and hide their traces, unknown to the multitudes. I have also heard that the supreme Way is profound and obscure—where there is form, there is falsity. Leave at once, or I shall destroy you. I have a wise minister named Tongling. If you possess true arts, come and debate with him."

The king summoned Tongling, who came forward, prostrated, and addressed the king: "I do not yet understand the reason for Your Majesty’s urgent summons."

The king said: "Did you hear of the one who appeared yesterday, displaying wondrous arts to deceive and confuse my ministers, seeking to convert me to goodness? You must decisively subdue and capture this external path, debate and exhaust its doctrines, observe its breath and speech, and fathom its spiritual conduct."

Tongling said: "External paths are mostly false with little truth—they are unworthy of discussion. I request that Your Majesty summon him to the palace hall to face your judgment."

For three days and three nights, they debated principles, discussing emptiness and existence, expounding the ancient and revealing the present, without hindrance or obstruction. Tongling then revealed the source of his wisdom, debating the true Dharma. His words flowed with diverse sounds, yet his form had no fixed place. Suddenly, he vanished without a trace, his shadow fleeing.

The king commanded his ministers to capture and seize him. The ministers summoned all within the kingdom of such appearance to be apprehended, but he had already disappeared, and though they searched everywhere, he could not be found. The external path’s followers, over three thousand in number, dared not emerge, and naturally dissolved. The kingdom became pure and upright, its faith in the Great Vehicle deepening with even greater devotion.

When the ten directions’ kingdoms heard of this king’s mastery of all dharmas and his unobstructed discernment of heresy, they knew that external paths could not prevail in their deceptions and would naturally retreat and vanish. Each sent great ministers to seek the true Dharma and invite the revered sutras.

At that time, the king dispatched Tongling to consult and invite the revered Dharma, fully explaining the circumstances: the ten directions’ kingdoms had come to request the revered sutras, and he entreated the Heavenly Worthy to bestow his grace and accept the invitation.

Then, the Heavenly Worthy, hearing their consultation and request, emitted a great radiance, universally illuminating the sutras.

The Vajra Youths, Dharma-protecting deities, and countless hosts—fragrant blossoms dense and drifting through the void—all bore the might and radiance of their numinous power, shielding and surrounding. In each of those kingdoms, auspicious signs appeared: banners and canopies, music and dance descended from the empty sky. There was also *yuhui*, the rare incense that reverses the wind, perfuming all without burning, filling the air and delivering the living from death.

Each king purified his land, prepared and cleansed all things, and welcomed the Sacred Honored One into his realm. For seven days and seven nights, the sound of the Dharma never ceased. Immortal youths and jade maidens filled the Dharma-realm; the gods rejoiced, each playing music—resonant, harmonious, and refined—stirring every kingdom with boundless joy. All vowed their refuge in the supreme Dao, the supreme sutra, and the supreme teacher. Their blessings and karmic retribution were beyond measure. The Heavenly King was sovereign; the land flourished and its people prospered. Weapons were forever laid down, and for ten thousand kalpas no calamity arose.

Even the borderlands and lands of mixed peoples, hearing of the wondrous sutra’s numinous power and might, each sent envoys to welcome and revere the sacred path. With heart and tongue they pledged, from body to body, to study the supreme Dao without weariness or surfeit.

Thereupon, the Sacred Honored One dispatched youths, Dharma-protecting deities, and boundless hosts, each bearing the *yuhui* incense that reverses the wind, arriving wherever their hearts desired. In every land they reached, the earth became lapis lazuli, and all rejoiced, their clothing and food naturally provided. The land was purified. The great sages of the ten directions together upheld and proclaimed the *True Treasury*, the secret and wondrous sutra, passing it on in transmission and entrusting it to kings and their great ministers. Those who received and venerated it—whether in heaven or on earth, within the Three Clarities—were pervaded by merit so vast it cannot be described.

All good men and women diligently studied the Great Vehicle and cultivated the Three Wisdoms. What are the Three Wisdoms? First, skillfully accumulating expedient means to extinguish external defilements; second, severing all karmic outflows without projecting into others’ realms; third, seeking the true mark until reaching the bodhimanda. Having realized the return to the source, the two views remain ever luminous; the three karmas revolve without hindrance; the four great elements are eternally interconnected; the five aggregates become clear; the six senses are unstained; the seventh consciousness is sovereign; the Eightfold Right Path is free of self; and the nine virtues flow unceasingly. Former worthies and later sages all attained the Dao by this means. Know that the *True Treasury* is foremost.

Why is this so? All other sutras and teachings speak only of branches and leaves, the stages of the Lesser Vehicle. This sutra reveals the root, its words true and real, easily understood and distinct.

At that time, among the assembly was a wise man named Faxiao, who rose and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “For seven minor kalpas I have followed teachers to study the Dao, hearing and knowing many things, yet much remains unclear, and I dared not ask. Later, I accompanied the Heavenly Worthy to Lingjie Mountain, where your virtues were displayed. The *True Treasury* of the Great Vehicle, the boundless realm—all equally partook of your grace. Yet I do not understand why various kingdoms still sent ministers to seek the Dao and invite the sacred sutra. If all were universally blessed, why would they come to invite it? And if invitations were made, would that not imply the Dao was incomplete?”

The Heavenly Worthy replied: “Excellent, excellent! What you ask is the same doubt shared by all. I shall now explain. The teachings of the Great Vehicle prioritize the blending of all things; no Dharma is left unpervaded. Those who come from afar to invite it have not yet awakened; they do not recognize the source of the Dao. All mixed kinds arise from the Dao, yet they do not know it and require a teacher to reveal it. It is like a treasure buried in the earth, trodden underfoot by the multitude, who remain unaware. Only those skilled in discernment, through divination, come to know of it. The merits of those lands are likewise. Though they exist, they must be invited and awakened.

All sentient beings are the same. Some dwell in the central kingdoms where royal law prevails, yet none awaken. Even if expounded for kalpas, it cannot be exhausted. It is like a head round as the heavens, yet unaware of the sky’s height and depth; feet square as the earth, yet unaware of the earth’s profundity and solidity. All dharmas arise within the Dao, yet they do not know the Dao’s form. The delusion of sentient beings is just like this.”

At that time, Fǎliáo and the great assembly rejoiced, bowed in reverence, awakened to the Six Right Paths, penetrated the Threefold Wisdom, and guarded the Old City—all demonic thieves were vanquished. They prostrated before the Supreme Compassionate Honored One, their voices choked with grief, and in silence took their leave.

*The Seventh Scroll of the Supreme Esoteric Treasury of the Inner Secret Sutra* concludes.

*The Eighth Scroll of the Supreme Esoteric Treasury of the Inner Secret Sutra*
*Chapter on the Assembly of Immortals*

At that time, a perfected one named Immortal Spirit, together with his disciples numbering seven thousand four hundred and more, wandered through the world and dwelled on Mount Linwu. For kalpas uncounted, they consumed magic mushrooms and elixirs, practiced breath cultivation and nourishing arts, and thus attained longevity, becoming earthbound immortals. Yet they did not awaken to the Great Vehicle and remained without liberation.

Immortal Spirit then prostrated himself upon the ground and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “For long have I heard that the wondrous *True Treasury Sutra* resides on Mount Lingjie, delivering the living from death, severing the bonds of affliction, dispelling the demons of a hundred kalpas, and sweeping away the delusions of a thousand heresies. Its compassionate grace shines universally, moistening all sentient beings.”

He entreated for instruction, saying, “I only pray that the Heavenly Worthy will deign to bestow your merciful regard.”

Then the Heavenly Worthy, seated upon a five-hued throne of lapis lazuli on Mount Lingjie, a hundred *zhang* above the earth, proclaimed the true and secret treasury of the Orthodox Dharma. Fragrant breezes of aloeswood and orchids wafted in reverse, scattering blessings upon all dharmas, benefiting every creeping thing and all beings endowed with consciousness—none failed to receive its moisture. The multitudes who came from the four directions naturally awakened to understanding. Moreover, it could perfect the defiled and impure lands below, adorning them with marvelous splendor, rare and wondrous beyond compare.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the immortals: “You and your disciples have long cultivated the Lesser Vehicle, and the karmic conditions are difficult to sever. Now I shall proclaim the Great Vehicle for you, though it may startle and alarm you. Why is this? Its subtlety surpasses the source of the mind, and those who perceive it are few. If you seek it, first sever the Three Delusions. What are the Three Delusions? The first is the delusion of the mind, which clings to life; the second is the delusion of emotion, which covets wealth and sensuality; the third is the delusion of intent, which discriminates between good and evil. Only by removing these Three Delusions can one seek the Dao.

There is yet one practice, the root of the Dao and the foremost of all practices. What is this one practice? It is neither abiding in the world nor departing from it; neither abiding in emptiness nor departing from emptiness; neither abiding in self and others nor departing from self and others; neither abiding in cause and effect nor departing from cause and effect; neither abiding in body and mind nor departing from body and mind. Constantly practicing the true Dao in this manner, one ever attains liberation and escapes the cycle of birth and death.”

Immortal Spirit then prostrated himself upon the ground and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “I venture to ask: in practicing this one practice, upon what should one rely?”

The Heavenly Worthy replied: “Rely upon the old scriptures.”

He further asked: “For beginners in the Lesser Vehicle, after kalpas of accumulation, they do not recognize the source of the Dao. How can this be called ‘old’?”

The reply: “Not giving rise to the mind is.”

He again asked: “If not giving rise to the mind means having no dharma, how can the absence of dharma be called the ‘old scriptures’?”

The reply: “Where the mind’s activity ceases, the bonds of affliction are severed, and the principle of non-action is attained. Those who realize this principle are without birth or extinction, and this is the ultimate site of the Dao. With merits complete, it is called the ‘old scriptures.’”

He further asked: “If the mind’s activity ceases, who severs affliction? Who realizes non-action? Who knows quiescence? If one knows quiescence and realizes non-action, then this is a dharma, and all dharmas are subject to change, constantly shifting without abiding. Since they do not abide, they are impermanent. How then can they be called the ‘old scriptures’? My doubts remain unresolved. I pray you will explain further.”

The Heavenly Worthy smiled, his five-colored radiance blazing, suffusing the ten directions. Shedding all phenomenal forms, he joyfully replied: “Excellent, excellent! Your questions resolve the doubts of the multitude and open the intent of living beings. I shall explain for you. Listen well and ponder deeply, for it is clear and easy to understand.

What I reveal is that dharmas have no inherent nature. Because they have no inherent nature, they are all the ‘old scriptures.’”

At that time, Immortal Spirit and his disciples, hearing this teaching of the Great Vehicle, experienced the opening of their minds and the resolution of their understanding. Overwhelmed with joy, they exclaimed: “For kalpas we have toiled in vain, seeking afar and missing the mark. Now, having heard the Great Vehicle, each shall return to our own lands, at ease in non-action.”

The Heavenly Worthy further addressed them: “All good spiritual friends, do not entertain external thoughts. Why is this?”

All dharmas are the ‘old scriptures.’ If one claims that dharmas arise and cease, one slanders the dharmas—this is called perverse view, also known as externalism, also called discrimination, also named gain and loss, also termed inversion, also called the notion of self and others. If one claims that dharmas neither arise nor cease, one destroys the dharmas—this too is called perverse view, also known as externalism, also called discrimination, also named gain and loss, also termed inversion, also called the notion of self and others. Why is this so? The fundamental nature of all dharmas is pure and ultimate, neither empty nor existent, neither non-empty nor non-existent. This very dharma-nature is unobstructed and free—it is called the supreme Dao. Thus it is named the ‘old scriptures,’ also called the true sutras, also named virtue.

Not destroying the dharmas is called the supreme Dao;
Not destroying right and wrong is called the ‘old scriptures’;
Not destroying birth and death is called the true sutras;
Not destroying coming and going is called virtue;
Not destroying grasping and rejecting is called the dharma-treasure;
Not destroying self and others is called concentration and wisdom.

Such a wondrous dharma is called the great birth-and-death, the great coming-and-going, the great right-and-wrong, the great self-and-others, the great grasping-and-rejecting, the great this-and-that. Why is this so? The nature of dharmas is boundless—even if one expounds it all day, one cannot exhaust it. It is like the great ocean, which receives the hundred rivers yet remains neither increased nor diminished. The subtle and wondrous virtue of the Great Vehicle sutras is likewise. Even if one were to set forth a hundred thousand myriad analogies, not one part in ten thousand would suffice. The virtue of this sutra cannot be measured.

Furthermore, all great disciples and immortals, you who first practiced the Lesser Vehicle and whose karmic deeds are heavy—how could you abandon them? Upon hearing this Great Vehicle, if your minds cannot accept it, do not give rise to regret or remorse, lest you lose the root of virtue. I cherish compassionate thoughts toward you, like a mother’s love for her child. Why is this so?

The Dao is unbroken, the Dao is pure, the Dao is wisdom, the Dao is liberation. A single moment of opposition severs all roots of virtue. A mother’s love for her child is likewise—qi flows in unbroken continuity, thought after thought without deviation, never to be abandoned. Yet if the child is unfilial, he forsakes his mother, flees outward, and turns his back upon her. Sentient beings in delusion do the same: they forget gratitude and love, lose their filial and compassionate mother, and stray far from the virtuous Way.

At that time, the immortals and spirits bowed their heads to the Supreme Honored One, bowed to the Supreme Dharma, and bowed to the Heavenly Worthy: “As disciples of the gate, we are fortunate to encounter the Great Vehicle and meet good-knowing advisors. Overjoyed and exultant, we praise what we have never before known. In the past, we studied the Lesser Vehicle for years with great toil, yet could not escape birth and death, could not escape right and wrong, could not escape afflictions, could not escape gratitude and love, could not escape clinging and attachment, could not escape self and others, could not escape discrimination, could not escape annihilation and permanence. Such suffering and distress were never liberated. Now, awakening to the Great Vehicle, we are suddenly without obstruction.”

Furthermore, the faculties of all sentient beings are unequal—how can they enter the Great Vehicle? The Heavenly Worthy replied: “All enter the Great Vehicle.” Someone asked: “If the Dharma is unequal, how can all enter the Great Vehicle? Why are there sentient beings who cultivate the Way? Why are there sentient beings who perform good and evil? Why are there sages who teach and transform? If there are sentient beings who act in good and evil, then the Dharmas cannot be unequal, and thus the Great Vehicle is not equal. If the Great Vehicle is not equal, how can all enter it?” The Heavenly Worthy replied: “The Great Way is without direction; differences are all correct. Sentient beings in inversion all enter the Great Vehicle. Sentient beings in good and evil all enter the Great Vehicle. Sentient beings dwell within it, yet deludedly do not understand. Because they do not understand, they take themselves to be real. With real Dharmas and karmic deeds, they are bound in the cycle of rebirth, losing the Way of great compassion.”

Someone asked: “Good and evil have different names, yet both enter the Great Vehicle. The real and the conventional have different names, yet both enter the Lesser Vehicle. If the real and the conventional, though differently named, are not the Lesser Vehicle, then how can good and evil, though differently named, both enter the Great Vehicle?” The answer: “The two names of good and evil—what difference is there between the real and the conventional? The Great Vehicle is equal to the Lesser Vehicle—where is there any distinction of great and small?”

Someone asked: “If this is so, then the great and the small are one. Though opposite, they are not the same. Should there not be two distinct natures, great and small, which are not both present? If both are present yet not distinct, then both names should be small and not great. How can all enter the Great Vehicle?” The answer: “The two vehicles, great and small, are named in mutual opposition, yet in reality there are no two natures to be revealed.”

Someone asked: “If the two vehicles, great and small, are named in mutual opposition, then they are interdependent. If the great is named in dependence on the small, then the great should be named small. If the small is named in dependence on the great, then the small should be named great. How can the two names, great and small, be revealed in mutual opposition?” The Heavenly Worthy replied: “Their mutual revelation is like medicine overcoming illness. The two minds of sentient beings both attain nothing. In this attainment of nothing, they perversely give rise to inversion, discriminating two views—good and evil with their differences.”

Someone asked: “If this is so, then when goodness arises, the name of evil should vanish; when evil arises, the name of goodness should vanish. How can the two names appear simultaneously?” The Heavenly Worthy said: “Just so, just so. When the name of goodness arises, the name of evil vanishes; when the name of evil arises, the name of goodness vanishes.”

The immortals and spirits said: “If this is so, then the name of evil should pervade the three times—past, future, and present—and all should be evil. If the past and future are not evil, how can the present have good and evil arising in mutual opposition?” The Heavenly Worthy said: “The past and future, being nonexistent, cannot have mutual arising in the present. Without arising, how can there be names of good and evil?”

Someone asked: “If the two names of good and evil both lack substance, then when good and evil arise, should they not also lack substance?” The answer: “When good and evil arise, each lacks name and substance.”

Someone asked: “If the two names of good and evil are not the same, then they cannot both lack substance. If both names lack substance, should the name of evil not have substance?” The answer: “There is neither existence nor nonexistence.”

Someone asked: “If the name of evil lacks substance and is thus nonexistent, should the name of goodness not have substance and thus be existent?” The Heavenly Worthy said: “The two names of good and evil have no two substances. They are equal in a single mark, without good or evil. Without good or evil, they are ultimately pure. All Dharmas attain freedom, without great or small, without long or short, ultimately liberated.”

All good men and women, diligently practice giving, diligently uphold the precepts, diligently cultivate diligence, diligently cultivate compassion, diligently cultivate forbearance, diligently cultivate wisdom. All Dharmas are named the great Dao-field. Future giving, future upholding of precepts, future diligence, future compassion, future forbearance, future wisdom—these virtues are complete and inconceivable.

If there are good men and women who deeply believe in the great Dharma, recite and contemplate this sutra, their merit will pervade the heavens, immeasurable. If someone receives, upholds, and makes offerings to this sutra, and expounds and circulates it for others, their wisdom will be like the light of the sun, shining without cease. As this wisdom is transmitted, it will moisten the seven generations of ancestors, all attaining liberation. The merit of the gods of the three realms and the grasses, trees, and grains of dust in number—compared to this merit, not one ten-thousandth part suffices.

Such a secret and true treasury is difficult to see or hear. Without profound past blessings and deep merit, one cannot encounter it. All the immortals and assembly, having heard this Great Vehicle, diligently cultivate and progress, proclaiming it to those who have not yet heard. If it is not circulated, all conditions will suddenly cease, the source of the Way will be blocked, and for countless kalpas, one will forever be separated from the causes of virtue.

Purify your minds, each and every one, and do not give rise to disbelief or slander the Great Vehicle, lest you incur grave retribution. From kalpas without measure have I cultivated without cease, transmigrating from body to body beyond count, with each thought continuing the last, seeking without respite. Having studied this Great Vehicle without retrogression, I have attained the supreme Dao. You must vow to deliver all beings, cherishing and pitying them all. You, the four assemblies, must practice compassion and employ skillful means to guide them.

At that moment, the divine immortals and the assembly trembled in awe, their bodies bathed in sweat, bearing the weight of their charge. They believed and reverently practiced.

At this time, royal law was pure and just, and people harbored compassionate hearts. The three evil destinies were extinguished, and the five desires did not arise. Then, the assembly of immortals rejoiced boundlessly, praising the subtle and wondrous virtue of the Dharma King, and they spoke in verse:

Our Master’s grace moistens without bound,
Beings receive their karma and are delivered according to their share.
Unchanging in nature and form, quiescent and unconditioned,
Virtue is complete, pervading all without exception.

We once practiced the lesser vehicle,
Through kalpas of toil and hardship, striving with diligence.
Now awakened to the Great Vehicle’s skillful means,
Without moving body or spirit, we naturally behold.

Subtle and profound, beyond thought or discussion,
Beings, minute and lost, stray from their original land.

At that time, the divine immortals praised the subtle and wondrous virtue of our Dharma King, benefiting the multitudes, delivering them from suffering, all receiving its moisture. The Great Vehicle is vast and boundless, beyond measure.

We, your assembly of disciples, each receive and uphold it. By past conditions, we are fortunate to have encountered this true sutra, revealed by the golden mouth, awakening to the supreme Dao.

The Heavenly Worthy said: The Dharma has no inside or outside, no length or shortness, no coming or going. Beings are weak and feeble, obscured by afflictions, forever unaware, dwelling in endless darkness, never to awaken. It is like the sun and moon, which shine impartially, yet the blind do not see. Beings, deluded in hearing, are likewise.

Furthermore, good men and women, it is like a jade mountain, luminous within and without, the jade emerging from the earth unstained. The original nature of beings is also thus. Deluded and inverted, they never awaken to understanding.

Again, I exhort you, great disciples: Establish your resolve, study diligently, practice earnestly without retreat. The subtle and divine spirits will naturally respond with fruition.

Moreover, there are gods of heaven and earth, each with their immortal officials, their ranks unequal, their distinctions manifold, each with their own hierarchy. Their deeds and karmic retributions differ, their kinds not the same. Even if one were to speak of them for the duration of a kalpa, they could not be exhausted. Yet, despite kalpas of toil and hardship, one would still not attain the Dao. Only through this sutra can the Dao be attained.

This true and secret treasury subdues external demons, as well as the gods of heaven and earth, the deities of the Five Peaks, the immortals of the grotto-heavens—all receive its share according to this sutra. This sutra is foremost, the king among all sutras, absolutely sovereign.

Then the Heavenly Worthy spoke in verse:

This sutra is originally subtle and wondrous,
Not something I can skillfully expound.
It reveals the old to suit conditions,
The wise hear and rejoice.

You, all my disciples,
Practice earnestly, do not neglect it.
This is not your lesser vehicle sutra,
Awakening slack, effort futile.

I now broadly illustrate with analogies,
The foolish hear and easily understand.
Words are shallow, principle profound and subtle,
Nearly attaining the fruit of non-arising.

The Dao is not within or without the mind,
Beings, bodies—equal to me.
Each of you reflect on this.
The wondrous Dharma is the land of equality.

The forest of wisdom and virtue,
Forgetting form, form naturally pervades.
Briefly praised in a single utterance,
The foolish and dull do not perceive.

At that time, as the Heavenly Worthy spoke these verses in praise, auspicious signs manifested among the gods, and natural spiritual responses arose. A hundred million wandering immortals simultaneously gathered in resonance; a hundred million youths arrived spontaneously from the void; a hundred million gentlemen heard and leapt with joy; a hundred million beings naturally turned toward it; a hundred million suns and moons shone together at once.

Then, the fragrance of *yuhui* reversed the wind, scattering through the Dharmas, the Dharmas clinging to defilements. The fragrance of *yuhui*, neither arising nor ceasing, at that time, all various kinds each bore their own fragrance, naturally *yuhui*, all exhaling their scents, entering the secret treasury. The subtlety and wonder of the Great Vehicle cannot be extolled in words.

At that time, there was a king named Heavenly Treasure. Witnessing these auspicious signs, he marveled at what he had never seen before, his joy boundless. His ministers and attendants, free from deceit and flattery, each guarded their stations, each with their own aspirations. The king commanded all within his domain to transcribe, receive, and uphold it, to make offerings. The merit and efficacy were such that the land became pure and serene, weapons stilled, people rejoiced, their lifespans lengthened, customs naturally harmonized, without hatred or vexation.

The divine immortals prostrated themselves to the ground and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "What we have seen today, we have never seen before; what we have heard today, we have never heard before. Is this a transformation of the Dharma, or is it divine manifestation? If it is a transformation, the Dharma should be without Dharma—how can the Dharma-less transform? If it transforms itself, then it is a Dharma, and the Dharma is impermanent—how can it transform?"

Their doubts unresolved, they entreated the Heavenly Worthy: "Out of compassion, pray resolve them for us."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "Excellent, excellent! The Great Vehicle is subtle and wondrous, neither existent nor non-existent, neither long nor short, neither great nor small, neither self-transforming nor transformed by another. Why is this so? Because the Dharma is sovereign, the Dharma is true and real, the Dharma is mysterious and wondrous, the Dharma is liberation, the Dharma is unborn, the Dharma is undying, the Dharma is unbound, the Dharma is unloosed, the Dharma is without hatred, the Dharma is without thought, the Dharma is without attachment, the Dharma is without estrangement. Therefore, the scriptures of the Great Vehicle thoroughly penetrate the nature of things, not relying on deluded speech."

The assembly of divine immortals, having heard this, deepened their understanding, their virtue increasing. The six penetrations and wisdom, the perfection of precepts, giving and conduct all found their place, diligence unobstructed, patience and compassion, wisdom and liberation—all realized their original subtlety, equal in one taste, ascending the mountain of spiritual understanding, attaining the supreme Dao.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the Youth of True Treasury: "You have deeply savored the flavor of the Dharma, fully illumined its principle, and your wisdom flows like a spring, your talents sufficient for entry and exit, expounding what has not been heard, resolving the practices of all immortals, guiding them according to conditions as if pointing to your palm. Such merit is profound and far-reaching, beyond all comparison. Even if one were to give away ten thousand pounds of gold in almsgiving, its merit would not equal one ten-thousandth of this. If one receives, upholds, lectures on, praises, or recites it, the merit is vast and boundless, no different in the slightest from the former merit. Why is this so? Because the Dharma is subtle and wondrous, the Dharma is profound and far-reaching, the Dharma is unborn, the Dharma is undying, the Dharma brings benefit.

"Furthermore, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the assembly of divine immortals: 'The Dharma has no before or after; those with virtue are supreme. The Dharma has no great or small; those who awaken are complete.' The Youth of True Treasury’s merit and practice are profound and far-reaching, worthy to serve as a model for all beings. Though you have awakened, you have not yet exhausted the depths of mystery. By relying on a master and upholding the lineage, you can extinguish the outflows of the mind and only then attain wisdom and understanding.

"Good men and women, each of you must diligently practice, deeply believe in the Great Dharma, cultivate the Ten Straight Minds, the Ten Straight Practices, the Nine Dharma Minds, the Nine Dharma Practices, the Eight Right Minds, the Eight Right Practices, the Seven Awakening Minds, the Seven Awakening Practices, the Six Wisdom Minds, the Six Wisdom Practices, the Five Liberation Minds, the Five Liberation Practices, the Four Immeasurable Minds, the Four Immeasurable Practices, the Three Concentration Minds, the Three Concentration Practices, the Two Reception Minds, and the Two Reception Practices. By cultivating such practices, you will thoroughly understand worldly toil, exhaust all dharma realms, and your merit will be vast and boundless, beyond all description.

"When the assembly of divine immortals heard this Dharma treasure and clearly understood its origins, they rejoiced and leapt for joy, shaking the great earth. All beings awakened—those who had not heard now heard, those who had not seen now saw, those who had not known now knew, those who had not believed now believed, those who had not been liberated were now liberated. All the myriad kinds of beings were fully nourished. Without leaving their original lands, the divine immortals arrived at the Mountain of Spiritual Understanding, abiding in eternal joy and freedom, and departed with reverent bows.

Thus concludes *Fascicle Eight of the Supreme, Esoteric, True Treasury Sutra*.
*Fascicle Nine of the Supreme, Esoteric, True Treasury Sutra*."

**Chapter on Illuminating Conduct**

At that time, the Youth of True Treasury, with refined and graceful steps, approached the Heavenly Worthy amidst the great assembly. He respectfully inquired of the Dao, seeking to resolve the doubts of the multitude:

"We do not yet understand—how are we to guide and inspire those beings in the lower realms who follow external paths and are most difficult to teach? They do not believe in the true and supreme Great Dao. How may we lead them to faith and devotion?

Moreover, what I expound is clear in scripture and rare in the world. Those who oppose the Great Vehicle claim their own way as true. There are also various ghosts, mixed spirits, and demonic forces that confuse and obstruct the true understanding of the Great Dao. Then there are followers of the Lesser Vehicle who calculate merits and establish ranks, refusing to believe in the true scriptures, clinging to emptiness and quiescence. And there are beings of dull faculties who, upon hearing, slander and revile. How are we to transform and deliver them?

The Heavenly Worthy has said that the Dao encompasses all without exclusion, pervades all without omission, and that the nature of all dharmas is equal. Why then do their orientations differ, and why do the dharmas manifest distinctions? The assembly remains perplexed, their insight not yet profound. We pray that, according to their roots, you reveal the truth so that all may awaken and understand."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "All you disciples, listen carefully and reflect well. I shall now explain to you.

Heaven is high and earth is low—yet in equality, there is no distinction.
Mountains, rivers, and seas—yet in equality, there is no distinction.
All mixed kinds of beings—yet in equality, there is no distinction.
The realms of the Three Clarities and the beings of the lower worlds—yet in equality, there is no distinction.
Deceptive words that confuse the true—yet in equality, there is no distinction.
The scriptures and teachings for beings—yet in equality, there is no distinction.

All dharmas arise from the great emptiness, where the unequal is made equal.

If one is burdened by worldly dust, this is called treading the deviant path, also named slandering the Dharma—it is not called proper orientation.
If one believes in the Great Vehicle yet strays from the conduct of the Lesser Vehicle, this is treading the deviant path, also named slandering the Dharma—it is not called proper orientation.
If one believes in the Lesser Vehicle yet strays from the conduct of the Great Vehicle, this is treading the deviant path, also named slandering the Dharma—it is not called proper orientation.
If one receives beings yet fails to dispel the three delusions, this is treading the deviant path, also named slandering the Dharma—it is not called proper orientation.
If beings do not believe in the Great Vehicle, this is treading the deviant path, also named slandering the Dharma—it is not called proper orientation.
If beings do not believe in the scriptural teachings, this is treading the deviant path, also named slandering the Dharma—it is not called proper orientation.
If beings speak of others’ faults and virtues, this is treading the deviant path, also named slandering the Dharma—it is not called proper orientation.

Such slander of the Dharma varies in depth and shallowness.

If one is burdened by worldly dust and afflictions are not exhausted, the source of the Dao remains unseen.
If one believes in the Great Vehicle yet strays from the Lesser Vehicle, the source of the mind is unclear, and craving for goodness knows no end.
If one believes in the Lesser Vehicle yet strays from the Great Vehicle, grasping and rejecting never cease, and the mind is darkened by many delusions.
If one receives beings yet fails to dispel the three delusions, seeking mind with mind, thoughts arise without end.
If beings do not believe in the Great Vehicle, they wander in delusion and inversion, losing their filial and compassionate mother.
If beings do not believe in the scriptural teachings, they are foolish, benighted, and blocked, never hearing the sound of the Dharma.
If beings speak of others’ faults and virtues, extolling their own goodness while harboring greed and attachment, their karmic offenses are profound. Even if one were to speak of them for kalpas, they could not be exhausted."

The Youth further asked: "Beings of deviant and true paths differ in faith and conduct. Those who tread the deviant path are called slanderers of the Dharma. But are those who tread the true path also slanderers of the Dharma, or are they not?

Moreover, the Dao is fundamentally empty and quiescent. If emptiness and quiescence are the Dao, then when beings slander the Dharma, is this not also emptiness and quiescence, thus the root of the Dao? Why then is it called slandering the Dharma? If it is not the root of the Dao, it is called deviant conduct. But if those who tread the true path are also deviant, are they not also slanderers of the Dharma?

Why is this? Beings are themselves the embodiment of the Dao, yet their actions differ. How then can there be distinctions? If there are distinctions, then deviance and truth differ, and beings are not the embodiment of the Dao—thus both deviance and truth are slander of the Dharma. Why then does the Heavenly Worthy diligently practice the true path?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Why do you again raise such doubts? Deviance and truth share a single root, a single gate to liberation. Though they are of one body, they do not arise from a single source.

Why is this? Those who tread the deviant path are overwhelmed by inversion, their minds entangled in afflictions, thus straying from the true path. Those who tread the true path are without reliance, without opposition, without quiescence, without extinction—quiescence and extinction are but provisional names.

Beings grasp and reject, relying on opposition. They falsely conceive existence as real, thus creating reliance and opposition. The opposition of birth and death, the opposition of karmic retribution, the opposition of good and evil, the opposition of cyclic existence—karmic retribution is endless, and deviant conditions never cease."

The Youth further asked: "If the Dao gives birth to the myriad things, then it is the mother of all things. Is the mother the same as beings? Are inversion, discrimination, delusion, deviant views, grasping and rejecting, cyclic existence, and the manifold karmic retributions—are all these also the Dao?

If so, then there is no distinction between good and evil, and thus beings manifest inversion and differentiation. But if there is inversion and differentiation, then the Great Vehicle expounded by the Heavenly Worthy—without person, without self, without great, without small, without high, without low, without long, without short, without the five constant virtues, without the turning of the six senses—would this not be slandering the Dharma and deceiving beings?"

The Heavenly Worthy smiled, responding to the ten directions. Each saw the Heavenly Worthy simultaneously let forth a smile. The realms of the gods were likewise transformed; all mixed kinds of beings universally rejoiced. The assembly, including the Youth of True Treasury, marveled at what they had never before witnessed—subtle and supreme beyond compare.

Though they knew the Dao was wondrous, they had not yet exhausted its wondrous source. They did not yet understand whether the wondrous Dao was difficult to fathom, nor whether beings were the wondrous Dao or not. If they were the wondrous Dao, then there would be no beings. But if there were beings, then there would be no wondrous Dao. The four assemblies were all perplexed.

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "The wondrous Dharma is without wonder. How then can there be beings to manifest?

If there are no beings to manifest, why then does the Heavenly Worthy expound the Dharma to guide and inspire?"

"If there is guidance and inspiration, then there are beings—why then speak of no mark of beings? Sentient beings of faith, not yet penetrating the nature of dharma, still harbor doubts—how much less could other beings come to believe?

I only pray the Heavenly Worthy will explain according to their roots."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "I speak a single word, and goodness unfolds across the ten directions. All the dust-mote multitudes of the dharma-realm are fully revealed and illuminated. Yet you, my assembly, find it difficult to awaken, difficult to hear.

Beings move with one mark and two practices—practice in one mark.
Beings move with one mark and three practices—practice in one mark.
Beings move with one mark and four practices—practice in one mark.
Beings move with one mark and five practices—practice in one mark.
Beings move with one mark and six practices—practice in one mark.
Beings move with one mark and seven practices—practice in one mark.
Beings move with one mark and eight practices—practice in one mark.
Beings move with one mark and nine practices—practice in one mark.
Beings move with one mark and ten practices—practice in one mark.

Thus, practice after practice, penetrating the source of wisdom, all attain liberation—this is called supreme joy. Called supreme joy, arriving at Spirit-Understanding Mountain, neither arising nor ceasing.

Furthermore, it is neither mind nor non-mind, nor neither non-mind;
neither form nor non-form, nor neither non-form;
neither self nor non-self, nor neither non-self;
neither condition nor non-condition, nor neither non-condition;
neither thought nor non-thought, nor neither non-thought.

Thus, practice after practice, the Dao-eye is purified, and so one fully possesses all measureless merits and virtues. Wisdom is perfected, arriving at Spirit-Understanding Mountain, abiding in constant peace and joy.

Joy gives rise to the three karmas, afflictions increasingly entangle, the true nature is not manifest, and deluded confusion runs deep. With various analogies, they do not awaken to themselves.

What are the three karmas?
First, greed and love: thoughts and considerations arise endlessly, scheming without cease. Once the nature of greed arises, one is deluded and lost on the path. The six senses gallop unchecked, uncontrollable, and one strays from the precepts.
Second, anger and hatred: external stimuli stir the emotions, and resentment knows no end. One strays from the practice of concentration.
Third, ignorance and darkness: benighted and unenlightened, the five senses are entangled, evil karma linked endlessly, for kalpas without cease. One strays from the wisdom of liberation.

These three karmas, when received, can extinguish the seed of the Dao. Yet these same three karmas, when practiced, can plant the fruit of the Dao. Why is this?

First, abandoning the worldly, the mind dwells beyond its bounds. Conduct and karma pervade all, cutting off the seed of greed, reaching directly to the bodhimanda—this is the Mahāyāna precepts.
Second, in all practices there is no depth, no reception, no contact. Loving-kindness for beings brings boundless joy. The roots of goodness are liberated—this is the Mahāyāna concentration.
Third, penetrating the understanding of beings, the five senses, six contacts, afflictions, and karmic conditions are revealed without obstruction, entering directly into the bodhimanda—this is the Mahāyāna wisdom.

Furthermore, good men, these three karmas—whether they lead to delusion or liberation—all arise from the mind. Of all dharmas, the mind is the root; good and evil arise from the mind.

The mind is not within, nor is it without; neither near nor far, neither coarse nor subtle, neither large nor small, neither long nor short, neither round nor square. Good and evil are self-arising. For those who create evil karma, karmic retribution arrives immediately. Past lives are bound, future lives are bound, the present life is bound—dust-mote kalpas all become enemies, cutting off the seeds of the Dao. For those who create good karma, the fruit of the Dao arrives immediately. Past lives are liberated, future lives are liberated, the present life is liberated—dust-mote kalpas all become good causes, cutting off the seeds of evil.

Again, it is asked: Since the mind is neither within nor without, neither long nor short, neither large nor small, utterly without mark, and also without non-mark—how then does good and evil arise immediately? When good arrives, there is liberation; when evil arrives, there is bondage.

I only pray the Heavenly Worthy, in compassion, will consider us, that all may be clearly understood."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "It is like a mirror and its image—forms are distinctly reflected. If one says it exists, one cannot grasp it; if one says it does not exist, the image is clearly seen. Know then that it is neither existent nor non-existent, yet beauty and ugliness are immediately apparent.

The preceding mind and the following mind—mind after mind—continue in succession. Though there is no mark of good or evil, it is through the discrimination of the two views, slandering right and praising wrong, destroying good and extolling evil, that all is created by the mind. This is called an ordinary being. In the realm of gain and loss, one takes loss as loss.

The practitioner, in cultivation, illuminates the true nature of things, without the mark of discrimination, without the mark of good and evil, without the mark of self and others—this is not called an ordinary being. In true reality, one takes gain as gain.

In brief, the conduct of the mind reveals the disparity between gain and loss. How much more so the myriad distinctions of ordinary calculations? Though the paths are ten thousand, those who attain it are one.

Again, it is asked: When one attains the One, is it the One? Or is it not the One? If it is the One, there should be two dharmas; if the One is not the One, then the One is unattainable. How then is the One attained?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "It is like the character for 'foot'—one hundred and one, yet not two; neither bound nor liberated, neither empty nor non-empty.

What is called attaining the One? It is realizing the principle of emptiness, realizing that there is nothing to affirm—this is called attaining the One. Not destroying all dharmas is called the mark of emptiness. The mark of emptiness is called the body of the Dao, and is also called merit and virtue. Thus, broadly speaking, the causes and conditions of merit and virtue are boundless."

The Youth of True Treasury and the assembly bowed their heads and asked: "The two paths of origin and trace—how can there be two? Is there a trace within the origin, or an origin within the trace? If there is a trace within the origin, then with a trace, there should be no origin; if there is an origin within the trace, then with an origin, there should be no trace. It is like existence and emptiness: if there is existence, there is no emptiness; if there is emptiness, there is no existence. How then can origin and trace be simultaneously revealed?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "In truth, there is no duality. Opening the gate of expedient means, the trace is the origin. The origin has no trace; without trace, there is no origin—this is called the true origin."

All dharmas, being inseparable from the origin, are thus called dharmas. The nature of dharmas being apart, it is called the origin of the Dao. When the mind-water is limpid and clear, the true origin is seen—neither real nor false, distinctly and lucidly.

The assembly of True Treasury and others awakened to the Great Vehicle, rejoicing without end, and spoke these verses:

The Great Vehicle is no deception,
Widely spread among gods and humans.
Its benefits extend to boundless beings,
Neither fruit nor cause.
All beings who hear it awaken,
Naturally attain liberation.
We have diligently cultivated with effort,
Enduring hardships across kalpas.
The root of the three karmas is concentration and wisdom,
Sought within the realm of words.
Ordinary beings, long deluded,
Lose their way in discrimination.
The Heavenly Worthy often teaches,
Using expedient means to ferry beings.
Each of the three karmas receives,
Within the Dharma, the Heavenly Scriptures.
The subtle marks of cause and effect,
Thus form a forest of merit and virtue.
We, the assembly of disciples,
Have never heard such words before.
Adapting to all lands and realms,
All beings rejoice in kind.
Its hidden merits are unfathomable,
The heart’s vision too profound to express.
I urge the carefree ones:
Strive to seek the true Dao.
The world is neither real nor unreal,
Detach from marks to roam the spirit.
By the power of True Treasury’s merit,
Delusion, stinginess, greed, and anger are shattered.
The four assemblies all rejoice,
Attaining the Dharma in perfect roundness.

Then, the Youth of True Treasury and the four assemblies, having spoken these verses, rejoiced in the Heavenly Worthy’s merit and expedient means, his teaching of the subtle and wondrous Dharma, and his vast deliverance of beings through unseen virtue, uncontrived. They asked: "Beings differ in their distinctions, their practices unequal, their faculties deep or shallow. Why does the Heavenly Worthy speak of the 'complete character'? Are all beings this 'complete character' or not? If they are, their faculties should be equal, and all should awaken to understanding. If they are not, what benefit is there in the Heavenly Worthy’s teaching of it?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "I speak of the 'complete character,' which all dharmas share. All beings are this 'complete character,' all perfectly equal. Though they differ in a thousand ways and myriad forms, none ultimately depart from it. Ordinary beings, deluded, do not awaken to this knowledge. Through gradual teachings and expedient guidance, the lower-rooted beings are taught the Dharma of existence, seeing marks and generating goodness. Middle-rooted beings are taught emptiness and existence; upon hearing of emptiness and existence, they generate faith and aspiration. Upper-rooted beings are taught non-emptiness, non-existence, neither emptiness nor non-emptiness, neither existence nor non-existence. Those who hear this teaching awaken with an empty mind. Though the teachings differ, they spread virtue according to conditions—all are the 'complete character,' prescribing medicine for the illness. Those who awaken to the 'complete character' transcend words and teachings. If the illness does not meet the medicine, there will be no cure or harm. Beings who do not believe in the Great Vehicle will never awaken to understanding. Therefore, this sutra can shatter beings’ afflictions, the darkness of ignorance, cleanse beings of defilements and evil dust, pacify the suffering of birth and death, bring peace and joy to beings’ families, enable beings to serve their lords and fathers with filial piety, grant beings long life and wealth, bestow upon beings the strength of vajra, endow beings with great wisdom, inspire beings to kindness, love, and filial devotion, free beings from fear, grant beings mastery over the Dharma, and enable beings to transcend birth and extinction. The power of this sutra’s merit and virtue is so profound that no analogy can encompass its bounds."

They further asked: "The three vehicles’ teachings adapt to the three roots, dispensing virtue according to faculties. How can the most foolish and lowest beings, who do not understand generosity or recognize human propriety, be transformed and delivered?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Though the three vehicles are designated, the paths of transformation are boundless. If one can believe with reverence, make offerings of banners and flowers, copy and uphold the scripture, the merit is immense and immeasurable. Compared to such giving, the merit of other acts of generosity does not amount to one ten-thousandth."

They asked again: "Those who can thus receive, uphold, and make offerings must be upper-rooted, wise individuals, not the foolish and ignorant. The assembly remains in doubt, their questions unresolved."

The Heavenly Worthy continued: "All who have ears and eyes can be roused—this is not limited to the three vehicles but encompasses all manner of expedient means. The innate nature of the dull-witted resides in spiritual understanding; with redirection, they will arrive. This sutra is profound and wondrous, foremost among all scriptures. First, it reveals other practices to sever external demons. When external demons are vanquished, internal practices are subdued. The city’s defenses are fortified, and all thieves are forever cut off. Merit and adornment are complete and perfect, all-knowledge is attained, and liberation is effortless. The Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions attain all-knowledge, their wisdom and understanding boundless. Arriving at the Mountain of Spiritual Understanding, they accomplish the supreme Dao, ultimate purity, and sever all paths of leakage. All dharmas are thus the true mark; all afflictions become the seed of wisdom. This is the path of the practitioner, the root of merit and virtue. You, the four assemblies, have realized the subtle and wondrous body, entered the secret treasury, and transcended birth and death. Entering the five turbidities, you transform and deliver beings, manifesting expedient wisdom according to the three karmas. Why is this so? The great sages of the ten directions who realize the wondrous body do so through the arising of afflictions within, not from without. It is naturally subtle, formless, and markless.

Furthermore, all dharmas are not fabricated, not born-and-dying, not formerly existent, not now non-existent. They are serene and naturally so, in harmony with the Heavenly Worthy’s virtue. Yet when all beings hear such words, they may generate slanderous thoughts and deepen their delusion. Nevertheless, though it runs counter to convention, its merit is profound, its benefits vast and far-reaching.

Furthermore, in practicing the true path, detach from all marks, seal the principle of non-arising, and sever delusion. Become one with the Dao, neither born nor extinguished, neither coming nor going. Why is this so? Because the wondrous Dao is quiescent and extinct. Quiescence and extinction give rise to birth and death, to coming and going, to movement and turning, to karmic actions."

All dharmas are capable of giving birth and nurturing. The dharmas of birth and nurturing manifest in diverse forms and excellences—some roam freely at ease, some dwell in constant suffering; some abide in wealth and nobility, some reside in poverty and lowliness; some possess graceful beauty, some bear ugly countenances. Though myriad in differences and countless in varieties, all are the wondrous Dao, quiescent and non-active.

Ordinary beings fail to comprehend this, generating delusion within themselves. At that time, the Heavenly Worthy, wishing to reveal the wondrous scripture of the Great Vehicle’s true treasury, spoke in verse:

The essence neither arises nor ceases,
Dharma marks naturally penetrate the mysterious.
All sensations remain ever pure,
The non-active nature is inherently empty.
The virtue of the Heavenly Worthies in the ten directions
Is shared equally by all beings.
You all should revere and respect,
Cultivate practice to establish great merit.

The fragrant mansion of the five aggregates
Is profound, without beginning or end.
The three karmas—precepts, concentration, wisdom—
Neither go nor come.
The Dao’s mark is unfathomable,
Its manifestations encompass all without exception.
I expound the wisdom of expedient means,
The wondrous Dharma transcends the three realms.

Revealing the root of merit and virtue,
The world’s womb nurtures a jade embryo.
Those who cultivate the supreme Dao
Will naturally open the six consciousnesses.
Awakening to the Dharma’s upright wisdom,
The three poisons will all be turned back.
Abiding in the Dharma with mastery,
For ten thousand kalpas, no calamity will befall.

Beings dwell in the long night of suffering,
Unaware that their years and lives waste away.
The wheel of rebirth turns without end,
Seeking pleasures, ignorant of sorrow.
I lament your foolish and deluded kind,
Who do not believe in the Great Vehicle sutras.
Abandoning true parents,
You cultivate evil as causes and conditions.

Without encountering good spiritual friends,
There is no way to create a field of merit.
Those who practice this sutra
Will awaken to all dharmas beforehand.

At that time, having spoken these verses, the Heavenly Worthy praised its merits, revealed the marks of all dharmas, and demonstrated that the Great Vehicle sutra encompasses all without exception—nothing is too vast to contain, nothing too minute to enter. It ferries all beings, guiding them into the treasure of the Dharma.

All beings and good spiritual friends should diligently practice and study this sutra. Its merit is the greatest, the root of all dharmas, the boat and ferry of the Dharma, the ladder and steps of the Dharma. Swift and rapid, it cures all illnesses, serving as the great king of physicians. With various remedies, it administers medicine according to the disease, ensuring none fail to recover.

You, the assembly, should broadly transform sentient conditions. Observe their karmic tendencies, do not act with self-interest, and accord with their inherent nature. When nature is contrary, discord arises; when nature is harmonious, tranquility and joy follow. Losing one’s nature brings sorrow.

It was further asked: How does one cultivate the nature of tranquility and joy?

The Heavenly Worthy replied: The practice of the five constants is all tranquility and joy, inherently without conflict. It is beings’ delusion—grasping and rejecting through desire—that loses the practice of tranquility and joy, causing all conflicts.

Deep attachment to external dusts loses the practice of tranquility and joy—this is called conflict.
The five aggregates failing to penetrate loses the practice of tranquility and joy—this is called conflict.

Practicing generosity is called tranquility and joy;
Practicing precepts is called tranquility and joy;
Practicing wisdom is called tranquility and joy;
Reciting and chanting is called tranquility and joy;
Copying scriptures is called tranquility and joy;
Making offerings is called tranquility and joy;
Receiving and upholding is called tranquility and joy;
Expounding and teaching is called tranquility and joy;
Cultivating contemplation is called tranquility and joy;
Practicing detachment is called tranquility and joy.

I speak of generosity, yet not generosity—this is called tranquility and joy;
I speak of precepts, yet not precepts—this is called tranquility and joy;
I speak of wisdom, yet not wisdom—this is called tranquility and joy;
I speak of recitation, yet not recitation—this is called tranquility and joy;
I speak of copying, yet not copying—this is called tranquility and joy;
I speak of offerings, yet not offerings—this is called tranquility and joy;
I speak of expounding, yet not expounding—this is called tranquility and joy;
I speak of all practices, yet not practices—this is called tranquility and joy;
I speak of all dharmas, yet not dharmas—this is called tranquility and joy;
I speak of cultivating the Dao, yet not cultivating the Dao—this is called tranquility and joy;
I speak of one or two, yet not one or two—this is called tranquility and joy;
I speak of the true treasury, yet not the true treasury—this is called tranquility and joy;
I speak of original nature, yet not original nature—this is called tranquility and joy;
I speak of parables, yet not parables—this is called tranquility and joy;
I speak of the Small Vehicle, yet not the Small Vehicle—this is called tranquility and joy;
I speak of the Great Vehicle, yet not the Great Vehicle—this is called tranquility and joy.

The practice of tranquility and joy is neither great nor small, neither long nor short, neither broad nor narrow, neither going nor coming. It is neither form nor sound nor touch.

It was further asked: Is the essence of tranquility and joy the essence of the Dao?

The Heavenly Worthy replied: All dharmas are the essence of the Dao; all dharmas are tranquility and joy. Though bearing two names, they are one body. I speak of one body, yet not one body—this is called one body.

Good men and women, do not grasp at words, do not cling to language.
The nature of words is detachment—cultivate practice through detachment from marks;
The Dao is severed from language—cultivate practice through severing marks;
The mind’s locus is extinguished—cultivate practice through extinguishing marks;
The nature of the five aggregates is empty—cultivate practice through emptiness;
The nature of the three karmas is pure—cultivate practice through purity;
The six consciousnesses abide eternally—cultivate practice through abiding;
The four great elements are ever-permeable—cultivate practice through permeability.

Those who practice thus accumulate vast merit, rescue boundless beings, ferry them across the sea of birth and death, and reach the mountain of spiritual liberation, attaining mastery and freedom.

At that time, the Youth of the True Treasury and the four assemblies bowed their heads in reverence and praised: Excellent! Excellent! The Heavenly Worthy’s profound wisdom has revealed the subtle and wondrous meaning of the Great Vehicle. We, your assembly, each tranquilly abide in the source of the mind, compassionately aiding and delivering with unseen merit—this is not something the Two Vehicles can comprehend.

Moreover, within the marks of all dharmas, the source of great wisdom is revealed, accomplishing the supreme Dao. Clothed in the blessings of future lives, all will easily awaken. The Great Vehicle is equal and impartial, equaling all marks, unbiased and unpartisan. It bestows upon those who can practice, without distinction of low or high.

Know that the Heavenly Worthy is the father and mother of all beings, the bridge for all beings, broadly bestowing teachings, opening and enlightening their ears and eyes, upholding and exalting the Three Treasures, turning the wheel without end. We, your assembly, each arouse great intention, proclaiming the wondrous Dharma, revealing it to future beings, that they may hear the true Dharma. Having attained the true Dharma, fathers and sons, wives and children will abide in unceasing bliss.

The Heavenly Worthy further said: This sutra has existed since kalpas without measure, neither ending nor decaying, delivering countless beings. Even if expounded for an entire kalpa, it could not be exhausted. Those who attain the Dao transmit it without interruption, for only through this sutra may the fruit of the Dao be realized. Without this sutra, there would be none. This sutra is spiritually efficacious, swifter than echo and shadow. In times of urgent peril, if one recites this sutra, calamities will immediately dissipate, and one will naturally be protected.

In the past, the Jade Seal Youth burned incense in offering and recited this sutra. Suddenly, immortal youths and jade maidens filled the empty sky, all arriving at once. They burned rare incense that reversed the wind’s direction, chanting the numinous scripture, startling the entire kingdom. The Jade Seal Youth remained unperturbed, his recitation uninterrupted. The assembly of True Treasury and the others fell silent, bowed their heads in reverence, and departed.

Thus concludes *Fascicle Nine of the Supreme Esoteric Treasury of the Womb Sutra*.
*Fascicle Ten of the Supreme Esoteric Treasury of the Womb Sutra* begins.

**The Chapter on Ultimate Realization**

At that time, the Heavenly Venerable, leading his assembly of disciples, manifested his merit and virtue upon Spirit Understanding Mountain. Countless lands were all moistened by his wisdom, innumerable beings attained liberation, boundless dharma realms all heard and understood, immeasurable followers of the Lesser Vehicle awakened to comprehension, countless perfected immortals revealed their merit, limitless retinues received and upheld the sutra, innumerable youths expounded the True Treasury, boundless superior beings embodied the Great Vehicle, measureless middling beings practiced offerings, numberless lesser beings generated faith, legions of lion-like guardians defended the Dharma citadel, and hosts of vajras severed delusions and demonic obstructions.

Then, the Heavenly Venerable emitted a radiance of wisdom, illuminating the eastern direction. In countless lands, each according to their kind, received its nourishment. Witnessing this divine transformation, they followed the light and came, yet without leaving their native realms, they beheld the Heavenly Venerable. They bowed their heads to the Supreme Venerable, bowed their heads to the Supreme Dharma, and took refuge in the Supreme Master.

Again, he illuminated the southern direction, countless lands, each according to their kind, receiving its nourishment. Witnessing this divine transformation, they followed the light and came, yet without leaving their native realms, they beheld the Heavenly Venerable. They bowed their heads to the Supreme Venerable, bowed their heads to the Supreme Dharma, and took refuge in the Supreme Master.

Again, he illuminated the western direction, countless lands, each according to their kind, receiving its nourishment. Witnessing this divine transformation, they followed the light and came, yet without leaving their native realms, they beheld the Heavenly Venerable. They bowed their heads to the Supreme Venerable, bowed their heads to the Supreme Dharma, and took refuge in the Supreme Master.

Again, he illuminated the northern direction, countless lands, each according to their kind, receiving its nourishment. Witnessing this divine transformation, they followed the light and came, yet without leaving their native realms, they beheld the Heavenly Venerable. They bowed their heads to the Supreme Venerable, bowed their heads to the Supreme Dharma, and took refuge in the Supreme Master.

Again, he illuminated the realms above, countless heavens, each according to their kind, receiving its nourishment. Witnessing this divine transformation, they followed the light and came, yet without shifting their positions, they beheld the Heavenly Venerable. They bowed their heads to the Supreme Venerable, bowed their heads to the Supreme Dharma, and took refuge in the Supreme Master.

Again, he illuminated the boundless worlds below, each according to their kind, receiving its nourishment. Witnessing this divine transformation, they followed the light and came, yet without leaving their abodes, they beheld the Heavenly Venerable. They bowed their heads to the Supreme Venerable, bowed their heads to the Supreme Dharma, and took refuge in the Supreme Master.

Again, he illuminated the hells, where suffering beings endured torment. Each according to their karmic retribution, they attained liberation. Witnessing this divine transformation, they followed the light and emerged, yet without leaving their places, they beheld the Heavenly Venerable. They bowed their heads to the Supreme Venerable, bowed their heads to the Supreme Dharma, and took refuge in the Supreme Master.

Then, the Heavenly Venerable addressed all who had come: "For you, I remain within the illusory, falsely generating karmic bonds, beset by the sorrows of birth and death, unable to awaken and comprehend. There are also immortals who practice the Lesser Vehicle; though they attain long life, they ultimately return to transformation. Why? Because they are burdened by karmic retribution. Now, turn your minds toward the Great Vehicle, take refuge in it, listen carefully, and reflect well—I shall expound it for you.

I emit this divine radiance, illuminating the ten directions and countless lands. You each see this wondrous and sublime light, rare and unparalleled, yet do not recognize its source. This light is neither external nor internal, neither blue nor white, neither red nor black. It transcends all forms and colors, attaining self-mastery. Each of you possesses this light—it is neither near nor far. It manifests in phenomena, producing the five sounds yet not the five sounds; the five colors yet not the five colors; the five flavors yet not the five flavors; forms and images yet not forms and images; wisdom yet not wisdom; liberation yet not liberation; subtlety yet not subtlety; purity yet not purity; immovability yet not immovability; grasping and rejecting yet not grasping and rejecting; coming and going yet not coming and going; quiescence yet not quiescence; right and wrong yet not right and wrong. This brief demonstration of the light reveals not even a thousandth or ten-thousandth of its fullness.

Good sons and daughters, do not be startled or doubtful, nor generate regret. Through countless kalpas, I have cultivated the Great Vehicle, seated in contemplation and walking in observation, never losing the four proper attitudes. Thus, through eons of time, enduring hardships and trials, I attained the fruit of the Dao. Yet among you, my retinues, your capacity to receive varies, and many harbor doubts. Why do you not ask? Now, I shall reveal the profound and wondrous principle one final time, making it easy for you to understand. Do not harbor disbelief or persist in delusion. In but a moment, you shall witness it for yourselves."

Before his words were finished, a sudden divine transformation occurred. A voice resounded in the empty sky, shaking heaven and earth, altering the courses of sun and moon, startling all beings. Even the lowliest creatures transformed in an instant, their whereabouts unknown. The prisoners of the five sufferings all attained liberation. The assembly of immortals and others came through the sky, arriving at Spirit Understanding Mountain. As one, they bowed their heads, gazing upon the Heavenly Venerable with boundless joy. Together, they raised their voices, extolling the Great Compassionate Venerable, who manifested wondrous virtue, extraordinary majesty, and myriad expedient means—able to create and destroy, to refine and coarsen, to lengthen and shorten—beyond all conception.

They asked, "We do not know whether this wondrous and extraordinary transformation, surpassing all forms and colors, arises from the Dharma’s inherent marvel or from the Heavenly Venerable’s divine power."

The Heavenly Venerable replied, "Excellent question. All dharmas are self-mastering, neither coarse nor refined, neither inherently existent nor created by me. I and you are not different; you and I are also not different. I and all beings, all beings and I—what transforms and moves is none other than true wisdom, the self-manifestation of the Dharma-nature. This self-manifestation is neither form nor non-form, neither dharma nor non-dharma, pure and self-mastering, liberated and unconditioned."

At that time, the four assemblies, hearing of these auspicious signs—neither internal nor external, neither real nor false, each abiding in their own nature—remained in serene quiescence, without illumination.

The four assemblies all arrived, yet without leaving their original realms they beheld other lands; without destroying dharmic appearances, dharmic appearances were self-mastering; without destroying afflictions, afflictions became pure; without destroying birth-and-death, birth-and-death was liberated; without destroying going and coming, going and coming were without self; without destroying right and wrong, right and wrong had no master; without destroying wisdom, wisdom entered quiescent extinction.

Our assembly has long studied the sutras, yet never before heard such a teaching. We have traversed famous mountains and grottoes, the palaces of immortals, each containing scriptures of the immortals—countless volumes. Having briefly perused them over many kalpas, we learned various teachings and arts of longevity, cultivating goodness through external seeking while harboring self and others within. Lacking skillful wisdom, we displayed our own abilities, forcibly transforming external conditions, yet remained ignorant of our own conditions. Our past efforts were but vain toil and suffering, for we never encountered the true sutra. Today, we witness the Heavenly Venerable revealing this wondrous medicine, manifesting the *True Treasury Sutra* to resolve the essential meaning for living beings. Through our past karmic affinities and the depth of our accumulated merit, we have heard this sutra. In less than a month, without progress or regression, we awakened to the Great Vehicle, reaching the Mountain of Spiritual Understanding, where all obstructions dissolved.

The Heavenly Venerable then addressed the great disciples and all present: "This sutra has existed unharmed for immeasurable kalpas, its divine power subtle and wondrous, its majestic presence vast, giving rise to heavens and establishing the earth, its transformations boundless. You should exhort others to receive, uphold, and make offerings to it, to transcribe and circulate it. The merit is immense, the blessings infinite. Those who slander or disbelieve this sutra will in this life invite calamity—demonic and evil spirits will arise unexpectedly. Observe carefully: confusion over poverty or low status, confusion over illness or disease, confusion over suffering or affliction, confusion over deafness or blindness, confusion over muteness or speechlessness—all arise from karmic conditions, their retribution unerring. Confusion before and after—each should be cautious of these. In cultivating the body and establishing conduct, there are five virtues of blessing. What are the five virtues of blessing? Diligence in reverence, diligence in compassion, diligence in forbearance, diligence in vigor, and diligence in generosity.

What is reverence? Reverence has two aspects: first, upon seeing forms, one reveres external appearances, so that others come to trust; second, one illuminates the inherently luminous nature, equal to the true Dao and dharma. Practicing such reverence is called right understanding.

What is compassion? Compassion also has two aspects: first, pitying and cherishing living beings; second, the power of compassion to break through existence and establish the truth. Practicing such compassion is called delivering beings.

What is forbearance? Forbearance also has two aspects: first, when evil karma externally touches one, the mind endures without generating resentment; second, without self, externally free from dust and burdens, one attains mastery of the dharma. Practicing such forbearance is called equal nature.

What is vigor? It also has two kinds: first, single-minded focus, steadfast resolve, desiring others’ respect; second, inner practice, illuminating the wondrous mind of things, without the marks of self or others, without the marks of going or coming, constantly practicing and illuminating, realizing the fruit without error. This is called vigor.

What is generosity? It also has two aspects: first, material giving, where use is incomplete and merit imperfect; second, dharma giving, where wisdom abides in the heart and pervades all without exception. The merit of these practices varies in depth. Those who imprint the dharma through contemplation of principle dwell in the Great Vehicle, attaining the most supreme merit, rare and difficult to hear. Those who do not imprint it remain bound to forms and sounds, called the Lesser Vehicle. Though they endure hardship for countless kalpas, realizing causes and receiving fruits, they gain only a fraction and never attain liberation. There are also the most deluded and foolish beings who know not reverence, know not compassion, know not forbearance, know not vigor, know not generosity. Such types are difficult to transform and teach—beyond conception.

You should listen and receive these teachings. At that time, the assembly of Zhenzang and others, hearing this wondrous discourse—so profoundly beneficial it defies analogy—spoke in verse:

The peerless Heavenly Venerable, wisdom boundless,
Manifests the dharma, and all directions attain deliverance.
Adapting to capacities, myriad practices without distinction,
Great and small, shallow and deep, return to the true path.
Radiant light shakes the earth, visions appear—
Not through clever words can this be described.
We, for kalpas, practiced the Lesser Vehicle,
Toiling arduously, yet never awakened.
Now we behold the Heavenly Venerable revealing the *True Treasury*,
In less than a month, fathoming its profound essence.
Compassion’s ultimate, the true Dao’s ground,
Breaking endurance, receiving birth, the fruit of uprightness.
Our teacher’s skillful teaching, no falsehood,
Saves and aids all beings without exception.
Beings who disbelieve in good causes,
Slander the Great Vehicle, clinging to self.
The Heavenly Venerable, mother of the dharma, compassion profound,
Bestows virtue universally without omission.
Now we comprehend the Great Vehicle sutra,
Inwardly reflecting, naturally beholding.
The Heavenly Venerable skillfully transcends the world,
In a single thought, receives all lands.
Revealing a subtle, wondrous, extraordinary body,
Neither born nor dying, neither now nor ancient.

Then the assembly of Zhenzang and others spoke in verse, praising:

The Heavenly Venerable, rare and wondrous,
Pities and grieves for all,
Broadly spreading the Great Vehicle,
Revealing the *True Treasury* dharma,
Enlightening the ignorant,
Teaching and benefiting,
Enabling the unseen to see,
The unheard to hear,
The unawakened to awaken,
The unliberated to attain liberation.
Our retinue universally enters the dharma-gate,
Awakening to the supreme Dao.

Yet there are beings of dull faculties,
Unable to fathom the profound essence of their original nature,
Their deluded minds failing to reach it—
How can this be made manifest?
We only beseech the Heavenly Venerable to further expound and clarify.

The Heavenly Venerable replied: "All beings who have not heard the jewel of the dharma, who do not believe in the Great Vehicle, who do not practice the true dharma, have not entered the samadhi state. One should carefully examine their conduct and teach according to their minds. Since attaining the Dao, for immeasurable kalpas I have constantly dwelled in the world, aiding and delivering all dharmas, never abandoning them."

If those to be delivered perceive my form, it is neither external nor internal, neither blue nor white, neither red nor black. The beings of that land respond to karmic conditions. You, my assembly of disciples, should each adopt what is fitting and transform according to the nature of beings.

Now I return once more to the realm of no-intervals; your fleshly eyes cannot see my wondrous dharma-body of sublime marks, and you will say I have perished. Observe your own bodies, and you shall see me complete and fully endowed. You have not yet embodied emptiness, wandering in delusion and inversion, relying on written words to bind your minds.

You who uphold the True Treasury Sutra of wondrous essence—merit will swiftly arise, and you shall see my form. Those who see my form perceive neither text nor letters, neither going nor coming, neither a self nor a non-self, neither form nor non-form. Why is this so? Because the sutra is subtle and wondrous, non-dual with dharma; dharma is subtle and wondrous, non-dual with beings; beings are wondrous, non-dual with me; I and all are wondrous, non-dual with all dharmas, neither dharma nor non-dharma.

Again, I address the four assemblies: When I first began my practice, I passed through countless kalpas, seeking in myriad ways. I studied the arts of longevity, consuming divine mushrooms and elixirs, practicing breath regulation and nurturing life. Thus I attained long life, living a thousand years, yet in the end, all must undergo transformation. Then I advanced further, cultivating the Middle Vehicle, tracing texts and recording events, seeking truth in external appearances, clinging to words and taking them as real.

Later, I encountered my original teacher and met good spiritual friends who revealed the true source and resolved the principle of non-action. My bodily form is founded on the four wondrous qualities, shaped by the five aggregates, which guide my every step. First, I observed the four wondrous qualities, traversing the five formations. The marks of the five formations are profound and obscure, ever-changing and emerging, never abiding in birth and death. Returning to the source and guarding the One, I illuminated the principle with clarity. At that moment, I awakened to the equality of all dharmas, the markless mark, ultimate quiescence—without beginning, middle, or end.

You, the four assemblies, widely open the dharma-gate, remove the five defilements, sever the four conditions of craving, eliminate the three delusions, and let singular wisdom penetrate. The six faculties become perfectly clear, illuminating within and without, like Mount Vaidūrya—neither external nor internal—radiant and pure, with boundless wisdom and understanding.

Yet beings, failing to comprehend, cling to arrogance. Afflictions obscure their vision, preventing clarity—like jade buried in mud, unseen yet never stained. You, the four assemblies, each encourage cultivation and refrain from external distractions. Beings, inverted and deluded, are infatuated with the world, indulging in the five desires and taking them as joy, claiming they will not die. In an instant, a hundred ailments arise: dizziness and wind diseases, internal afflictions filling the heart, paralysis of limbs, muteness, deafness, and blindness. When such illnesses strike, they long for death but cannot attain it, suffering torment and self-affliction. Wives and children attend them for years, yet show no filial piety. Such karmic retribution brings bitter pain to the body, beyond lamentation.

After death, their names are bound to the Three Offices; their souls are shackled and interrogated in dark prisons. In that long night, they see neither sun nor moon, enduring karmic retribution without end. Their families rejoice, unaware and unknowing.

You, observe the causes and conditions before and after, purify body and mind, comprehend the causes of the three times, and understand the fruits of the three times. Skillfully discern the varying roots and natures of beings, abide in self-mastery according to your portion, and from immeasurable kalpas, dwell in the fixed state of no-birth and no-death, sharing the same body with me, the same root as the Dao. All dharmas are likewise.

You must first study this sutra and awaken to the principles of conditions. Why? This sutra is the true seal, universally sealing all dharmas, revealing the wondrous mind of beings, truly non-dual, without false speech. It is the gate of the markless mark, complete and fully endowed. Cultivating to this point, you become steadfast and unretreatable, cleansing non-action. The heretical and deviant groups naturally dissolve. The spiritual power of this sutra is the great Dharma-wheel, carrying beings in ceaseless revolution—like the sun and moon suspended, illuminating the four directions, unseen only by the blind.

The wondrous nature of the true sutra is likewise. Beings, inverted and obscured by afflictions, do not see the true sutra, generate slander, and lose their loving mother. The assembly of the True Treasury, bowing with heads to the ground, addressed the Heavenly Venerable: "Our doubts remain unresolved. We dare ask: Is the nature of beings equal to the Heavenly Venerable’s nature, without difference? Is the nature of beings equal to the Heavenly Venerable’s form? Is the form of beings equal to the Heavenly Venerable’s nature?

If forms are equal, beings should see; if they see the Venerable’s form, there would be no inversion, no afflictions, no slander, no right or wrong, no birth or death. Why then are beings inverted and uncomprehending? If natures are equal, then forms are not equal, and nature and form differ. Beings have form but no nature; the Heavenly Venerable has nature but no form. If form is nature and nature is form, then beings are the Heavenly Venerable’s perfect response, and the Heavenly Venerable is beings’ clinging. Such doubts trouble us; we beseech your instruction."

The Heavenly Venerable rejoiced and praised them: "Excellent! You skillfully ask about this meaning, and all may hear. It is like planting a tree: deep roots make flourishing branches. Without branches, there are no roots; without roots, no branches. The nature and form of beings are likewise. Without form, there is no nature; without nature, no form. Nature cannot be seen, so form is neither form nor non-form. Form cannot be seen, so nature is neither nature nor non-nature.

Those who equal my nature equal my form; equality has no object—why speak of difficulty? Form is visible, nature is not; to distinguish the two is to lose the true Dao. I call this sutra the Great King of Physicians, able to cure all illnesses. Prescribing medicine according to the disease, those who take it will all recover."

Those who cannot take it will not recover from their illness, yet they vainly lament the Great Physician—it brings him no harm. This sutra is likewise. Beings, deluded and inverted, do not believe in the Great Vehicle. They slander it, refuse reverence, and will not receive or uphold it, thus generating their own confusion and delusion. This sutra can shatter the heavy illness of afflictions, break the bonds of greed and desire, sever the obstructions of anger, hatred, and ignorance, grant beings fearlessness, bestow the art of immortality, endow beings with wisdom and skillful means, cultivate kindness, benevolence, and filial piety, prolong life and bring wealth and honor, bring beings peace and ease, and enable them to realize the supreme Dao. The merits of this sutra are vast and boundless, beyond words to express.

If you can employ skillful means, accumulate merit through cultivation, reach the Mountain of Spiritual Understanding, enter the true reality, and realize the great vehicle’s path, you will attain equality without obstruction. Without skillful means, failing to comprehend the true essence, you will instead become attached and stagnant, increasing your afflictions. You will lose the great compassionate mother, lose the mind of equality, lose the principle of non-action, lose the wisdom of liberation, and lose the root of merit. All practices will be lost, and misfortune will naturally follow.

The Heavenly Worthy then spoke verses in praise, reaffirming its merits and urging the four assemblies to reflect inwardly. The gāthā says:

The Great Vehicle spreads widely,
Teaching beings according to their capacity.
I reveal the true treasury’s root,
Its right seal of verification clear.
Those who practice this sutra
Will naturally attain wisdom.
You, all my disciples,
Widely transform and diligently cultivate.
Realize the Dharma and gain freedom,
Comprehend the supreme sutra.

Now I offer a parable,
A near analogy for easy understanding.
Those of the Lesser Vehicle who gain faith
Gradually realize the fruit of non-arising.
The ultimate grove of merit
Is neither person nor self.
Finally, with earnest words,
All that is said is unassailable.
Great and small each contain the other,
Divine power accompanies walking and sitting.
The Great Vehicle cannot be displayed—
It turns and returns within the confines of a wall.

When the Heavenly Worthy had finished speaking these verses, he addressed the four assemblies and all his retinue: “I have finished expounding the Dharma and shall now return to my original abode. This sutra is entrusted to the sagely king and sovereign, then to the great ministers, the princes and nobles, and my great disciples, to be transmitted and propagated together. As the Dharma spreads, its merits will widely extend, beyond measure.

Why is this so? It is like a fine well that quenches the thirst of all, its waters never exhausted. The merits of this sutra are likewise: as it is widely proclaimed and disseminated, all people may receive it, yet its original essence remains undiminished. If it is not circulated, if this sutra does not spread, its merits will be cut off, wisdom will be obstructed, the practices of beings will be severed, the source of liberation will be broken, and the karma of causes and conditions will be destroyed. The sin of this is profound, beyond any analogy.

You, the four assemblies, must diligently practice the great practice and refrain from making distinctions. I shall now return my spirit, neither sinking nor floating, free from all forms and images.”

The four assemblies, gazing intently, heard these words and wept bitterly, their voices choked with sorrow. In unison, they cried out, entreating the Heavenly Worthy to remain in the world and bestow his grace. The Heavenly Worthy replied: “I travel through all lands, the nine regions of Kunlun, contemplating the Dharma and teaching beings, guiding them to turn toward the great Dao. My parting from you will not be for long. Each of you should dwell in your purified lands, where fragrant orchids and basil grow, on the Mountain of Spiritual Understanding—there you will see me.”

Suddenly, he rose gently into the air and departed. The assembly, including True Treasury, gazed after him without cease, yet could not discern where he had gone. Each then returned to their original abode.

Thus concludes *Fascicle Ten of the Supreme Esoteric Treasury of the True Sutra*.
