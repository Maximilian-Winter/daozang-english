**The Primordial Five Venerables’ Red-Writ Jade Chapters of the Celestial Scripture, Scroll One**

In the East, the Azure Numinous Venerable of Anbao Hualin, styled *The Divine Life-Preserving Cavernous Mystery Chapter*.
In the South, the Cinnabar Numinous Venerable of Fanbao Changyang, styled *The Southern Clouds’ Celestial Numinous Mantle*.
At the Center, the Primordial Numinous Venerable of Yubao Yuanling, styled *The Precious Kalpa’s Cavernous Clarity Nine Heavens’ Numinous Scripture*.
In the West, the Radiant Numinous August Venerable of Qibao Jinmen, styled *The Golden Perfection’s Precious Luminous Cavernous Subtlety Chapter*.
In the North, the Mysterious Numinous Venerable of Dongyin Shuodan Yujue, styled *The Primordial Spirit’s Life-Generating Precious Luminous Text*.

The Five Venerables’ Jade Chapters are all spontaneously arisen texts of the Void Cavern, concealed within the Seven Treasures’ Mysterious Terrace of the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Capital, the Purple Tenuity Palace, guarded by the divine officials of the Five Thearchs. According to the Mysterious Regulations, they emerge once every forty thousand kalpas.

*The Primordial Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Red-Writ Jade Chapters* originated prior to the Primordial Beginning, within the Void Cavern. Before Heaven and Earth took root, before the sun and moon shone, in the profound obscurity—without ancestor or lineage—the numinous writ flickered, now present, now absent. The Two Modes awaited it to divide; the Great Yang awaited it to illuminate. The numinous diagram revolutionized the cosmic course; the mysterious signs shifted and transmuted. Riding the moment, responding to the confluence, it thus came into being. Heaven and Earth received it and separated; the Three Luminaries received it and radiated. The numinous writ flourished in splendor, its cavernous luster ascending to the Highest Clarity, emerging from the Primordial Azure Heaven yet without fixed hue. Its textual form twisted and turned, beyond full comprehension.

The Primordial Beginning refined it in the Cavernous Yang Lodge, smelted it in the Flowing Fire Court, purifying its true text until it gleamed with radiance. As the Cavernous Yang qi was crimson, it was named the *Red Writ*. Once the numinous diagram shone forth, the myriad thearchs paid homage to the Perfected, soaring through the Void, circumambulating the Upper Palace, burning incense, scattering blossoms, and chanting the numinous chapters. At that time, twelve mysterious omens descended from Heaven, and twenty-four responses arose from Earth. Above, they celebrated the numinous mysteries of the Nine Heavens; below, they extolled the precious texts of the Three Heavens. The divine winds stirred, the August Dao flowed unimpeded. The Primordial Beginning issued the decree; the Supreme Perfected held the brush. The Jade Consort swept the mat; golden slips were cast, and the Jade Chapters inscribed. The Five Venerables recorded them, concealing them within the Palace of the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Capital. Jade maidens tended the incense; the Grand Florescence held the napkins. Jade lads stood guard; jade steps led to the audience hall. The scripture of the Nine Heavens was not for ghosts or spirits to hear.

Heaven treasures it to attain floating transcendence; Earth conceals it to achieve tranquility. The Five Thearchs wield it to secure their dominion; the Three Luminaries ride it to ascend in brilliance. The loftiest sages uphold it to attain Perfection; the Five Marchmounts follow it to gain numinosity. The Son of Heaven obtains it to govern; the dynastic mandate enjoys it to attain Great Peace. Truly, the wondrous power of the numinous writ is the mysterious root of Heaven and Earth. Its majestic numinosity expands boundlessly, pervading the vast transformations. It is the ancestor of the divine and luminous, its measure unfathomable, towering as the Great Void.

*The Primordial Five Venerables’ Red-Writ Jade Chapters* emerged from the Void Cavern’s spontaneity, establishing Heaven and founding Earth, enlightening the divine and luminous. Above, it is called *Numinous*, stabilizing the Five Marchmounts and ensuring the nation’s enduring existence. Below, it is called *Precious*, its numinous treasure wondrous and mysterious, the most exalted of all things. The Primordial Beginning unfurled the diagram, above eliciting twelve numinous omens, below manifesting twenty-four responses.

1. At that time, there was neither Heaven nor Earth, only profound obscurity. The numinous writ flickered, without ancestor or lineage. The cosmic course turned of itself, becoming the root of the myriad qi. The Void Cavern congealed the Perfected; the qi clarified and ascended, forming the vast expanse of Heaven, suddenly and spontaneously arising from the Mysterious.
2. At that time, the Two Modes divided the Modes; the qi flowed downward and congealed, unfolding the profound and bearing the weight, all at once taking form.
3. At that time, thirty-six thousand suns and moons simultaneously shone, illuminating all Heavens, leaving no obscurity unpenetrated.
4. At that time, the loftiest sages, divine beings, and Perfected of wondrous conduct—innumerable multitudes—paid homage at the Jade Court, circumambulating the Great Void, extolling and reciting the numinous writ.
5. Heaven spontaneously produced divine music, a thousand myriad kinds sounding as one, resounding through the cloud palaces, celebrating the divine Perfected above.
6. Numinous winds sang in a hundred tones, spontaneously arising in the ten directions. The notes harmonized, all forming cavernous chapters.
7. The celestial pivot halted; the stellar lodges ceased their motion. Heaven knew neither day nor night; the four seasons dawned as one.
8. Purple clouds emitted radiance, streaming through all Heavens. All the myriad things universally received illumination.
9. Spring, autumn, winter, and summer knew neither scorching heat nor freezing cold. The four qi were gentle and harmonious; the withered and decayed all revived.
10. The Five Marchmounts stood firm. Talismans, diagrams, scriptures, and texts all unfolded at once, revealing the Mysterious Void and universally teaching the boundless.
11. At that time, seven treasures of divine marvels descended, scattering across the lands to nourish the multitudes.
12. Seven-jeweled wondrous groves spontaneously arose in the Void, their radiance shading and covering the Ten Heavens.

These twelve numinous omens spontaneously arose, the mysterious diagram initiating the cosmic course, manifesting the numinous writ. Earth produced twenty-four responses, celebrating the divine Perfected above.

1. At that time, the Heavenly qi was chaotic, without light. The dawn cock heralded the day; the four seasons shone clearly. The Mysterious Heaven unfolded; Earth expanded, giving rise to the Five Phases.
2. Thirty-six thousand suns and moons above and below shone with the same brilliance, illuminating the darkest nights without end.

3. Azure birds #1 bore missives in their beaks, announcing to the Five Thearchs to rectify the celestial divisions and degrees.
4. White tigers spewed forth gold, securely anchoring the Five Numinous Spirits.
5. Azure dragons presented talismans, reporting to the Water Thearch to regulate and hasten the cosmic course, opening the rivers and seas.
6. Jade dragons #2 bore imperial seals in their jaws, offering them to emperors and kings to stabilize the state, protect the throne, and ensure the Five Sacred Peaks endure forever.
7. Phoenixes sang and luan-birds cried, their soaring calls harmonious and resonant.
8. Flocks of birds soared and danced, their wings stirring the heavens’ edge.
9. Dragons leapt and frolicked, stirring the vast oceans and deep marshes.
10. The waters of the Yellow River stilled their flow, fish scales interlocking in assembly.
11. Sweet dew spontaneously arose, and magic mushrooms flourished in abundance.
12. Winter brought no frost or ice, and withered trees bloomed anew.
13. Forests, trees, and crops bore flowers and fruit in both winter and summer, their growth lush and unblemished, untouched by decay.
14. The Four Qi harmonized, calamities and epidemics ceased, heaven and humanity rejoiced, and none met untimely ends.
15. Venomous creatures sealed their fangs, harboring no harmful intent.
16. Lions and fierce beasts dwelled alongside humans as neighbors.
17. Throughout the world, the blind, deaf, lame, and infirm were all at once restored to wholeness, free from ailments, and enjoyed robust health.
18. The aged reverted to youth, the young never aged, their faces radiant and majestic, their spirits luminous and bright.
19. Birds, beasts, and the six livestock, whether pregnant or yet to conceive, all bore offspring without miscarriage or harm.
20. Pregnant women across the world gave birth to sons.
21. The earth’s hidden treasures were revealed, gold and jade exposed, scattered across the roads, leaving no secluded depths.
22. Heaven quaked and earth split, withered bones revived, sunken corpses and wandering souls arose as whole beings, and the world sang in celebration of the great peace.
23. The earth sprouted lotus blossoms, and heaven and humanity rejoiced, all filled with joy.
24. The Five Sacred Peaks opened wide, revealing talismanic scriptures to instruct heaven and humanity. At that time, all who studied attained flight as immortals.

These twenty-four responses extolled the numinous diagram of the Primordial Beginning, rejoicing in the enlightenment of the Five Elders. Once the numinous writ resounded, the Dao spread forth. Heaven and earth unfolded, the true Dharma flourished, the divine wind spread afar, and the myriad qi diffused their essence. The Five Thearchs lent their aid, guiding celestial immortals, commanding divine officials, and directing the movements of yin and yang. They secured the Three Luminaries in the Mysterious Root, preserved heaven and earth for eternal endurance, anchored the Five Sacred Peaks in the Numinous Abode, regulated the kalpic course at the Three Passes, established the state’s destiny in accord with the diagram, and guided the Five Qi to nurture the people. They propagated the Primordial Heaven’s greatness, universally teaching the ten directions. Their majestic power vast and boundless, no darkness remained unopened. The divine marvels were resplendent, beyond all description.

At that time, the Supreme Sage, the Most High Lord of the Great Dao, the Jade Emperor of the Highest Heavens, and the Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions all rode upon five-colored jade wheels, jade carriages with azure canopies, nine-hued mysterious dragons, ten-fold feathered canopies, and three-pure streaming clouds. The Great Saints of the Heavens and the Perfected Ones of Wondrous Conduct all rode upon azure mists, nine-spirit flowing-light flying-cloud jade chariots. The Four Assemblies of the Empyrean, the Three Dawns exhaled fragrance, flying incense converged from eight directions, lightning flashed and beacons flared, floral essences bathed the sun, the Three Luminaries merged their brilliance, divine radiance blazed resplendently, and their glances traversed the Great Void. Following them were the Five Thearchs and divine immortals, the thousand Perfected of the Mulberry Grove, lions, white cranes, tigers, leopards, dragons, and unicorns. Divine consorts scattered blossoms, golden lads wafted incense, the Five Paths opened their roads, the Three Realms unsealed their ferries. They roamed the cloud paths, whistling commands to the Ten Heavens.

Ascending to the Supreme Clarity’s Great Mysterious Jade Capital, the Cold Numinous Cinnabar Palace, and the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, they donned the Heavenly Treasure Feathered Robes and proceeded to the Golden Gates of the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy, beseeching to receive the *Primordial Beginning Numinous Treasure Red Writ Jade Chapters of the True Writ*. Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy commanded the assembly of Perfected Ones to enter the Golden Terrace Jade Treasure Palace of the Great Void, the Nine-Light Radiant Chamber. Jade lads and maidens attended to left and right, numbering ninety million. Flying dragons and venomous beasts guarded the eight gates, coiling serpents struck swords, long-fanged creatures clashed bells, divine tigers roared aloft, lions roared below, unicorns danced, phoenixes sang, their harmonious cries resonant. Heavenly chimes played their celestial melodies, jade tones echoed through the cloud courts.

The Supreme Elders and the Most High Lord of the Great Dao bowed their heads and spoke: “We humbly hear that the Primordial Beginning has renewed the cosmic course, the mysterious signs have unfolded the diagram, the numinous writ flourishes, and the divine manifestations grace the Five Directions. Heaven and earth rely upon it to part and take form; the Three Luminaries follow it to shine forth. This is the great enterprise of the primordial lineage—might we briefly glimpse its numinous depths?”

“Your servants, though unworthy, were born before the heavens of this kalpa, planted their truth within the Nine Numinous Palaces during the great kalpa, imbibed the essence at the Pass of the Five Flowers, received life within the womb of mysterious conception, beheld the yang within the dark stirrings of the soul, cast off the bonds of the Great Void, strode the long ferries, shone resplendent in the Three Assemblies, bathed in the radiance of the Supreme Mystery, flowed their light through the capital of Dark Florescence, and held fast to their aspirations within the Eight Circles. We presumptuously received the office of Enlightenment, and undeservedly became disciples of the Mysterious Master’s lineage. We reflect upon the multitudes of beings, grieving as the kalpic course flows onward. Now that the August Dao has flourished, the truth also moves in hidden ways. Our private hope is to extend the cloud’s shade to the eight distant realms, scatter the wind’s fragrance upon the orchid groves, let withered branches aspire to the luxuriance of the Florescence Yang, and let decayed bones receive the numinous essence’s ferry. Might we be granted a sight of the *Numinous Treasure Five-Chapter Jade Writ* and receive its teachings to instruct those yet unenlightened?”

The Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy, then absorbed in distant contemplation, stroked the table and raised his gaze. He summoned the Five Thearchs to deliberate upon yin and yang, reckon the kalpic cycles, shift the Yellow River’s source, inspect the celestial degrees, select the seed-people, point toward the Great Void, and whistle the Nine Mysteries into clarity. For a long while, he remained deaf to entreaties, sealing the path of those who sought the truth. The Most High Lord of the Dao persisted in his inquiry, until at last the Primordial Beginning cast a sidelong glance and, sighing deeply, said: “How subtle and profound! What you now ask—is it not too remote?”

This is the mysterious root of the Primordial Beginning, the scripture of the Empty Cavern’s spontaneity, preserving the kalpic movements within the celestial mechanism and anchoring the Five Numinous Ones to establish the true. Now, as the Three Heavens align their revolutions and the Six Heavens’ Dao unfolds, diverse teachings emerge to transform—there shall be thirty-six thousand kinds of Dao to liberate the minds of those yet to come. When this Dharma’s kalpa concludes, after the Three Dragons’ era, in the year of *gengzi*, when miscellaneous *qi* universally dissipates, our true Dao shall prevail.

For now, it may be entrusted to you, to be recorded in the Upper Palace, yet not yet disseminated to the lower world or taught to beginning learners. The Mysterious Statutes bear prohibitions; it may not be casually transmitted. You yourself may journey to the Numinous Capital’s Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, observe the celestial sounds inscribed on the golden tablets, and receive the postures from the Divine Kings. Thereafter, you shall be enabled to master the celestial patterns, thereby governing the Heaven of the Primordial Beginning.

Thereupon, the Most High Lord of the Great Dao and the assembly of perfected beings retired to fast for three months, then proceeded to the Numinous Capital Palace to receive the postures of reverence. Only then did they comprehend the precious solemnity of the Celestial Perfected, how difficult it was to immediately hear of them. Returning once more to the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy, they consulted him on the rites of prohibition, humbly acknowledging their inadequacy. The Heavenly Countenance, moved by their discourse, unsealed the numinous barrier. He summoned the Five Elders and the Upper Perfected, who unfastened the cloud-brocade satchel woven of nine radiant, eight-hued mysteries, and produced the *Primordial Beginning’s Vermilion Writ Jade Chapters True Scripture of the Numinous Treasure*, entrusting it to the Most High Lord of the Great Dao, the August Jade Thearch on High, the Perfected of the Ten Directions, the Great Saints of the Myriad Heavens, and the Perfected Persons of Wondrous Conduct. They were instructed to transmit it in accordance with the Mysterious Statutes once the *qi* of the Six Heavens had dissipated, following the prescribed method.

*The Primordial Beginning’s Vermilion Writ Jade Chapters True Text*
The Upper Clarity’s spontaneous numinous writ, the Nine Heavens’ primordially engendered mysterious talisman, the Cavernous Void’s numinous verse. It establishes heaven and founds earth, unfolds the myriad perfected, pacifies spirits and anchors numina, engenders and completes the multitudes, rectifies and safeguards the celestial revolutions, preserves the heavens and ensures long life. Above, it governs the celestial mechanisms; at the center, it examines the Five Numinous; below, it strategizes with the earthly deities. Whistling commands the Yellow River’s source, moving and directing yin and yang, summoning spirits and dispatching immortals. This writ of utmost perfection wondrously responds to spontaneity, causing the heavens to ascend in clarity, the earth to stand firm in stability, the Five Marchmounts to be preserved and guarded, and the ten thousand kinds to abide therein.

The Primordial Beginning inscribed it upon the Divine Capital’s coiled writ, enduring through kalpas and revolutions, its text preserving the celestial root, never to be destroyed or lost. With the revolutions’ advance, it remains undefiled when mixed, grows clearer when defiled, indestructible when ruined, and supremely luminous when extinguished. This writ of Great Existence is revered by the celestial perfected, its true name self-luminous. The Thearch’s diagrams are engraved upon tablets, manifesting to future generations. This text is profoundly recondite; none may glimpse or hear of it. Those who obtain it abide with the Three Qi eternally. Diligently practicing its methods, they attain divine transcendence. Simply by devoutly upholding it, their households and states enjoy peace, their lives are preserved, calamities are averted, and all inauspiciousness is swept away. Should the Son of Heaven or feudal lords revere it, their states attain great peace, malevolent bandits are pacified, borderlands cease strife, the multitudes sing in joy, and all under heaven flourishes. As the revolutions cycle and the numbers turn, the true Dao shall prevail. Those who obtain it shall summon spontaneity while seated.

The Celestial True and Wondrously Weighty is concealed by the Nine Heavens; it must not be lightly divulged, lest judgment befall your person.

**The Divine Titles of the Five Elders of the Primordial Beginning and Numinous Treasure**

**Eastern Direction: Azure Treasure, Flourishing Forest, Azure Numinous Beginning Elder**
Named the Azure Thearch, surnamed Yan, personal name *Kaiming*, style *Lingweiyang*. His head bears a crown of azure essence-jade, and he wears a flying robe woven of ninefold azure *qi*. Ever he rides a verdant dragon, bearing the Quail Banner, attended by the *jiayi* officials and nine hundred thousand generals. At the dawn of his essence, above he is titled the Azure Molar Nine-*Qi* Heaven of the East; in the midst, he is Jupiter; below, Mount Tai. His *qi* resembles the first sprouting of spring grasses; his radiance, the sun’s first descent in glory. Below lies the Abyssal Pool of Morning Blossoms; above stands the Palace of Flowing Splendor. Within its chambers dwell the Jade-Maiden of the Azure Waist; in its halls, the Perfected Kings of the Supreme. The Jade-Maidens ride the beasts of the Nine Mountains; the Perfected Kings drive ninefold luminous divine dragons. Above, they guide the harmonious *qi* of the Nine Heavens; below, they draw forth the fragrant streams of the Nine Springs. They nurture the Two Modes to everlasting endurance and safeguard Yin and Yang to perpetual flourishing. Heaven bestows primordial essence upon the Great Ultimate; Earth preserves the mountains and peaks through Goumang. Spirits convey numinous emptiness within the Silent Terrace; humans nourish the five viscera at the edge of the lips. Thus, those who cultivate and irrigate know no bounds, and those who preserve it never perish. Thereupon, after ten thousand kalpas, all is renewed; the state’s mandate is secured and flourishes. They gather rosy clouds from the upper palaces, dispelling decay to restore youthful innocence. Then, like the roc soaring to the ninefold distances, they ascend the Dark Grotto, gazing upward to seek the numinous halls of the Supreme Perfected, taking the Immortal Treasures as their lineage. Vast is the Numinous Treasure! The Azure Molar endures forever through the merit of the Beginning Elder and the Nine *Qi*.

**Southern Direction: Fiery Treasure, Flourishing Yang, Cinnabar Numinous Perfected Elder**
Named the Vermilion Thearch, surnamed *Dongfu*, personal name *Jiyan*, style *Chibiaonu*. His head bears a crown of vermilion essence-jade, and he wears a flying robe woven of threefold cinnabar *qi*. Ever he rides a crimson dragon, bearing the Vermilion Banner, attended by the *bingding* officials and three hundred thousand generals. At the dawn of his essence, above he is titled the Vermilion Cinnabar Three-*Qi* Heaven of the South; in the midst, he is Mars; below, Mount Huo. His *qi* resembles descending clouds enfolding the sun; his radiance, the lustrous depths of dark jade. Below lies the Cinnabar Pool of the Vermilion Spring; above stands the Vermilion Palace of Longevity. Within its chambers dwell the Great Cinnabar Jade-Maidens, residing upon the Three Mountains of Grand Yang. In its halls stands the Elder of Primordial *Qi*, driving a three-horned unicorn. Above, he guides the numinous transformations of the Supreme Clarity and Primordial Beginning; below, he harmonizes the forging of the Three *Qi*. He ensures the eternal endurance of the myriad things, conveying celestial essence through the southern summer and nurturing human essence at the cinnabar lips. Thus, those who gather it never cease; those who cultivate it endure forever. Thereupon, they reverse withered age to return to infancy, transforming decay into lush abundance. They dispel the falling leaves of autumn frost, restoring radiant splendor for ten thousand springs. Then, like the dragon glancing through the empty cavern or the simurgh soaring amid the clouds, they suddenly release the heart to clarity, untethered by the dust of the world. Truly, they are the mysterious root of the Nine Heavens, opening the wondrous gate of the primordial origin. Vast is the Numinous Treasure! The Vermilion Cinnabar attains eternal life through the merit of the Perfected Elder and the Threefold Blackness.

**Central Direction: Jade Treasure, Primordial Numinous Primordial Elder**
Named the Yellow Thearch, surnamed *Tongban*, personal name *Yuanshi*, style *Hanshuniu*. His head bears a crown of yellow essence-jade, and he wears a five-colored flying robe. Ever he rides a yellow dragon, bearing the Yellow Banner, attended by the *wuji* officials and one hundred twenty thousand generals. At the dawn of his essence, above he is titled the Heaven of the Supreme Thearch of the Primordial Grotto of the Center; in the midst, he is Saturn; below, Mount Song. Above, he emits yellow *qi*; below, he governs the gates of Earth. His mist resembles clouds ascending to the Nine Heavens. Primordial essence comes and goes; the *qi* of the Perfected is taut as a bowstring. The Supreme is without limit; below, it engenders spirits and numina. His radiance resembles flying shadows arrayed like the morning sun; his brilliance, the bright moon illuminating the hidden realms. Within lie the Nine Passes of the Dark Gullet; without, the pools of sweet spring and jade nectar. The Perfected One is named *Zidan*. The Yellow Court of Heaven’s Center, the *wuji* of Heaven’s Granary, the Jade-Maidens who ward off death and nurture life. His official title is the Supreme Thearch, who commands the armies of the Nine Heavens, riding the chariot of Earth’s Axis, attended by the six *bing* and six *ding*. He rewards the merits of the Dao and punishes demonic essences. Above, he harmonizes the spontaneity of nature; below, he revolves the numina of the Five Lands. Heaven and Earth are preserved without loss; Yin and Yang are employed without tilting. Heaven’s *qi* is gentle and boundless; humans rinse their lips and teeth to prevent decay. Thereupon, they raise the sun from its decline in Yu Yuan, restoring the first sprouts of dawn’s rosy clouds. They extend the withered and decayed, transforming extinction into clarity. Their countenances glow, returning to their original state; their *qi* surges, flowing and full. Then, like the rainbow traversing the eight domains, they ascend the cloud paths, surpassing the multitudes to gaze afar, drawing in the *qi* of Heaven to sustain themselves. They return the Perfected Immortals to the Supreme Subtlety, exhausting the Three Luminaries to announce the dusk. How majestic is the Great Void! One may indeed halt the numinous workings at the Primordial Mandate. Wondrous is the Numinous Treasure! The Yellow Court attains eternal life through the enduring solidity of the One *Qi*.

**Western Direction: Seven Treasures, Golden Gate, Radiant Numinous August Elder**
Named the White Thearch, surnamed *Shangjin*, personal name *Changkai*, style *Yaopobao*, also styled *Baizhaoju*. His head bears a crown of white essence-jade, and he wears a flying robe of white feathers. Ever he rides a white dragon, bearing the Plain Banner, attended by the *gengxin* officials and seven hundred thousand generals. At the dawn of his essence, above he is titled the Bright Stone Seven-*Qi* Heaven of the West; in the midst, he is Venus; below, Mount Huayin. His *qi* resembles the bright moon descending upon rosy clouds; his radiance, the dark night beholding a luminous pearl. The white dragon holds magic mushrooms in its jaws to ascend; numinous Perfected descend with plain nectar to moisten and nourish. This is the numinous moisture of the celestial earth, the jade marrow of the Supreme Perfected. Its *qi* is sweet, harmonious, and subtly wondrous, surpassing even the finest flavors of the tripod. Below lie the Jade Spring and the Long River; above stands the Tower of Flowing Splendor. Within its chambers dwell the Supreme Plain Maidens; in its halls, the Grandee of Primordial *Qi*. They ride the falling tigers of collapsing mountains, driving cloud chariots through the Void.

Above, it guides the vast essence to the celestial earth; below, it harmonizes all beings in the numinous thoroughfare. Drawing cloud-dew from luminous mushrooms, drinking divine liquid from dragon’s whiskers, striking the Heavenly Pool to sound the drum, gathering sweet nectar upon the tongue. Thus, those who preserve it flourish; those who practice it dwell forever, reversing white hair to raven-black, turning withered decay back to infancy.

Thereupon, phoenixes dance in the radiant Han, clear whistles resound through the Void. Pillowing on cloud peaks to refine the spirit, nurturing essence and harmony in the Great Beginning, befriending Perfected Ones—how then could one know where honor or disgrace might lead?

Great indeed is the Numinous Treasure! The Luminous Stone grants long life through the joy of the Seven *Qi*.

In the north, the Cavern of Darkness—Dusky Solitude—where the Five Numinous Ones and the Mysterious Elder dwell, he is called the Black Emperor. His surname is Black Stem, his taboo name is Numinous Assembly, his style is Hidden Marquis Bureau, and his alternate name is Leaf of Radiant Record. His head bears a crown of dark essence-jade; he wears a flying robe of black feathers. Ever riding a black dragon, bearing a black banner, he commands the fifty myriad spirits of the Ren-Kui palace. His essence first arises: above, it is called the Mysterious Nourishment of the Five *Qi* Heaven; in the midst, Mercury; below, Mount Chang. His *qi* resembles the howling wind lashing through fiery forests; his radiance, a shooting star plummeting into vast waves. He refines jade syrup in the dragon cauldron, draws dark *qi* from the celestial lake. Below lies the Abyss of Long Life; within stands the household of the Supreme. His chambers hold the Night-Glow Jade Maidens, clad in emerald silk of cloud forests. Riding cloud-dragons to awaken the Perfected, driving deer-chariots upon the Heavenly River, they roam freely to grasp the root of the Mysterious Origin, preserving harmony at the birth of the Nine Mysteries’ fold.

Above, he guides the flowing *qi* of the Five Emperors; below, he rescues the flourishing multitudes. Upholding the Two Modes from collapse, safeguarding all lives in eternal peace. Heaven bestows primordial essence upon the Perfected of the Great Mystery, nourishing the six palaces within teeth and jaws. Thus, those who practice it endure; those who employ it enjoy long life. Rinsing the spirit-fluid at the crown, holding pure harmony without ostentation.

Then, as the yang light inclines westward, the dark night returns to the eastern mound. Reversing decline and decay to extinguish smoke, reverting to childlike youth and ascending anew. Beating the cloud pool to stir the dense, beholding the flicker of minnows as dragons soar. Befriending Perfected Ones in delight, ascending high with numinous immortals—his virtue is vast indeed! Who could surpass it?

Great indeed is the Numinous Treasure! The Mysterious Nourishment grants long life through the rise of the Five *Qi*.

The Primordial Five Elders issued the Five Emperors’ True Talismans to deliver the Five Emperor-Persons. The Heavenly Light opened the yang, revealing this scripture in the Dark Capital Palace.

**Primordial Azure Emperor True Talisman**
Summons the Direct Talisman Officer Gengsheng to guard the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Script. When the Daoist ingests it, numinous *qi* stabilizes the liver, generating the Nine-Leaf Spirit of Azure Essence Treasure Flower, serving as a messenger to communicate with spirits and attain immortality.

The above is the *Original Heavenly Light Scripture*, from the *Azure Emperor True Scripture*, to pacify the Nine *Qi* Heaven of the East. The Azure Emperor receives this scripture to guard Mount Tai. One copy is sealed in the Nine Numinous Cavern Chamber, opened once every forty thousand kalpas. Daoists whose fate is tied to Mount Tai wear azure script on crimson silk upon their person. On their fate-day, they write in vermilion, face east, and ingest nine talismans. The Direct Talisman Officer Qu Gengsheng follows the talisman into the liver repository, where over nine years, nine layers of Azure Essence Treasure Flower grow, their light radiating beyond the body. They should also inscribe the azure script on crimson silk and place it within the upper node of the spirit staff, clothing it in divine robes. Nine Azure Waist Jade Maidens attend as guardians. Should one fail in devotion, the Examiner Officers will come.

The above is the *Comprehensive Numinous Scripture*, from the *Yellow Emperor True Scripture*, to pacify the One *Qi* Heaven of the Center. The Yellow Emperor receives this scripture as the central *qi* of heaven unfolds, responding to the turning wheel. When this scripture first appeared, the Heavenly Gate halted its wheel, ceasing day and night. The Primordial gathered the original scripture and returned it to the Upper Primordial *Qi*. Thus, the Yellow Emperor and Central Mount lack this scripture. Now, it is recorded in the old scriptures merely to preserve it unbroken. The Four Emperors jointly oversee its defense in the Upper Palace, with no proper scribe to guard it. Daoists whose fate is tied to the Central Mount may wear yellow script on white silk upon their person. On their fate-day, they write in vermilion, face the center, and ingest twelve talismans. Though no officer follows, over twelve years, twelve layers of Yellow Essence Treasure Flower grow within the spleen repository. They should also inscribe the yellow script on white silk and place it within the node below the Vermilion Emperor’s on the spirit staff. Daoists who alone may wear this talisman do so because the Yellow Emperor generates humanity, aligning with heaven’s *qi*. Even so, it remains without a guardian scribe. Should one fail in devotion, the Examiner Officers will come.

On their destiny day, they write it in vermilion, face west, and ingest seven talismans. The Direct Talisman Officer Qūzhèng, humbly following the talisman, enters the lung palace within the abdomen. Over seven years, seven layers of White Essence Treasure Flower bloom, their radiance illuminating beyond the body’s form. They should also inscribe it in white on black silk and place it within the node below the Yellow Emperor’s on the spirit staff, where seven Maidens of Primordial Simplicity attend as guardians.

Should one fail in devotion, the Examiner Officers will come.

The Five Emperor True Talismans: their upper essence in heaven becomes the Five Stars, their middle essence within the human body becomes the Five Viscera, and their lower essence upon the earth becomes the Five Marchmounts. Thus, the *qi* of the Three Origins each has its proper affiliation. Without the Five Scriptures, the Three Luminaries in heaven remain dim. Without the Five Scriptures, humans cannot establish their form. Without the Five Scriptures, the Five Marchmounts lose their numinosity. The Five Emperor True Talismans, born together with the Primordial Beginning, were once concealed in the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Mysterious Capital, attended by five hundred million divine officials of the Five Emperors. All heavens pay homage to the True Scriptures thrice monthly, with Fire, Water, Yin, and Yang officials enforcing prohibitions against leakage.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy seals them within the spirit staff, which must always be carried upon the body. This is because they guard the celestial perfected, never to be parted from the body’s form even for a moment. The Primordial Spirit Staff is made from bamboo grown on the sunlit side of the Numinous Mountain, seven feet in length, with seven nodes, straight from top to bottom. The Five Talismans are placed within it in sequence, leaving the top and bottom nodes empty to correspond with the celestial and terrestrial configurations.

Merely wearing this talisman also grants liberation through simulated death, transforming into an immortal through cyclic rebirth. When the eastern lands and the three months of spring face calamity, to pacify and stabilize the eastern region, inscribe it in vermilion on green stone and place it in the east for nine days. Disasters will vanish, and malevolence dissolve. The region will flourish with virtuous people, azure dragons soar, and auspicious omens appear, bringing peace to the realm.

One remains in constant accord with the divine luminaries, safeguarding the nation and family, and enjoying boundless blessings.

The Primordial Beginning bestows the method of the Numinous Treasure Five Emperors’ Talismans for Pacifying Dwellings, to be conferred upon advanced scholars of the Dao, not upon the common populace. Those who uphold this method—master and disciple—fast together for nine days, offering five taels of gold and five bolts of Five Emperors’ patterned silk, swearing oaths before the Five Venerable Lords of Heaven, and receiving the talismans through the covenant of the Five Marchmounts. Thereafter, wearing the talismans and applying them to one’s dwelling as prescribed will naturally summon great fortune, dispel misfortune for all time, pacify nation and family, and ensure boundless prosperity.

The *Primordial Beginning’s Five Venerables’ Vermilion Writ Jade Chapters True Writs Heavenly Scriptures*, Scroll the Upper, concludes.

---

The *Supreme Purity Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Summons for Subduing Dragons, Tigers, Leopards, Mountain Spirits, and the Eight Mighty Talismans* shares its origin with the *Primordial Beginning’s Jade Chapters True Writs* from the Vermilion Heaven, emerging through the spontaneous workings of the Dao, manifesting the numinous symbols of the Great Void. It unfolds the Three Diagrams to commune with the perfected, expounds the Five Phases within the Mysterious Treasury, circulates the Four Qi to respond to the divine, stabilizes the Jade Chapters to secure the kalpa, safeguards the earth at its primordial root, commands the numinous talismans to restrain demons, utters divine incantations to extend their reach, deploys the Eight Mighties to rectify the measure, and whistles to the Five Emperors to summon dragons. Thus, the pivotal mechanism remains unshaken, the Five Marchmounts are preserved in perpetuity, mountains and rivers endure without sinking, and humans and spirits receive its blessings without end.

The Supreme Dao Lord received this from the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy and was awarded the registers in the Upper Three Heavens’ Mysterious Capital Purple Tenuity Palace. According to the Mysterious Regulations, when the qi of the Six Heavens dissipates after forty thousand kalpas, the true Dao shall prevail. Those who adhere to the regulations may transmit the *Upper Three Heavens’ Supreme Lord’s Summons for Subduing Dragons, Tigers, Leopards, Mountain Spirits, and the Eight Mighty Talismans*. This was received by the Vermilion Essence after the celestial qi descended, and its writs were revealed beneath the Numinous Storax Grove in the Southern Cinnabar Cavern.

On such-and-such a year, month, and day, the Numinous Treasure Vermilion Emperor So-and-So Lord, wearing the *Primordial Beginning’s Upper Three Heavens’ Supreme Dao Lord’s Six Heavens’ General Earth Eight Mighty Talismans*, summons the gods of heaven, binds the spirits of earth, seals mountains and calls forth clouds, and restrains the dragons of the rivers, bearing the master So-and-So Emperor So-and-So’s Primordial Beginning’s chapters.

In such-and-such a prefecture, commandery, county, village, and hamlet, Cavern Mystery disciple So-and-So Marchmount Master, woman So-and-So Marchmount Daoist So-and-So, born on such-and-such a day, aged so many years, born in such-and-such a month, in the year of such-and-such Jupiter station, on the first day of such-and-such a month, respectfully in the celestial qi of such-and-such a heaven, requests the *Supreme Purity Numinous Treasure Eight Mighty Talismans* in three documents, transmitted by the Supreme Lord to the Yellow Emperor, sealed together as talismans to manifest the postures of reverence.

The *Nine Heavens’ Primordial Yang-Generating Talisman*, bestowed by the Primordial Beginning upon the Supreme Lord Elder, is inscribed in the Vermilion Writ after the kalpa, visible in the sun’s yang palace. According to the old statutes of the Mysterious Capital Purple Tenuity Palace, it is written in cinnabar on white silk, five *cun* square. After a hundred days of pure fasting, one enters the chamber to contemplate the sun’s essence, holds it in the mouth and swallows it, thereby sharing the sun’s lifespan, enduring as long as heaven and earth. Through contemplating the numinous and concentrating on the true, the body naturally gains the power of flight. If impure qi is harbored in the mouth, the talisman emerges and one dies. It is also called the *Life-True Contract* and the *Eight Mighties Dragon Writ*. After a woman swallows this talisman, she is reborn in a male body.

The *Three Heavens’ Supreme Mystery Yin-Generating Talisman*, bestowed by the Primordial Beginning upon the Supreme Dao Lord, is inscribed in the Vermilion Writ after two kalpas, visible in the moon’s upper abode. According to the old statutes of the Mysterious Capital Purple Tenuity Palace, it is written in black on yellow silk, five *cun* square. After a hundred days of pure fasting, one enters the chamber to contemplate the moon’s essence, holds it in the mouth and swallows it, thereby sharing the moon’s lifespan. Daoists who wish to achieve *shijie* write it in black on a wooden sword, embrace it while lying down, and thus a substitute form dies in their place. This practice demands utmost purity; if impure thoughts or defilement arise in the mouth, the talisman emerges and the body dies.

This talisman is also called the *Transformation Contract* or the *Nine Yin Numinous Writ*; when a man swallows it, he transforms into a woman. These two talismans, embodying the yin and yang qi and the essence of the sun and moon, must not be taken lightly without purifying the body and disciplining the will. Only through proper fasting and adherence to the rites can their power become boundless.

The *Nine Heavens Jade Perfection Long-An Spirit-Flight Talisman* emerges after the *Vermilion Writ* of four kalpas, following the *Primordial Beginning’s Azure Radiance Upper Light Qi*, and appears above the *Northern Primordial Jade Pass* of the Three Heavens. According to the old statutes of the *Purple Tenuity Upper Palace* of the Mysterious Capital, it is written in vermilion on white silk and worn on the body. When traversing the *Great Yang Nine* and *Great Hundred Six*, at the juncture of great kalpas and the convergence of the three great floods, wearing it ensures that no poisons afflict the body, and one passes through the perils of water and fire to witness the Great Peace, becoming a seed-citizen of the Sage Lord. Its script is now sealed in the *Southern Huo Stone Vault*, emerging once every forty thousand kalpas.

The *Three Heavens True Life Spirit Talisman* emerges after the *Vermilion Writ* of five kalpas, following the *Primordial Beginning’s Pervasive Radiance Mysterious Light Qi*, and appears in the *Upper Abode of the Jade Capital* of the Mysterious Capital. According to the old statutes of the *Purple Tenuity Upper Palace*, it is written in black on yellow silk and worn on the body. When traversing the *Lesser Yang Nine* and *Lesser Hundred Six*, at the juncture of lesser kalpas and the convergence of ten thousand disasters, wearing it ensures that no harms afflict the body, and one passes through myriad pestilences to witness the Great Peace, becoming a seed-citizen of the Sage Lord. It is now sealed in the *Northern Dan Broad Numinous Grotto Chamber Stone Vault*, emerging once every forty thousand kalpas.

These two talismans were received by the Supreme Dao Lord from the Primordial Heavenly Worthy and transmitted to the Queen Mother of the West. The Primordial Beginning and the Five Elders gave birth to the Five Thearchs, and the celestial elements were divided into degrees.

The Eastern Direction’s *Nine Qi Azure Heaven*: The heavens possess nine origins, and the nine origins govern the cycles, revolving thirty-two times. Day and night span thirty days, and the heavenly qi converges once; twelve convergences constitute one degree. After three hundred thirty degrees, the qi of all heavens reigns over wood, and the Azure Thearch presides. In the years of *yin* and *mao*, the Azure Thearch’s perfected persons descend to the world, teaching and transforming at Mount Tai, delivering nine individuals to replenish the ranks of the immortals. In those regions and years, crops flourish, disasters do not arise, and warfare and fires cease. After three thousand three hundred degrees, the azure qi surges while the yellow qi wanes—this is the *Lesser Yang Nine* of the yang number’s nine nines, the heavens’ extremity. When the qi of the six heavens ascends, the hundred officials convene, known as the *Lesser Hundred Six*. This heavenly qi surges in the fire palace; in the years of *si* and *wu*, epidemic qi spreads, and though the five grains abound, there are no people to consume them. After nine thousand nine hundred degrees, the azure qi rages while the yellow qi is consumed—this is the *Great Yang Nine* of the yang number’s nine nines. When the qi of the six heavens returns, the hundred officials withdraw their qi, known as the *Great Hundred Six*. This heavenly qi rages in the metal palace; in the years of *shen* and *you*, crops are broken and felled, warfare and illness spread together, epidemic qi fills the heavens, and of ten thousand beings, one survives. At that time, an azure thearchic spirit-person, riding a green dragon and bearing the talismanic mandate, will descend to Mount Tai to regulate the heavenly qi. Those who wear this talisman will escape this disaster.

The Southern Direction’s *Three Qi Vermilion Heaven*: The cycles govern three hundred thirty degrees, and the qi of all heavens reigns over fire, with the Vermilion Thearch presiding. In the years of *si* and *wu*, the Vermilion Thearch’s perfected persons descend to the world, teaching and transforming at Mount Huo, delivering three individuals to replenish the ranks of the immortals. In those regions and years, there is abundance, the state is secure, and the people prosper. After three thousand three hundred degrees, the vermilion qi surges while the white qi wanes—this is the Vermilion Thearch’s *Lesser Yang Nine* and *Lesser Hundred Six*. The heavenly qi surges in the earth palace; in the years of *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*, the four qi expel one another, warfare and disasters spread, fire arises from the earth, and gold and jade form naturally, yet the world is scorched and withered. After nine thousand nine hundred degrees, the vermilion qi rages while the white qi is consumed—this is the Vermilion Thearch’s *Great Yang Nine* and *Great Hundred Six*. The heavenly qi rages in the water palace; in the years of *hai* and *zi*, the essence of fire is extinguished, and for ten thousand *li* there is no smoke. Floods rise to the heavens, and of ten thousand beings, one survives. At that time, a great bird will fly from the southeast, and a vermilion thearchic spirit-person, riding a crimson phoenix and bearing the talismanic mandate, will descend to Mount Huo to regulate the heavenly qi. Those who wear this talisman will escape this disaster.

The Central Direction’s *One Qi Yellow Heaven*: The cycles govern three hundred thirty degrees, and the qi of all heavens reigns over earth, with the Yellow Thearch presiding. In the years of *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*, the Yellow Thearch’s perfected persons descend to the world, teaching and transforming at Mount Songgao, delivering twelve individuals to replenish the ranks of the immortals. In those years, the Central Kingdom enjoys great abundance, and the four directions are at peace. After three thousand three hundred degrees, the yellow qi surges while the black qi wanes—this is the Yellow Thearch’s *Lesser Yang Nine* and *Lesser Hundred Six*. The heavenly qi surges in the metal palace; in the years of *shen* and *you*, earthly mists obscure the heavens, and day and night are indistinguishable. After seven years, the obscuring qi dissipates, and as it spreads, people and beasts die of epidemics, with one-third surviving. After nine thousand nine hundred degrees, the yellow qi rages while the black qi is consumed—this is the Yellow Thearch’s *Great Yang Nine* and *Great Hundred Six*. The heavenly qi rages in the wood palace; in the years of *yin* and *mao*, the nine earths collapse, and the people have no place to stand. Myriad epidemics expel one another, and not one in ten thousand survives. At that time, a yellow thearchic spirit-person, riding a yellow dragon and bearing the talismanic mandate, will descend to the Central Marchmount to regulate the heavenly qi. Those who wear this talisman will escape this disaster.

The Western Direction’s *Seven Qi White Heaven*: The cycles govern three hundred thirty degrees, and the qi of all heavens reigns over metal, with the White Thearch presiding. In the years of *shen* and *you*, the White Thearch’s perfected persons descend to the world, teaching and transforming at Mount Hua, delivering seven individuals to replenish the ranks of the immortals. In those regions and years, there is abundance, the land is secure, and the people prosper. After three thousand three hundred degrees, the white qi surges while the azure qi wanes—this is the White Thearch’s *Lesser Yang Nine* and *Lesser Hundred Six*. The heavenly qi surges in the water palace; in the years of *hai* and *zi*, gold and jade dissolve and vanish, corpses fill the rivers and seas, people devour one another, and the seas turn to blood. After nine thousand nine hundred degrees, the white qi rages while the azure qi is consumed—this is the White Thearch’s *Great Yang Nine* and *Great Hundred Six*. The heavenly qi rages in the fire palace; in the years of *si* and *wu*, metal and stone dissolve of themselves, warfare and disasters expel one another, and the species of people and beasts are extinguished.

The northern quadrant, governed by the Five Qi of the Mysterious Heaven, revolves through three hundred and thirty degrees, with all heavenly qi reigning over water, and the Black Thearch presiding. In the years of *hai* and *zi*, the divine personage of the Black Thearch descends to the world, teaching and transforming at Mount Heng, and delivering five individuals to replenish the ranks of the immortals. In that region and those years, the five grains ripen in abundance, crops grow without sowing, warfare ceases, and the people live in peace. After three thousand three hundred degrees, the black qi surges while the red qi wanes—this is the Black Thearch’s *Lesser Yang Nine* and *Lesser Hundred Six*. The heavenly qi surges in the wood palace; in the years of *yin* and *mao*, crops wither and die, the five grains become exceedingly scarce, waters surge and rivers burst their banks, floods inundate the heavens, corpses of the people drift as flotsam, and bones and blood are torn asunder. After nine thousand nine hundred degrees, the black qi rages while the red qi is consumed—this is the Black Thearch’s *Great Yang Nine* and *Great Hundred Six*. The heavenly qi rages in the earth palace; in the years of *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*, rivers and streams run dry, the seabed turns to dust, and the people, birds, and beasts are scorched to death without remnant. At that time, there shall appear a divine personage of the Black Thearch, riding a dark dragon, bearing the talismanic mandate to regulate the heavenly qi at Mount Heng. Those who wear this script shall be spared from these calamities.

The five directions revolve through thirty-two cycles, and after nine thousand nine hundred degrees, the qi of the five directions all ascend to circulate the primordial Azure Yang qi, returning to revolve within the Mysterious Capital Jade Mountain’s central pass. They circle beyond the ten voids of the myriad heavens, the sun, the moon, and the stars, for ninety-nine myriad nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine degrees. The heavenly qi reverses the calamities of one kalpa, and the myriad beings of heaven and earth, mountains and rivers, seas, metals and stones, and the people all dissolve and vanish in an instant. At this time, heaven and earth undergo transformation, and in the blink of an eye, there is nothing to be done. Only those who wear the Jade Script of the Numinous Treasure may immediately attain rebirth in the midst of the primal division, as if in the brief moment of awakening from sleep. Without this script, none can achieve this.

The yang qi turns the heavenly pivot, while the yin qi turns the earthly mechanism. The mouths of the Nine Rivers, the ebb and flow of waters, all correspond to the heavenly divisions, and their revolutions align likewise. Thus, the yang number nine is called *Yang Nine*, and the yin number eight is called *Eight Calamities*. The revolutions of heaven and earth are mirrored in humanity.

The Mysterious Capital Jade Mountain lies at the center of the upper heavens. Trees of the seven treasures overhang and shade the eight directions. There are the perfected divine lords of the ten directions and the wondrously accomplished true persons who attend and guard the numinous script within the Jade Mountain. They traverse the void, chanting the cavernous chapters, circling the Jade Mountain once, and the myriad heavens praise their virtue. Five hundred and fifty-five myriad five thousand five hundred and fifty-five layers of the Dao, five hundred and fifty-five myriad five thousand five hundred and fifty-five myriad boundless numbers of the most true and great spirits—on the day of the grand Numinous Treasure fast, all bow their heads from afar and intone the Jade Tone. The musicians of the myriad heavens, with hundreds of thousands of myriad kinds of celestial arts, assemble together in the cloud court. At this time, how truly joyous it is!

When the great kalpa of heaven and earth is about to turn, the perfected divine lords of the myriad heavens and the wondrously accomplished true persons descend to roam the Five Marchmounts, gazing from afar upon the most learned of the world. As the vast currents surge to the heavens, they are all welcomed by the five dragons, ascending to the Hall of Blessings, enabling them to share in the same death and rebirth as the Primordial Beginning.

Together with the Five Thearchs, the Five Marchmounts, the Four Waterways, the River Lords of the Jiang, He, Huai, and Ji, and the Nine Divisions, they expose transgressions. The Three Officials summon and examine, while the terrestrial deities patrol the world, overseeing and scrutinizing the weight of good and evil deeds, then reporting them to the heavens. On such days, those who uphold the *Lingbao* True Scriptures, observe fasting and precepts, burn incense, and recite the Dao are commended by the Grand Unity. Their meritorious deeds are recorded, their names inscribed in the Registers of Transcendent Immortals, and the earth gods encamp to protect them. Those who violate the precepts and break the rules have their names transferred to the Earth Officials, forever marked as sinful subjects.

The Northern Thearch of the Supreme Mystery Upper Palace, on every *gengshen* day, restrains the Three Worms and hun-souls of the celestial subjects, itemizing their transgressions and reporting them to the Imperial Lord. On such days, those who observe fasting and precepts, meditating on the divine day and night, prevent the Three Worms from ascending to heaven to report their sins. The Earthly Offices instead report their good deeds to the Imperial Lord. The Grand Unity rejoices and records their names in the Left Contract, forever marking them as the seed people.

The Supreme Perfected Honored Gods of the Supreme Mystery Upper Palace, on every *jiazi* day, dispatch the Grand Unity’s Central Terrace Great Envoys to traverse all heavens and earths, inspecting the deities and driving away miscellaneous vulgar spirits and demonic essences. On such days, those who perform fasting rites and burn incense have their good deeds itemized by the Central Terrace Great Envoys and reported to the Three Heavens’ Supreme Thearch. The Supreme Thearch then appoints them as Overseers of Heaven, commanding the terrestrial ghost and spirit kings. Their names are inscribed in the Jade Calendar, and they are forever recognized as Perfected Ones.

They tally the records of transgressions of the world’s myriad people, assessing the weight of merits and transgressions, and report them to the *Lingbao* Mystery Metropolis Upper Palace.

The Yang Terrace Perfected Ones of the Supreme Mystery Upper Palace, on the day of *Lidong* (Beginning of Winter), gather with the immortal officials and jade maidens atop the *Lingbao* Yang Terrace to assess the records of Dao students, weighing the depth and shallowness of their names, and report them to the *Lingbao* Mystery Metropolis Upper Palace.

They assess and determine the records of the host of immortals, reporting them to the *Lingbao* Mystery Metropolis Upper Palace.

The days of the Eight Nodal Points are the great celebratory assembly days of the heavens. On such days, the great sagely honored gods and the wondrously accomplished Perfected Ones of the various heavens ascend without exception to the *Lingbao* Mystery Metropolis’ Jade Capital Mountain Upper Palace. They pay homage to the Heavenly Perfected, uphold the precepts and fast, circumambulate while reciting scriptures, and each dispatches the majestic divine spirits to patrol the world, the Four Seas, the Eight Extremities, the Five Marchmounts, and the famous mountains, scrutinizing the merits and transgressions of those who study the Dao and the common people who have attained it. The weight of their deeds is reported to the Upper Palace. On such days, the stellar constellations of the heavens, the sun, moon, Jade Armillary Sphere, and the terrestrial deities all stand in solemn reverence. All who observe fasting, uphold the precepts, and revere the celestial patterns are commended by the Five Thearchs, distinguished in the heavens’ right records, their names inscribed in the Jade Calendar. They are marked as the seed people, and the Three Officials’ divine spirits are commanded to guard and protect them. Their households are ordered and solemn, and the myriad calamities do not afflict them. Those who diligently study are welcomed by the Three Realms’ overseers, and the immortals deliver them to transcend the world, elevating them as Perfected Ones. Those who do evil and violate the precepts are seized by the examining officials, transferred to the Earth Officials, and forever marked as sinful subjects.

The Five Elder Lords’ *Lingbao* Five Chapters of True Writ, the Celestial Writ of the Primordial Beginning, were born within the Void Cavern, serving as the root of heaven and earth. Numinous, honored, and wondrously noble, their teachings are majestic and solemn. The Three Origins unfold, their virtue crowning all heavens. The Fourteen Virtues are all cultivated through the Three Origins’ fasts, their noble conduct renowned in lofty esteem.

First, their virtue is like the Great Void—formless and boundless, the ancestral origin of the beginningless.
Second, their virtue is like the Primordial Void—from nothing, something arises; within something, nothing returns.
Third, their virtue is like the Great Dao—majestic and numinous, vast and expansive, the treasure of divine luminosity.
Fourth, their virtue is like heaven—limpid, clear, lofty, and empty, broadly covering without bounds.
Fifth, their virtue is like earth—open, expansive, and all-embracing, bearing all without exception.
Sixth, their virtue is like the Three Luminaries and Five Planets—all heavens universally receive their radiance.
Seventh, their virtue is like the Lofty Perfected—expounding and unfolding the mysterious teachings, the honored ones amidst the heavens.
Eighth, their virtue is like the divine beings—broadly delivering all, universally receiving the natural.

Ninth, their virtue is like the Supreme Mystery—pure, open, and expansive, the capital of divine immortals.
Tenth, their virtue is like clouds and rain—all the myriad beings universally receive their shade and moisture.
Eleventh, their virtue is like the wind—all the myriad beings receive its bestowal and release.
Twelfth, their virtue is like the four seasons—all the myriad beings receive their generation and completion.
Thirteenth, their virtue is like Mount Tai—securing the primordial mandate, pacifying the divine regalia.
Fourteenth, their virtue is like the Great River—vast and unobstructed, none it does not embrace.

The numinous scriptures are wondrously weighty. These fourteen virtues, towering and lofty in their exemplarity, are of measureless magnitude. Their blessings flow like shade, endless through ten thousand kalpas; they illumine the primordial transformation, and none do not arise therefrom.

The Five Chapters of the Numinous Treasure’s true writ bestow fourteen blessings, and the rewards of blessings are as follows:

First, form and spirit become limpid and upright, free from all misfortunes; forever parted from pain and affliction, the body knows no illness.
Second, the myriad demons are subdued; the Five Emperors show reverence, earth spirits attend and guard, the heart is upright and the spirit settled.
Third, the lofty sages of the Mysterious observe; the heavenly spirits record one’s name, inscribe it in the register of the right, erase death and ascend to life.
Fourth, virtue and wisdom ever renew; ghosts and spirits are commanded, whatever one desires is attained, and one sits and summons the natural.
Fifth, divine youths and jade maidens attend and guard the body; wherever one goes, they receive and welcome.
Sixth, heavenly calamities submit; blessings and felicity daily increase, the household flourishes, and virtue daily ascends.
Seventh, the clan is upright and majestic; generation after generation enjoys peace, both within and without share in the felicity, and its blessings flow endlessly.
Eighth, the Five Emperors promote one; one is elevated to fill the ranks of the Perfected, the Three Realms receive and welcome, and a radiant light rests upon the crown.
Ninth, all dust and defilement vanish; within and without, one is bright and fresh, the body fragrant and pure, immaculate as vajra.
Tenth, no aspiration is unfulfilled, no wish unanswered; whatever one desires is effortlessly attained, boundless and penetrating, the heart keen and the body sagely, the spirit and the numinous in communion.
Eleventh, one is revered by all the great sacred honored gods of the heavens, the wondrously accomplished Perfected, the flying immortals of the Five Peaks, and all beings.
Twelfth, merit is perfected and virtue fulfilled; the Dao’s recompense is natural, the body grows feathered raiment, and one ascends to heaven in broad daylight.
Thirteenth, the greatness of one’s merit and virtue extends upward to seven generations of ancestors, liberating them from the Three Wretched Paths, the Five Sufferings, and the Eight Difficulties; they ascend to the heavenly halls, receive immortality in the Southern Palace, and blessings flow downward to descendants, generation after generation flourishing.
Fourteenth, the merit of these words extends to all crawling, flying, wriggling, and breathing creatures—both those already born and those yet to be born within the six domestic animals—all universally enjoy extended years. Those who honor the numinous writ, perform purification rites, and make offerings.

Such merit is of the utmost weight, and the recompense of virtue is natural. The Three Officials record and remember, not a hair’s breadth lost. The resonance of response and requital is most evident in principle.

The two chapters on virtue and blessings comprise twenty-eight clauses, issued from the Upper Register of the Purple Tenuity Palace in the Mysterious Capital. They are the virtues practiced by the most true and devoted scholars.

The Middle Register of the Purple Tenuity Palace in the Mysterious Capital.

The true writ of the Numinous Treasure is beheld by the assembled Perfected who perform purification rites, uphold the precepts, and pay homage to the celestial writ with twelve devotions:

First, devotion to diligent and arduous practice, never transgressing the scriptural precepts, honoring the Dharma in every matter.
Second, devotion to the reverence of the Dao and the nobility of virtue, the loftiness and greatness of the Dharma’s transformation, and the aspirations of the heart.
Third, devotion to repenting and confessing all transgressions, hiding nothing, rectifying the heart and cultivating reverence, ever fulfilling one’s duties.
Fourth, devotion to the aspiration for divine immortality, to behold the True Lord, to escape the calamitous world, and to witness the Great Peace in person.
Fifth, devotion to delivering all from suffering and hardship, from the Three Evil Paths and the Five Calamities.
Sixth, devotion to the aspiration to attain flight, to ride upon clouds and dragons.
Seventh, devotion to the billions of ancestors, the parents of past lives, to disperse the accumulated burdens of the deceased, to free them from servitude and punishment, and to ascend to the halls of felicity.
Eighth, devotion to all within the household, young and old, and to fellow practitioners, that their blessings and felicity daily increase, and their good thoughts daily arise.
Ninth, devotion to all people universally, to descendants of future generations, that they escape calamity and, dwelling in peril, attain safety.
Tenth, devotion to all creatures from livestock downward, to all breathing and wriggling beings, and to all that draw breath and possess vitality, that they universally receive kindness and grace, and are covered and protected by beneficent shade.
Eleventh, devotion to the aspiration to transcend worldly glory, to cast aside heterodox customs, deceitful flattery, falsehood, demonic spirits, and the arts of spectral and miscellaneous sorcery.
Twelfth, devotion to commanding ghosts and employing spirits, to capturing and restraining the wicked and deceitful, that heaven and humanity suffer no harm, and all universally part from evil, the Three Calamities, Nine Perils, Ten Sufferings, and Eight Difficulties, to attain the rank of the highest immortals, ascend to heaven in broad daylight, and after transcending the immortal realm, unite with the Dao in devotion.

These twelve devotions arise from the natural heart of heaven, the virtue of great compassion, and their merit is vast throughout the heavens.

The old ritual system pertains to the Middle Chapter of the Numinous Treasure, located in the Mysterious Capital. The Middle Register of the Purple Tenuity Palace in the Mysterious Capital bestows twelve devotions, and with them come twelve rewards:

First, the body is sturdy and strong, the physical form peaceful and secure.
Second, one’s reputation spreads far and wide; all people desire to hear of one’s wishes.
Third, one is beloved and revered by all the great sacred honored gods of the heavens, the wondrously accomplished Perfected, favored by the sun, moon, and stars, revered by immortals and sages, looked up to by earth spirits, and feared by ghosts and gods.
Fourth, the myriad families of the world revere and honor one, calling one a Perfected; all is auspicious and without misfortune, and felicity and peace endure forever. All crawling creatures seek one as a bridge; the thousand spirits and myriad demons, the monstrous and deceitful ghosts and gods, all vanish in an instant, and every response follows the heart’s desire.
Fifth, wherever one goes, in coming and going, officials and soldiers guard the body, heavenly officers lead the way, and earth spirits receive and welcome.
Sixth, one subdues and commands all ghosts and gods of heaven and earth; one sits and summons the heavenly kitchens and jade maidens to attend and guard.
Seventh, one commands the Six Jia spirits, sets the stars in motion, rebukes and employs the Three August Ones, dispatches and commands ghosts and spirits; in walking and sitting, eating and resting, heavenly spirits attend and protect, and earth spirits stand guard.
Eighth, wherever one dwells, within a radius of three thousand six hundred li, the monstrous and deceitful, heterodox customs, and crafty specters all vanish in an instant.

Ninth, in associating with those on the Dao, one is lifted by immortals, roaming the Five Peaks; entering and leaving among the people, none dare harm or injure.
Tenth, one severs the heterodox and shatters enemies, commanding them to depart without instruction.
Eleventh, with each day, the bones of longevity grow, the Dao of immortality daily advances; when the Dao is perfected and virtue fulfilled, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight.
Twelfth, one befriends the supreme sages, the noble lords and elders, ascending into the formless and merging with the Dao as one.

These twelve rewards extend from the bestowal of virtue, prized by the Supreme Emperor, and naturally attained through focused intent. The two chapters of *Bestowing Thoughts and Receiving Rewards* contain twenty-four clauses, issued from the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Mysterious Capital in the *Middle Prime Registers*—the virtue practiced by those who cultivate the utmost truth.

The *Lower Prime Registers* of the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Mysterious Capital. The *True Writ of Numinous Treasure*, when observed by the assembled perfected ones in fasting and audience, reveals twelve graces upon paying homage to the celestial patterns:
First, it absolves the transgressions of past lives and the sins of the present.
Second, it brings fortune and averts calamity.
Third, it secures life in the future and averts death.
Fourth, it summons wealth and attracts official emolument.
Fifth, it benefits descendants in later generations.
Sixth, it extends blessings to departed ancestors.
Seventh, it ensures prosperity in the present life.
Eighth, it forges kinship with heaven and earth.
Ninth, it fosters friendship with perfected ones.
Tenth, one swiftly attains celestial immortality, ascending to heaven in broad daylight.
Eleventh, after transcending mortality, one ascends to the halls of the Dao.
Twelfth, it bestows universal blessings, serving as a bridge for the world.

These twelve graces arise from the refinement of conduct, where virtue moves the celestial perfected. The *Lower Prime Registers* of the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Mysterious Capital. The *True Writ of Numinous Treasure*, when observed by the assembled perfected ones in fasting and audience, reveals fourteen merits:
First, for past lives; second, for descendants; third, for the present world; fourth, for dwelling in mountains; fifth, for cultivating the Dao; sixth, for seeking immortality; seventh, for officials; eighth, for governing the people; ninth, for all beings; tenth, for the world; eleventh, for heaven; twelfth, for spirits; thirteenth, for humanity; fourteenth, for all myriad things.

The method of fasting and directly addressing the supreme sages is one of purity, emptiness, simplicity, and plainness—casting off filth to summon the perfected. Above, it accords with the arrayed stars; in the middle, it aligns with human sentiments; below, it conforms to the hearts of things. The sagely see it as sagely, the benevolent as benevolent, the wise as wise, the worthy as worthy. The Primordial Beginning established this Dharma as the most revered of all Daoist practices, the abode of the Supreme Emperor, the bridge for those who cultivate and attain.

The two chapters of *Bestowing Grace and Establishing Merit* contain twenty-six clauses, issued from the *Lower Prime Registers* of the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Mysterious Capital—the virtue practiced by those who cultivate the utmost truth.

The *Primordial Beginning’s Natural Vermilion Writ of Jade Chapters and True Writ*, after its revelation, was each entrusted with a text to pacify and guard the Five Peaks. The original text was sealed in the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Mysterious Capital, where the assembled perfected stood guard, establishing the arcane statutes with rites of reverence. At the end of the fifth kalpa, it was transmitted to the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the Most High Great Sage Assembly, and the perfected ones of all heavens. They reverently cultivated the numinous writ, expounded its profound meanings, and elucidated its intricate details. There are ten divisions of wondrous scriptures in thirty-six scrolls, two scrolls of jade instructions to establish essential practices, all sealed in the Upper Palace of Purple Tenuity. The assembled perfected, on the days when heaven’s blessings converge, fast, uphold the precepts, gather in the Mysterious Capital, pay homage to the celestial patterns, recite the scriptures, and perform the Daoist rites. Above, they praise the chapters of the Primordial Beginning’s naturalness; in the middle, they harmonize the qi of the Three Primes’ luminous clarity; below, they celebrate the great compassionate teachings of the divine perfected.

Where the Dao resides, it is revered; only purity is prized, hence fasting and precepts preserve its discipline. On the days of fasting, the great sages, honored deities, and perfected ones of wondrous conduct, along with the sun, moon, and constellations, all gather at the Terrace of Jade Capital in the Upper Palace of Purple Tenuity in the Mysterious Capital. They uphold the precepts, pay homage, circumambulate, and recite the scriptures. The perfected ones and immortals of the Five Peaks on earth, the water emperors of the Four Seas, the Three Officials of Mount Feng, and the earth deities of the Three Realms—all spirits and numina, without exception, don their sashes, stand in solemnity, fast, revere the Dao, and honor the Dharma, thereby exalting the celestial perfected. The forms and standards of its rites and statutes are fully set forth in the *Golden and Purple Registers of the Numinous Treasure*, with systems of yin and yang, rewards, and assessments.

The *True Writ of Numinous Treasure* originated at the dawn of the Vermilion Clarity’s unfolding of the mysterious, named the *Vermilion Writ of the Radiant August Emperor of the Primordial Chaos*. When heaven and earth divided, heaven was called the *Numinous*, and earth the *Treasure*—hence the name *Numinous Treasure*. In the era of the Yellow Emperor, at the end of the fifth kalpa, the teachings descended to deliver those who attain the Dao, enabling them to ascend into the mysterious.
