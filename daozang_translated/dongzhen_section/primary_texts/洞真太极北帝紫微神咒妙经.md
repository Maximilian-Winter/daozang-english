### *The Wondrous Scripture of the Divine Incantations of the Purple Tenuity of the Northern Thearch of the Supreme Ultimate*
#### *Chapter on the Divine Incantations Empowered by Edict for the Divine Soldiers to Protect the State, Pacify Households, Expel Ghosts, and Dissolve Disasters*

The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning proclaimed:
In the Lower Kalpa, sentient beings abound in wickedness and perversity.
They gather in great states yet do not follow the true Dao.
They boast of their own strength, unaware that human life is fleeting.
From this time forth, the great demons shall hold sway.
In this world of the Five Turbidities, people commit manifold transgressions,
scheming against the multitudes, bringing harm to the world.
The myriad people toil in hardship, all beings suffer punishment.
The people of the state act lawlessly, meting out punishments and calamities.
Bandits arise from below, sowing chaos in the world.
Ghostly soldiers invade the state, unleashing great pestilential disasters.
Blades slaughter the people, who in turn grow malevolent and rebellious.
Legal punishments are plotted, ghostly schemes multiply, and the roads grow perilous.
Five kinds of great bandits roam by night, killing people,
seizing and plundering, fleeing with captives—rebel factions and ghostly brigands.
You, the five kinds of great ghosts, wreak havoc in the world.
The myriad people know no peace; the humble bear heavy burdens.
Prefectures and counties labor in hardship; the land is not governed justly.
The noble disregard the Dao, and a thousand ghosts and ten thousand demons all harm people,
emptying households and leaving all affairs unfulfilled.
Death by banditry and harm, chronic illness in the home,
official ghosts in the household, and monstrous ghosts arise in competition.
The people’s dwellings are depleted and drained; nothing prospers.
Yet if even one person turns toward the essentials of the Dao and upholds Our edict,
the myriad disasters may be resolved, and the hundred pestilences shall scatter of themselves.
The great armies of official ghosts shall dissipate and not arise.
Winds will be harmonious, rains timely; the land will be level and just, and all affairs will flourish.
We do not speak falsely. Those who receive Our true words
shall themselves transcend disasters, dangers, and hardships, and these matters shall naturally disperse.
You must not fail to grasp Our intent. All you sentient beings, men and women,
if you but receive the essential and wondrous arts of this scripture,
you shall sever and slay all illnesses, and ghostly disasters shall vanish of themselves.
Should any ghost defy the true edict, the Demon Kings shall come to seize and bind them,
slaying the ghostly brigands and shattering their skulls.
We command that their ghostly kin be torn asunder and cast into the pit.
Hasten! By edict and command!

The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning proclaimed:
In the Lower Kalpa, sentient beings commit sins and perpetrate evil,
engaging in the Five Inversions and unfilial acts, killing without reason, and tormenting their own bodies.
Their minds do not reflect; they cling to transient gains.
Though they have long enjoyed glory and splendor in this world, they shall ultimately tread the path of death,
their malevolent hearts unbroken. Rather than cease their transgressions,
they bring misfortune upon their descendants, who suffer bitterness and hardship,
their debts and retributions impossible to clarify.
When ghosts enter the Middle Kingdom, good and evil are made plain.
These ghosts are named the "Heavenly Ghosts," for Heaven has dispatched them,
commanding them to lead tens of thousands to descend upon the ten directions,
the various states, prefectures, and counties of the world, to slay the wicked.
Heavenly soldiers and ghostly emissaries drive these living people
to perish amid the great disasters of blades, water, and fire.
Why do you, O people of the world, not believe in the great Dao,
thus allowing these ghosts to traverse the world, stirring chaos among the living?
The land and its people, the kin of the realm, shall perish between Heaven and Earth,
great illnesses afflicting them until the *jiayin* year.
Water and fire shall contend, and ghostly pestilences shall abound.
The multitudes shall suffer grave illnesses, and Heaven’s judgments shall spread.
In this age of blades and warfare, people are often unfilial to their parents.
Siblings turn against one another; prefectures and counties lie in ruin.
The land is emptied, and many perish in defeat.
The state having suffered disaster, the people too lack filial piety,
thus inviting these calamities and upheavals.
The people of the world, benighted by heterodoxy, know not the true and correct words of the great Dao.
From this time forth, those who with sincere hearts come to receive Our wondrous scripture of *samādhi*
shall be attended by the Five Demon Heavenly Maidens, the Jade Lads of the Nine Radiant Flowers,
the Purple Clarity Wondrous Maidens, the Perfected of the Ten Chambers, the Great Soldiers of the Five Heavens,
and ten thousand messengers and *li* warriors.
We dispatch the *samādhi* Dharma Masters of the Northern Thearch
to the places where the Dao is practiced and the scriptures recited, where people are saved—
all ghostly lords. We issue edicts to the Three Realms, commanding them to uphold Our true words.
You, Demon Kings, must swiftly release them and not detain them; grievances must be swiftly resolved.
We send forth the immortals of the various heavens, jade maidens and wondrous lads,
bearing talismans and holding staffs, chanting hymns of praise to Heaven,
to descend and rescue the multitudes from their afflictions.
Hasten! By edict and command!

The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning proclaimed:
In the Lower Kalpa, sentient beings now face the age of Heaven’s destiny and the disasters of the Five Demons.
The world is thrown into chaos by ghostly factions, ignorant and unenlightened,
unable to discern good from evil, tormenting themselves.
In this great era of the Lower Kalpa’s destiny and the great armies,
the ghostly soldiers of the Six Caverns shall emerge and traverse the world,
seizing the people of the state—those who lack righteousness, do not believe, and do not follow the true Dharma—
driving them into the Three Evil Paths and delivering them to the pestilence ghosts to be beaten and slain.
These people, lacking righteousness and faith in the great Dao, are thus slain.
By the *yimao* year, those who disrespect Dharma Masters and do not believe in the great Dao
shall swiftly be consigned to the Cinnabar Sand Hell by the Demon Kings and *li* warriors of the Three Heavens.
Hasten! As decreed by the great law of the Three Heavens.
We dispatch the Great-Eyed *Li* Warriors and the Messengers of the Central Heaven
to follow the Dharma Masters in their practice of the Dao and their places of saving people,
where the sick shall swiftly recover and official matters shall be swiftly resolved.
All you sentient beings, uphold Our divine incantations,
and transmit them to the immeasurable *samādhi* Dharma Masters of the Northern Thearch.
You must revere your masters as Heaven reveres the four seasons, the sun and moon,
and the eight solar terms that come and go. Bow and inquire of the Dharma Masters,
asking whether they passed the night in peace.
You, all sentient beings, shall in future lives ascend as immortals, and the myriad spirits shall revere and serve you.
From this time forth, We dispatch the *Li* Warriors of the Forest of Peers,
the Five Venerable Elders, the Great Immortals of the Ten Directions,
the Five Ding Messengers, and the Great Gods of the Ten Heavens
to descend as one and guard and protect the people.

The people’s likes and dislikes, We too know them.
The winds and waters, however many, shall never lead to wrongful slaughter.
All you sentient beings must understand that the great Dao bestows Heaven’s grace,
and know that the four seasons corrupt goodness, with cold and heat in measure.
This year, ghosts roam the land, and pestilence spreads far and wide.
Those who contract this sickness shall perish in great numbers, for these ghosts are most rampant.
Yet if any come to revere the teachings of the *samādhi* Dharma Masters of the Northern Thearch,
all affairs shall prosper, pestilence shall depart of itself,
and all plague ghosts shall flee a thousand *li* away,
while the Demon Kings of the Three Heavens descend to execute and slay.
Hasten the divine decrees!

The Most High Lord of the Dao Primordial declares:
In the lower kalpa, the age of the Earth Lords, the year of ten thousand afflictions,
a thousand myriad Earth Lord ghosts shall arise across the land,
along with white-headed ghosts, Five Wood ghosts, and Five Earth ghosts—
red of eye, black of face, gaping of mouth—
who shall enter the states, counties, villages, and hamlets of the Middle Kingdom,
spreading their pestilent poison to slay all people.
Those who fail to honor the Three Treasures and the True Lords of the great Dao,
who disbelieve in the Daoist teachings,
shall bring upon themselves the spread of thirty thousand plagues.
In the year *bǐng-chén*, a crimson pestilence shall sweep the land.
That year, the Crimson *Dīng* ghosts shall roam, spreading fiery contagion,
the plague of blades and warfare, to slaughter the myriad people—men and women alike.
Ancient enmities shall pursue them, and cursing ghosts shall seek them out,
craving the taste of blood and flesh, draining the vitality of the living.
Afflicted by sudden illness, besieged by misfortune,
haunted by *wǎngliǎng* spirits, hounded by vengeful ghosts,
burdened by official troubles, their sickness shall worsen,
and their lives hang by a thread, nearing death.
As pestilence invades and great armies ravage the land,
the people shall know no peace, the five grains shall fail to ripen.
War shall claim lives, homes shall lie abandoned,
laws shall turn harsh, and the people shall lose the Way.
The noble shall cease their rites, incense and offerings shall not reach the Dharma Masters,
and the great Dao shall be disbelieved.
Thus shall grace be spurned and the sacred law slighted.
The Most High shall dispatch the Crimson Cavalry Officers,
brandishing iron staves to patrol the land,
seizing those who speak blasphemous words of treason and rebellion,
whom the Heavenly *Dīng* shall strike down.
Should any ghosts or men refuse to submit, their guilt shall span ten thousand kalpas.
If they are not masters of ghosts, how can they be saved?
Hasten the divine decrees!

The Most High Lord of the Dao Primordial declares:
In the lower kalpa, the age governed by celestial portents,
perverse spirits shall abound, and the land shall know no peace.
Ghost Kings shall traverse the land, spewing fire and disease.
These ghosts shall travel a thousand *li* by night,
blighting horses, grain, and fields with sudden affliction.
Demon ghosts shall spread great pestilence, and floods shall soon follow,
while celestial plagues shall strike the people, who shall lose the Way.
In the year *dīng-sì*, the Raven-Yuan Ghost Lord shall unleash a myriad plagues,
which shall spread across the ten directions, filling the land,
and the people shall tremble in terror.
Ghost Lords shall gather daily, and the people shall find no refuge.
Blades and warfare shall ravage the land, disrupting the realm.
Ghostly bandits shall devour men, official matters shall falter,
and uprisings shall arise in the mountains and forests.
Earth ghosts shall bring dysentery—crimson and black—
to harm the people of Heaven.
Good and evil shall be weighed, yet not in one place alone;
each land shall face its own perils, and many shall turn to wickedness.
“Gauging the hearts of men, five kinds of treacherous thoughts arise.
Though they rely on Heaven and Earth, they know not human affairs,
nor do they endure for long.
Self-made, self-destroyed, their families shall be ruined,
scattered far and wide, their grievances extending even to the six relations.
Such deeds are evil and must not be done.
They shall lead to death and ruin, bringing calamity to families and nations,
while armies surge across the land from south to north, disrupting the world.
Blades shall clash, fathers south and sons north,
the land shall know no harmony, the people shall bear heavy burdens,
and the myriad folk shall lose their livelihoods.
Such is the fate of the guilty.”
Heavenly soldiers shall drive them into the fires of hell,
where they shall suffer for ten thousand kalpas and more.
Yet if even one person reveres the Dao with wholehearted devotion,
delighting in the recitation of the great *sūtra* of the *samādhi* of the Northern Thearch,
We shall dispatch the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers,
the Great Gods of the Ten Directions, the *Lì* Warriors, and Jade Maidens
to come to the aid of the people.
All the sick among sentient beings shall swiftly find deliverance,
and official troubles shall be resolved.
All baleful □ ghosts shall flee ten thousand *li* away.
Should any refuse to submit, they shall be delivered to Wenchang,
their heads shattered and brains crushed—no Dharma Master may save them,
and their factions shall be executed by the soldiers.
Hasten the divine decrees!

The Most High Lord of the Dao Primordial declares:
In the lower kalpa, the era of the Three Officials and the calamity of the Five Pestilences,
many shall fall ill, and the people of the land shall perish,
as plagues spread unchecked.
All matters of the Three Realms shall be pursued by official laws,
and punishments shall bring harm.
Nothing shall prosper, and slander shall arise.
The noble shall lose the Way, and calamity shall disrupt the land.
Great ghostly armies shall follow, and the people shall suffer.
Plague ghosts shall spread, and the Three Officials shall exact their oaths.
A hundred ghosts shall descend, bringing sickness to the living.
Men and women shall suffer dysentery, and their descendants shall perish.
In the year *wù-wǔ*, a great pestilence shall strike the people of the land.
Heavenly soldiers shall descend, and the people shall endure hardship,
as the myriad beings face great disaster.

Should any person turn toward the Three Honored Ones, receive the scriptures and uphold the Dharma, and venerate the North Emperor’s Samādhi Master by performing the Dao rituals—from this moment onward, if any suffer from pestilence, official misfortune, the calamity of great armies, the collapse of their dwellings, or the distress of their descendants, or if the myriad people face disaster—I shall dispatch the Great Halberd General, the Red Cavalry, the Red Infantry, and the Hundred-Tongued Messengers, each wielding a crimson staff, to slay all ghostly bandits among humankind. Should any minor ghost of illness claim to be a spirit of the Three Dukes or Five Emperors, I know well who you are. Every name of the plague ghosts lies within my grasp. If even one ghost refuses to depart, the Three Officials’ great armies shall descend to execute them all. Those plague ghosts who harass and disturb the living, along with those who bring official misfortune, shall be swiftly driven a thousand myriad leagues away. None shall be spared, and all shall be slain to the last fraction. Should any demon king fail to heed this command, they shall be the first to face a hundredfold punishment. Hasten, by the decree of the statutes and ordinances!

The Most High Lord of the Dao Primordial declares: In the era when the ghostly armies descend upon the lower realm, the people of the Middle Kingdom shall suffer greatly from illness and plague. The demon kings of the Three Caverns shall descend, along with the Six Palace Demon Kings who uphold the world, bringing ghostly armies into the Middle Kingdom—pestilence, flood, fire, and warfare shall throw the world into chaos. The myriad people shall fall ill, and humankind shall face peril. Ghosts from within and without shall spread great plague. The common folk shall flee in desperation as great demons disrupt the world and ghostly soldiers converge upon the people. In the year *jǐ-wèi*, the Beak-Headed Demon King, the Raven-Extended Great King, the Long-Nosed Great King, the Strong and Ominous Great King of the Inner and Outer Realms, the Small-Eyed Great King, the White-Faced Great King, and the Red-Faced Great King—each of you kings shall be examined. Your descendants and followers shall be bound by this decree. Should any person uphold the Dharma, receive the scriptures, and make offerings to the North Emperor’s Samādhi Master, the sick shall recover at once, and all affairs shall turn auspicious. You demon kings must swiftly command your ghostly minions to ensure the sick recover quickly, official troubles dissolve, and all matters resolve peacefully. If even one ghost resists, or if any demon king fails to comply, they shall be swiftly executed. Hasten, by the decree of the statutes and ordinances!

The Most High Lord of the Dao Primordial declares: From this moment onward, in the lower realm, countless thousands of ghosts shall come to the Middle Kingdom, and the myriad people shall endure suffering. The common folk shall fall ill, and official corvée shall multiply. Great floods shall come, and the noble shall lose the Way.

Official disputes shall bring punishments, and unjust punishments shall spawn convicts. Perils and hardships shall entwine, and calamities shall lie with the Three Officials between Heaven and Earth. The deluded and base shall find no recourse. Yet if there be those who uphold the Dao and revere the sacred incantations of the Three Heavens, their illnesses shall heal of themselves, and their official troubles shall resolve on their own.

From this moment until the year of Gengshen, should any of the myriad people venerate the *True Scripture of the North Emperor’s Samādhi*, the Most High shall issue this decree: You demon kings must command your subordinates that from this day forward, they shall not transgress against Our people. Swiftly order your ghostly legions to release the living, that illnesses may vanish at once, official troubles may not arise, and pestilential toxins may disperse. Hasten, by the decree of the statutes and ordinances!

The Most High Lord of the Dao Primordial declares: From this moment onward, the people of the lower realm shall suffer myriad afflictions. In the Middle Kingdom, there shall come ghost lords—the Long-Headed Ghost Lord, the Red-Faced Ghost Lord, the One Who Reverses the Chart Ghost Lord, and the Muchuan Ghost Lord—who shall enter the Middle Kingdom. They shall cause the king to turn tyrannical, ruler and minister to slaughter one another, and father and son to harm each other. The myriad people shall endure hardship, and the common folk shall face great disaster.

Birth and death among the living grow frequent, and illness spreads among the people. Ghostly servitors wound one another, blades clash in slaughter. Ghostly legions spread poison, swiftly harming the living. In the year *xinyou*, the people of the realm shall know no peace—floodwaters shall rise ten thousand fathoms, and fish and dragons shall turn upon each other. High officials shall be displaced, ruler and minister shall rebel against one another, and the common folk shall wound each other. Illness and exile shall spread, and the people of the world shall perish to the last, their weeping one upon another. All this is the work of ghost lords stirring chaos in the world, depleting and harming the people. They shall cause the common folk to flee, the multitudes to fall ill, all manner of miasmic afflictions, and the black pestilence of evil. The Yellow Slaves and the Seven Sons shall come repeatedly, harming the people, their fields, and their silkworms, bringing illness to the myriad folk. Now that you know the names of these ghosts, from this moment onward, banish them a thousand *li* away. Hasten, by the decree of the statutes and ordinances!

The Most High Lord of the Dao Primordial declares: In the lower realm, the kalpa of ghostly legions shall begin. From this moment onward, many shall flee their homes, great armies shall rise, and the multitudes shall know no peace. The Three Heavenly Demon Kings shall enter the realm to spread disaster, and pestilence shall blanket the world. Households and the realm’s people shall know no peace. Bandits shall roam freely, and ghostly *qi* shall slay the people. The multitudes shall suffer great calamity—disasters of water and fire. In the year *renxu*, the king shall fall and perish, the myriad people shall scatter and flee, enduring hardship. Ten kinds of demon kings shall traverse the world, disturbing the sagely ruler, setting ruler and minister against one another, and father and son at odds. Chaos shall arise from below, the realm shall grow tyrannical, and the people shall perish. Yet if even one person in the realm receives and upholds the *Samādhi Sutra*, disasters shall vanish, and the people shall know peace. Now, the demon kings, lords of the celestial caverns, and heavenly hosts shall lay down their arms. The king and the people of the world shall revere the Dao and receive the sutra. You, divine kings, must swiftly descend to gather and restrain them, forbidding them to roam and spread illness, harming the myriad people. The lord of the realm and his great ministers shall all follow Our true Dao. We now decree to the demon kings: command the gathering of all ghosts in the world, that they may not disturb the households of the common folk. You must strictly obey the decree of the Most High. Henceforth, you shall not dare return to disturb the lord of the realm, his great ministers, or the myriad people. If illness or unresolved official matters persist, the heads of the ghost lords shall shatter into seven pieces. Hasten, by the decree of the statutes and ordinances!

The Most High Lord of the Dao Primordial declares: The people of the lower realm drift through their days, unaware that in the age of Great Jin, thirty thousand ghostly soldiers shall descend upon the royal realm, spreading great pestilence and crimson *qi*, and surging floods that reach the heavens. The Six Cavern Demon Kings shall traverse the world, pursuing and driving out the myriad people, their great armies slaughtering one another, and the hundred officials scattering in flight. The ghostly legions of the world shall hunger and famine, devouring the multitudes. The common folk shall flee—fathers south, sons north. Great bandits shall surge through the world, and the land shall be divided. The Five Paths shall know no peace, provinces and counties shall turn upon one another. High officials shall slay one another, lesser officials shall be displaced. The myriad people shall lose their livelihoods, and famine shall spread across the world, the living enduring disaster. In the year *guihai*, violent ghosts by the thousands and tens of thousands shall roam the world, slaying the living and disturbing the realm. They shall plunder and ravage property, and countless horses and riders shall be lost. Not only one region shall suffer, for the barbarians shall spread everywhere. Yet if even one person upholds the *Sutra of the Northern Emperor’s Samādhi Divine Incantation*, the myriad people shall all know peace, illness shall vanish at once, and all wishes shall be fulfilled. Great armies shall scatter of their own accord, ghostly bandits shall perish, and official disputes shall be resolved. The myriad people shall revere Our true words and the Dharma Masters. We shall dispatch mighty divine warriors, envoys of the Nine Heavens, the Eight Heavenly Ghost Lords, and demon kings, all to shield and protect the people of the realm. If any enter the Dao and uphold Our great Dharma, honoring the Dharma Masters of the Northern Emperor’s *Samādhi*, all evil ghosts shall flee a thousand *li* upon hearing of it. Should any disobey Our command, you ghost lords shall be of no use, and the great Dharma shall swiftly execute them. Hasten, by the decree of the statutes and ordinances!

The Most High Lord of the Dao Primordial declares: The multitudes of the lower realm shall encounter the great calamity of war, disasters of water and fire, and all manner of ghostly afflictions. We now reveal the *Thirty-Six Divine Decrees of the Northern Emperor’s Samādhi True Teachings and Wondrous Sutra*, spreading its transformation through the royal realm to instruct the multitudes, that they may know the great Dharma. Thus, the Dharma Masters of the Northern Emperor’s *Samādhi* shall descend to proclaim the teachings. Shall the emperor, great ministers, governors, and magistrates not turn toward the great Dao, that all matters may be resolved? When the Northern Emperor, the Great Sage, together with others proclaims this divine incantation, the demon kings of the heavens, the great gods, the Jade Maidens, the Brahmā Mothers, the Mysterious Maidens, the Generals of the Six *Jia*, the Envoys of the Six *Ding*, the Jade Lads of the Heavens, and the divine generals of the heavens shall all descend to bow their heads, wishing to hear this sutra’s divine arts. The Demon Kings and Heavenly Maidens say: From this day onward, if any in the Middle Kingdom suffer from grave illness or are on the verge of death, we, the demon kings and ghost lords, shall be the first to have our heads shattered into seven pieces. Hasten, by the decree of the statutes and ordinances!

The Most High Lord of the Dao Primordial declares: The multitudes of the lower realm shall face many celestial pestilences, and the great kalpa shall draw near. Floodwaters shall surge ten thousand fathoms, and the Three Disasters shall arise in competition. The Five Demon Epidemics and crimson *qi* shall converge. Great armies shall slaughter one another, and calamitous fires shall spread. Evil ghosts of the world shall wield fire to burn the lands of the people. The common folk shall flee, the myriad people shall endure hardship, and pestilence shall rage. Ghostly bandits shall grow wildly violent, disturbing the world. Great ministers shall know no peace, the multitudes shall perish, and disasters shall flow for ten thousand generations. Those who do evil shall die or be harmed, and the Three Disasters shall arise in competition. The people shall scatter and flee, ghostly legions shall drive out the people of the world. The world shall fall into great chaos, blades and weapons shall gather. Ruler and minister shall grow reckless and perish, and the king shall turn tyrannical. The myriad people shall spread pestilence, the common folk shall bring forth disaster, and a hundred kinds of illness shall slay them. Yet if the great Dharma spreads and the Middle Kingdom upholds it, the myriad households shall turn their hearts toward it. If they honor the Three Treasures, the great divine incantations, and the Dharma Masters of *Samādhi*, We Ourself, together with the great gods of the ten directions, the wondrous maidens and jade lads, the Green Dragon Generals, the warrior demons, the Heavenly *Ding* officials, the great envoys, and the Five Heavenly Messengers, shall each guard and intercept the pestilence ghosts wherever they may be.

Now We command the demon kings, all dragon spirits, and the great aquatic hosts to descend into the world. Across the Three Realms and the ten directions, they shall transform and deliver the multitude of beings. Let the lands and all people—men and women alike—receive this great scripture, that the foolish and the wise may be distinguished. Not only shall all beings, immortals inscribed in the registers, be recorded in the Jade Calendar, delivered from the great calamities of flood, water peril, the Nine Palaces, and the Eight Adversities.

From this day forth, all you beings who hear these great divine incantations and receive, uphold, and honor the great Dharma—We shall dispatch heavenly soldiers, transformed divine warriors, and hundreds of millions of celestial enforcers to follow wherever you may go. Wherever one transmits the scriptures and practices the Dao, ten thousand spirit officials from a thousand villages shall come to guard the sick, and the myriad people shall revere the great Dharma.

Hasten the decree! By the divine command of the Law.

*The Wondrous Scripture of the Divine Incantations of the Purple Tenuity of the Northern Thearch of the Supreme Ultimate of the Cavernous Truth* concludes.
