**The Supreme Daoist Scripture on Guiding and Absorbing the Three Luminaries’ Precious True Wonders**

**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture on Guiding and Absorbing the Three Luminaries’ Wonders*. Author unknown. Likely composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. Not recorded in the *Catalogue of Numinous Treasure Scriptures*. Originally one scroll. The *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era* divides it into two texts: *The Supreme Scripture on Guiding and Absorbing the Three Luminaries’ Precious True Wonders* and *The Supreme Scripture on Guiding and Absorbing the Nine Transformations of the Three Luminaries’ Wonders*, both included in the *Dongzhen* section under the category of *Original Texts*. Here, they are combined as one.

At that time, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning resided in the Vermilion Radiance Realm of the Crimson Clarity World, within the Bright Rosy Cloud Palace of the Vermilion Phoenix City, seated upon the Vermilion Qi Cinnabar Flower Hall. Together with the Great Saints of the Heavens, the Perfected and Venerable Divinities, the Five Elderly Thearchs, the Golden Watchtower’s Posterior Sages, the Three Pristine Origins of the Ultimate, the Lofty and Exalted, the Grand August of Eastern Florescence, the Golden Mother of Western Numinosity, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Thearchs, the Eighty-One Heavenly Lords, the Mystic Harmonious Numinous Consorts, the Radiant Jade Maidens, and an innumerable host, they calibrated the celestial origins, governed the great calamities, assessed the kalpas’ fortunes, and consulted the registers of the Three Origins to deliver all beings.

The Three Realms and Nine Netherworlds, the sunken and hidden kinds, myriad spirits rejoiced, all beholding the Dharma-gate. Hell was stilled, the Eight Obscurities brightened, chronic ailments dissolved, sinful records expunged. Those who glimpsed the celestial radiance all received great blessings.

In the boundless worlds of the ten directions, by the majestic power of the Dao, all arrived in an instant. Suddenly, from the farthest reaches of the eastern and western extremes, a wondrous light ascended to illuminate the firmament, entering the Dharma assembly. Its nine hues were resplendent and ethereal, dazzling and fresh, radiant and fragrant—too brilliant to gaze upon directly.

Then came the Heavenly Lords and Thearchs, Perfected and Immortals, Jade Maidens and Jade Lads, and the retinues of heavenly beings. Their necks bore circular halos, their feet trod upon lotus blossoms. They filled the two directions and arrived as one. Having entered the Dharma assembly, they paid homage to the Celestial Worthy, burned incense, scattered flowers, and made offerings in reverence.

When the ritual was complete, each returned to their respective places, sitting to the left and right in their proper ranks. Then the Perfected raised the tally, the Divine Kings wielded banners, celestial music and aerial hymns resounded in myriad forms, shaking heaven and earth with indescribable joy.

Before the assembly had fully settled, the Perfected of Universal Virtue and Wondrous Conduct arose from his seat. With composed and graceful steps, he approached the Dao. Bowing deeply, he addressed the Celestial Worthy: "In this assembly, there are two hosts from the east and west, their forms and spirits outstanding, their appearances dignified and majestic, their movements refined and poised. Their wondrous light shines brilliantly. By what method do they cultivate? From which master do they receive teachings? By what karmic conditions have they attained this rank? We humbly request your instruction, that we may hear what has not been heard before."

The Celestial Worthy replied: "Universal Virtue and Wondrous Conduct, you have attained the rank of Upper Perfected, having traversed countless kalpas. The lineages of sacred ranks, the stages of Perfected fruition, the inner and outer, the high and low, the shallow and profound practices—you have thoroughly perceived them all, with nothing left unexamined. You should also be fully aware of the cultivation of these two hosts. Your question arises because within this assembly, there are young Perfected and newly ascended Immortals whose practice is not yet extensive. Seeing these arriving hosts, they harbor silent doubts. You wish to reveal their cultivation, illuminating later learners, and thus you ask, broadly benefiting future generations by expounding this wondrous gate and establishing great Dharma merit. Such a mind of vast universality is inconceivable. Return to your seat and listen carefully; I shall now explain to you.

The transformation of the Great Dao precedes all precedence. It is neither existent nor non-existent, utterly profound and quiescent, beyond sound and form, neither form nor emptiness. Subtle and wondrous, mysterious and deep, without end or beginning, it gradually manifests its transformative work, unfolding generation and completion.

Within the primordial void’s profound stillness, the Dao’s qi first divided, faintly revealing signs of form. Clear and turbid diverged: the clear floated to become Heaven, the turbid congealed to become Earth. The two qi separated, yielding one yin and one yang. The utmost essence of yin and yang coalesced into the sun and moon. Yang culminates in nine: the sun contains nine rays. Yin culminates in ten: the moon divides into ten hues. The moon is swift and restless; the sun is leisurely and unhurried. The moon regulates completion; the sun governs generation and transformation. The two images alternate, illuminating the center, while the myriad things respond and transform below.

Moreover, the qi of the two images coalesces, the sun and moon divide their essences, scattering to become the stars, settling to become rivers and mountains. The Five Stars and Five Dipper constellations interlace in the heavens, establishing the fundamental principles and governing the hidden and manifest. No thing, great or small, escapes their influence.

Within the sun, moon, and stars, each has its palaces and halls, with rulers, ministers, and officials overseeing their duties. The ranks of Immortals and divine officials, the functionaries of sin and fortune—all are arrayed within, with nothing left unassigned. Among these officials, some are born of innate qi, some ascend through accumulated merit, some attain their ranks through cultivation and learning. Collectively, they are called the Three Luminaries, corresponding to the Dao’s transformative workings.

Each possesses natural jade scripts and the writings of the Eight Assemblies, concealed within the Three Palaces, never before transmitted to the world. Now, I shall bestow them upon you to transform and deliver the multitudes.

This is called *Guiding and Absorbing the Three Luminaries, Serving and Commanding the True Qi*. Follow the precepts, receive it through covenant, and practice according to the method. After eighteen years, your merit will be complete, and you will attain the Dao. Your qi will merge with the Dao, and your lifespan will be boundless.

The people of these two directions have long cultivated this Dao. Their merit fulfilled and virtue perfected, their forms and spirits ascend together, dwelling in the palaces of the Three Luminaries as their attendants. Their forms and appearances shine brilliantly, their radiance flourishing and abundant, distinct from the host of Immortals and Transcendents. If they accumulate merit without cease and advance through the ranks, from the lower Immortals of the Three Luminaries, they too may ascend to sacred positions, their affairs entirely identical to those who cultivate the Three Caverns.

This method existed in the boundless kalpas of antiquity, in the vast and distant past, simultaneously transforming the heavens alongside the Sacred Teachings of the Jade Clarity. The Two Observances and Three Vehicles are equal, without distinction. Do not harbor doubts about the Great Dao."

Then the command was given to the Minister of Scriptures, the Grand Scribe of Guarded Perfection, the Supervisor of Covenants and Registrar, the officials of the Mystic Upper Offices, the Four Jade Bureaus, and their subordinate officers to open the Morning Radiance Treasure Hall, present the Cinnabar-Light Jade Casket, and reveal the *Upper Chapters of the Three Luminaries*, the *Jade Scripts of the Eight Heavens*, the *Nine Transformations and Eight Assemblies*, and the *Profound and Wondrous Cavern Chapters*. Following the *Bright Statutes of the Four Poles*, these were conferred upon the Wondrous Conduct of Universal Virtue.

All the heavens in their stations, the ten thousand sages in arrayed ritual, the Four Offices of the Three Realms—all gazed upon the spectacle. Thereupon, Wondrous Conduct of Universal Virtue faced north, knelt in prostration, and received the scriptures with reverence. The myriad spirits of heaven and earth cried out in unison, "Excellent!"

Then, with white jade as tablets and yellow gold for engraving, the scriptures were enshrined in the Terrace of Luminous Splendor and the Pavilion of Jeweled Radiance. Within four hundred years, they were to be transmitted to but three persons.

When the transmission was complete, the Heavenly Worthy addressed them, saying: "The multitudes from the Two Directions, the immortals of the sun and moon, those who guide and govern the Three Luminaries—having realized the perfection of their true rank, their spirits and forms shine with clarity, illuminating the assembly. What you have witnessed is most wondrous, yet among the manifestations of all true immortals across the ten directions, their luminous appearances are not uniquely extraordinary. Do not harbor doubt or waver, lest you forfeit your good merit."

In an instant, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy appeared, along with the great assemblies of humans and gods. Each emanated a subtle and wondrous light, illuminating the vast heavens, merging heaven and earth into one. Myriad forms and colors transformed endlessly, like a mountain of seven treasures shining with the brilliance of a hundred thousand suns, indistinguishable from the sun, moon, and stars.

The Heavenly Worthy then spoke to Wondrous Conduct of Universal Virtue: "The profound power of the Great Dao gives birth to and transforms the ten thousand things. According to their forms and endowments, each receives it to varying depths. The Dao bestows its teachings in response to karmic conditions, delivering all beings. Yet as beings cultivate in accordance with their capacities, distinctions arise. Though the ten thousand transformations differ, they return to the One Dao. The Dao is fundamentally without duality, returning to the One Origin. When one accords with the Dao, even this 'One' is forgotten. Unbound by self or other, unattached to being or non-being, abiding in stillness and subtlety, beyond words and thoughts—though kalpas may end, this Dao remains eternally. To dwell in the wondrous gate is called 'attaining the Dao.'"

With these words spoken, the Heavenly Worthy commanded the celestial chariot and returned to the Great Mystery. The assembled divine immortals, perfected transcendents, and all within and beyond the Three Realms—those who had fathomed the true essence—bowed to the vast emptiness and withdrew in reverence.

Thus concludes the *Supreme Scripture of the Three Luminaries, Revealed by the Most High*.
