At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy was upon Jade Capital Mountain in the Great Brahma Heaven, expounding this *True Scripture on Ascending to Heaven and Attaining the Dao* to the assembled immortals and celestial beings. He addressed the immortals, saying: "I shall now briefly reveal to you the essentials of body and mind, and clearly proclaim the fundamentals of the Dao.

All the perfected immortals of the ten directions who have attained the Dao have penetrated its subtleties through the cultivation of this scripture. Good men and good women, relying upon purification rites and taking this as a bridge, may manifest the true path amid all conditioned phenomena. By embodying these dharmic signs, they may receive and uphold it.

Able to sever all karmic entanglements, forever eliminating defilements, with no external thoughts entering and no internal thoughts departing, within right mindfulness, they shall attain cool purity in the five viscera and harmonious balance in the six bowels. Between the three hundred and sixty joints, where obstructions and hindrances reside, the karmic roots of the ten evils, the hundred and eighty afflictions, and the sources of all suffering and transgressions shall be entirely eradicated.

Thereupon, the true qi of Great Harmony shall infuse and moisten the field of the body. The five viscera and six bowels, observed inwardly through the mind’s eye, shall be pervaded by the true qi—pure, luminous, and radiant with empty brightness. In profound obscurity, with no affairs within or without, in tranquil silence, one directly attains non-action. Abiding eternally from ancient times to the present, upholding pure mindfulness, one awakens from this. The power of the Dao aids and sustains, while dharmic medicine assists.

Further, regulate your diet, expel the corpse-demons, pacify the six senses, and purify the eight consciousnesses. Empty the five aggregates, realize the wondrous Three Origins, attain the Dao, and become a perfected one, naturally ascending and transcending."

At that time, the assembled immortals and celestial beings addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "From beginningless time until today, we have never heard such a Mahāyāna scripture. Through this fortunate encounter, may all beings widely attain the full illumination of the Dao’s fruition." And they spoke these verses:

In profound obscurity, the pure Dao,
In tranquil silence, the traces of the Great Void.
The essence-nature, serene and unattached,
Form and mind utterly quiescent—one true source.

**Here ends *The Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s Scripture on Ascending to Heaven and Attaining the Dao*.**
