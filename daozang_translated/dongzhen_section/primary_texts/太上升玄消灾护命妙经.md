### *The Supreme Ascent to the Mysterious Wondrous Scripture for Eliminating Disasters and Protecting Life*

At that time, the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy dwelled within the Seven Jeweled Grove, in the Palace of Fivefold Luminosity, together with the assembly of boundless sagely hosts. Radiating boundless light, he illumined the boundless worlds, observing the boundless sentient beings suffering boundless afflictions—
tossed and turned in the mundane realm, revolving through birth and death, adrift in the river of craving, swept along in the sea of desire, sunk in the mire of sound and form, deluded by existence and non-existence;
neither void nor void, neither form nor form, neither non-being nor non-being, neither being nor being—ever shrouded in darkness, unable to awaken, utterly lost in confusion.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: "You sentient beings arise from non-being into being, from non-non-being into non-being, from non-form into form, from non-void into void.
Not-being is not being, yet not-non-being is not non-being; not-form is not form, yet not-void is not void.
Void is void, yet void is not fixed as void; form is form, yet form is not fixed as form.
Form is void, and void is form.
If one can know void as not-void and form as not-form, this is called ‘illuminating clarity,’ the first attainment of the wondrous resonance.
Recognizing the Dharma of non-void, one perceives without obstruction, enters the gates of manifold wonders, and naturally awakens—free from the net of doubts, unattached to the view of void, purifying the six senses, and severing all perverse hindrances.
I shall now proclaim for you this wondrous scripture, named *The Scripture for Protecting Life*, to deliver and ferry all beings. Carry it upon your person, venerate it, transmit it through the world, and circulate it through recitation.
Then will the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, the Demolishing Mara Vajras, the Dharma-Protecting Spirit Youths, the Salvation-from-Suffering Perfected Ones, and the Golden Essence Fierce Beasts—each in hundreds of millions of myriads—all come to attend and guard this scripture. Wherever it is venerated, they will ward off calamities, support the frail, and deliver all beings from defilements and attachments."

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy spoke this verse:
*"Seen yet not seen by sight,
Heard yet not heard by sound.
Beyond all extremes,
This is called the wondrous Dao."*

Here ends *The Supreme Ascent to the Mysterious Wondrous Scripture for Eliminating Disasters and Protecting Life*.
