**Volume One:**
The Dao spoke: Long ago, in the Azure Heavens of the Beginning, within the Great Floating Li Land of the Azure Vault’s Empty Song, the Primordial Beginning bestowed the *Infinite Salvation of the Upper Chapters’ Marvelous Scripture*.

When the Primordial Heavenly Worthy was to expound this scripture, he circumambulated ten times to summon the ten directions. Only then did he ascend his seat. Celestial perfected spirits, exalted sages, and transcendents of wondrous conduct—innumerable multitudes—rode the void to arrive, soaring upon cinnabar clouds. Their chariots were of jade-green, their wheels of luminous jasper, their feathered canopies casting shade. Streaming essences and radiant jade light, in five resplendent hues, suffused the Great Void, blazing for seven days and seven nights. The sun, moon, and stellar lodges of the heavens, the jade celestial pivots, all halted their revolutions. Divine winds stilled, mountains and seas concealed their clouds. The heavens were free of drifting veils; the four qi shone bright and clear. Throughout the land, mountains, rivers, forests, and groves leveled as one, no longer high or low. The earth transformed into azure jade, uniform in hue.

The assembled perfected ones took their places beside the seat. The Primordial Heavenly Worthy suspended himself upon a five-colored lion in the floating void. After reciting the scripture once, the celestial sages and great spirits all proclaimed its excellence.

At that time, the deaf and ailing of the land regained their hearing. After the second recitation, the blind received sight. After the third, the mute could speak. After the fourth, the lame and those long bedridden rose and walked. After the fifth, chronic and incurable illnesses were restored to wholeness. After the sixth, white hair turned black again, and fallen teeth regrew. After the seventh, the aged reverted to youth, and the young grew strong. After the eighth, pregnant women and creatures with child—whether born or unborn—all came to perfect birth. After the ninth, the earth’s treasuries opened, revealing gold and jade. After the tenth, withered bones revived, rising as whole persons.

At that time, every man and woman of the land turned their hearts in devotion. All received protection and salvation, attaining eternal life.

The Dao spoke: When the Primordial Heavenly Worthy recited the scripture once, the boundless and infinite perfected great spirits of the eastern direction, with their innumerable multitudes, arrived upon the void. After the second recitation, those of the southern direction came. After the third, those of the west. After the fourth, those of the north. After the fifth, those of the northeast. After the sixth, those of the southeast. After the seventh, those of the southwest. After the eighth, those of the northwest. After the ninth, those of the upper direction. After the tenth, those of the lower direction.

When the ten recitations were complete, the boundless celestial perfected great spirits of the ten directions arrived as one. The men and women of the land turned their hearts in reverence. The arrivals were like fine rain or dense mist—innumerable multitudes—filling half the land, causing the earth to sink unevenly, beyond restraint.

Thereupon, the Primordial suspended a single precious pearl, as small as a millet grain, in the dark void five *zhang* above the earth. The Primordial led the celestial perfected spirits, exalted sages, transcendents of wondrous conduct, and the boundless perfected great spirits of the ten directions—innumerable multitudes—all to enter the pearl. The heavenly beings gazed upward, seeing only a surging movement as they entered the pearl’s mouth. Once inside, their whereabouts were unknown. The people dispersed, and the earth returned to levelness, no longer uneven.

Within the pearl, the Primordial completed the scripture’s recitation. The assembled perfected ones oversaw the salvation, transmitting it to me. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words. When the ritual was roughly concluded, the celestial beings returned to their stations. In an instant, all was silent, without lingering resonance.

At that time, the heavenly beings who encountered the scripture’s teachings were universally saved, preserving their allotted years without harm. The entire land turned in reverence, all cultivating virtuous hearts. They did not kill or harm, did not envy or covet, did not indulge in lust or theft, did not greed or desire, did not hate or resent. Their words were free of embellishment, their mouths free of harsh speech. Equal in compassion, they regarded even strangers as kin. The land was at peace, the people prosperous, rejoicing in great harmony. From the scripture’s first promulgation, the land followed the Dao. Those with prior devotion who revered and honored it all attained liberation from the world.

The Dao spoke: The words uttered by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy in reciting the scripture are the hidden names and secret rhymes of the celestial emperors, as well as the inner taboos of demon kings and the concealed names of the hundred spirits. They are not the common speech of the mundane world. Only those who have attained the rank of perfected transcendents, who penetrate the mysteries and fathom the subtle, can fully grasp its verses. Reciting it ten times, the celestial beings chant from afar, the ten thousand emperors offer rites, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks conceal their clouds, the sun and moon halt their radiance, the celestial pivots cease their turning. Demon hordes bind their forms, ghostly spirits vanish, corpses revive, and white bones become living persons.

For scholars of the highest learning, reciting it ten times will summon the Five Emperors to stand guard, the Three Realms to bow in reverence, demonic essences to lose their sight, and ghostly malevolence to vanish utterly. Those on the verge of death shall be delivered and, though cut off from life, be restored to it. The reason for this is that scholars, though their impure qi has not yet dissipated and their bodies have not fully attained the True, may still summon and command the ten directions, their majesty not yet sufficient to govern the heavens. Their virtue can only subdue and bind the earthly deities, restrain demonic spirits, and reverse death—but not restore life. To recite these verses lightly brings misfortune upon oneself. Yet those who honor and revere them with offerings and rites shall see their households flourish, their generations prosper, and their good karmic connections endure. Ten thousand calamities shall not touch them, and divine beings shall guard their gates.

This scripture is most venerable and wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital. It delivers countless beings, serving as the root of all Dao. Vast and majestic is its Brahmanic power—its virtue beyond measure.

The Dao speaks: When one recites this scripture ten times, all the heavens assemble. The suffering souls of ancestors across myriad generations shall immediately receive deliverance, ascending to the Crimson Palace. After nine years of refinement, they shall be transformed and reborn, becoming noble persons. Those who diligently study this scripture, their merit complete and virtue perfected, shall attain immortality, soaring to the Golden Gates and roaming the Jade Capital. Scholars of the highest learning who cultivate and recite this scripture shall all be delivered, ascending to the Southern Palace. Those in the world who recite it shall extend their years and lengthen their lives, later attaining the Dao of liberation through simulated death. Their souls shall briefly dissolve, sparing them the trials of hell, and they shall swiftly regain form, roaming the vastness of the heavens.

This scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally delivering boundless beings. All heavenly and mortal beings receive its blessings, its immeasurable fortune bestowed upon the living and the dead. It is treasured by the heavens above and not transmitted to the lower world. Only the most devoted scholars, offering gold and treasures with sincere hearts and swearing oaths to heaven, may receive it. To leak or slight it carelessly brings calamity upon nine generations, condemning them to eternal servitude under the ghostly officials.

The Five Emperors attend this scripture, accompanied by twenty-four Jade Lads and twenty-four Jade Maidens, who safeguard its divine writ and protect the bodies of its reciters.

The Dao speaks: During the long fast of the first month, recite this scripture to sever the earthly bonds of past generations and deliver their souls to the Southern Palace. During the long fast of the seventh month, recite this scripture to attain immortality, your name inscribed in the heavens on yellow registers and white tablets, death erased and life restored. During the long fast of the tenth month, recite this scripture for the sake of kings and emperors, rulers and ministers, fathers and sons, to stabilize the nation’s destiny, preserve the heavens’ longevity, and ensure unbroken generations of sovereigns who shall govern their realms in peace, their people calling it the Great Peace. On the eight seasonal festivals, recite this scripture to become a Perfected One of the Nine Palaces. On one’s natal day, recite this scripture to purify the soul, preserve eternal qi, avoid suffering, and radiate light. The Three Realms shall attend, the Five Emperors shall receive, and myriad spirits shall pay homage. Your name shall be recorded in the heavens, and upon merit’s completion and virtue’s fulfillment, you shall ascend to the Upper Clarity.

The Dao speaks: On the day of ritual practice, one must bathe in fragrant waters, enter the chamber in purification, face east, and knock the teeth thirty-two times to reach the thirty-two heavens. Bow thirty-two times in reverence, close the eyes, and silently visualize oneself seated amidst clouds of blue, yellow, and white qi, enveloped in mist. A Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Lion, and White Crane shall array themselves to left and right, the sun and moon illuminating the chamber with radiance. A circular halo shall appear above the head, its light suffusing the ten directions—all must be vividly perceived.

Recite the secret incantation:
*"Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Dao Lord, summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Attendant Envoys of the Left and Right, the Jade Lads who tend incense, the Jade Maidens who transmit words, the Direct Talismans of the Five Emperors, and the thirty-two Incense Officials of the Day. Open the gates of my petition on this auspicious day of long fast and pure chamber, as I cultivate the scripture of boundless deliverance. May my words ascend swiftly to the presence of the Most High Primordial Sovereign of the Thirty-Two Heavens."*

Afterward, draw qi thirty-two times and recite the scripture facing east.

**The Primordial Limitless Deliverance, Supreme Wondrous Scripture**

The Primordial Cavernous Mystery, Numinous Treasure’s Fundamental Chapter—supreme and wondrous beginning. Ten recitations deliver beings, a hundred demons conceal their rhymes. Separation and union arise naturally, the Crimson Writ of the Chaotic Abyss. The Non-Ultimate’s Supreme Perfected, the Primordial Ancestor of Kalpas, who transforms and gives birth to all heavens, illumines the Three Luminaries—this is the root of heaven. Above, there is no further ancestor; only the Dao is the body. The Five Writs unfold and expand, universally planting divine spirits. No writ is unilluminated, no writ is unbright, no writ is unestablished, no writ is unaccomplished, no writ is undelivered, no writ is unborn. This is the Great Brahman Heaven within Heaven, the Towering Canopy of Yu Luo, the Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital, supreme beyond all, the Great Net of the Jade Clarity. Vast and boundless, as if absent, as if present, the Three Flowers separate and converge, the Great Existence’s Wondrous Court, Golden Gates and Jade Chambers, a forest of purity and clarity. The great Brahmanic qi circulates through the ten directions. Within it dwells the immortal-delivering spirit, the Southern Culmen’s Lord of Longevity, the Deliverer of the World’s Marshal Great Spirit, the Life-Loving Elder Han, the Southern Supreme’s Directors of Destiny and Records, the Venerable Spirits who extend life, increase years, and deliver from calamity. They reverse decay and revive the dead, delivering boundless beings. Today, the celestial records are examined, and all the heavens descend in audience.

The Limitless Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings of the East, Great Sages of Longevity, deliver boundless beings.

Together they ride upon crimson chariots and emerald carriages, their feathered canopies and jade wheels drawn by vermilion phoenixes and five-colored dark dragons. They raise nine-hued standards and ten sacred banners; before them, nine phoenixes cry in unison, while behind, eight simurghs sing in harmony. Lions and white cranes chant melodiously; the Five Elders lead the way as hosts of immortals flank their procession. Myriad chariots and ten thousand riders float through the void to arrive.

Their radiant light turns back their steeds as they oversee the deliverance of the true and the salvation of the living. The celestial chancellors of the Southern Palace, Han the Recorder of Lives, holding registers and ledgers, all assemble before the Emperor. According to those who ought to be delivered, they strictly examine the heavens and universally proclaim to the Three Realms, the boundless divine realms, the Yellow Springs, the Northern Capital of Fengdu, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, and the Twelve River Sources.

They absolve the sins of ancestors and kin across countless kalpas, swiftly erasing transgression records and severing evil roots, preventing confinement among ghostly throngs. By the Mandate of the Primordial Beginning, they ascend at the appointed hour: from the Northern Capital’s icy pools, they guard and escort souls, restrain demons, and ensure protection. Those delivered ascend to the Southern Palace, where the dead undergo refinement and transform into immortals, while the living receive deliverance, enduring through kalpas, turning with the ages, and attaining lifespans equal to heaven.

They forever deliver beings from the Three Ways, Five Sufferings, and Eight Difficulties, transcending the Three Realms to roam freely in the Upper Clarity. Within the Upper Clarity’s heavens, the Heavenly Emperor and Jade Perfected dwell in the formless realm of pure conduct.

Thirty-two heavens, thirty-two emperors. The heavens conceal their secrets; the heavens veil their names. Within the heavens lies the empty cavern, the spontaneous numinous scripture. The heavens conceal their rhythms, the sounds within the heavens. The heavens’ revered ones, the heavens’ spirits, the great demons of the heavens, the numinous ones of the heavens. Nine harmonies and ten unions transform into the Upper Clarity. The boundless mysteries are profound and unfathomable.

The divine perfected scatter and descend, universally delivering heaven and humanity. Today, rejoicing in receiving deliverance, they pass through the barriers of all heavens, beseeching the eradication of the Three Evils and the severance of earthly roots. They ascend through the Five Gates, their names recorded in the Supreme Mystery. The Demon Kings oversee and ensure no hindrance at the celestial gates.

The Eastern Dipper governs fate, the Western Dipper records names, the Northern Dipper severs death, the Southern Dipper bestows life, and the Central Dipper, the Great Chief, oversees all spirits. The Azure Emperor guards the soul, the White Emperor attends the po, the Vermilion Emperor nurtures qi, the Black Emperor circulates blood, and the Yellow Emperor presides at the center—none among the myriad spirits transgress.

The Azure Heaven Demon King, Bayuan Choubo.
The Vermilion Heaven Demon King, Futian Danshi.
The White Heaven Demon King, Fanshan Liumu.
The Black Heaven Demon King, Jianshou Langfu.
The Yellow Heaven Demon King, Hengtian Danli.

The Five Emperors and Great Demons, lords of all spirits, fly with drumming retinues, commanding ghostly legions. Wielding banners and drums, they roam the vast heavens, proclaiming their majesty as all heavens acknowledge their merit.

The heavens deliver humanity, strictly governing Fengdu. The divine lords receive their mandate, universally sweeping away misfortune. The Eight Mighties spew venom, fierce horses bare their fangs. Heavenly soldiers lead the vanguard, great marshals brandish banners. Fire is hurled for ten thousand leagues, and flowing bells resound in eight directions. Should any dare to challenge or obstruct the perfected, golden axes strike first, and the Queen Mother of the West metes out punishment. Ghosts are butchered and severed, wind and fire unceasing. Thousands upon thousands are beheaded, myriads upon myriads are dismembered. Demons dare not transgress; ghosts dare not harbor malevolence.

The Three Offices and Fengdu meticulously inspect ghostly camps, permitting no concealment. The Golden Horse post ensures swift transmission. Universally proclaimed, boundless and eternal. All spirits heed: the Five Emperors of the Three Realms declare to the Upper Clarity.

The Jade Calendar of the Primordial Cavern spans the Dragon Han and Yan Kang eras. In the distant kalpas, within the primordial chaos, above there was no longer color, below there was no longer abyss. Wind and marsh pervaded the void; the Diamond rode the heavens.

Heaven above and heaven below, no darkness nor obscurity.
No form nor shadow, no limit nor end.
The vast Brahmā of primordial chaos, boundless and lightless.
The Crimson Clarity unfurls its chart, the cycles turn naturally.
The Primordial Beginning settles in stillness, unfolding the Five Scriptures.
Crimson writings on jade, eight mighty dragon scripts.
They govern the kalpas’ passage, ensuring heaven’s eternal endurance.
Brahmā-qi suffuses the cosmos, myriad patterns unfold.
The primordial net flows and evolves, the thirty-two heavens.
Wheeling without color, circling the ten directions.
The Dipper revolves through the southern asterism *Ji*,
returning through the five constants.
Thirty-five divisions gather the qi of the Upper Primordial.
Eight luminous scenes merge in darkness, qi enters the profound profound.
Within the profound, the Great August One, the Highest Perfected.
Floating upon the radiance of supreme auroras, chanting the cavernous hymns.
Golden perfection shines resplendent, its echoes streaming through cloudy encampments.
Jade tones gather qi, numinous winds amass mist.
Purple emptiness flourishes in elegance, aiding and sheltering the myriad immortals.
A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—naturally they attain perfection.
Within perfection dwells the spirit, the Great Lord of Longevity.
The Lord of Non-Excellence, the Venerable White Prime.
The Great One who Oversees Destiny, Peach and Health unite in extension.
Grasping talismans and holding registers, they safeguard life and root existence.
Ascending to the Upper Clarity, entering and exiting the Flowery Chambers,
within the eightfold darkness, within the minutest subtleties.
Below, they govern the human body, the Mud-Pill Palace and the Crimson Palace.
Within, they order the five qi, blending the hundred spirits.
Ten revolutions return the numinous, ten thousand qi purify the immortal.
The immortal Dao values life, endlessly delivering beings.
Above, the eight gates open, the flying celestial wheel.
Karmic retribution and prohibitions, past-life causes and conditions.
Universally received and delivered, the dead soul revives in a new body.
The body attains rebirth, ascending to be heard by the various heavens.
Above the various heavens, each has its gate of life.
Within lies the empty cavern, the hymns of chant and song.
The demon kings’ numinous scriptures, their verses matching the Highest Perfected.

**First Desire Realm: The Flying Void’s Melody**
The human path stretches distant, the immortal path vast and boundless.
The ghostly path delights—yet when one stands at the gate of human life,
the immortal Dao values life, the ghostly path values its end.
The immortal Dao is ever auspicious, the ghostly path ever inauspicious.
The lofty Upper Clarity’s numinous essence, its mournful song resounds through the great void.
I only wish for the immortal Dao to succeed, not for the human path to be exhausted.
The Northern Capital’s Yellow Springs and Crooked Mansion,
within dwell the myriad ghostly hosts.
They only seek to cut short human destiny, to sever the gate of human life.
Ah, chant the cavernous hymns to restrain the Northern Fengdu.
Bind and dispatch the malevolent demonic essences,
beheading and vanquishing the six ghostly blades.
The qi of the various heavens surges boundless,
my Dao daily flourishes and rises.

**Second Form Realm: The Demon King’s Hymn**
Lofty and vast, the luminous qi soars in all four directions.
The Brahmā-conduct heavens encircle the ten directions.
The boundless great spirits all arise from my body.
I possess the cavernous hymns—ten thousand times they perfect immortals.
The immortal Dao values deliverance, the ghostly path clings close.
Heaven and earth stretch vast and desolate, foul qi swirls thickly.
The three realms delight—passing through them, one abides forever.
Crossing into my realm, the body enters the natural.
At this time, delight arises—yet it is by my grace.
The Dragon Han era surges boundless—how can one distinguish the true?
My realm is difficult to cross, thus I compose the cavernous scriptures.
Transforming and flying through the void, to test your body.
Success or failure, slackening or retreat—how many achieve deliverance?
I laugh at those who do not cross, thus I sing this melody.

**Third Formless Realm: The Demon King’s Song**
Above the three realms, the distant and vast Great Luo.
No root of color above, cloudy layers towering.
Only the Primordial Beginning dwells in the kalpa’s vastness.
It commands and orders my realm, governing from the Mysterious Capital.
Those who transgress my realm enter the Jade Void.
I reign as the supreme king, rectifying and ruling the myriad demons.
Within the void, ten thousand transformations—foul qi blooms in profusion.
Few preserve the true, many are deluded and confused.
The immortal Dao is difficult to secure, the ghostly path easily led astray.
The human path lies in the heart—truly, it does not depend on others.
The immortal Dao values substance, the human path values splendor.
If you do not delight in the immortal Dao, how can you pass through the three realms?
Should you desire to traverse the five paths, what then can I do for you?

Above the three realms, within the flying void,
the demon kings’ melodies, their tones matching the cavernous hymns.
Recite them a hundred times, and your name is delivered to the Southern Palace.
Recite them a thousand times, and the demon kings will protect and welcome you.
Ten thousand recitations perfect the Dao, ascending to the great void.
Passing through the three realms, your rank attains that of an immortal lord.
Those who hear the numinous melodies—the demon kings respectfully manifest and restrain,
earth spirits attend and escort, delivering you from the earthly prisons,
the five sufferings and eight difficulties. Seven generations of ancestors ascend,
forever departing the ghostly bureaus.
The soul crosses the Vermilion Mound, undergoes refinement, and is reborn.
This is called the boundless, the universal deliverance without end.

There exists a secret celestial scripture, revered by all heavens.
Those who recklessly divulge it fall into hell, their calamity extending to seven generations of ancestors.

The Dao declares: These two hymns are the hidden melodies of the various heavenly emperors
and the numinous demon kings, all words of the great Brahmā.
They are not the common speech of the world, their language lacks ornate beauty,
their tunes lack florid elegance—thus they are called profound and obscure,
difficult to fathom in detail.
The heavens treasure them, secreting them in the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace of the Mysterious Capital.
According to the mysterious statutes, they are transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas.
If a perfected person offers gold and treasures with a sincere heart,
following the old protocols and pledging allegiance to the ten heavens,
only then are they bestowed.

The Dao declares: The cycles of heaven and earth also have their ends.
The sun, moon, and five planets also wax and wane.
Even the most sagely and divine persons have their periods of rest and decline.
Those of shallow learning also suffer illness and harm.

Whenever such calamities afflict those of shared qi, all must unite in heart to perform purification rites, burn incense through the six periods, and recite the sutras ten times over—then blessings and virtue will descend at once, dispelling all inauspicious omens. These boundless scriptures universally deliver limitless beings.

The Dao declares: Those of shallow learning in the Way, whose immortal rank remains unfulfilled, when their destined time of passing arrives and their bodies enter the Great Yin, at the moment of transition, their fellow students and perfected persons shall burn incense and recite the sutras ten times to deliver the corporeal form according to the proper method. Thus the hun-soul will ascend directly to the Southern Palace, and in accordance with their accumulated merit, they shall be reborn after a calculated span of days, escaping the wheel of rebirth to attain immortality.

The Dao declares: When the cycles of heaven and earth reach their end, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the sutras. When the stellar lodges fall into disarray and the sun and moon lose their proper course, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the sutras. When the four seasons lose their order and yin and yang fall out of harmony, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the sutras. When the sovereign faces calamity and warfare erupts on all sides, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the sutras. When pestilence spreads and the multitudes perish, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the sutras. When masters or companions pass from this life, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the sutras.

The merit of purification rites and sutra recitation is profoundly weighty: above, it dissolves heavenly disasters and safeguards the emperor; below, it wards off poison and harm, delivering the multitudes. In life and death, all depend upon it—its blessings are immeasurable, universally delivering gods and humans.

The Dao declares: Whoever possesses these scriptures and performs such meritorious deeds for heaven and earth, the sovereign, and the multitudes—on the day of calamity, if they resolve in heart to perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the sutras ten times—all the heavens will record their names, and the ten thousand spirits will attend and guard them. Those who distinguish themselves as perfected persons shall become ministers of the Golden Gates of the Sage Lord. The heavens record the merits and transgressions of each person without the slightest error. Even the demon kings of heaven shall protect and recommend them. Only those who attain the Dao shall fully comprehend these most profound words.

The Dao speaks: These are the boundless hidden speeches of the Great Brahma in the heavens, their ancient characters each a full *zhang* in length. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign of Old inscribed their script to establish the correct sounds. Those who know these sounds and can purify themselves to recite them shall have all the heavens dispatch Flying Celestial Divine Kings to descend and observe their persons, record their meritorious diligence, and report it to the heavens above. The myriad spirits shall pay homage; the earthly deities shall attend at their gates. The great merit demon kings shall protect and recommend them as Transcendent Ones. When the Dao is complete and attained, they may wander the Three Realms and ascend through the Golden Gates. These sounds repel all, exorcise all, deliver all, and accomplish all—such are the natural sounds of the Heavenly Perfected. Thus, reciting them summons the Flying Celestials to descend and observe; the Supreme Lord chants from afar; the myriad spirits pay homage; the Three Realms attend at their chariots; the demonic hordes bow their heads; ghostly essences perish of themselves. The jade chimes resound; the ten directions grow solemn and clear. Rivers and seas fall silent; mountains and peaks swallow their mists. The myriad numina tremble and submit; the assembled Transcendents are summoned. Heaven is free of foul vapors; earth is free of demonic dust. Profound wisdom illumines the hidden; the vast measure is profoundly mysterious.

*Thus concludes the first scroll of the* Wondrous Scripture of the Uppermost Grade on the Limitless Salvation of Humanity *of the Numinous Treasure.*

*The Wondrous Scripture of the Uppermost Grade on the Limitless Salvation of Humanity*
*Scroll the Second: The Jade Palace’s Great Dao*

The Dao speaks: Long ago, in the Azure Heavens of Primordial Beginning, within the Great Floating Li Land, the Limitless Uppermost Grade for the Salvation of Humanity was received. When the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning first descended to the Pure Subtlety Realm, he manifested a pearl of numinous瑞, gathering the boundless host—heavenly perfected, great spirits, exalted sages, and wondrously accomplished perfected beings—all entered within the pearl. With the Limitless Salvation’s Uppermost Grade of the Numinous Treasure’s scriptural Dharma, the assembled perfected oversaw the transmission, bestowing it upon me. At that time, joy and celebration were beyond words; the Dharma rites were roughly complete, and the myriad heavens returned to their stations.

Then, at the inception of the Five Kaihuang Kalpas, when the dark dragon ascended through the Celestial Pass, he descended again to the Vermilion Radiance of the Great Cinnabar Heavens. In the congealed luminance of the Cavernous Yang, within the Jade Mystery’s Crimson Realm, he salvaged ten thousand myriads of beings, entrusting the Great Dao of the Jade Palace to me.

When the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning expounded this scripture, he circumambulated ten times, summoning the ten directions, and only then took his seat. Heavenly perfected, great spirits, exalted sages, wondrously accomplished perfected beings, the Great Dao of the Jade Palace, the Primordial Masters and Immortal Lords, the Supreme Pole’s Imperial Perfected, the Nine Radiant Spirits of Flying Blossoms, the Heavenly Emperor of Yu Yu, the Purple Radiance Venerable, and the boundless host arrived borne upon the void. Jade emptiness streamed with mist; the Three Luminances blazed with color. Azure wheels and jeweled chariots, feathered carriages and crimson canopies, divine brocades and phoenix silks, dark clarity shading the armrests, cavernous voids merging in revolution, divine crystals interluminating—nine qi wafted with auroras, three chambers revolved in splendor. Heaven’s expanse stilled; the azure vault congealed in perfection. Whirlwinds dispersed radiance; returning winds blended in harmony. The Imperial Unity oversaw life; the Round Net infused qi. The Eight Gates stirred in flight; the sun-pearl held brilliance, the moon-disc shed waves. Numinous nets thickened with haze, pervading and transforming the realm entire.

The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, seated in mystery upon the floating Jade Scriptural Terrace, expounded the scripture once. The Jade Dawn’s Great Sage simultaneously acclaimed its excellence. At that time, the men and women of the land heard it throughout the ten directions, without hindrance or obstruction.

When the scripture was expounded a second time, all gazed upon the boundless, penetrating and perceiving all.

When expounded a third time, the voice was pure and wondrous, transforming and salvaging those who came.

When expounded a fourth time, one spirit responded to ten thousand, and ten thousand spirits merged in perfection.

When expounded a fifth time, the myriad beings of the Three Realms, upon recalling, arrived instantly, their spirit-travel leaving no trace.

When expounded a sixth time, he pointed and pressed the Two Modes, traversing all in an instant.

When expounded a seventh time, birth and extinction were forever severed, and eternal existence endured through kalpas uncounted.

When expounded an eighth time, the Dao’s sea manifested auspicious signs, and the Mystery Mountain emitted瑞.

When expounded a ninth time, form was refined into qi, and qi refined into spirit.

When expounded a tenth time, spontaneity attained perfection; the Jade Palace realized the Dao. The ten directions and Three Realms all achieved transcendence. At that time, the men and women of the land, without exception, harmonized in mind, without distinction of self or other, all attaining eternal life.

The Dao speaks: At that time, when the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning expounded the scripture once, the Great Dao of the Jade Palace’s spontaneous great spirits of the eastern direction, with their boundless host, arrived borne upon the void.

When expounded a second time, the Great Dao of the Jade Palace’s spontaneous great spirits of the southern direction, with their boundless host, arrived borne upon the void.

When expounded a third time, the Great Dao of the Jade Palace’s spontaneous great spirits of the western direction, with their boundless host, arrived borne upon the void.

When expounded a fourth time, the Great Dao of the Jade Palace’s spontaneous great spirits of the northern direction, with their boundless host, arrived borne upon the void.

When expounded a fifth time, the Great Dao of the Jade Palace’s spontaneous great spirits of the northeastern direction, with their boundless host, arrived borne upon the void.

When expounded a sixth time, the Great Dao of the Jade Palace’s spontaneous great spirits of the southeastern direction, with their boundless host, arrived borne upon the void.

When expounded a seventh time, the Great Dao of the Jade Palace’s spontaneous great spirits of the southwestern direction, with their boundless host, arrived borne upon the void.

When expounded an eighth time, the Great Dao of the Jade Palace’s spontaneous great spirits of the northwestern direction, with their boundless host, arrived borne upon the void.

When expounded a ninth time, the Great Dao of the Jade Palace’s spontaneous great spirits of the upper direction, with their boundless host, arrived borne upon the void.

When expounded a tenth time, the Great Dao of the Jade Palace’s spontaneous great spirits of the lower direction, with their boundless host, arrived borne upon the void.

When the ten circumambulations were complete, the spontaneous great spirits of the boundless heavens of the ten directions arrived as one. The men and women of the land harmonized in mind, revering as one. Those who came were like layered clouds and accumulated mists, beyond reckoning, pervading the land entire, filling the fourfold void, unstoppable.

Thereupon, the Primordial Beginning gathered his fingers and emitted flying light, minute as a radiant star, gleaming with nine hues. It stood erect in the mysterious void, illuminating above and below, ten ren from the earth, penetrating inner and outer. These ten directional realms became like lapis lazuli, blended in a single hue.

The Primordial Beginning settled into his seat; his radiant light pervaded all. Gazing upon this land, it was like an image in a mirror. The garments of heaven’s people, the forms of men and women, every thread and hair were revealed in clarity. In the great void, not the slightest obstruction remained.

The Great Dao of the Jade Palace’s spontaneous great spirits, with the assembled exalted sages, boundless high perfected, wondrously accomplished perfected beings, and the great spirits of the ten directions’ transformative qi and Dao-grade, all entered within a single light. Their Dharma-bodies, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousandfold, dense as layered valleys, reflected and returned the light, their forms and images mutually mirrored. Bright and transparent, distinct yet unconfused.

The heaven’s people of that land who came to bear witness looked upward: the divine light raced like wind, coiled like clouds. The ten thousand sages were all within the great void, perceiving the wondrous stillness devoid of form.

Then, within the Dao’s light, the Primordial Beginning expounded the Jade Palace’s Great Dao for the salvation of humanity. When the circumambulation was complete, the assembled perfected oversaw the transmission, bestowing it upon me. At that time, joy and celebration were beyond words. When the Dharma rites were complete, the myriad heavens returned to their stations. In an instant, all was silent, without lingering resonance.

At that time, the heaven’s people encountered the great model, universally achieving transcendence and eternal life. Spirit congealed, qi focused, harmonized yet undivided. The land turned in reverence, taking the Dao as their heart. Without thought, without action, without cogitation, without scheming, without awareness, without knowledge, without extinction, without birth, without arising, without abiding, without self, without name—words merged with the utmost subtlety. Spirit soared to the Purple Clarity, equal in compassion and love. Different bones became kin; the land was secure, the people prosperous, rejoicing in great peace.

The Jade Clarity Great Dao, immeasurably delivering beings, reverently believes, awakens, and comprehends—attaining the Dao and becoming perfected.

The Dao speaks: All that the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounds in the sutras are the hidden rhymes of the Jade Clarity Great Dao’s Supreme Deity’s inner names, also the esoteric titles of the exalted perfected Jade Clarity Divine Kings, the concealed names of the hundred spirits—none are ordinary words of the mundane world.

When the highest sages have attained perfection, true persons penetrate the mysteries and fathom the subtleties, fully mastering these chapters. Reciting them ten times, the ten thousand heavens pay reverence, a thousand emperors bow in listening, the Jade Capital sways in motion, seas settle and mountains stand firm, the Three Radiances merge in illumination, the Seven Luminaries shine as one. Demonic souls are extinguished at their roots, ghostly spirits severed from their bonds, perverse qi is purged and purified, the Three Primordials expand in stillness. Withered forms and white bones return to life and restore their spirits.

For those of utmost learning who recite this ten times: the Five Elders oversee the covenant, the Four Marshals descend to observe, the Three Officials record merit, the Eight Scribes manage external affairs, demon kings submit

Whether manifest or concealed, whether vanished or present, in profound tranquility and emptiness, amidst the tangled web of interconnections—the Dao is most wondrous. Where numinous transformations are heard, it illumines the Nine Origins, spans the Seven Celestial Palaces, supports the left with the Vast and Falling, and upholds the right with Golden Perfection. Purple auroras flow in resonance, crimson radiance surges horizontally, weaving its chapters in ceaseless transformation.

The Dao’s root is born, concealed within the Jade Capital, upon the Terrace of Mist and Net, descending to coil at the source of the Twin Pure Pools. Paired, they emerge from the Gates of the Sun and Moon, casting fire ten thousand fathoms high to sweep away demonic vapors. The Vermilion Essence of Yang’s Radiance and the Eightfold Crimson Mists bathe and refine the spirit’s windows. The Nine Void Peaks of Kunlun blaze with luminous clouds, jade spirits and net-like blossoms imbibe the Long Tower’s nectar, scattering jade splendor. Spirits merge, bones transform, the ten thousand qi harmonize in brilliance. The Jade Capital enters the Mysterious, the Dao’s qi forms the body, resplendent in the indistinct, merging at the ultimate to command immortality.

The Dao gives birth to spirit, qi forms the body, illumination guards the true, transformation spreads glory—wherever it goes, it arrives without fail, and all works are instantly accomplished. The Grand Tenuity refines essence, the profound vastness sinks into obscurity, the Azure Void and Crimson Realm—these are the Primordial Capital of the Great Dao, the Cloud Court floating above, the Mysterious Gate towering in purity. The Yu-Yu transforms qi, cycling through the ten directions.

Within lies the Spirit of the Vast and Falling Northern Terrace; within lies the Crimson Essence Lord of the Nine Harmonies; within lies the True Person of the Mud-Pill Heavenly Canopy; within lies the Minister of the Golden Gate Assisting the August Emperor; within lies the Venerable One of the Three Upper Clarities; within lies the Spirit of Longevity and Transcendent Transformation; within lie the Twin Lads of Flowing Light, crimson script forming pearls, the natural Jade Capital, the Golden Perfection Venerable.

The Grand Aurora’s Bright Hall, the Lesser Essence’s Green Chariot, the Great Circle’s Abundance, the Grand Unity summons immortals, bestowing blessings and delivering beings. Heaven’s transformations stretch endlessly; today, the imperial radiance arrives as the Ten Thousand Emperors descend to the throne.

Together they ride the Nine Yangs’ divine chariot, the Azure Empyrean’s golden-rooted crimson simurgh carriage, bearing the cords of ten thousand transformations, the canopy of pure numinous radiance. Vermilion banners veil the sun, jade wheels grind the void. Each drives a chariot of dark crystal, drawn by black-armored poison dragons, celestial apes, and endlessly shifting forms.

They strike the *aoluo* zither and beat the Grand Empyrean’s drum. Purple mists and white clouds conceal and reveal the ten thousand spirits. Heavenly heralds bear banners, great marshals set forth, wind and fire unite, divine auroras scatter brilliance. Auspicious omens descend, floating through the void to arrive. Their voices resound through the empty waves, subduing demons and protecting life. The Upper Clarity’s Marshal, the High Numinous Sovereign Perfected, the Jade Capital’s Imperial Office, the Great Dao’s divinities, deliver beings to transcendence, the Great Lord of Longevity.

Bearing registers and holding talismans, they assemble at the imperial court. The Supreme Nine Voids, the Palace of the Spirit Canopy, the division of the Mud-Pill, the flowing crystals of the Three Purities, the Mysterious Cinnabar and Grand Tranquility, the Central Yellow and Purple Tenuity. The numinous spirits of the Upper Perfected universally proclaim to the Three Origins. Purple portals and azure chambers, misty nets and cloud encampments. The Jade Hall’s Purple Infants, the spirits of the White Flower, the heroes of bone transformation, the Twin Lads of Flowing Bells. Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance, the Two Radiant Great Spirits, leftward turning the Vast and Falling, rightward flashing the Fire Bells.

Swiftly summon the Three and Five, the Upper Clarity’s officers and soldiers, crimson veins and purple networks entwining the celestial scriptures. Glancing with flying light, they inhale and absorb the Jade City, descending to the profound springs, the river valleys and dark abysses. The intricacies of winding principles, the black waters’ inner stillness, jade maidens turning the mechanism, golden lads twisting the ropes. The ancient ancestors of former kalpas examine and punish without cease. The Jade Capital’s Dao qi swiftly verifies names. Sin registers are erased, karmic paths lose their glory—none may detain them, for the Emperor’s punishments are severe. By the Primordial Beginning’s talismanic command, they ascend at the appointed hour.

The Nine Capitals of accumulated nights, the Grand Abyss and Weak Depths—all demonic souls, cold-dew-suffering spirits, fire-refined yin obstructions, the hundred barriers burned away. Malevolent villains and their lineages are extinguished, swiftly subdued at Mount Feng. The Jade Capital’s Great Dao transforms the body to birth immortals; immortals refine the body to transcend kalpas, ever unshaken. Following the light to guide qi, the spirit pool exhales mist, born together with the Dao, their lifespan surpassing a hundred million years.

Forever delivered from the Seven Harms, Eight Difficulties, and Nine Calamities, they step through the Heavenly Gate, surpassing the Three Realms, ascending the Phoenix Terrace and lofty chariots to roam the Upper Clarity. In the Upper Clarity’s heavens, the Heavenly Emperor and Primordial Perfected dwell in the wondrous emptiness of Brahman conduct.

*Jade Chapters of the Immortal Kings, matching the exalted perfected.*

**First: Lower Origin’s Jade Heaven Grand Dao, Azure Void Immortal King’s Chant**
Cloud-light surging and merging,
celestial winds eightfold open.
Green chariots attend the banners, commanding dragon-drawn carriages.
Mystic sea stilled to azure, vermilion standards subdue demons.
Nine Heavens unite in might, shaking and dispelling the hundred evils.
This is my Mud-Pill Palace—
numinous light flying as rosy clouds.
Streaming mist through eight paths, azure crystal and jade gauze.
Purple dawn’s Dao accomplished, irrigating qi through the Three Radiances.
Measuring boundless deliverance, inscribing merit for the Imperial Lords.
Primal Beginning’s talismanic decree, Heavenly Tally records the name.
Transcending the dark netherworld, flying across the Vermilion Mound.
Imperial court’s towering peaks, refining and tempering form and soul.

**Second: Middle Origin’s Jade Heaven Grand Dao, Purple Grotto Immortal King’s Chapter**
Luminous Purple Tenuity, vast and boundless in eight directions.
Transforming form to ride the Mystery, encircling the numinous precincts.
Heavenly River irrigates the ford, the Dipper’s handle and stars bow low.
Jade pendants in profuse brilliance, great pearls and lesser beads.
The host of stars quiver with light, following the Imperial Banner’s command.
Seated in stability in the Purple Heaven, molten gold’s fourfold radiance.
Vermilion mist unfolds, fire essence whirls in tempest.
Within, an elder—crimson script on cloud-garments.
Ascending my Jade Capital, gazing below at the luxuriant sun.
Circling winds fan the gale, merging with the shadowy and subtle.
Sun-lads blend the pearl, illuminating the central compass.
Soaring luminance through a hundred realms, the two qi unite and part.
The Dao’s secrecy in Jade Perfection—
his name is Profound Pool,
hand wielding the long halberd, waist girdled with jade tassels.
Left authority, right balance—cinnabar serpent and mysterious tortoise.
Bestowing deliverance upon me, returning together to Upper Clarity.

**Third: Upper Origin’s Jade Heaven Grand Dao, Grand Void Immortal King’s Song**
Exhaling qi to form dragons, sighing qi to birth winds.
Adorning my spirit-chariot, treading the radiance to fly through space.
Sun and moon revolve and turn, intersecting without end.

Do not behold my spirit—
my spirit communes with the Void.
You ask of the Great Dao—
what form does the Dao assume?
None can truly know—
the Mud-Pill Palace’s cavernous tower.
The spirit’s canopy billows azure,
true transformation flourishes and thrives.
Nurture and refine your spirit,
lush and radiant as the twin lads.
Tossing the ringing bells, hurling fire,
crimson radiance through ninefold layers.
Circling the eight poles,
heaven’s motion in the firm and the profound.
Refining yin to extinguish malevolence,
attending the Jade Enclosure’s celestial wall.
This Dao is wondrous and subtle,
boundless fortune unending.

Above the Three Voids, within the Three Origins’ palace,
the Jade Capital Immortal King’s deliverance chant—
its sound interwoven with cavernous scriptures.
Recite it a hundred times,
your name inscribed in Upper Clarity;
recite it a thousand times,
the Three Origins descend to your court;
ten thousand recitations perfect the Dao,
ascending in flight to Upper Clarity.
Govern and align the Three Origins,
myriad spirits pay homage in your court.
Those who hear this numinous sound,
the Immortal King preserves their authenticity.
Commanding the Three Realms,
directing the thousand spirits,
forever dissolving the Earth Bureau,
the Five Offices’ examining deities.
Entering and exiting without hindrance,
village altars escort you forth and back.
Nine generations refine and transform,
souls and spirits transcend and ascend.
This is called Jade Dawn—
the Dao perfected, the utmost truth,
delivering boundless beings,
recorded in the Supreme Ultimate’s register.

There exists a secret Upper Clarity text,
revered by all heavens.
Revealed to the indolent, it sinks into the dark prison,
eternally parting from the Supreme Ultimate Elder.
The Dao declares:
This Jade Capital cavernous scripture
comprises the hidden chants of all Heavenly Thearchs
and the Three Origins’ Immortal Kings—
all are the words of the Great Brahma,
not the common speech of the world.
Its language merges with the primordial chaos,
its text heaven-born,
thus in its secret subtlety, beyond thought and detail.
Upper Clarity treasures it,
concealed in the Mysterious Metropolis’ Purple Tenuity Upper Palace,
transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas according to the Mysterious Statutes.
If a perfected one offers gold and treasures with a sincere heart,
following the Jade Capital’s transmission protocols,
pledging oaths to the Nine Thearchs,
only then is it passed on.

The Dao declares:
The Two Modes’ revolutions also have ends and beginnings.
The Seven Governors and Nine Palaces also have calamitous alignments.
Perfected Daoists also have concealments and revelations.
Those of shallow learning also suffer afflictions.
For all who share these calamities and affinities,
you must unite in heart to perform purification rites,
burn incense in the six watches,
recite the scriptures ten times,
through the power of the Jade Capital’s Great Dao’s profound secrecy—
heaven turns, earth revolves,
spirits are pacified, ghosts silenced,
blessings and virtue descend at once,
dissolving all inauspiciousness.
The Jade Capital’s cavernous scripture
universally delivers without end.

The Dao declares:
Those of shallow Daoist learning,
whose immortal rank is yet unfulfilled,
or who have not fully comprehended the Jade Capital’s practices,
failing to awaken to the Dao’s essentials,
naturally entrust their hearts to fate,
falling into the reckoning of existence.
When their destined time of extinction arrives,
their bodies pass through the Great Yin.
At the hour of their passing,
fellow students and perfected ones
perform incense rites for them,
recite the scriptures ten times,
to deliver their corporeal forms according to the method.
Then the spirit’s palace is sealed and secure,
the Mud-Pill fortress firm,
the ringing bells blaze within,
the Jade Capital enfolds its light.
The corpse refines, the po-soul vanishes,
the hun-soul ascends,
following the merit of their studies,
calculating the days to attain rebirth.
Yang fire enters the body,
restoring the decayed form,
spirit and flesh suffuse the frame,
suddenly reborn,
the turning wheel no longer confounds,
ascending to the rank of lofty immortals.

The Dao declares:
When the cycles of chen and shen reach their limit,
kalpas exhaust and fortunes decline,
you must perform purification rites,
burn incense, and recite the scriptures.
When the Yellow and Red shift their measures,
eclipses and encroachments occur,
you must perform purification rites,
burn incense, and recite the scriptures.
When seasonal qi prevail and oppress,
the heavenly stems and earthly branches clash,
you must perform purification rites,
burn incense, and recite the scriptures.
When a nation’s borders suffer flood and drought,
weapons and war arise on all sides,
you must perform purification rites,
burn incense, and recite the scriptures.
When epidemics spread,
ghosts and spirits cause harm,
you must perform purification rites,
burn incense, and recite the scriptures.
When teachers and friends pass away,
you must perform purification rites,
burn incense, and recite the scriptures.
Purification rites and scripture recitation
carry immense merit and virtue,
dissolving heavenly disasters above,
dissolving human calamities below,
preserving and extending the emperor’s life for a hundred million years,
pacifying the nation,
delivering the myriad people.
In life and death, they rely upon it—
its blessings are immeasurable,
universally delivering heaven and humanity.

The Dao declares:
Whoever possesses this scripture,
able to perform these merits for the Thearchs of Heaven and Earth and the myriad people,
reverently petitioning the Jade Capital’s Primordial August Perfected,
on the day of their vow,
resolving to perform purification rites,
burning incense,
reciting the scriptures ten times—
all are recorded in Upper Clarity,
myriad spirits attend and guard them.
Those distinguished on the right as perfected ones
become sagely lords,
Immortals of Longevity and Great Thearchs,
ministers of the royal court.
All heavens inscribe their Daoist merits,
displaying them in the Jade Capital.
Their merits and transgressions are tallied,
not a hair’s breadth lost.
The Three Origins’ Immortal Kings
also safeguard and recommend their persons.
Those who attain the Dao
truly comprehend these profound words.

Brightness scatters wisdom’s silence,
Obscurity alone completes the design.
Cypress vast, extremes dispelled,
Torrents flow through lush peaks.
Veiled diligence, weariness dispelled.

Lofty scenes, vast and limpid,
Jade eyes rise high in Su.

Fierce and coarse, Yuan’s capital.
Moonlit ford congeals its radiance,
Luminous spirits pierce the pearl.

**The Eight Heavens of the South**
Jing’s luxuriance, sighing at the assembly,
Purple rhythms, Yi’s remnants.
Pouring into the pole’s resplendent flames,
Summoning the sturdy Ox.
Fierce fire turns back at its peak,
The plain Way embraces serenity.
Ancient perfected ones, primordial and empty,
Qi’s abyss, the dragon’s majesty.
Firm and stern, the magpie’s benefit,
Chariots and carriages bear their countenance.
Heaven’s wisdom rises in strength,
Dark governance calls forth the profound.

Capitals open, Du’s canopy.
Nine destinies of Shamo,
Green spades link in succession.

Depending on and extending Bi’s hope.
The Winnowing Basket attends the hook’s tail,
Youthful factions hold fast.
Virtuous ones traverse the pure and numinous,
Clouds bear purple in their shift.
Wind’s prohibitions, silent transmission,
The Great Profundity’s marvels.

**The Dao Speaks:**
These are the hidden writings of the Jade Capital’s Great Dao Lord in Upper Clarity Heaven, the Jade Emperor’s secrets, the boundless sounds. The ancient script was inscribed upon the canopy of the Great Void’s Purple Tenuity Heaven, in green characters coiled and curved, a full ten feet in length. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign of Old once transcribed this text to rectify the celestial sounds. Those who know its sounds and purify themselves to recite it shall have the myriad heavens of Upper Clarity dispatch the Three Origins’ Immortal Kings and the Jade Capital’s ten thousand perfected ones to descend and observe their persons, recording their meritorious diligence. These deeds are then memorialized to the heavens, the Four Offices stand in solemn reverence, and the Nine Palaces bow in welcome. Though the heart has yet to fully comprehend, merely reciting its words ensures the Immortal Kings’ protection, ascending in flight to the Jade Capital, roaming and feasting in Cavernous Yang, soaring to the Purple Court.

This sound is the Jade Capital Great Dao’s chapter—nothing it does not move, nothing it does not illumine, nothing it does not pacify, nothing it does not govern. The Three Origins employ it, and nothing is not divine. It is the Heavenly Perfected Supreme Emperor’s naturally perfected sound. Thus, reciting it aligns the Eight Simplicities with the light, the spirit’s radiance reflecting one’s form. Within the Mud Pill Palace, ten thousand spirits stand in array, the Great Perfected Lord of the Mysterious revealing to you the wondrous Dao.

Reciting this scripture daily sharpens hearing and brightens vision, lost hair regrows, and one naturally harmonizes with the profound. Golden perfection and jade radiance encircle your body, the spirit’s palace thrives in harmony, the myriad qi return to the true, a thousand sages descend in rosy clouds, the Dao’s ocean shines in clarity. The boundless opens to salvation, the vast profundity of the profound and mysterious.

*The Marvelous Scripture of the Numinous Treasure’s Limitless Salvation of Humankind, Upper Grade, Scroll the Second, Complete*
*Scroll the Third*

*The Chapter on Stabilizing the Eight Directions of Heaven and Earth and Securing the Nation’s Fortune*

The Dao spoke: Long ago in the tranquil void of heaven, amidst crimson descents of divine winds and the wondrous soil of the Great Mystery, the Primordial Beginning bestowed the *Limitless Upper Grade Scripture for Salvation of Humankind*—the stabilization of the eight directions of heaven and earth and the securing of the nation’s boundless fortune.

As the Celestial Worthy of the Primordial Beginning was about to expound this scripture, he circumambulated eight times to summon the eight directions. Only then did he ascend his throne. The great deities of the eight directions of heaven and earth, the lofty and venerable sagely lords, the Perfected Lords who stabilize the nation, and their innumerable hosts arrived upon the void. Jade radiance and purple qi, auspicious mists congealing into brilliance, jasper chariots drifting through rosy clouds, feathered banners interlacing in splendor, kingfisher canopies arrayed in rows, fragrant winds dispersing numinous essence, celestial spirits shining in clarity, the myriad forms pristine and luminous, divine light scattering and spreading, golden haze suffused with fragrance, green silken veils rippling with radiance—all illumined the Great Void in resplendent glory.

For eight days and eight nights, the sun, moon, and stars of all heavens, the warp and weft of the celestial sphere, the Northern Dipper and the Balance, all paused in their courses. Golden perfection and jade luminosity filled the tranquil void with numinous resonance; the thunder of the Dharma rolled gently, and none failed to stand in solemn reverence. The lands of the nation became uniformly level, mountains and rivers majestic and fair, forests and trees lush and flourishing. Mighty radiance responded to the signs, heavenly omens all arrived, and the assembled Perfected Ones attended as the Celestial Worthy of the Primordial Beginning, seated in mystery upon the transforming treasure-throne of jade petals unfolding in blossoms, began to expound the scripture.

After the first recitation, the great sages of all heavens simultaneously proclaimed its excellence. At that moment, all sentient beings across the ten thousand lands universally received enlightenment and together awakened virtuous minds.

After the second recitation, the eight directions were stabilized, and the imperial fortune flourished in perpetuity.

After the third recitation, the myriad classes harmonized, and the people enjoyed abundance and joy.

After the fourth recitation, calamities and disorders vanished forever, and noxious harms ceased to arise.

After the fifth recitation, the transformative power of the Dao spread universally, and all were refined by sagely models.

After the sixth recitation, heaven covered and earth bore, and harmonious qi surged in fusion.

After the seventh recitation, the numinous scripture manifested and spread, and the true Dao shone in clarity.

After the eighth recitation, the people and all beings lived in blissful harmony, free from worldly concerns.

After the ninth recitation, the true scripture appeared in revelation.

After the tenth recitation, auspicious omens arrived in abundance.

At that time, every man and woman in the land turned their hearts in devotion, all received protection and salvation, and each attained longevity.

The Dao spoke: At that time...

When the Primordial Heavenly Worthy recited the scripture once, the infinite and boundless hosts of the Azure Flower Palace Lords and their officers from the Eastern Limitless Realm arrived, floating through the void.

When recited twice, the infinite and boundless hosts of the Cinnabar Flower Palace Lords and their officers from the Southern Limitless Realm arrived, floating through the void.

When recited thrice, the infinite and boundless hosts of the Luminous Flower Palace Lords and their officers from the Western Limitless Realm arrived, floating through the void.

When recited four times, the infinite and boundless hosts of the Purple Flower Palace Lords and their officers from the Northern Limitless Realm arrived, floating through the void.

When recited five times, the infinite and boundless hosts of the Ghost Gate Palace Lords and their officers from the Northeastern Limitless Realm arrived, floating through the void.

When recited six times, the infinite and boundless hosts of the Earth Gate Palace Lords and their officers from the Southeastern Limitless Realm arrived, floating through the void.

When recited seven times, the infinite and boundless hosts of the Human Gate Palace Lords and their officers from the Southwestern Limitless Realm arrived, floating through the void.

When recited eight times, the infinite and boundless hosts of the Heavenly Gate Palace Lords and their officers from the Northwestern Limitless Realm arrived, floating through the void.

After the eight recitations were complete, the Palace Lords, officers, and their hosts who stabilize the nation’s fortune across the eight directions—the Eight Radiant Ones, the Eight Mighty Ones, the Eight Scribes, the Eight Spirits, and all the immortals of the various departments—arrived all at once. Every man and woman in the land turned their hearts in devotion and reverence. All wished for the eight directions of heaven and earth to be blessed with auspicious responses, peace, prosperity, and joy, to hear the Heavenly Worthy proclaim the essential Dharma, to stabilize the nation’s fortune, and to ensure the eternal endurance of heaven.

Like fine rain or dense mist, the boundless hosts encircled and surrounded, an encirclement that could not be restrained. Then, from the pearl upon the Heavenly Worthy’s brow, there emanated a radiance of wondrous hues. This light divided into eight beams, and within each beam appeared celestial scriptures—natural, numinous talismans of primordial qi. From these eight directions emerged eight talismans to stabilize the nation’s fortune, secure the cosmos, and reveal vermilion texts and jade-script divine chapters. Auspicious qi was summoned, and felicitous omens were drawn forth.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy led the eight directions, the celestial and terrestrial bureaus, the Palace Lords, officers, and the perfected beings of the eight quarters. The immeasurable great spirits and the boundless hosts all entered the radiant light. From below, the people gazed upward, seeing only a gentle shimmer as they merged into the light, dissolving into the numinous talismans of primordial qi. Once within the radiant light, their whereabouts became unknown. The people dispersed, and the earth was veiled in misty clouds, lustrous as soft jade.

Within this wondrous vision, the Heavenly Worthy proclaimed the Great Dharma for Stabilizing the Nation’s Fortune in its entirety. The assembled perfected beings oversaw its transmission, bestowing it upon me. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words. When the ritual was roughly complete, the hosts of heaven returned to their stations, and in an instant, all fell silent without a trace.

At that time, all heavenly and earthly beings who encountered this scripture and Dharma were universally delivered, their allotted years preserved without harm or injury. The entire land turned in reverence, each with wholehearted devotion. There was no deceit, no falsehood, no malice, no scheming, no slander, no contention, no flattery, no cruelty. Their words upheld loyalty and uprightness; their mouths spoke no grievance or praise. They were united in compassion and love, and even foreign lands became kin. The nation was at peace, the people prosperous, and all rejoiced in great harmony.

From the scripture’s first proclamation, the entire land followed the Dao. Those who had cultivated sincere devotion, reverence, and veneration were all delivered across the ages.

The Dao spoke: The names uttered by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy during the scripture’s recitation are the inner names of the Heavenly Emperors. They stabilize the nation’s fortune, dispel misfortune from the eight directions, and bring supreme blessings and auspicious omens—these are the hidden tones of the divine. They are also the esoteric secrets of the highest spirits, the sacred texts of the jade tablets, the inner taboo names that summon the perfected, primordial, and wondrous beings, and the hidden names that protect the flourishing age of the emperor. These are not the common words of the world.

When the highest sages have attained perfection and the perfected beings have mastered the mysteries, descending with numinous power to uphold the imperial destiny, the Dao sustains the great fortune, subdues evil and ugliness, and its virtue extends to all living beings. Those who comprehend its chapters may recite it eight times: the eight directions will be at peace, the six harmonies will be tranquil, the hosts of heaven will chant from afar, the myriad emperors will offer rites, rivers and seas will be serene, mountains and peaks will manifest their numinous power, the sun and moon will cast double shadows, the stars will move in orderly procession, demonic hordes will be bound in form, ghostly spirits will lose their clarity, blessings will return to extend the age, and the people will be nurtured in peace.

For the devoted scholar who recites it eight times, the Five Emperors will guard the nation, the Three Heavens will assist and sustain, demonic spirits will lose their sight, ghostly evils will lose their clarity, and those on the verge of death will be delivered, cut off from death and restored to life. The reason for this is that though the scholar may uphold the highest precepts and the talismans of the eight directions stand firm, the numinous Dharma for stabilizing and securing remains unintegrated with their spirit and qi, and their body has not yet penetrated the true. They may summon and command the eight spirits, but their power has not yet governed the celestial administration. Their virtue may subdue and restrain earthly deities and bind demonic spirits, but they can only invoke blessings and bring forth fortune—they cannot restore life. To recite this chapter lightly is to invite calamity upon oneself. To honor and venerate it with reverence will cause one’s family and nation to flourish, generation after generation, thriving in goodness. Through this karmic connection, ten thousand disasters will not touch them, and divine luminaries will guard their gates.

This scripture is supremely wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital. It delivers countless beings and is the root of the ten thousand Daoist traditions. Its majestic model is vast, and its virtue is beyond measure.

The Dao spoke: Whenever this scripture is recited eight times, the eight spirits of the eight directions of heaven and earth, the Palace Lords, officers, the Eight Radiant Great Spirits, and the perfected beings of the eight quarters will all arrive together to stabilize the nation’s fortune. The Eight Great Divine Kings and the perfected beings of the eight directions will come as one. Evil and strange beings will hide in concealment, the people and all beings will be at peace, the nation will be secure, demonic spirits and malevolent specters will be dispelled by the eight talismans, and the true spirits will be protected. In the lands of the eight directions, the bones of the dead will be laid to rest. The thousand-year-old trees and stones, the water and fire spirits, the vermilion serpents and red rats, the yin shadows and lingering grievances, the ghosts of ancient times, the multitudes of past generations, the countless ancestors, and the suffering souls of the hidden realms will all be delivered, ascending to the Vermilion Palace. After nine years of refinement, they will be transformed and reborn, beholding the era of great peace.

Those who diligently study this sutra to its culmination, fulfilling their merit and perfecting their virtue, shall all attain divine transcendence, ascending to the Golden Gates and roaming the Jade Capital. For scholars who cultivate and recite this sutra, their bodies shall align with Heaven and Earth, resonating with the eight directions. The nine palaces within their heads shall connect to the Great Ultimate, and the jade script of the eight directions shall radiate, illuminating their bodily palaces. The Lord of the Heart, tranquil and non-active, shall harmonize the hundred spirits. Their hun and po souls shall undergo refinement, the yin and yang shall circulate their numinous essence. On the left resides Wu Ying, on the right guards Bai Yuan, and at the center shines the Morning Radiance, illuminating countless realms. The swift steeds shall report their merits, and the Scribe of Destiny shall record their deeds. All shall then be delivered, ascending to the Southern Palace.

When this sutra is recited universally, all shall attain the true Dao. Jade talismans shall summon the spirits, and the spirits shall be at peace, their qi numinous. Crimson sinews and frosty marrow shall form patterns of purple veins, and the script shall spread as a profound chapter, transforming their bones into cinnabar gold. Thus shall their lifespans be extended, and in the end, all shall achieve the Way of Corpse Liberation. Their ethereal souls shall briefly dissolve, sparing them the trials of hell, and they shall swiftly regain their forms, roaming the vastness of the heavens.

This sutra is wondrous and subtle, universally delivering boundless beings. All heavenly and mortal beings shall receive its blessings. Immeasurable fortune shall grace both life and death, for this is a treasure cherished by the heavens above, not to be transmitted to the lower realms. Only the most devoted shall offer gold and treasures in sincerity, swearing oaths to Heaven before its transmission. Those who lightly disclose or disrespect it shall bring calamity upon nine generations, condemned to eternal servitude in the Earthly Offices.

The eight directions are guarded by thirty-two Jade Lads and thirty-two Jade Maidens, who protect the sacred script and safeguard the bodies of those who receive this sutra.

The Dao declares: During the long fast of the first month, recite this sutra to pacify the directions of *yin*, *mao*, *chen*, *si*, *wu*, *wei*, *shen*, *you*, *xu*, *hai*, *zi*, and *chou*, the cardinal positions of the eight directions, and the central burial grounds. This shall liberate the souls of past generations from earthly bondage, delivering them to the Southern Palace.

During the long fast of the seventh month, recite this sutra to pacify Heaven and Earth, ensuring all living beings fulfill their Dao-nature and aspire to divine transcendence. Their names shall be inscribed in the heavens on yellow registers and white tablets, erasing death and granting rebirth.

During the long fast of the tenth month, recite this sutra for the king, emperor, lord, ministers, fathers, and sons, to secure the nation’s prosperity, preserve the Mandate of Heaven, and ensure its eternal continuity. The ruler shall perpetually govern, pacifying the land, and the people shall praise the era of Great Peace.

On the eight seasonal festivals, recite this sutra to pacify the eight directions of Heaven and Earth. Auspicious omens shall descend, and wondrous signs shall manifest. The sacred script and secret diagrams shall be carved upon the eight pillars, and the eight celestial offices shall record virtues, preserving the Dao’s transformation for eternity.

On the Three Primordial Days, recite this sutra to harmonize the twelve celestial palaces, the four directions, and the eight directions. Heavenly spirits and earthly deities shall bestow compassion and blessings, inscribing good fortune and ensuring the sagely ruler’s virtue ever ascends.

Their bodies shall become as the unbroken Cavern of Spirits, their forms adorned with jade blossoms, their faces golden. Their ethereal souls shall be pure and upright, their myriad qi enduring. All suffering shall cease, their bodies radiant with light. The Three Realms shall guard them, the Five Emperors shall receive them, and myriad spirits shall pay homage. Their names shall be inscribed in the heavens, and upon fulfilling their merit and perfecting their virtue, they shall ascend to the Supreme Clarity.

The Dao declares: On the day of practicing the Dao, one must bathe in fragrant waters, fast, and enter the chamber. Facing east, knock the teeth thirty-two times, making it heard in the thirty heavens above, and bow thirty-two times with utmost reverence. Close the eyes and meditate upon the body seated amidst clouds of blue, yellow, and white qi, both within and without shrouded in mist. A Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Lion, and White Crane shall array themselves to the left and right. The sun and moon shall shine brightly, illuminating the chamber. The talismanic officials of the eight directions and the merit-recording attendants of the eight sides shall stand in attendance. A circular image shall manifest above the head, revealing celestial script of dragons and phoenixes, pacifying Heaven and Earth and casting light upon the eight directions. This vision shall be vivid and clear.

Recite the secret incantation:
*"Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Lord of the Dao, summon forth the Three and Five Merit-Recording Attendants within my body, the officials and messengers to my left and right, the Jade Lads bearing incense, the Jade Maidens transmitting words, the talismanic attendants of the Five Emperors, and the incense officials of the day—thirty-two each—to open the gates and convey my words. Today is an auspicious day, a long fast in a pure hall, practicing the supreme sutra to deliver boundless beings. May my entreaties ascend swiftly to the presence of the Most High Primordial Lord of the Thirty-Two Heavens."*
Upon completion, draw in qi thirty-two times and recite the sutra facing east.

*The Primordial Beginning’s Wondrous Scripture of Boundless Salvation, Supreme and Marvelous*
*The Primordial Cavern-Mysterious Numinous Treasure’s Fundamental Chapter, Supreme and Marvelous Beginning, Pacifying and Delivering Beings*

The eight directions of Heaven and Earth, the eight mighty ones concealed in rhythm, the natural coagulation of celestial seal-script. The eight spirits’ crimson script. The primordial qi of the ancestral kalpas. The wondrous qi of the Primordial Beginning, giving birth to all heavens. Opening and spreading the eight directions, assisting in establishing the root of Heaven. The divine perfected of Heaven and Earth, dividing qi to form bodies. Once the directions were set, fortune and misfortune unfolded. The divine talismans of the Emperor repel demons and protect humanity.

Without script, there is no illumination; without script, there is no clarity; without script, there is no establishment; without script, there is no completion; without script, there is no pacification; without script, there is no stabilization. This is the Great Brahma, pacifying and securing the cosmos. The nation’s prosperity shall endure, and auspicious blessings shall perpetually flow.

The realm of Yu Luo Xiao Jing, the numinous capital of the Jade Emperor. At the utmost height of the Supreme Great Luo Heaven, vast as kalpas. Below to the Kunlun’s foundation, the eight directions distinctly divided. The myriad regions clearly demarcated, each position guarded by divine officials and spirit attendants. Memorials ascend to the morning court, virtues recorded and merits inscribed, all derived from the people.

Together they ride the dark clouds, with their hosts of officials and cavalry, the divine officers and functionaries of the eight directions. Their banners and pennants, mounted escorts, ride upon wind and cloud, spouting smoke and breathing fire. Dragon spirits and courier-demons, tiger-headed ghostly officers, four-faced generals, eight-armed divine warriors, crimson-browed and azure-armored, ride the whirlwinds and mount the unicorns. The direct-talisman minor functionaries pacify the numinous offices, the spirits of the earthly regions, with their myriad chariots and ten thousand riders, ascending and descending to attend the celestial cortege, to pacify the nation and protect life.

The Heavenly Mechanism’s Chancellor, the Southern Prosperity’s Supreme Palace, the Han Director of Records, the Eight Culmens’ Great Gods—holding the registers of Heaven and Earth, they inspect the myriad spirits, summoning them in secret flight to assemble before the Emperor. According to their respective directions, they solemnly report to the heavens above. Universally proclaimed to the Three Realms, the Boundless Divine Regions, the Yellow Springs’ Courts, the Northern Capital of Fengdu, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the Twelve River Sources—hastily summon the Great Star Lord of the Accumulated Corpses to deliver the people.

The Eight Culmens subdue harm, shatter malevolent arrows, call back wandering souls, and deliver ancestors through countless kalpas, swiftly erasing their names from the ledgers of sin, extinguishing evil roots, so they may not be detained or pressed into ghostly throngs. By the Primordial Beginning’s talismanic command, they pacify and promote, guarding the Northern Capital’s Frigid Pool, escorting the forms and souls, with the Earthly Offices recommending them for promotion to the Southern Prosperity’s ranks. The Heavenly Mechanism’s Central Ministry ensures the Dao’s eternal renewal, as dead souls undergo refinement and the people are transformed into immortals. The people receive deliverance, enduring through kalpas, revolving with the ages, their years equaling Heaven’s. Perpetually delivered across the directions, no harm may assail them; by talisman they are pacified, securing long years of felicity.

the Eight Culmens of Heaven and Earth, the method for pacifying and securing the nation’s destiny,
secretly preserved in the Eastern Florescence’s Treasure Chamber, its prohibitions most solemn.
The true talismans of the Eight Culmens are all naturally numinous scriptures,
the blossoms of soaring mystery, the qi of the Nine Phoenixes,
forming purple characters.
Used to rescue and protect the world’s afflictions, the misfortunes of regions and boundaries,
the way to rectify unruly lands.
Should a nation’s borders suffer epidemics, warfare, banditry, or disasters of water and fire,
then perform incense offerings and purificatory fasts, practice the Dao in the six watches,

and place it within the nation.
Burn incense and offer libations to the Three Heavenly Lords and the Eight Culmen Divine Kings and their officers.

After three or seven days, dismantle the altar, and great fortune will follow.

If a household suffers from harmful qi in its boundaries, or the killing force of yellow earth talismans,
use this talisman to perform exorcisms, and also sacrifice to the Eight Culmen’s officials, lords, generals, and officers.
This is the Upper Clarity’s scripture for protecting the world—it must not be treated lightly.

If the people possess sincerity, they may take yellow silk, inscribe the eight talismans in cinnabar,
and wear them on their person to repel the myriad evils and thousand calamities.
When going out or returning, they need not avoid the Grand Year or the killing forces of directions and culmens.

revealing carelessness casts one into hell, misfortune extending to seven generations of ancestors.
The Dao states: These two chapters are the hidden melodies of the Celestial Emperors
and the Numinous Perfected Kings, all words of the Great Brahma,
not the common speech of the world.
Their words lack ornate beauty, their tunes lack florid elegance,
thus they are called profound and obscure, difficult to fathom in detail.
The heavens treasure them, secreted in the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace of the Mysterious Capital,
transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas according to the Mysterious Regulations.
If there is a perfected person who offers gold and treasures with a sincere heart,
following the old statutes to pledge alliance with the Ten Heavens, only then are they bestowed.

The Dao states: When the revolutions of heaven and earth reach their end,
the sun, moon, and five stars wane and wax,
the most sagely and divine persons prosper or decline,
the ill and afflicted among the lesser learned,
extending to national borders with floods and droughts,
the people and creatures suffering from epidemics,
within the divisions of the Eight Culmens, various calamities and anomalies arise.
Those of the same qi and lofty scholars should all unite in heart to perform purification rites,
burn incense in the six periods, recite the scriptures eight times,
offer libations to the Celestial Perfected, distribute talismans to the Eight Culmens,
place the twelve jade characters at the center,
diligently and earnestly pray—
blessings and virtue will immediately descend,
dispelling all inauspiciousness.
The immeasurable script universally delivers without limit.

The Dao states: When governance and transformation are incomplete,
morality and virtue not yet fulfilled,
affairs require broad implementation,
the unfolding of mysterious merit—
one should select the most learned and perfected persons
to burn incense and recite the scriptures.

Then the Eight Culmens of Heaven and Earth shall universally attain peace and stability, the imperial destiny shall prosper and flourish, and people shall be free from harm and malevolence. The true and upright divine spirits, with all things enveloped in virtue, receive life and imbibe numinous power, while stagnant ghosts and lingering spirits are purged. The deliverance of form and soul shall proceed directly to the Southern Palace. According to the merit of one’s study and practice, rebirth is attained by the reckoning of days. With the Wheel of Dao turning ceaselessly, one thereby achieves immortality as a divine transcendent.

The Dao states: When the revolutions of Heaven and Earth reach their end, the stellar lodges fall into disorder, the sun and moon lose their proper times of rising and setting, the four seasons deviate from their courses, yin and yang fall out of harmony, and the realm suffers calamities—floods, fires, warfare, banditry, epidemics, and poisons spread—causing the multitudes to perish and masters and disciples to meet untimely deaths. All these are the result of the punitive qi of the Eight Culmens inflicting their influence. In such times, one must distribute talismans, perform purification rites according to the proper methods, burn incense, and recite the scriptures. For the merit of purification rites and scripture recitation is most weighty: above, it dissolves celestial disasters and safeguards the emperor; below, it wards off poisonous harms and delivers the multitudes. Both the living and the dead depend upon it, its blessings immeasurable. Thus it is called "immeasurable," universally delivering gods and humans alike.

The Dao states: Whoever possesses this scripture and performs these meritorious deeds for the sake of Heaven, Earth, the sovereign, and the multitudes—on days of calamity, should one resolve to perform purification rites, burn incense, recite the scriptures, offer libations to the Eight Culmens, distribute talismans, and employ the proper methods, reciting the scriptures eight times—then all the heavens shall record their names, and the myriad spirits shall attend and protect them. Those of exceptional attainment shall become ministers of the Golden Gates of the Sage Lord, with the heavens meticulously recording their merits and demerits, not a hair’s breadth amiss. The True Kings of Heaven shall also safeguard and commend their persons. Those who attain the Dao shall thereby thoroughly comprehend the most profound teachings.

Composed by the Lord of the Immeasurable Sound of the Great Brahma Hidden Language in the Heavens
*The Jade Chapters of the Numinous Scripture of the Primordial Beginning for Pacifying the Imperial Destiny in the Eastern Eight Heavens*

The Caverns resound with the roar of the Great Turtle, discerning harmony in the scattered remnants.
Teachings ascend and drift, transcending the flourishing seals.
Radiant tablets stream forth, their axles set in motion; jade-like patterns are inscribed upon the catalpa.
Exquisite strokes descend with precision, their inception glowing and boundless.
Lush diagrams trace the ancestral origins, profound and robust in their density.
Pipes of catalpa and ochre rings align in harmonious accord.
Resplendent bells resound in distant reaches, the Dao’s jade and verdant perfection.
Veiled membranes drift like silk, distant peaks contend in their inscriptions.

**Southern Eight Heavens**
The Reclusive Pool establishes repose, its brilliance steadfast and questioning.
Vast mysteries guide the primal, thunderous expanses embrace the honored guests.
Indulgence gathers in spheres of grace, celestial crystals mark the lineage of the sun.
Cries echo in lofty confinement, tiny seals ripple in profound reverence.
Carved rhinoceros and twisted cords, discourses surveil the demonic paths.
Majestic maidens stir the threads, repeatedly dissolving in the saline marshes.
Immortal Xiao ascends the capital, inscribed pacts resound with Confucian clarity.
Day merges with the porcine depths, chaos swirls within the cavernous abyss.

**Western Eight Heavens**
Reverence converges with Peng, bending to observe the scribe Geng.
Forbearance and profit incline toward retreat, the obscure flourishes with martial spirits.
Jade and silk accumulate in the earth, their unique countenances draped in sashes.
Excessive splendor severs the vast, infants leak into the abyssal brilliance.
Crowns and dwellings embrace the firmament, purity unfolds in the twilight’s balance.
Life’s threads weave joyous strands, encountering the turbid depths of the primordial abyss.
Profound elegance propels the flourishing, the solitary departs for distant springs.
Pathways bathe in overflowing patterns, scribes hasten toward the western immortals.

**Northern Eight Heavens**
The Hidden and Sturdy surge with keen edge, the sun’s brilliance graces the celestial countenance.
Spokes extend to distant traces, amassing the rhinoceros’ thunderous might.
Radiance blazes in subtle splendor, trailing orchids and hanging wisteria.
Nourishing harmony streams in banners, the void’s kalpas bear crimson fissures.
Coiling peaks bow to the summits, entangled wings trace their painted couriers.
Buttons gleam in distant mystery, true vastness proclaims the celestial expanse.
Vast and boundless, the dragon’s abode gleams with crystalline purity.
The Feng’s severance commands confinement, the northern flames consume the sacrificial Ding.

The Dao speaks: These are the Great Brahma’s hidden languages within the heavens, the sounds of the Immeasurable. The ancient script, wrought from five-colored divine metal, was forged into talismans to pacify and establish them above the Eight Culmens of Heaven and Earth. They regulate the cycles of destiny, harmonizing qi with the primordial harmony, upholding the imperial destiny, and ensuring the Dao’s eternal flourishing. Each character spans a full *zhang* in breadth, once inscribed by the Heavenly Perfected and August Ones to serve as the true sounds. Those who know these sounds and recite them with sincere devotion shall have the Eight Directional Divine Kings and the governors of the Eight Culmens descend to observe their persons, recording their merits and diligence. These shall be reported to the heavens, where the myriad spirits shall pay homage. Earthly deities shall attend their gates, and the great merits of true immortals shall be preserved. Those who are commended as Perfected Ones shall attain the Dao in full, roaming the Three Realms and ascending through the Golden Gates. These sounds repel all, exorcise all, deliver all, and accomplish all—such are the spontaneous sounds of the Heavenly Perfected. Thus, their recitation summons the Eight Perfected to descend in observation, the Celestial Thearch to chant from afar, the myriad spirits to pay homage, the Three Realms to attend in reverence, and all malevolent forces to bow their heads. As demonic essences perish of themselves, the jade-like resonance reverberates, the ten directions grow solemn and clear, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks swallow their mists. The myriad spirits tremble and submit, gathering the host of immortals. The heavens are free of impurity, the earth devoid of demonic dust. Profound wisdom illumines the purest clarity, and the vastness of the Dao abides in the most profound mystery.

*The Primordial Treasure’s Measureless Upper Chapter of the Wondrous Scripture for the Salvation of Humanity, Scroll the Third Concludes*
*Scroll the Fourth*

**The Chapter on Eternally Extending the Kalpic Destiny to Preserve the World and Ascend in Peace**

The Dao spoke: In ancient times, within the August Numinous Heaven, amidst the wondrous transformations of the soaring tones of the Great Li Paradise, the *Primordial Beginning’s Scripture for Eternally Extending the Kalpic Destiny to Preserve the World and Ascend in Unlimited Supreme Peace* was received. When the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning expounded this scripture, he circumambulated ten times to summon the ten directions. Then, the celestial perfected, the great spirits, the exalted sages, and the perfected of wondrous conduct—an innumerable host—rode the void to arrive. Auspicious radiance suffused the air, numinous incense soared through the heavens, dragon-drawn chariots and purple canopies interlaced in mutual reflection, while streaming auroras blazed with splendor, illuminating the myriad heavens.

For nine days and nine nights, the floating canopies of the various heavens arrayed themselves in perfect order. The pivot of the Dipper halted its motion, the two luminaries merged their light, the eight extremities were swept clear, and all became serene and limpid. Throughout the land, mountains and forests, rivers and marshes, deep pools and thickets—all grew lush and verdant, blossoming in brilliance. The earth transformed into yielding jade, its luminous glow congealing in fresh purity, without a trace of discordant hue.

The host of perfected attended in reverence as the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning, in profound repose, sat upon the Nine-Colored Dark Dragon Treasure Throne in the Great Void. When the scripture was recited once, the great sages of the various heavens simultaneously voiced their approval, and all beings and people fulfilled their natures. When recited twice, no pestilence afflicted creatures, and the people were freed from care and anxiety. When recited thrice, people dwelled in harmony with transformation, without contention or desire. When recited four times, the age was called abundant and joyous, and none knew calamity or misfortune. When recited five times, the myriad regions submitted in compliance, and distant and near lands shared the same wind. When recited six times, winged and scaled creatures, those born from wombs and eggs, each preserved their generation and growth. When recited seven times, qilin and phoenix arrived in proper form, and heaven and earth responded with auspicious signs. When recited eight times, supreme virtue flourished in harmony, and people and creatures returned to simplicity. When recited nine times, the lords of states and kings and marquises eternally preserved their dynastic succession. When recited ten times, all under heaven universally realized the wondrousness of the Dao.

At that time, every man and woman in the land turned their hearts in devotion. All received protection and deliverance, and each attained longevity.

The Dao spoke: At that time,

When the Primordial Heavenly Worthy recited the sutra once, the boundless and measureless ranks of Perpetual Epoch-Preserving Perfected Great Spirits of the Eastern Direction, their numberless hosts, arrived floating through the void. When recited twice, those of the Southern Direction, their numberless hosts, arrived floating through the void. When recited thrice, those of the Western Direction, their numberless hosts, arrived floating through the void. When recited four times, those of the Northern Direction, their numberless hosts, arrived floating through the void. When recited five times, those of the Northeastern Direction, their numberless hosts, arrived floating through the void. When recited six times, those of the Southeastern Direction, their numberless hosts, arrived floating through the void. When recited seven times, those of the Southwestern Direction, their numberless hosts, arrived floating through the void. When recited eight times, those of the Northwestern Direction, their numberless hosts, arrived floating through the void. When recited nine times, those of the Upper Direction, their numberless hosts, arrived floating through the void. When recited ten times, those of the Lower Direction, their numberless hosts, arrived floating through the void.

When the ten recitations were complete, the boundless Perfected Great Spirits of the Ten Directions arrived all at once. Every man and woman in the land turned their hearts in devotion, and those who came numbered in the tens of millions, filling every region. All rejoiced in their aspirations, coming before the Heavenly Worthy to behold and hear the supreme Dharma, to penetrate its wondrous emptiness. The kalpas stretched long, preserving the world in peace; the myriad states took refuge, and heaven and humanity were in harmony. The numberless hosts pressed upon the land until half the earth sank beneath them, an irresistible force.

Thereupon, the Primordial One composed his gaze and gathered his spirit, emitting wondrous qi that coalesced into a radiant orb, vast as the red sun, suspended in the dark void nine *zhang* above the earth. The Primordial One ascended and led the Perfected Great Spirits, the exalted sages, the lofty Worthies, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, and the boundless Perfected Great Spirits of the Ten Directions, their numberless hosts, all into the radiant orb. Heavenly beings gazed upward, seeing only a shimmering light into which they entered. Once within the orb, their whereabouts were unknown, and the people of the land dispersed, the earth restored to levelness, no longer sunken.

Within the radiant orb, the Primordial One completed the recitation of the sutra in full. The assembled Perfected oversaw the transmission, bestowing it upon me. At that time, the kalpas were extended, the world preserved in peace, and boundless blessings and virtue prevailed. The Dao was spontaneous, all things flourished in joy, and the celebration was beyond words. When the Dharma rites were roughly concluded, the hosts of heaven returned to their stations in the space between breaths, leaving no lingering echo.

At that time, the heavenly beings who encountered the sutra universally attained deliverance, preserving their allotted years without harm. The entire land turned in devotion, all attuning to the great Dao. There was no premature death, no obstacles, no suffering, no calamity, no strife, no disturbance, no evil, no perversity, no bias, no faction. Minds were free of greed, hearts free of resentment and hatred. All shared in loving-kindness, and even those of different lineages became kin. The states were secure, the people prosperous, and all rejoiced in great peace.

When the sutra first emerged as teaching, those in the land who had cultivated utmost sincerity, revered and honored it, and perpetually extended the kalpas. The Dao spoke: What the Primordial Heavenly Worthy recited in the sutra are the inner names of the Heavenly Thearchs, the hidden rhymes of sound, as well as the inner taboos of demon kings and the concealed names of the hundred spirits. All are the divine mechanisms of the supreme Dao, the secret script of heaven and earth. They can perpetually extend the great and small kalpas, preserve the world in peace, grant the emperor ten thousand generations, and ensure the flourishing of all people and creatures. These are not ordinary words of the world.

The exalted sages who have already attained perfection, the Perfected who have penetrated the mysteries and fathomed the subtle, can fully grasp its verses. Reciting it ten times harmonizes heaven and earth, ensures the kalpas proceed without error, dissolves the three disasters, stabilizes the five qi, and brings all auspicious signs. The imperial lineage endures in prosperity. For scholars of the highest learning who recite it ten times, their bodies become eternally firm, their lifespans extended, preserving the world for countless ages. They summon the Perfected and attain immortality, delivering the dying and reviving the deceased.

The reason for this is that scholars’ Dao-qi is not yet pure, and their bodies have not merged with the numinous. They cannot summon and command the Ten Directions, nor wield authority over heaven. Their virtue can only subdue earthly spirits, extending deliverance from disasters and decline. They may only avert death, not restore life. To recite this chapter lightly brings calamity upon oneself. To honor and revere it brings prosperity to one’s household, flourishing through the generations, forming good karmic connections. Ten thousand disasters will not touch them, and divine beings will guard their gates.

This sutra is supremely wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital. It preserves and extends boundlessly, serving as the root of the myriad Dao. Its majestic model is of virtue beyond measure. The Dao spoke: For those who recite this sutra ten times, all the heavens arrive together, extending wondrous qi to restrain water and subdue fire, preventing their encroachment. The kalpas are perpetually extended, free from temporal disasters, eternally preserving peace.

For all who study this supreme sutra, when their merit is complete and their virtue perfected, they can safeguard and bring about the utmost governance, rejoicing in abundant years. Scholars of the highest learning who cultivate and recite this sutra externally protect the Six Directions and internally preserve their own bodies. Inner and outer follow the same principle, both attaining perpetual extension. Great and small receive blessings, and both the hidden and the manifest are enveloped in grace. This sutra is subtly wondrous, its protection and preservation inexhaustible. All heavenly beings receive its blessings, boundless fortune bestowed across ten thousand kalpas.

This sutra is treasured by heaven and not transmitted to the lower world. Only the most worthy, offering gold and treasures with sincere hearts, may transmit it after swearing an oath to heaven. To leak or slight it lightly brings calamity upon nine generations, condemning them to long servitude under the ghost officials. Five Emperors attend the sutra, along with twenty-four Jade Lads and twenty-four Jade Maidens, who safeguard the divine script and protect the bodies of those who receive the sutra.

The Dao speaks: In the first month, observe a prolonged fast and recite this sutra, and across ten thousand kalpas and countless assemblies, the transformative power of the Dao shall endure eternally. In the seventh month, observe a prolonged fast and recite this sutra, dispelling discord and misfortune while summoning supreme blessings and auspiciousness. In the tenth month, observe a prolonged fast and recite this sutra, and for kings, emperors, lords, ministers, fathers, and sons, it shall stabilize the nation’s destiny, safeguard the celestial mandate, and ensure the throne endures unbroken through generations, ever ruling as sovereigns, securing their realms, and bringing the people to proclaim great peace.

On the eight seasonal festivals, recite this sutra to perpetually extend the kalpic cycle and preserve worldly peace. Those who embody the Dao and receive its virtue shall ascend with their ancestors, attaining the rank of the Nine Palaces and becoming Perfected of the Three Heavens. On the days of parting and reunion, recite this sutra to universally deliver all living beings, granting them fortune and longevity, forever dispelling strife and discord, bringing universal harmony and tranquility. The myriad spirits shall guard and protect, the Five Emperors shall oversee, and boundless blessings shall extend across infinite ages.

The Dao speaks: On the days of practicing the Dao, one must bathe in fragrant waters, observe purification rites, enter the chamber, face east, and knock the teeth thirty-two times to ascend to the Thirty-Two Heavens. Bow in reverence thirty-two times, close the eyes, and meditate upon the body seated amidst clouds of blue, yellow, and white qi, both within and without shrouded in mist. There shall appear the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, Lion, and White Crane arrayed to the left and right, the sun and moon illuminating the chamber with radiant brilliance. A circular halo shall emerge from the crown of the head, its light suffusing the ten directions—all this must be visualized with perfect clarity.

Recite the secret incantation:
*"Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Dao Lord, summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Attendant Envoys of the Left and Right, the Jade Lads who tend the incense, the Jade Maidens who transmit words, the Direct Attendants of the Five Emperors, and the Incense Officials of the Day—thirty-two each—to convey these words. On this auspicious day, in a purified hall during a prolonged fast, practicing the supreme sutra to deliver boundless beings, may these entreaties ascend directly to the august presence of the Most High Primordial Sovereign of the Thirty-Two Heavens."*

Upon completion, draw in qi thirty-two times and face east to recite the sutra.

*The Primordial’s Wondrous Scripture of the Upper Chapters of the Numinous Treasure, the Supreme Scripture for Delivering Innumerable Beings*

The Primordial’s Scripture of Boundless Deliverance, the Uppermost Wondrous Scripture:
Ten cycles deliver beings, the hundred spirits conceal their rhymes; parting and reunion arise naturally, wondrously transforming into Jade Perfected. The lofty and mysterious upper spirits nurture the primordial qi, coalescing the myriad heavens, revealing luminous radiance, and harmonizing yin and yang. As yin and yang transform, the Five Phases advance; cold and heat alternate, and the myriad transformations come into being. The vast and obscure great pattern encompasses all wondrous numbers, cyclically distributing prosperity and decline, each with its ultimate limit.

The ninety-six cycles of yang, when water and fire clash, are called kalpic disasters, wherein creation is wholly undone. When the great kalpa converges, water and fire scour and burn, heaven and earth perish in darkness, and only the Dao endures alone. The Primordial stabilizes and guards, the upper chapters of the Jade Scripture, commanding the numinous destinies of all Perfected and inspecting the various heavens. The stellar lodges divide their degrees, their movements flawless, summoning dragons to bear and block the river sources. The Eastern Well remains unshaken, rivers and seas still their depths; the world is upheld, each with its true spirits.

The sovereigns who guard the world, the exalted ones of great peace, the Five Numinous Elders, the Three Qi Venerables—among them are the Ten Directions’ Great Saints who protect the nation, the Perfected Lords who eternally restrain kalpic disasters and deliver from calamity, who reverse misfortune and disperse woe, preserving the world’s purity. Today, they proclaim this decree as the various heavens descend in attendance.

The Boundless Flying Heavenly Kings Who Preserve the Kalpic Cycle and Extend the World’s Destiny:
- Of the East: the Long-Lived Great Sage Who Delivers Innumerable Beings
- Of the South: the Long-Lived Great Sage Who Delivers Innumerable Beings
- Of the West: the Long-Lived Great Sage Who Delivers Innumerable Beings
- Of the North: the Long-Lived Great Sage Who Delivers Innumerable Beings
- Of the Northeast: the Long-Lived Great Sage Who Delivers Innumerable Beings
- Of the Southeast: the Long-Lived Great Sage Who Delivers Innumerable Beings
- Of the Southwest: the Long-Lived Great Sage Who Delivers Innumerable Beings
- Of the Northwest: the Long-Lived Great Sage Who Delivers Innumerable Beings
- Of the Above: the Long-Lived Great Sage Who Delivers Innumerable Beings
- Of the Below: the Long-Lived Great Sage Who Delivers Innumerable Beings

The Ten Directions’ Perfected Flying Heavenly Kings eternally extend the kalpic cycle, preserving worldly peace, the boundless great spirits. Together, they ride upon auspicious clouds of numinous radiance, jade chariots adorned with emerald canopies and flowered wheels, drawn by jade dragons, attended by guardians who repel evil. They bear the purple-tasseled standards, cloud-brocade divine banners; before them, phoenixes sing in harmonious melodies, behind them, flutes and panpipes blend in chorus. All under heaven rejoice, none fail to exult.

Jade Lads scatter incense, Jade Maidens flank the chariots; the Great Generals Who Pacify Heaven, clad in red armor with ten thousand soldiers, advance together under unified command, escorting the exalted Perfected to deliver from kalpic disasters and extinguish demonic influences. The Orthodox Officers of the Three Origins, the Upper Spirits of the Nine Heavens, the Elders Who Govern Transformations, and the Great Spirits Who Stabilize and Guard—inspecting the cycles of destiny, they memorialize before the Emperor. Where yin and yang stagnate, they respond and resolve; turning the great pivot, they regulate the numinous gates, harmonizing the cycles of adversity.

Water and fire flow and spread, creation arises naturally; surpassing peril, they bring tranquility, cutting off the roots of disaster. Malevolence is annihilated, myriad blessings converge; no discord is permitted, no misfortune invited. The Numinous Treasure’s Jade Script stabilizes and extends the kalpa, bringing peace to rulers and people, enduring for infinite kalpas. Heaven and earth are serene, sun and moon unite in brightness; insects fulfill their natures, and the supreme transformation knows no bounds. The divine Perfected assist in harmony, the world’s destiny endures; their virtue equaling the Dao, their merit returns to the myriad heavens. Transcending the three disasters, their fortune and prosperity remain pure and complete.

The myriad beings abide in non-action, roaming carefree in Great Peace. The mechanism of Great Peace encompasses the Supreme Mystery, the formless realm of Brahman conduct.

The Thirty-Two Heavens, the Thirty-Two Emperors—each heaven conceals its taboos, each heaven veils its names. Within the heavens lies the Hollow Cavern, the natural numinous scripture; each heaven conceals its rhymes, the sounds within the heavens, the honor within the heavens, the spirits within the heavens. Extending kalpas and great demons are the numina within the heavens. Harmonizing the imperial qi, they govern the transformations of the Supreme Clarity, the boundless mysteries too profound to fathom. Spreading the teachings of the Divine Empyrean, they safeguard for endless ages.

Today, rejoicing in the reception of deliverance, passing through the gates of all heavens, they govern the kalpic transformations and preserve worldly peace. Opening and extending the records of eras, the qi’s movement knows no error; uniting with the Great One, they revolve and deliver the Five Phases. Jupiter guards life, Venus presides over completion. Mercury conceals and nurtures, Mars spreads glory. Saturn serves as the central sovereign, the August One circulates throughout. The Azure Spirit stabilizes benevolence, the Radiant Spirit assists righteousness. The Cinnabar Spirit praises ritual, the Mysterious Spirit guards wisdom. The Central Primordial Elder expands and diffuses the harmonizing qi.

The Great Spirit of the Eastern August, sweeping away the demonic influences of wood.
The Perfected of the South, pacifying calamities to their utmost.
The White Emperor Great Spirit, dissolving the weapons of metal.
The Primordial Crystal Great Spirit, uniting and harmonizing virtue.
The Central August Great Spirit, governing the talismanic numina.

The gods of the ten directions and myriad realms, the spirits of all Daoist paths, wielding bells and brandishing halberds, sternly guard in countless thousands. Drumming the net of transformations, they summon and command the divine Perfected. Through kalpas of heaven and earth, they preserve and stabilize without faltering. The Twenty-Eight Constellations resist the four celestial courses; the Central Dipper faces and directs, averting misfortune and opening life. The four seasons revolve in order, cold and heat cycle in turn. Yin and yang alternate, and no monstrous aberrations dare intrude.

When the great kalpa reaches its term, they repel and dispel the thronging disasters. The Five Rivers’ sovereigns, the vast and numinous spirits of the deep, hasten to record and inspect, clearing the watery passages. By the Primordial Beginning’s talismanic decree, none dare delay or linger; they are seized and sent to the Upper Palace, where those condemned are utterly annihilated. Treachery and malevolence lose their qi, demonic chaos is eradicated at its root. The world receives great fortune, the Dao’s transformations become limpid and clear. Eternal blessings and prosperity abound, benevolence and goodness flourish. Universally advancing all wondrous beings, they ascend together to the Upper Palace. Following and upholding the celestial reckoning, they array their reports in the highest heavens.

The Primordial Beginning’s Great Brahman, propelled by the Three Qi, divides and judges the Two Images, establishing the myriad heavens. Spirits and numina spread throughout, creation arises and takes form. In nurturing and fostering, the Five Qi flow; the Six Qi alternate, flourishing and decaying in succession. When the qi’s movement is obstructed, the great kalpa entangles. Destiny has its appointed meetings, bringing disasters of water, fire, and wind. Splendor collapses and perishes, living spirits are extinguished at their root. The deep abysses are desolate, the Three Luminaries conceal their radiance. Good and evil are indistinguishable, misfortune and calamity rush forth.

The Primordial Beginning stabilizes and pacifies, and fortune and virtue arise naturally. The Numinous Scriptures and Great Strategies, the precious records of the Upper Chapters, hasten to summon all heavens and the great gods of the ten directions. Grasping the Mysterious Chart, they endure without end. Encompassing the Dao’s qi, their wondrous efficacy opens and connects. The divine net’s warp and weft, the kalpic turning of the Dharma Wheel, pivot and govern creation, eternally preserving the primordial integrity.

The numinous winds stir and fan, bringing peace to the eight directions. Harmonious qi surges and merges, all auspicious signs converge. Spreading and proclaiming heavenly governance, they present reports to the Supreme Perfected. Within the Perfected dwell the spirits, the Great Lords of Longevity. The Divine Empyrean’s Later Sage, the Azure Flower Emperor Lord. The Eastern Ultimate and Western Terrace, the left and right immortal ministers. Holding talismans and determining decrees, they preserve the subtle and tranquil. Mighty and luminous generals and officers sweep away all wrongs. Above, they serve the Nine Heavens; below, they restrain the Three Disasters. The four quarters and eight regions unite in a single virtue. Filth and defilement are swept away, demons and pestilence are shattered and crushed.

For countless kalpas, wealth and joy abound in tranquility. No treachery is permitted, and the highest goodness renews daily. The loyal and good assist in transformation, uniting with the Dao in brilliance. The Dao treasures preservation and extension, the boundless ford of kalpas. All ghostly thieves are eradicated, wind and fire do not cease. The seas and lands are serene, heaven and earth vast and clear. Blessings reach the hidden depths, the stagnant and benighted ascend; sunken souls are extinguished and confronted, grievances and transgressions are released and resolved.

The pure transformation flows vast and boundless, lauded by all the heavens.
The great sages of the heavens all rejoice and speak in joy.
At its heart lies the "Empty Cavern Hymn and Song," the "Numinous Chapter of the Demon Kings,"
whose words ascend to the loftiest perfected ones.

The first is the "Eternal Melody of the Desire Realm’s Flight through the Void,"
where divine transformations expand in grandeur, and auspicious blessings flourish.
The perverse ways are extinguished, and felicitous omens arrive.
The Dao of Heaven shines brightly, dispelling all demonic mists.
The benevolent and good return to the highest virtue, while the treacherous and wicked plant the roots of evil.
Greed and attachment forget true preservation; the celestial scriptures are misapplied in errant conduct.
Do not let this become a flowering transgression—now is the time to safeguard great peace.
Malevolent demons delight in ruin and decay, harming and exhausting living spirits.
They disturb our realm of purity, their venomous grievances enduring without cease.
The August Jade-Pure King on High bestows upon us the sacred talismanic chapters,
to restrain and govern the long kalpas, ever receiving the supreme merit.

The true wind flows vast and boundless; the world’s fortunes daily rise and prosper.
The "Purple Clarity’s Blessing, the Eternal Talisman of the Cavern-Subtle Heavenly Worthy"
is the "Chapter of the Demon King of the Form Realm, Extending the Kalpa’s Fortune."

The primordial chaos embraces heaven and earth, its course ever-changing.
Yin and yang fall into disorder; calamities block the ford of kalpas.
Wherever the kalpa’s disasters strike, water and fire scour and burn.
The myriad phenomena and three luminaries vanish into darkness, no longer existing.
Yet by the grace of our host of spirits, peace is secured throughout the heavens.
We extend the great cycle, unraveling the roots of disaster.
We regulate the four qi, harmonizing cold and heat.
How could mortals know this and thus enjoy our favor?
Disasters and harms sink and cease; clarity and tranquility arise naturally.
At this time, joy abounds, and protection spans countless ages.
Radiant are all living beings, united as one in truth.
The Emperor’s sacred talismans descend upon mountains and rivers.
Lineages and altars stand serene; great peace is eternally preserved.
Auspicious responses arise from the primordial; our Dao remains eternally revered.
The "Eternal Talisman of the Heavenly Worthy of Myriad Blessings, Extender of Kalpas."

The "Hymn of the Demon King of the Formless Realm, Preserver of the World" says:
Above the Three Heavens, at the origin of the myriad phenomena,
the Primordial August One governs and commands, revered within our realm.
We command and restrain the spirits, safeguarding the roots of heaven.
The Three Disasters are transformed and swept away; the Eight Paths grow clear and bright.
The wheel of kalpas flows without obstruction, following the current of transformation.
We inspect the stellar constellations, each celestial station precisely divided.
By the Emperor’s talisman, we command and restrain the demonic hordes.
Should any dare act with treachery and violence, the sunlight will flare in wrath.
Great peace unfolds in transformation, securely established for eternity.
Ever receiving blessings and fortune, the future remains unshaken.
The mysterious pivot of creation governs from above, seizing the mechanisms of heaven.
If one knows not this Dao, how can they ascend the ladder to perfection?
Do not let the turning of the kalpa’s fortune allow the demonic hordes to unleash their might.
The "True Talisman of the Heavenly Worthy, Protector of the State and Preserver of the World."

These three talismans, cast in bronze or gold, are to be installed above the ruined gates and halls of palaces—most auspicious.
Those who study the Dao wear them upon their person to extend their years, avert disasters, and transcend calamities.
Inscribed in cinnabar on red paper, as prescribed by the rites.

Above these Three Realms, within the flight through the void,
are the hymns and chants of the true demons, their melodies harmonizing with the cavernous chapters.
Receiving them eternally extends the kalpa’s fortune; the imperial destiny flourishes.
Reciting them a hundred times dispels the disasters of the age.
Reciting them a thousand times ensures the demon kings guard the spirits.
After ten thousand recitations, the Dao is complete, and boundless ages of peace ascend.
They preserve and deliver through the kalpa’s transformations, toppling the myriad evils.
Those who hear these numinous melodies find the demon kings reverent in form.
We command the earthly deities, attended by divine spirits.
Ministers and people enjoy well-being, transcending misfortune and disaster.
Great blessings and fortune arrive without exception.
This is called the boundless, preserving and delivering without end.
These are the secret celestial texts, revered by all the heavens.
To leak or profane them is to fall into hell, bringing calamity upon seven generations of ancestors.

The Dao says: These two chapters are the hidden melodies of the Heavenly Emperors and the numinous demon kings,
all spoken in the great Brahma’s tongue, upholding the kalpa’s fortune, guarding the world and bestowing blessings,
summoning the perfected and drawing the divine, benefiting the people and pacifying the state.
Their words lack ornate rhythm; their tunes lack florid embellishment.
Thus they are called profound and obscure, difficult to fathom in detail.
They are treasured by the heavens, secreted within the Divine Empyrean’s Jade-Pure Jade Treasury,
the scriptorium’s resplendent halls, transmitted once every sixty thousand kalpas in accordance with the turning of the age.
Only if a perfected one offers the inner treasure of a sincere heart,
and follows the ancient rites to pledge allegiance to the Nine Heavens,
are they then entrusted with these texts.

The Dao says: The revolutions of heaven and earth also have their ends.
The sun, moon, and five planets also wax and wane.
The reckoning of kalpas and the fortunes of the age also shorten and extend.
Even the sagest and most divine of beings also have their flourishing and decline.
Those of shallow learning also suffer illness and harm.
Whenever such disasters arise, all of like mind should gather to perform the fast,
burn incense in the six periods, and recite the scriptures ten times.
Virtue and blessings will descend at once, dispelling all inauspicious omens.
These boundless texts universally deliver without end.

The Dao says: Those of shallow Daoist learning, whose immortal rank is yet unfulfilled,
whose destined time of extinction approaches, and whose bodily kalpa nears its end,
whose spirit passes through the Great Yin—
at the hour of their passing, fellow students and perfected ones should burn incense on their behalf
and recite the scriptures ten times to deliver their corporeal form,
following the method of the Five Refinements to animate the corpse.
Their hun-souls will then ascend directly to the Southern Palace,
where their names are recorded in the Heavenly Mechanism’s Mysterious Register.
According to the merit of their studies, they will be reborn after a calculated number of days.
Unconfused by the turning of the wheel, they will attain the rank of immortals.

The Dao says: When the revolutions of heaven and earth reach their end, one should perform the fast,
burn incense, and recite the scriptures.
When the stellar stations fall into disorder and the sun and moon lose their proper times,
one should perform the fast, burn incense, and recite the scriptures.
When the four seasons lose their proper order and yin and yang fall out of harmony,
one should perform the fast, burn incense, and recite the scriptures.
When great or small kalpas end, the Five Movements shift, and the age’s fortunes extend,
one should perform the fast, burn incense, and recite the scriptures.
When pestilence spreads and the multitudes perish,
one should perform the fast, burn incense, and recite the scriptures.
When the harvests fail,
one should perform the fast, burn incense, and recite the scriptures.

The merit of fasting, maintaining precepts, and reciting scriptures is most weighty.
Above, it dispels celestial disasters and secures the protection of the emperor.
Below, it wards off poison and harm, delivering the multitudes.
In life and death, all rely upon it; its blessings are beyond measure.
Thus it is called boundless, universally delivering heaven and humanity.

The Dao says: Whoever possesses these scriptures can perform these meritorious deeds
for the sake of the Lord of Heaven and Earth, the Emperor, and the multitudes.

When disasters arise, if one resolves in the heart to perform the fast, burn incense, and recite the scriptures ten times, all the heavens record their name, and ten thousand spirits stand guard. Those of exceptional attainment may thereby become ministers of the Golden Gates of the Sage Lord. The heavens record each person’s merits and transgressions with unfailing precision, down to the finest detail. Even the demon kings of heaven will protect and recommend them. Those who attain the Dao shall fully comprehend these profound words.

Within the heavens, the Great Brahma’s hidden speech resounds in boundless tones. The *Dao Lord* composed the *Primordial Numinous Writ of Everlasting Kalpas, the Jade Chapters for Protecting the World and Ensuring Great Peace*.

**The Eight Heavens of the East:**
Yu Luo stands lofty, transforming through mysterious workings.
Chronicles trace the threads of the world, moved by compassion in the Palace of Mercy.

Prayers and sacrifices meet their needs, jade and stones gather in hidden depths.

Deserts extend to distant halls, striking the spirit’s core with power.

**The Eight Heavens of the West:**

Embracing the linked ruins, the Dark Mystery awakens in profound realization.

Life’s grace is named compassion, striking poison and banishing wrong.
Following the self, one receives blessings, heaven gathers and advances the subtle.
The distant cord is firmly bound, woven baskets peer into the distant.
Glory’s end brings no sorrow, taboos yield to revelation and bestowal.

The Dao says: Within these heavens, the Great Brahma’s hidden speech resounds in boundless tones. The ancient script was each a *zhang* in length, but the Heavenly Perfected inscribed its words upon cinnabar-jade tablets, establishing the correct pronunciation. These were displayed upon the terraces and gates, as well as in the halls of the Grand Tenuity and Purple Tenuity, to govern the great and small kalpas, the cycles of the world, and the disasters of water and fire, restoring harmony and dispelling misfortune.

Those who know these sounds and perform the fast while reciting them will have the heavens dispatch flying spirit-kings to descend and observe them, recording their meritorious diligence. This is reported to the heavens, where ten thousand spirits pay homage, earthly deities stand at the gates, and the Great Merit Realized Kings recommend them as perfected immortals. Once their Dao is complete, they may wander the Three Realms and ascend through the Golden Gates.

These sounds repel all, ward off all, deliver all, and accomplish all— they are the heavens’ spontaneous, natural tones. Thus, reciting them summons flying spirits to descend in observation, the Celestial Thearch chants from afar, ten thousand spirits pay homage, the Three Realms attend in reverence, all demons bow their heads, ghostly essences vanish of themselves, jade-like chimes resound, the ten directions grow solemn and clear, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks swallow their mists, all spirits tremble and submit, immortals gather in assembly, the heavens are free of impurity, the earth is cleansed of demonic dust, dark wisdom shines in clarity, and the vastness of the mysterious abides in profundity.

The *Supreme Wondrous Scripture of the Numinous Treasure, the Limitless Deliverance of Humanity*, Scroll Four, concludes.
Scroll Five begins.

**The Chapter on Dispelling Calamities and Warding Off Misfortunes for Lords, Kings, and Feudal Lords of the World**

The Dao spoke: In ancient times, within the tranquil and blessed heavens, at the Great Realm of Peace and Splendor, the Jade Radiance of Serene Florescence, the *Primordial Beginning’s Scripture on the Limitless Deliverance of Humanity: The Supreme Wondrous Chapter on Dispelling Calamities and Warding Off Misfortunes for Lords, Kings, and Feudal Lords of the World* was received.

As the Primordial Celestial Worthy was about to expound this scripture, he circumambulated ten times to summon the ten directions, and only then ascended his seat. The celestial perfected, the lofty sages, the radiant treasure perfected ones, the celestial immortal kings, the lords of the Great Ultimate, the left and right immortal ministers, the divine officials and spirit officers—an immeasurable host—arrived borne upon the void. Their jeweled steeds and celestial horses, their cloud chariots with trailing canopies, cast forth resplendent light; their luminous canopies gleamed afloat, their golden wheels flew in motion, the five clouds intermingled in radiance, their attendants arrayed like stars, the nine numina unfolded auspicious signs, and the eight directions shone in clarity. For seven days and seven nights, the myriad heavens and the Three Realms, the domains of immortals and perfected beings, rejoiced as one. The host of perfected ones harmonized their virtue, humans and celestials enjoyed health and longevity, disasters and misfortunes were dispelled, and all reveled in great peace.

The lands of the myriad heavens, their mountains and rivers, forests and trees, were leveled as one, no longer distinguished by high or low. The earth transformed into yellow jade, without variation in hue. As the host of perfected ones attended in assembly, the Primordial Celestial Worthy sat in profound stillness upon the Ninefold Radiance of the Jeweled Lotus of Supreme Harmony, the jasper dragon afloat in the void.

When the scripture was recited once, the great sages of the myriad heavens voiced their approval in unison. At that moment, throughout all lands under heaven, the winds and transformations grew serene and clear. When recited a second time, no inauspicious influences arose. When recited a third time, the seasons harmonized in peace. When recited a fourth time, the stars and planets followed their proper courses, and the sun and moon shone with constant brightness. When recited a fifth time, the five grains flourished abundantly, without famine or misfortune. When recited a sixth time, the people preserved authenticity and cast aside falsity, free from covetous desires. When recited a seventh time, the people’s virtue returned to benevolence, and they enjoyed enduring prosperity and health. When recited an eighth time, the true Dao flowed freely, and all beings fulfilled their natures. When recited a ninth time, kings and emperors extended their longevity by ten thousand years. When recited a tenth time, heaven and humanity rejoiced as one, and blessings endured without end.

At that time, every man and woman in the land turned their hearts in devotion, all received protection and deliverance, and each attained longevity. The Dao spoke: As the Primordial Celestial Worthy recited the scripture once, the Boundless Great Sage of the East, the Great Spirit of Dispelling Disasters, arrived with an immeasurable host, afloat in the void. When recited a second time, the Boundless Great Sage of the South, the Great Spirit of Warding Off Misfortunes, arrived with an immeasurable host, afloat in the void. When recited a third time, the Boundless Great Sage of the West, the Great Spirit of Dispersing Calamities, arrived with an immeasurable host, afloat in the void. When recited a fourth time, the Boundless Great Sage of the North, the Great Spirit of Eliminating Afflictions, arrived with an immeasurable host, afloat in the void. When recited a fifth time, the Boundless Great Sage of the Northeast, the Great Spirit of Eradicating Ugliness, arrived with an immeasurable host, afloat in the void. When recited a sixth time, the Boundless Great Sage of the Southeast, the Great Spirit of Suppressing Evil, arrived with an immeasurable host, afloat in the void. When recited a seventh time, the Boundless Great Sage of the Southwest, the Great Spirit of Scouring Filth, arrived with an immeasurable host, afloat in the void. When recited an eighth time, the Boundless Great Sage of the Northwest, the Great Spirit of Punishing Deviance, arrived with an immeasurable host, afloat in the void. When recited a ninth time, the Boundless Great Sage of the Upper Realm, the Great Spirit of Annihilating Pestilence, arrived with an immeasurable host, afloat in the void. When recited a tenth time, the Boundless Great Sage of the Lower Realm, the Great Spirit of Subduing Demons, arrived with an immeasurable host, afloat in the void.

After the ten recitations were complete, the true great spirits of the ten directions, the boundless ones who dispel calamities and ward off misfortunes for the lands of the world, arrived as one. The lands of the myriad heavens, their rulers, ministers, and multitudes of people, turned their hearts in reverence. They came like clouds converging and mists gathering—an immeasurable host—filling half the land, causing the earth to sink unevenly, beyond all restraint.

Thereupon, the Primordial Beginning transformed a divine pearl, vast as the sun, its radiance congealed and luminous, ascending and descending, lingering in the great void. The Primordial One drew them in, its effulgent rays extending to all. The celestial perfected, the lofty sages, the radiant treasure perfected ones, the lords and ministers of the boundless lands of the ten directions, the immeasurable host of great spirits who dispel calamities and ward off misfortunes for the lands of the world—all entered the divine pearl. From below, the celestials and humans gazed upward, seeing only the lords, ministers, and multitudes of the myriad lands, along with the great spirits who dispel calamities and ward off misfortunes, swiftly entering through the effulgent rays. Once within, their whereabouts were unknown. The people dispersed, the land returned to levelness, and the uneven sinking ceased.

Within the divine pearl, the Primordial Celestial Worthy completed the recitation of the scripture in full. The host of perfected ones oversaw the deliverance and transmitted it to me. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words. When the ritual was roughly concluded, the myriad heavens returned to their stations, and in an instant, all was silent, without lingering resonance.

At that time, the celestials and humans who encountered the scriptural Dharma were universally delivered, their allotted years preserved intact, free from harm. The lands were at peace, all prospered and flourished. There was no strife, no contention, no illness, no injury, no punishment, no killing, no encroachment, no theft, no premature death, no mutilation. Above and below shared a single virtue, preserving the harmony of the Great Peace. They were united in compassion and love, and even those of different lineages became kin. The land was secure, the people abundant, and all rejoiced in great peace. From the scripture’s first promulgation, the myriad lands followed the Dao. Those who had cultivated utmost sincerity, revered and upheld it with devotion, all attained deliverance across the ages.

The Dao spoke: The words uttered by the Primordial Celestial Worthy in the recitation of this scripture are the hidden, resonant tones of the inner names of the Celestial Thearchs of the myriad heavens, as well as the concealed names of the true kings and the hidden appellations of the hundred spirits. Within the lands of the ten directions, if the lords, kings, and feudal rulers wish to perpetuate their hereditary lines, safeguard their territories, prevent the rise of warfare, avert floods and droughts, quell banditry, ensure the people’s abundance, and secure the prosperity of the times and the flourishing of all things, they must establish and display the *True Writ for Dispelling Calamities and Warding Off Misfortunes for the Lands of the Five Directions*.

Those who wear and receive it shall summon blessings and auspiciousness. The talismans for pacifying the realm are established through altar rites and offerings. Chanting this divine writ dispels calamities and averts misfortunes, ensuring the preservation of great peace—words not of this mundane world. The perfected sages have already attained it; true persons fathom its mysteries and delve into its subtleties. Those who master its verses and recite them ten times shall hear the distant echoes of the myriad heavens, and the lands of the world shall flourish afar. Disasters and illnesses shall be eradicated, floods and fires pacified, governance and education perfected, Dao and virtue equally exalted. Blessings shall descend in abundance, and all people and things shall thrive in harmony.

Scholars of the highest learning who recite it ten times shall harmonize heaven and earth, moving the spirits to respond. The warp and weft of cosmic order shall align in sequence, and the workings of creation shall bring forth life. The dynastic mandate shall endure, and auspicious signs shall multiply daily. The reason for this is that once the world’s impurities are dispelled and the qi of the Dao returns to purity, the wondrous model summons and commands the majestic spirits, safeguarding the times and seasons, warding off misfortune without fail, and preserving the ultimate governance. Yet this is but non-action, and no further anxieties remain.

Those who recite these verses lightly shall bring misfortune upon themselves. Those who honor and revere it with devotion shall see their states prosper, their eras flourish, and their lands thrive. Bound to good karmic causes, they shall be untouched by the ten thousand calamities, and divine protectors shall guard their gates. This scripture is most venerable and wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital. It dispels all manner of calamities and auspices, serving as the root of the ten thousand Daoist teachings. Its majestic model is vast, and its virtue beyond measure.

The Dao spoke: When this scripture is recited ten times, the myriad heavens shall gather in unison. Across the billions of kingdoms, the lords, kings, and feudal rulers of the world shall all receive the mysterious transformation, universally partaking in the grace of the Dao. They shall nurture all beings, and their virtuous influence shall spread evenly, silently transforming bandits and thieves. Thus, treachery shall vanish, harmonious qi shall flourish, and purity and spontaneity shall prevail. Blessed with radiant fortune, they shall align with the Jade Perfected.

Scholars of the highest learning who cultivate and recite this scripture shall all be able to dispel harms and calamities for their states, summoning auspicious signs. Those who recite it in the world shall safeguard their families and nations above, and below, they shall be free from personal misfortunes, forever loyal and filial, extending their years and enjoying longevity. Thereafter, they shall undergo refinement and transformation, transcending the depths of suffering, returning to their original essence, and ascending as immortals to roam and feast in the Great Clarity. This scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally delivering boundless beings. All heavenly and mortal beings shall receive its blessings, and immeasurable fortune shall grace the lands of the world.

This treasure of the heavens is not transmitted to the lower world. Only the most devoted scholars, offering gold and treasures to pledge their sincerity and swear oaths before heaven, may receive it. Those who lightly divulge or disrespect it shall bring calamity upon nine generations, consigning them to eternal servitude in the dark realms. The Five Thearchs shall assign twenty-four Jade Lads and twenty-four Jade Maidens to attend the divine writ, protecting those who receive the scripture.

The Dao spoke: During the long fast of the first month, recite this scripture to dispel and pacify calamities for the lords, kings, and feudal rulers of the world, rectifying the disharmonies of heaven and earth, yin and yang, that give rise to disasters. During the long fast of the seventh month, recite this scripture to dispel and pacify the transgressions of inauspicious conjunctions of the sun, moon, and stars that descend upon the palaces of the lords, kings, and feudal rulers, wielding its wondrous efficacy to ensure that heaven’s mandate does not end. During the long fast of the tenth month, recite this scripture to dispel and pacify calamities for the lords, kings, and feudal rulers of the world, extending their reigns, summoning immortals and perfected beings, stabilizing their dynastic mandates, and preserving the eternal endurance of heaven. Thus, their lineages shall never be severed, and they shall forever rule as sovereigns, pacifying their domains and bringing their people to proclaim great peace.

On the days of the eight seasonal nodes, recite this scripture to bestow divine blessings and spread protection over the common people. On one’s own life-destiny day, recite this scripture to dispel calamities and misfortunes, safeguarding the body’s three fields, eight luminous spirits, nine palaces, joints, and passages, the numinous spirits of the viscera, and the hundred deities that weave through the entire form. The register of life shall remain unshaken, and the scripture shall pacify and dispel calamities from the lands of the world, preserving the myriad things in shared prosperity. Honoring the supreme merit, the sagely virtue shall shine equally, the three realms shall serve as guardians, the Five Thearchs shall oversee the reception, and the ten thousand spirits shall pay homage. One’s name shall be inscribed in the heavens, and upon the fulfillment of merit and virtue, one shall ascend to the Great Clarity.

The Dao spoke: On the days of practicing the Dao, one must bathe in fragrant waters, enter the chamber in purity, face east, and knock the teeth thirty-two times to ascend to the thirty-two heavens. Bow thirty-two times with utmost sincerity. Close the eyes and silently visualize oneself seated amidst clouds of blue, yellow, and white qi, enveloped within and without in misty obscurity. A blue dragon, white tiger, vermilion bird, dark warrior, lion, and white crane shall array themselves to the left and right. The sun and moon shall illuminate the chamber with radiant brilliance, and a circular halo shall emanate from the crown of the head, casting light in the ten directions—all vividly clear.

Recite the secret incantation:
*"Supreme Mystery and Primordial One, Supreme Dao Lord, summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the attendants of the left and right, the Jade Lads who tend the incense, the Jade Maidens who transmit words, the direct talismans of the Five Thearchs, and the thirty-two officials of the incense altars for the day. Open the gates to relay these words. Today is an auspicious day, a time of long fasting in the pure hall, of cultivating the supreme scripture, the boundless deliverance of beings. May these words ascend swiftly to the presence of the Most High, the Primordial Celestial Worthy of the Thirty-Two Heavens."*

Conclude by drawing qi thirty-two times, then face east and recite the scripture:

*The Supreme Primordial Wondrous Scripture of Boundless Deliverance*
*The Supreme Cavernous Mystery, Numinous Treasure Root Chapter for Dispelling Calamities and Pacifying Auspices for the Lords, Kings, and Feudal Rulers of the World, Supreme Wondrous Beginning*
*Ten recitations deliver beings; the hundred spirits’ hidden resonances unite and part by nature.*
*The jade texts of the five qi, the wondrous roots of the three heavens.*
*At the dawn of chaos, the divine perfected were moved to respond.*
*They ordained the ten thousand images and shaped the myriad things.*
*Radiant splendor spreads its brilliance, merging with the Dao in luminosity.*
*They govern the three realms and weave through the eight directions,*
*The domains of states and lands, the celestial lords, kings, and feudal rulers,*
*Each ruling their realms, all revered by the Supreme Mystery.*
*Governance and virtuous transformation emulate and exalt this.*
*The mechanisms of movement and stillness manifest blessings and calamities.*
*Goodness summons fortune; evil bequeaths misfortune.*
*In profound union with the subtle and formless, the heavens’ fortune flourishes.*
*This wondrous model resides in the Golden Writ of the August Ultimate, pervading the qi of the primordial pattern.*
*It gathers and records the spirit-kings,*
*Examining and verifying fortunes and misfortunes, assembling in the Jade Hall,*
*The left and right mysterious terraces, the cinnabar numinous cloud chambers.*

They examine adversity and obstruction, dissolving and dispelling them with the flow of qi,
Unfolding and overflowing with the Great Harmony, circling and lingering in its midst.
Within resides the Bureau of Supreme Transformation and Preservation,
Within resides the Supreme Perfected, the Twin August Ones of the Grand Tenuity,
Within reside the Five Elders who repel calamity and avert wrongdoing,
Within resides the Dao-Ancestor, the Great One, the Celestial Perfected,
Within reside the Nine Numinous Ones, the Primordial Spirits of Wondrous Mystery,
All grasping the pivotal mechanisms.

Above the Three Heavens, the Jade Emperor’s mysterious abode,
Contains the chapters for dispelling and warding off the world’s calamities,
The *Eightfold Radiance’s* jade scriptures, their phrases matching the lofty Perfected.

**First: The Chapter for Protecting and Securing the Lord of the State, the Flying Air’s Sound**
The pure net’s divine mounds receive the records of the Purple Emperor.

**Second: The Chapter for Dispelling and Warding Off the Calamities of Kings and Lords**

Lofty and towering, the various heavens all establish lords and kings.
Assisting in defense are billions and thousands, together rectifying the grand principles.
Extending below to the human world, they emulate the lofty vault.
Vast and numerous, the myriad kinds, their merit归于 the emperor.

Roaming the vast heavens, wherever they go, fortune and prosperity.
Revolving the divine above the scene, eternally dwelling in the Purple Court.

The Third Song for Dispelling and Averting Disasters in the World’s Lands Proclaims:

Above arrayed the Nine Heavens, below divided the Nine Abysses.
Vast and boundless the Dao’s radiance, its warp and weft without limit.
Revolving the primordial net, it fixes the realm within.
Once the nation’s borders are rectified, the imperial ultimate abides in honor.
The three realms of the forest of phenomena securely anchor the Five Mountains.
The emperor dwells in the Divine Continent, governing the myriad spirits.

Should disasters arise, they are averted with jade scriptures.
The eight mystic tones, sixty-four chapters,
Penetrate heaven and earth, intertwining the six qi.
Sweeping away inauspicious filth, memorials ascend to the Supreme Mystery.
Preserving and securing grand peace, the Three Realms rest in tranquility.

The Supreme Dao is originally formless, its divine wonders transmissible.
Its profound virtue blankets all existence; we bow our heads to the Divine Empyrean scriptures.
Here above the Three Realms, amid the flying void,
The True Kings’ song resounds, its notes harmonizing with the cavernous chapters.
Recite it a hundred times, and the Four Seas unite in harmony.
Recite it a thousand times, and the people transform in timely concord.
Ten thousand recitations perfect the Dao, the world’s fortune endless,
Transcending the Three Realms, virtue and merit flourish in majesty.

Those who hear the numinous tones may seal mountains and summon spirits,
Command earth deities, escort and receive with attendants,
Safeguard the nation’s lands, universally deliver all beings.
This is called boundless, delivering multitudes across kalpas.
The secret celestial scriptures, revered by all heavens—
Should one recklessly disclose them, they fall into hell,
Calamity extending to seven generations of ancestors.

The Dao declares: These two chapters are the hidden tones of the Heavenly Thearchs
and the Divine Empyrean True Kings.
They eliminate all disasters within the lands of kings, princes, and lords,
Repel misfortune, avert warfare, famine, locusts, drought,
Floods, pestilence, unseasonable frost, thunder, lightning,
Violent storms, and all strange anomalies.
They ensure the world’s lands endure, lineages flourish,
Suppress demonic forces, summon harmonious qi—
All are the words of the Great Brahma, not common speech of the mortal realm.
Their words lack ornate beauty, their melodies lack florid grace,
Thus they are called profound and obscure, difficult to fathom.

Treasured by heaven, they are secretly stored in the eastern chamber of the Divine Empyrean Jade Clarity King’s Palace,
Transmitted downward in accordance with the cyclical signs *ding*, *ren*, and *chen*.
Should a perfected one offer gold and treasures with sincere heart,
Following the old rites to pledge allegiance to the Ten Heavens,
Only then shall they be bestowed.

The Dao declares: The revolutions of heaven and earth also know decline.
The sun, moon, and five planets also wax and wane.
Even the most sagely and divine may know prosperity and adversity.
The lesser learned may also suffer affliction and harm.

When such calamities arise, all of like qi must unite in heart to perform purification rites, burn incense in the six periods, and recite the scriptures ten times through—whereupon blessings and virtue shall descend at once, dispelling all inauspicious omens. The boundless scriptures universally deliver infinite beings.

The Dao declares: Should the lesser learned possess shallow attainment in the Dao, or their immortal rank remain unfulfilled, and they encounter calamity in the course of their destiny, facing peril and collapse, they need only concentrate their minds to burn incense and recite the scriptures ten times through. Thereby shall they traverse their trials and tribulations, ascending in rank according to their merit, reckoned by the day. They shall avoid divine trials and swiftly ascend to join the ranks of immortals.

The Dao declares: When the revolutions of heaven and earth reach their end, the stellar lodges fall into disarray, the sun and moon lose their radiance, the four seasons lose their order, yin and yang fall out of harmony, and the realm suffers calamities and portents. Epidemics and poisons spread, the people perish in great numbers, masters and companions pass away—then, outside the gates of the capital, one must erect altars of the Five Directions. At the site of the calamity, facing toward its location, one shall display the True Writs of the Five Directions, burn incense in the six periods, offer praises and recitations, and submit memorials to present petitions, summoning the true numina. The heavens shall then dispatch the Ten Great Divine Generals of the World to Consummate and Dispel Calamities, who shall descend as one, driving away disasters, severing and slaying demonic spirits. The world shall know peace, and the Five Fortunes shall arrive in abundance.

The merit of purification rites and scripture recitation is most profound: above, it dispels celestial calamities and safeguards the emperor; below, it averts poisonous harms and delivers the people. From life to death, all depend upon it—its blessings are beyond measure. Thus it is called boundless, universally delivering heaven and humanity.

The Dao declares: Whoever possesses these scriptures and performs these meritorious deeds for the Lord of Heaven and Earth, the Emperor, and the people—on the day of calamity, should they resolve to perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures ten times through—all the heavens shall record their names, and the myriad spirits shall attend and protect them. Those of exceptional attainment shall become true ministers of the Jade Treasury of the King. The heavens record the merits and transgressions of people without the slightest error. The True King of Heaven shall also safeguard and promote their persons. Those who attain the Dao shall thereby thoroughly comprehend the most profound teachings.

The boundless hidden language of the Great Brahma in the heavens—
Composed by the Dao Lord,
*The Jade Chapters of the Primordial Beginning on Consummating and Dispelling the Calamities and Fortunes of Lords, Kings, and Marquises of the World*
The Eight Heavens of the Eastern Direction.

The Radiant Position of Śītā, with distant forests joining in song.
Distinguishing the cage’s utmost grasp, Wei Xun’s vast abundance.
The hook’s white fierce uplift, Han Yuan’s competitive splendor.
Pervasive mists command talismans, horizontal aid to the scriptural sands.
The liquid of Ji awaits Qin’s encampment, the halted marquis gathers the rivers.
No barrier hastens the feast, parted clouds lave the waves.
The ramparts of compassion bequeath brightness, light expands the hidden net.
The proper conduct of the Brahmā-dragon, the celestial mechanism of jade streams.

**Southern Direction, Eight Heavens**
The starry palace’s primordial foundation, traversing the flourishing edge.
Revolving and casting at the Gate of Congratulations, the Nine Peaks uphold heaven.
Transforming directly to occupy the palace, the trustworthy emperor’s carefree authority.
Casually returning to pour into the flask, the radiant fortune of the jade sphere.
Bing manifests to guard the marsh, Pingyao bends in connection.
Celebration eternally soars on post-horses, the immortal of flowing branches and mysteries.
Sweeping the region’s scriptural structures, jade constructs hasten to firmness.
Chen and Dong cannot sustain it, the fierce oak merges the fields.

**Western Direction, Eight Heavens**
The Sword Yi’s true court, linked ridges of swift crystal.
Transforming the plain to the Śāla terrace, governing the distinct to dissolve spirits.
The divination chamber locks the frontier, soaring and alighting to secure the latch.
Shading the ends of mountain peaks, Wen bestows the offering of Ding.
Extending the sincere and humble, the ancestral hall of Lou decides the campaign.
Ancestral judgments and younger disciples, auspicious reliance on cultured tranquility.
Frequent Feng’s winding springs, the example of Su’s clouded city.
The primordial covers the vortex’s origin, rescuing compassion to raise the lotus.

**Northern Direction, Eight Heavens**
Crimson silks welcome the talisman, the Pivot Star’s northern chart.
Investigating the continuous and dense incantations, the infant’s sequence entwines the pillar.
Gou and Li in the silent bureau, the moon’s threads spread and weave.
The first tinkling congeals the record, the distant reed-pipe shepherds the ranks.
Rosy clouds overflow with distant gazing, commands distinguish the generals and spirits.
Carving and congealing the edict to completion, strength proclaims solid wholeness.
Recording the Brahmā’s vast retribution, the netherworld’s scrutiny enriches the mysterious.
The subtle and imperceptible, awakening the kiln’s wheel of thorns.

The Dao states: Within these heavens, the Great Brahmā’s hidden language resounds with boundless tones. The ancient script, concealed within the Nine Heavens’ Jade Gates, descends in accord with the turning of the kalpa to dispel and avert calamities and pestilence from the lands of the world below. Each character spans a full *zhang* in height, inscribed long ago by the Heavenly Perfected and August Ones to establish the correct pronunciation. Those who know these sounds and can purify themselves to recite them shall have all the heavens dispatch spirit-messengers on flying chariots to descend and observe their persons, recording their meritorious diligence to be reported above. The myriad spirits shall pay homage, earth deities attend at their gates, and the True Kings of the Four Poles shall safeguard and recommend them for ascent. When their Dao is complete and they attain mastery, they may wander the Three Realms and ascend through the Golden Gate.

These sounds repel all, avert all, deliver all, and accomplish all—such is the spontaneous sound of the Heavenly Perfected. Thus, reciting them summons flying immortals to descend and observe, the Supreme Emperor to chant from afar, the myriad spirits to pay homage, the Three Realms to attend at their chariots, the host of demons to bow their heads, and ghostly essences to vanish of themselves. The chiming of jade pendants resounds, the Ten Directions grow solemn and clear, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks swallow their mists, the myriad numina tremble and submit, and immortals are gathered in assembly. The heavens are free of defilement, the earth devoid of demonic dust. Profound wisdom illumines the pure, and the vastness of the mysterious attains its ultimate profundity.

The Supreme Five Directions’ True Writings, along with the talismanic commands for lords, kings, and marquises to dispel and avert calamities and fortunes, are appended below.

**Eastern Direction’s True Writing**
**Southern Direction’s True Writing**

**Western Direction’s True Writing**
**Northern Direction’s True Writing**
**Central Direction’s True Writing**
**Talisman for the Lord of the State**
**Talisman for the King**
**Talisman for the Marquises**

The talismans on the right stabilize the realm and dispel calamities. Inscribe them in the dominant color of the season upon green silk, and store them in a crimson pouch. Offer incense, bow three times, and wear them for auspiciousness. Burying one in the earth-altar yields even greater efficacy.

*The Supreme and Limitless Scripture on Salvation of the Highest Grade, Scroll Five* **Ends Here**

**Scroll Six**
*The Divine Transformations of the Great One: The Five Blessings for Protecting the State and Averting War*

The Dao speaks: Long ago, in the Azure Heavens of the Beginning, amidst the vast emptiness of the Blue Firmament, in the Great Floating Li Land, the Primordial Beginning received the wondrous scripture of the *Divine Transformations of the Great One for Salvation*. As the Celestial Worthy of the Primordial Beginning was about to expound this scripture, he circled ten times to summon the Ten Directions, and only then ascended his seat.

Heavenly Perfected Spirits, Supreme Sages, Exalted Worthies, Perfected Ones of Wondrous Conduct, the True Lords of the Three Primes and the Great One, the Nine Palaces and Eight Scribes, the Divine Charts and Jade Boards, and an innumerable host arrived upon the void. Ninefold radiance suffused their chariots; purple auroras bore forth orchid incense; green mists wafted fragrance; vermilion phoenixes drew cloud-borne carriages; ranks of dragon steeds followed; carved wheels bore layered canopies; jade ornaments cast congealed splendor; embroidered hues vied in brilliance; immortal clouds displayed their beauty; and the Eight Poles were illumined throughout.

For nine days and nine nights, the divine peaks of all heavens stilled their numinous winds, sweeping away the slightest obscurity, clearing the vast expanse of the seas, and revealing the Great Harmony. The land, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees of the realm were equally suffused with fragrant moisture; azure mists coiled and receded; all was surveyed in boundless emptiness, and wondrous light merged into one hue.

The assembled Perfected Ones attended the Celestial Worthy of the Primordial Beginning, who sat in profound stillness upon the Jade Capital of the Void, the Golden Beam of the Eight Winds, the Floating Terrace of Cloud Pearls, the Curved Dawn of Ten Thousand Dragons, the Seat of Heavenly Virtue. As he expounded the scripture once, the Great Saints of all heavens simultaneously proclaimed its excellence.

At that time, the womb of chaos nurtured form from formlessness.
As he expounded the scripture a second time, the Great One was conceived, resembling a lotus bud.
A third recitation: it unfolded its petals, and true qi flowed forth like a rainbow.
A fourth recitation: nine-colored cloud-sprouts burst forth, their hooks forming armor.
A fifth recitation: the Great One dwelled at the center, encircled by the Eight Effulgences.
A sixth recitation: the mysterious liquid flourished in unison, and primordial qi inwardly sustained it.
A seventh recitation: the celestial infant opened its seven apertures, awakening to clarity and sound.
An eighth recitation: humans and beings emerged from the womb, and the Great One gazed upward.
A ninth recitation: the Great One took its first steps, circling through the Nine Palaces.
A tenth recitation: its body was clad in brocade robes, and it held a jade celestial chart.

At that moment, all men and women of the realm, beholding the Celestial Worthy and witnessing the divine transformations of the Great One’s Dao-mysteries, received the descent of the Primordial Clan’s blessings for salvation. Those who inwardly believed and sincerely submitted were all granted deliverance and protection, attaining long life.

The Dao speaks: As the Celestial Worthy of the Primordial Beginning expounded the scripture once, the True Lord of the Three Primes and the Great One of the Eastern Direction, Celebrating Life, arrived with an innumerable host upon the void.
A second recitation: the True Lord of the Three Primes and the Great One of the Southern Direction, Vast Illumination, arrived with an innumerable host upon the void.
A third recitation: the True Lord of the Three Primes and the Great One of the Western Direction, Divine Tiger, arrived with an innumerable host upon the void.
A fourth recitation: the True Lord of the Three Primes and the Great One of the Northern Direction, Concealing the Dao, arrived with an innumerable host upon the void.
A fifth recitation: the True Lord of the Three Primes and the Great One of the Northeast, Ghostly Strategist, arrived with an innumerable host upon the void.
A sixth recitation: the True Lord of the Three Primes and the Great One of the Southeast, Original Birth, arrived with an innumerable host upon the void.
A seventh recitation: the True Lord of the Three Primes and the Great One of the Southwest, Earth Mother, arrived with an innumerable host upon the void.
An eighth recitation: the True Lord of the Three Primes and the Great One of the Northwest, Great Elder, arrived with an innumerable host upon the void.
A ninth recitation: the True Lord of the Three Primes and the Great One of the Upper Direction, Heavenly Wailing, arrived with an innumerable host upon the void.
A tenth recitation: the True Lord of the Three Primes and the Great One of the Lower Direction, Earth’s Teeth, arrived with an innumerable host upon the void.

After ten recitations were completed, the True Lords of the Three Primes and the Great One of the Ten Directions, with their innumerable hosts, arrived simultaneously. All men and women of the realm turned their hearts in reverence.

Those who came were led by the True Lords of the Great One of the Nine Palaces of the Upper Prime, the Nine Palaces of the Middle Prime, and the Nine Palaces of the Lower Prime. Each of the Three Primes’ Nine Palaces of the Great One transformed into three palaces, and within those three palaces, they further transformed into nine palaces. Within each of the nine palaces, nine palaces were again transformed—nine times nine, each yielding eighty-one palaces—with the Great One dwelling at the center.

The Great Ones of the Ten Directions cast forth their radiance to save humanity, and all the heaven-dwellers hastened to the Primordial Beginning to behold and hear the Great Dharma. Their numbers were incalculable. The attending True Lords of the Three Primes and the Great One filled the realm like clouds crowding the sea; the sacred land trembled, the celestial towers swayed, and boundless radiance blazed forth, irresistible.

Then, without rising from his seat, the Primordial Beginning grasped the Jade Net, seized the Great Dipper, and suddenly let it fall from the void. Heaven-dwellers gazed from afar as the canopy of flowers gleamed brilliantly, myriad treasures intertwined. Only the Dipper’s mouth and the Primordial Dipper were seen descending through the void; the Six Stars shone resplendent amidst the azure radiance, their golden hues round and luminous, glowing like a great conflagration.

Within it sat the Supreme Perfected Lord upon a golden couch and jade canopy, draped in purple embroidered robes, a nine-colored aura upon his neck, holding a starry pearl that gleamed like a jeweled capital. The Celestial Worthy surveyed the heaven-dwellers and proclaimed to the innumerable host:

“Let the True Lords of the Three Primes and the Nine Palaces of the Great One each ride their palaces, manifesting divine transformations and blessings. Within the human body, they are called the Central Yellow Great One, dwelling in repose within the Mysterious Cinnabar.”

Now the divine transformations commence, as the Dao descends with the Primordial Dipper. Gazing afar upon the Jade City, yet it does not surpass a single square inch. Through boundless spiritual power, I ferry all beings across; the Great One transforms his body to expound the Dharma as I do.

Thereupon, the Primordial Beginning ascended, leading the Celestial Perfected, the Supreme Spirits, the Exalted Worthies, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Boundless Ones of the Ten Directions, the True Lords of the Three Primes and the Great One, the Most Perfect and Great Spirits—an innumerable host—all entering into the Primordial Dipper. The heaven-dwellers looked up and saw them surge forth, entering from the stars of the Dipper’s handle. Once within the stellar palace, their whereabouts became unknown. The lands of the realm dispersed, the earth returned to level stillness, and the tremors ceased.

Within the stellar palace, the Primordial Beginning expounded the sutra in full. The assembled Perfected oversaw the deliverance and bestowed it upon me. At that moment, joy and celebration defied expression. When the Dharma rites were roughly complete, the hosts of heaven returned to their stations. In the fleeting instant, all fell silent, leaving no lingering echo.

At that time, the heaven-dwellers who encountered the sutra’s Dharma were universally delivered. The divine transformations of the Great One followed the turning of fate to bestow blessings, preserving their allotted years without harm or injury. The entire land turned in reverence, awakening the resolve for the Dao. There were no calamities, no wars, no hunger, no illness, no violence, no untimely deaths, no upheavals, no punishments, no fears, no terrors. Their words aligned with auspicious responses, and their speech overflowed with benevolent tones. Compassion and love became universal, and even those of different bones became kin. The realm knew peace, the people abundance, and all rejoiced in great harmony. From the moment the sutra’s teachings emerged, the entire land followed the Dao. Those who held sincere devotion, revered and honored it, all attained deliverance across the ages.

The Dao declares: The names spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy within the sutra are the inner appellations of the Three Primes and the Great One, the hidden rhymes of sound, as well as the secret taboos of the Nine Palaces and the concealed names of the Hundred Spirits. They are not the common words of the mundane world. Only those Perfected who have attained the status of True Persons, who penetrate the mysterious and fathom the subtle, can fully grasp their verses. When recited ten times, the Great One gazes downward, the Three Primes strike their rhythms, the celestial wheels interlock in emerald splendor, the earthly domains are bounded by gold, the sun and moon conjoin like jade disks, the stellar lodges align like strung pearls, the Milky Way stirs with clarity, the mountains and peaks stand majestic, numinous winds sweep through the void, and the myriad apertures blow their flutes. The celestial net shifts, the mechanisms of transformation operate of their own accord, demonic hordes are bound in form, ghostly essences extinguished in brilliance, the dead return to life, and white bones become human once more. The blessings of the Great One perish and yet revive again.

For those devoted to study, reciting this ten times summons the Five Emperors wielding their halberds, the Three Primes commanding their banners, the Great One riding his chariot to encircle the eight boundaries. Blessings flow with the qi, a myriad paths open before them. Misfortunes are severed, disasters and famines dispersed, demonic and ghostly traces swept away, and the obscured and departed ascend as immortals. Where the sovereign’s virtue extends, jubilation flourishes for a hundred million years. The divine might knows no bounds, and their station stands at the forefront of the celestial net. Even those on the brink of death from illness, when they encounter this, are preserved whole.

The reason for this is that the scholar awaits the qi and bides the time, while the Great One commands the Perfected to govern the ten directions, overawe the myriad heavens, subdue the earthly deities, bind the demonic spirits, avert disasters, repel death, escape calamity, and attain life. The divine script of the Great One transforms and revives the numinous. To recite this chapter lightly brings misfortune upon oneself. To honor and revere it ensures the prosperity of one’s household, flourishing across generations, forging good karmic connections. Ten thousand calamities will not intrude, for the Great One guards the gate.

This sutra is supremely wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital. It delivers boundless beings and serves as the origin of the myriad Dao. Its majestic model of virtue is beyond measure.

The Dao declares: Those who recite this sutra ten times should understand the Dao of the Great One’s divine transformations. The Three Primes and Twenty-Seven Palaces—comprising the Three Divisions of Heaven, Humanity, and Earth—each have a True Lord of the Great One presiding over them. Following the colors of the nine qi, nine stars, and nine palaces, they determine the realm’s fortunes and misfortunes. They rescue the times and protect the world, safeguarding the realm and preserving the sovereign, ensuring the emperor’s longevity and prosperity, and the harmony of celestial phenomena. Such is the profound merit of the Great One.

The Nine Palaces of Heaven: the North Emperor resides there, the Northeast is the Pivot of Wandering, the East nurtures life, the Southeast gazes upon the dawn, the South is the Vermilion Mound, the Southwest is the Woman’s Chamber, the West is the Luminous Pure, the Northwest is the Empty Constellation, and the Center is the Yellow Numinous.

Their Great Ones are named: Ancient Azure, Bamboo Trust, Dark Origin, Purple Ceremony, Nine Heads, White Banner, Fixed Auspice, Swift Fortune, and Warrior Prisoner.

The Nine Palaces of Humanity: the North is the Mysterious Path, the Northeast spews souls, the East is the Infant, the Southeast is the Ghost Metropolis, the South is the Fire Mountain, the Southwest is the Tiger’s Body, the West is the Bear Woman, the Northwest is the Heavenly Father, and the Center is the Hall of Blessings.

Their Great Ones are named: Long Life, Imperial Prosperity, Earl Wheel, Minister Axe, Mysterious Chart, Nine Slaughters, Cinnabar Essence, Seven Armors, and Human Mother.

The Nine Palaces of Earth: the North is the Mysterious Chamber, the Northeast is the Azure Lift, the East is the Dark Azure, the Southeast is the Proper Brilliance, the South is the Crimson Soldier, the Southwest is the General’s Seal, the West is the Crouching Slayer, the Northwest is the Capital of the Dao, and the Center is the Universal Ascent.

Their Great Ones are named: Dark Tiger, Green Teeth, Disheveled Hair, Nine Bodies, Azure Serpent, White Mist, Blood Devourer, Mad Slave, and Meng Dun.

The hidden names of the Three Primes differ from those used in the world, for their Dao is most secret. The Central Palace is the Court of the Five Blessings, the essence of the earth spirit. Above, it is the Heavenly Sovereign; in the middle, the Great One; below, the Mysterious One. For those who cultivate the Dao, the body becomes the sovereign’s abode, and they contemplate it as the Mysterious One. Those who attain this Dao unite the one with the myriad and the myriad with the one, mastering transformations and knowing the roots of life. They live without dying, attaining the immortality of the Transcendent.

The qi of the Five Lands serves as the sovereign’s master of blessings. Thus, after forty-five years, the residence shifts. Those dwelling in the North move after nine years; in the Southwest, after eighteen years; in the East, after twenty-seven years; in the Southeast, after thirty-six years; in the West, after sixty-three years; in the Northeast, after seventy-two years; and in the South, after eighty-one years.

Shifting one’s residence must not go against the natural order; below, there is no oppressive rule, and above, no punitive retribution. Thus, no disasters or harms arise, and one daily enjoys great peace. Should one tread where one does not belong or encounter times that are not one’s own, with superiors and inferiors out of harmony, misfortune follows the palace like a shadow, and calamities arise—all tied to the workings of Dao and virtue.

Those who recite this scripture will cause the Great One to turn his banner, and envoys bearing tallies will summon blessings and summon qi, achieving victory without battle. The Dao of warfare brings great fortune; auspiciousness returns to the imperial throne, and one’s years equal those of Heaven. The divine transformations of the Great One are difficult to fathom in detail. The Great One is the noble spirit of the Three Origins, bestowing blessings upon the lord of men. His transformations are without constancy; those who know them enjoy boundless longevity, and the fullness of Dao and virtue descends.

The qi of the Great One transforms at dawn into auspicious clouds, at midday into layered halos, and at dusk into flowing gold. When starlight streams by night, these are its remnants. Upon seeing them, one should burn incense and recite the scripture to welcome its blessings, thereby effortlessly attaining heavenly emolument, becoming a Transcendent, and ascending in joyous flight, naturally attaining the Dao.

Clouds resembling a scholar’s cap signal the Five Blessings in the North.
Clouds resembling a flying dragon signal the Great One in the East.
Clouds resembling a boat or fish signal the Great One in the South.
Clouds resembling banners and standards signal the Great One in the West.
Clouds resembling a canopy signal the Great One at the Center.
Clouds resembling a wandering maiden signal the Great One in the Northeast.
Clouds resembling a torch signal the Great One in the Southeast.
Clouds resembling a burial mound signal the Great One in the Southwest.
Clouds resembling armored warriors signal the Great One in the West.
Clouds resembling a ceremonial chariot signal the Great One in the Northwest.

Those who study, whether of Daoist or secular background, should gaze at the clouds, burn incense, and recite the scripture ten times. The Great One will dispatch riders from the Nine Palaces to protect the state and pacify the people, spreading blessings universally, so that all receive deliverance and attain long life as Transcendents. The Perfected Lord of the Great One shields the emperor and safeguards the people.

Those who know the Great One oversee the myriad heavens, and when they dwell near within their own bodies, even their ancestors of a hundred thousand generations—suffering souls in darkness—all receive deliverance and ascend to the Vermilion Palace. After nine years of cultivation, they undergo transformation and rebirth, becoming noble persons. Those who recite this scripture with understanding in heart and mind extend their years and longevity, and later all attain the Dao of corpse liberation. Their ethereal souls briefly vanish, avoiding the underworld, and immediately regain form, roaming the vastness of the heavens.

This scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally delivering boundless beings. The divine transformations of the Great One bring deliverance to Heaven and humankind, bestowing immeasurable blessings that grace both life and death. Treasured by the heavens above, it is not transmitted to the lower world. Only the most devoted offer gold and treasures to pledge their sincerity, swearing an oath to Heaven before passing it on. Those who lightly divulge or neglect it bring calamity upon nine generations, consigning them to long servitude under the ghostly officials.

The scripture is attended by the Five Thearchs, twenty-four Jade Lads and twenty-four Jade Maidens, who guard its divine writ and protect the body of the reciter.

The Dao says: During the long fast of the first month, recite and chant this scripture to welcome the Perfected Lord of the Great One of the Upper Origin, along with his attending officers and the great spirits of the Nine Palaces. They will deliver the souls of past generations from earthly servitude, those who perished by warfare or punishment, and guide them to the Southern Palace.

During the long fast of the seventh month, recite and chant this scripture to welcome the Perfected Lord of the Great One of the Middle Origin, along with his attending officers and the great spirits of the Nine Palaces. They will dispel warfare and repel enemies, aiding and assisting the emperor, bringing blessings to the people, and enabling the practitioner to attain Transcendence. Their names will be inscribed in the heavens, recorded on yellow registers and white tablets, erasing death and granting life.

During the long fast of the tenth month, recite and chant this scripture to welcome the Perfected Lord of the Great One of the Lower Origin, along with his attending officers and the great spirits of the Nine Palaces. They will protect the emperor and lord of the state, averting the Five Weapons, pacifying the Eight Directions, causing bandits to lose their forms and treachery to vanish. Rulers and ministers, fathers and sons, will stabilize the state’s destiny, ensuring the throne’s eternal preservation, generation after generation, so that one remains the lord of men, securely ruling the land, and the people enjoy great peace.

On the days of the Eight Nodes, recite and chant this scripture to welcome the Perfected Lord of the Five Blessings and the Great One, who will enter the Central Palace, enabling one to become a Perfected Person of the Nine Palaces. On one’s natal day, recite and chant this scripture to welcome the Perfected Lords of the Three Origins and the Great One, who will enter the Palace of Destiny, bestowing blessings upon one’s person. The ethereal soul will be purified, and the myriad qi will endure forever, free from suffering. The body will radiate light, attended by the Three Realms, received by the Five Thearchs, and revered by the myriad spirits. One’s name will be inscribed in the heavens; with merits fulfilled and virtue perfected, one will ascend to the Highest Clarity.

The Dao says: On the day of practicing the Dao, one should bathe in fragrant water, fast, and enter the chamber. Facing east, knock the teeth thirty-two times to reach the thirty-two heavens, and bow thirty-two times in the heart. Close the eyes and silently visualize the body seated amidst clouds of blue, yellow, and white qi, both within and without shrouded in mist. Clearly behold the Great Ones of the ten directions, each riding their respective palaces, spreading qi throughout the heavens. Green Dragons, White Tigers, Vermilion Birds, Dark Warriors, lions, and white cranes array themselves to the left and right. The sun and moon illuminate the chamber, which shines brilliantly, and a circular image appears above the neck, its light radiating in all directions—all vividly manifest.

The secret incantation says:
Supreme Mystery beyond mystery,
Most High Lord of the Dao,
Summon forth from within my body the Three and Five Merit Officers,
Left and right attending envoys,
Jade Lads bearing incense,
Jade Maidens transmitting words,
Direct Talismans of the Five Thearchs,
Incense Officials of the day—
thirty-two each—to report my words.
Today is auspicious and joyous,
a long fast in a pure hall,
cultivating the supreme scripture,
delivering boundless beings.
May my entreaties ascend swiftly
to the presence of the Most High,
the August One before the thirty-two heavens.

Conclude by drawing qi thirty-two times, then face east and recite the scripture.

*The Supreme Scripture of Boundless Salvation, Most Wondrous Upper Chapter*
The Primordial Mystery of the Cavernous Darkness,
the original text of the Numinous Treasure.
The divine transformations of the Great One,
delivering humankind through the Five Blessings.
The Three Origins conceal their rhymes,
parting and uniting naturally.
The Primal Yellow is dim and distant,
without gate or side.

Vast and radiant the Great Void,
the Dao’s qi boundless in every direction.
For eighty-one kalpas,
expansive and without light,
a primordial embryonic sac,
not born of yin or yang.
Suddenly arose the Supreme Spirit,
forcedly named the Great One.
Riding a yellow dragon,
grasping the celestial net,
its form like a jade infant,
clad in cinnabar brocade and green robes.
Revolving left and right,
in the eight true directions,
the myriad spirits submit,
none dare oppose.
The Great One, the Great Spirit,
is called the Root of Heaven.
At times it roams the Jade Purity,
body of the Most Sage.
From the Nine Palaces of the Mud-Pill,
it descends to generate the myriad heavens,
and with humankind,
each endowed with knowledge.
Distinguishing kinds and lineages,
differentiating forms into the ten thousand things.
Dwelling in the human brain’s palace,
it is the Radiant Awareness, the One True Great Spirit,
above residing in the Grand Tenuity,
in the center establishing the Court of Blessings,
below in these Nine Palaces,
guest of the Thearch.

The Great One’s birth,
coeternal with the Primordial Beginning,
above without further ancestry,
its body is the Dao alone.
Once it took root and stood firm,
heaven and earth congealed.
Nothing that is not illumined,
nothing that is not bright,
nothing that does not stand,
nothing that is not accomplished,
nothing that is not delivered,
nothing that is not born—
this is the Great Brahmā Heaven within Heaven.

The Great One’s true form
roams and strides the Jade Capital.
Ascending to the utmost height,
the Great Luo of Jade Purity.
Vast as kalpas and fathoms,
now present, now absent.
Riding the purity of the Dao,
the Three Origins array their palaces.
Using nine as the measure,
the Great One governs them.
Bestowing blessings and quelling warfare,
it transforms with the Dao.
Coeternal with the Primordial Beginning,
in movement and stillness, waxing and waning,
advancing and retreating, obscurity and brightness.
Before it lies the Golden Portal,
behind it the Jade Chamber.
To the east, mist contends; to the west, fog—
the Great One traverses these.
Extending and unfolding the Brahmā qi,
revolving through the ten directions.
Within are the spirits of the Three Origins and Nine Charts,
within are the Lords of the Jade Bureau who perform calculations,
within are the spirits of the *Yi*’s degrees and the Chamber of Transmigration,
within are the standard-bearers, the Year-Watchers, the Red-Turbaned, the Directing Talismans, the Venerable Elders,
within are the Great One, the Vanguard, the Rear Guard, the Eight Slayers, the Five Blessings, the Six Qi, the Nine Void Honored Spirits—
they restore bones and raise the dead,
delivering boundless beings.
Today, as the records are examined,
the various heavens descend to the imperial terrace.

The Great One, True August of the Three Origins and Nine Palaces of the Infinite East,

The Great One, True August of the Three Origins and Nine Palaces of the Infinite Below,
Great Sage of Boundless Deliverance and Eternal Life.
The Great Ones, True August of the Ten Directions,
Great Spirits of Boundless Deliverance and Eternal Life,
all ride upon azure mists,
purple and white clouds intertwining,
flowing light illuminating the void,
cinnabar chariots and green carriages,
toad-wheel phoenix chariots,
feathered canopies and vermilion tassels,
shimmering and swaying.
Their steeds are nine-colored giant celestial beasts,
dragons of the Jade Throne swift as the whirlwind.
They bear the green-tasseled standards,
the Seven Luminaries’ spirit-penetrating banners,
ahead the Nine Songs resound in unison,
behind the Eight Sounds harmonize.
Celestial horses and apotropaic creatures,
dancing and prancing,
phoenixes, cranes, swans, and simurghs,
crying and gathering in flocks.
The Six Jia open the way,
Jade Maidens support the shafts,
myriad chariots and ten thousand riders,
floating through the void they come,
their radiant procession turning,
governing deliverance and salvation.

The Great One’s Directing Talismans,
the Three Origins and Nine Palaces,
deploy their strategies and cast their lots,
summoning the great spirits.
The Heavenly Eye, the Flying Bird,
measuring qi and reckoning time,
descend to the realms beyond,
blessings and misfortunes manifest in due season.
Holding registers and grasping records,
all arrive before the Thearch,
to be strictly examined by the various heavens
according to those to be delivered.

Universally proclaimed to the Three Realms,
the Nine Contingents and Eight Extremities,
the twenty-eight divisions,
and the lands they oversee:
war, famine, floods, drought,
sudden death, pestilence,
auspicious omens, blessings,
the sovereign’s longevity and virtue.
Matching talismans above and below,
mastery over all they traverse.
The Three Offices and Nine Bureaus,
the Twelve River Sources,
the configurations of yin and yang qi,
the inner and outer twelve hundred degrees of destiny,
the celestial realms and human domains,
governing blessings and misfortunes.
Extending even to the living people’s ancestors,
the myriad kalpas’ kindred spirits—
wherever blessings converge,
the Great One descends with qi,
the hidden souls are delivered,
the Dark Springs radiate light,
sins are erased from the ledgers,
evil roots extirpated,
none may detain or confine them,
nor herd them with ghostly multitudes.

By the Great One’s talismanic command,
they ascend in due time.
Welcoming the qi, reciting the scriptures,
ascending the altar and invoking the spirits,
to pray for blessings.
Though a land lies beneath the constellation of calamity,
if one sincerely prays and performs expiations,
the Three Offices sound their chariots’ wheels,
the Great One turns the procession,
disasters transform into blessings,
the realm enjoys great peace,
the Thearch’s reign endures for myriad years.
If a person’s fate is afflicted by impending harm,
by following the method and praying,
heavenly light will shine upon their body,
and they shall attain longevity in this world.

The Great One’s Purple Palace
bestows blessings upon heaven and humankind.
Even those who perish
depend on the measure of their fortune and blessings.
Then the Cold Pool of the Northern Capital
guards and protects their forms and souls,
restraining demons and ensuring promotion,
delivering them to the Southern Palace’s ranks.
The dead souls undergo refinement,
transmuting into immortals.
Those whose bodies receive deliverance
abide for kalpas without end.
Revolving with the charts,
governing the eras and years.
Those who know these spirits
become perfected immortals,
forever transcending the Three Calamities and Four Slayers,
the Five Ghosts and Six Harms,
the Seven Injuries, Eight Difficulties, and Nine Perils,
ascending beyond the Three Realms,
carefree in the Upper Purity.

In the heaven of Upper Purity,
the Jade Perfected of the Heavenly Thearch,
the colorless realm of Brahmā conduct.

The Eight Heavens of the East:
The Nine Palaces and Thirty-Two Heavens where the Great One (Taiyi) traverses,
with the nine-colored qi flowing through each palace.
The Thirty-Two Heavens are also divisions of the Nine Palaces,

ward off harm and welcome fortune,

enabling the attainment of immortality.

The Thirty-Two Heavens, the Thirty-Two Thearchs,
with hidden taboos and concealed names,
the Great One’s cavernous emptiness,
the natural numinous scripture.
The Great One’s hidden rhyme,
the Great One’s divine sound,
the Great One’s majesty,
the Great One’s spirit,
the Great One’s perfection,
the Great One’s taboo,
the Great One’s numen.
The Nine Palaces and Ten Directions,
transforming into the Upper Purity,
the boundless mysteries,
too profound to detail.
The scattered numinous perfected,
descend to govern heaven and humanity.
Today, in joyous celebration,
we infer and distribute the various passes,
turning misfortune into fortune,
severing worldly roots,
exiting death and entering life,
facing and worshipping the Jade Lord.
Flying through the Seven Governors,
revolving with the Grand Mystery,
offering petitions at the year’s turn,
requesting control of the Heavenly Gate.
The Eastern Dipper supports on the left,
the Western Dipper carries on the right,
the Northern Dipper pivots the central axis,
the Southern Dipper turns the mechanism,
the Central Dipper forms the heavenly canopy,
while the Great One moves within.
The Azure Thearch wields the tally,
the White Thearch holds the weapon,
the Vermilion Thearch issues commands,
the Black Thearch gathers essence,
the Yellow Thearch governs the course,
advancing ten thousand leagues ahead.

The Azure Heaven’s Direct Envoy,
brandishing the halberd and raising the banner.
The Vermilion Heaven’s Direct Envoy,
the Great One’s returning banner.
The White Heaven’s Direct Envoy,
the shield and piled corpses.
The Black Heaven’s Direct Envoy,
serving and guarding the Pool of Xian.
The Yellow Heaven’s Direct Envoy,
the great fork of the Five Fortunes.
The Five Heavenly Envoys,
with the Great One as their宗.
Commanding the celestial soldiers,
devouring demons and drinking wind,
the dark banners and whistling standards,
attacking in unison with the troops.
How dare the petty rebels of the Qiang Dao act arrogantly?
The Dipper’s pointer shifts the diviner’s board,
the Jade Chart alters its seals.
Ten thousand fortunes converge with the Thearch,
ensuring victory without misfortune,
heavenly couriers lead the way,
flying cavalry soar through the void.
Eight paths hurl fire,
the Four Heavens track traces,
protecting the state and aiding the times,
the Great One’s divine duke.
First establishing the sun and moon,
grasping the golden bell in hand,
clad in yellow armor,
riding ten flying dragons.
Unstoppable in all directions,
wind and fire surge in succession,
the Five Fortunes descend,
purple mist swirls and gathers.
Immortal clouds cover the palace,
the Three Origins command the retinue,
weapons and slaughter dispel inauspiciousness,
all consigned to the Northern Feng.
Thus, the qi of specters and demons,
concealing their forms within qi,
meeting with yin and calamity,
causing the people’s illnesses and infirmities.
They cannot hide,
as the Golden Horse post connects all.
Universally proclaimed without end,
the myriad spirits all listen,
the Three Realms and Five Thearchs,
declare to the Upper Purity.
The boundless and ultimate emptiness,
dragons transform and spirits shift,
the Great One, ancestor of the Dao,
the resource of all life.
Heaven and earth assist in completion,
the central course subtly operates,
the Great One receives the numinous,
the sun and moon fly together.
In the vastness of countless kalpas,
within the primordial chaos,
spirits are tranquil and qi congeals,
planting and establishing the Nine Palaces.
The Nine Palaces become one,
one becomes the Nine Palaces,
the Dao of nine and one,
the宗 of the Great One.
Numbers proceed and return,
true qi like a dragon,
the Great One’s arrival and governance,
the Three Origins’ laws in harmony.
Enveloping the animate and inanimate,
the Jade Capital’s exquisite intricacy,
wrapped externally by the fierce wind,
within the primordial chaos.
Above, no color of action,
below, no emptiness of inaction,
the Great One holds the reins,
solemnly attended by jade youths.
One drumbeat, then another,
becoming water, becoming wind,
one connection, then another,
the heavenly auspice points east.
For the Dao, wisdom and clarity,
all things harmonize and flourish,
the Great One enters the mysterious,
the nine qi open the heavens.
Above heaven and below heaven,
no darkness, no obscurity,
no form, no shadow,
no limit, no end.
The vast expanse of the primordial ocean,
the boundless and lightless void,
the Great One’s divine transformations,
naturally govern the cycles.
The cinnabar elixir across the nine wilds,
arranging the chessboard to record the years,
the Great One’s divine qi,
condenses into the numinous scripture.
The mysterious prophecy and jade calendar,
tiger scripts and dragon texts,
preserve and control the kalpic cycles,
ensuring heaven’s eternal existence.
The Brahmā qi pervades the net,
myriad patterns unfold,
the round mechanism flows and evolves,
the Thirty-Two Heavens.

the returning cycles traverse the eight gates.
The Twenty-Eight Lodges gather qi at the Upper Prime,
the Eight Sceneries merge in darkness,
qi enters the profound mystery.

floats by the Dipper, leans on the Northern Apex,
the Heavenly Thearch and the Curved Array.
The Nine Palaces and Ten Essences,
jade wefts and golden scriptures,
divine winds follow the chariot,
assisting the myriad immortals.
A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions,
heaven and earth share the same balance,
the One True Great Spirit.
The Most Exalted of the Great One,
ascends the Grand Stair,
opens audience with the Great Lord,
the Feathered Forest leads the way.
Drums resound, solemn tones echo,
cutting off demonic lineages,
preserving life and rooting existence,
ascending to the Upper Clarity,
entering and exiting the Three Primes,
within the Eight Darknesses,
amidst the subtlest realms.
Below, it governs the human body,
the Mud-Pill Palace and the Crimson Palace,
ordering the five qi,
circulating the myriad spirits.
Ten revolutions return the numinous,
the myriad qi unite as immortals,
the immortal Dao values life,
the Great One’s perfected beings.
Above, the eight gates open,
heaven and earth become the wheel,
sin and fortune, prohibitions and precepts,
karmic causes and conditions.
Universally received and delivered,
the dead path gives birth to the body,
the body attains rebirth,
ascending through the various heavens.
Above the various heavens,
each has its gate of life,
within are the empty and cavernous odes and songs,
the Great One’s numinous scripture,
its verses matching the lofty perfected.
---
The First, the Lower Prime’s Nine Palaces Great One Perfected Lord,
the flying sound of the void,
morning rides the yellow steed,
entering the Grand Tenuity.
Below, gazing upon the Nine Provinces,
chess-like, stars scatter.
Above, beholding the Upright Gate,
the Thearch’s sole felicity.
The Dipper’s chariot races fourfold, green mist flies,
the golden halberd’s cold light, the celestial arc hangs.
Cinnabar talismans blaze with yang, the five fortunes return,
ten thousand soldiers invincible, heaven’s virtue reverts.
Divine martial transformations shine, the year knows no famine,
the Emperor’s radiance returns, the jade-embroidered dragon robe.
The Great One descends to the Bright Hall, auspiciousness fills the suburbs,
the attendants clear the purple void, the vermilion gates overflow with light.
---
The Second, the Middle Prime’s Nine Palaces Great One Perfected Lord’s Chapter
I propel heaven’s strategy,
fortune resides in the imperial house.
The myriad states submit their lives,
the chariot’s patterns unite as one.
Resplendent, the great star,
brilliant, the purple light.
At its center, the Purple Enclosure,
below, it overlooks the Jade Chamber.
Your spirit, the Hairy Head,
your soldiers, the Flanking Ones.
The Great One joins talismans,
rides the Apex, treads the firm.
Watering horses with green hay,
greasing chariots, reinforcing boxes.
Unarrayed, yet victorious,
the Great One establishes the directions.
Golden lads bear banners,
jade maidens offer libations.
Divining the altar, pouring sincerity,
the five fortunes flow abundantly.
Prolonging our Emperor’s honor,
a hundred auspices descend from heaven.
The people sing with joy,
the times are peaceful and prosperous.
Clouds drift in azure vastness,
pearl-like dew, dark frost.
Auspicious responses fill all under heaven,
our Dao flourishes.
---
The Third, the Upper Prime’s Nine Palaces Great One Perfected Lord’s Song
I ride the refined serpent,
crowned and girded with clouds and rosy dawn.
Entering the celestial thoroughfare,
exiting to wander the imperial house.
Where the dragon banner points,
the myriad things shine with splendor.
The Great One’s qi,
joy overflows with abundant fortune.
Attending the Emperor’s hall,
the numinous radiance glows resplendent.
Reciting my jade scripture,
the Five Thearchs burn incense.
The Three Realms bow their heads,
the Queen Mother of the West passes the cup.
Phoenix diagrams by the thousands,
dragon longevity knows no end.
I journey in the blue carriage,
the eight winds come to court.
Gazing in homage to the Great One,
brocade robes and kingfisher-feathered gowns.
Altar clouds swirl fourfold,
striking stone, thunder resounds.
Offering my sweet blossoms,
a hundred yellow threads.
Heaven’s voice distant and faint,
vibrant echoes like jade chimes.
Left, I glance at the Purple Tenuity,
right, I support the Jade Pendants.
Turning the Dipper’s pivot,
ten thousand treasures fill the storehouse.
Descending fortune overflows,
harmonizing the palace and court notes.
---
Above these Three Primes,
within the Nine Palaces,
the Great One’s songs and sounds,
their tones matching the cavernous chapters.
Reciting them a hundred times,
one may avoid the three disasters.
Reciting them a thousand times,
the Great One protects and welcomes.
Ten thousand recitations, the Dao is complete,
one merges into the great void.
Knowing where the One abides,
one ascends as an immortal elder.
Hearing the numinous sound,
demons and ghosts vanish in form.
Commanding and controlling earth spirits,
attendants escort and receive.
Drawn from the earth’s gates,
the five sufferings and eight hardships.
Worldly gains and promotions,
eternally departing the Three Offices.
One’s name is recorded by the Great One,
arrayed to attend the imperial chariot.
This is called the immeasurable,
universal deliverance without end.
There is a secret celestial pattern,
revered by all heavens.
Revealing it carelessly casts one into hell,
misfortune extends to seven generations of ancestors.
---
The Dao says: These cavernous chapters are all the celestial hymns of the Thearchs of the various heavens,
and the Three Primes, Nine Palaces,
Ten Spirits, Eight Marvels, Six Concealments, Five Perfected, Four Gates, Two Luminaries, One Prime,
the Great One’s hidden sounds,
all are the revolving jade mechanisms,
turning misfortune into fortune,
transforming calamity into blessing.
Their words lack ornate beauty,
their melodies lack florid grace,
thus they are called profound and abstruse,
difficult to fathom in detail.
Heaven’s treasures,
secretly kept in the Great One’s Three Primes Purple Palace of the Dark Capital,
transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas according to the mysterious statutes.
If there is a perfected being who offers gold and treasures,
pledges sincerity according to the ancient rules,
and swears oaths to the Ten Heavens,
only then are they entrusted with it.
---
The Dao says: When heaven and earth’s revolutions
approach an inauspicious end,
the Great One Perfected Lord transforms in response,
appearing as a divine horse with fleshly mane,
one horn, red in color,
emerging to draw water from the sea.
When the sun, moon, and five stars
are about to wane or wax,
the Great One Perfected Lord transforms in response,
appearing as a female shaman carrying a zither,
wandering the Tang marketplaces.
When the most sagely and divine beings
are about to experience fortune or misfortune,
the Great One Perfected Lord transforms in response,
appearing as a black qi traversing east and west,
thick frost clinging to trees,
great winds toppling and snapping,
whirling and pouring in alarming violence.
When lesser scholars
are about to suffer illness or injury,
the Great One Perfected Lord transforms in response,
appearing in dreams as bloody corpses, death,
weapons, slaughter, thunderous illness,
falling from cliffs, or drowning in rivers.
For all such disasters,
when observing these divine transformations,
those of the same qi should all wholeheartedly perform purification rites.
Practicing the Dao at the six hours,
reciting the scriptures ten times,
blessings and virtue will immediately descend.
If one encounters the Great One’s descent,
welcoming, meeting, and reverently inviting,
one will surely attain longevity.

The esoteric Dao of immortals manifests according to the time of encounter—observe it with good intent, do not resist its numinous power, and you shall preserve the great prosperity of the true Way. The boundless scriptures universally deliver the limitless.

The Dao declares: When lesser scholars of shallow attainment, whose immortal rank remains unfulfilled, face the destined hour of passing, and their bodies undergo the transit of the Great Yin, the Great One Perfected Lord of the Corpse descends in response, revealing divine transformations—now as white cranes flying forth, now as tortoise and serpent emerging together, now as sudden gales, the heavens and earth darkening, birds and beasts wailing in sorrow, white rainbows piercing the sun, mountains and forests altering their hues, or dreams bearing extraordinary portents. Then the Great One guards the corpse, the Three Officials record the soul, the Nine Elders seize the qi, and after one cycle of sixty days, life returns and form is restored. Fellow perfected ones, performing incense rites and reciting the scriptures ten times to deliver the corpse-form according to the method, the soul and spirit ascend directly to the Southern Palace, where, in accordance with their cultivation, they reckon the days to rebirth. Once the Wheel turns without confusion, they attain immortality.

The Dao declares: When the cycles of heaven and earth reach their end, one must perform purification rites, offer incense, and recite the scriptures. When the stellar lodgings fall into disorder and the sun and moon lose their proper times, one must perform purification rites, offer incense, and recite the scriptures. When the four seasons lose their order and yin and yang fall out of harmony, one must perform purification rites, offer incense, and recite the scriptures. When barbarian tribes invade the borders and military violence erupts, one must perform purification rites, offer incense, and recite the scriptures. When pestilence spreads and the multitudes suffer death and injury, one must perform purification rites, offer incense, and recite the scriptures. When masters or companions pass away, one must perform purification rites, offer incense, and recite the scriptures.

The merit of purification rites and scripture recitation is exceedingly weighty. Above, it dissolves heavenly calamities and safeguards the emperor; below, it wards off poisonous harm and delivers the multitudes. In life and death, all rely upon it—its blessings are beyond measure. Thus it is called boundless, universally delivering heaven and humanity.

The Dao declares: Whoever possesses this scripture and understands the Way of the Great One’s divine transformations to protect the state and avert warfare, and performs these meritorious deeds for the lord of heaven and earth and the multitudes—on the day of calamity, if they resolve to perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures ten times, all the heavens record their names, ten thousand spirits attend and guard them, and those distinguished as perfected ones shall surely become ministers of the Golden Gates of the Sage Lord. The heavens record the merits and transgressions of people without the slightest error. The great deities of the Nine Palaces of Heaven also protect and recommend you. Those who attain the Dao shall thoroughly comprehend these profound words.

These are the great Brahma’s hidden speech within the Nine Palaces of the Heavens—boundless words, whose ancient script was carved upon the azure walls of the Vermilion Phoenix Hall in the Grand Tenuity. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign of Old inscribed their text to establish the correct intonation. Those who know these sounds and can purify themselves to recite them shall have all the heavens dispatch flying heavenly spirit-kings to descend and observe their person, record their meritorious diligence, and report it above to the heavens. The myriad spirits shall pay homage in audience, the earth spirits shall attend at the gates, and great merit shall be achieved at the Three Origins, ensuring the Great One’s protection and recommendation. When the Dao is complete and attained, one may wander the Three Realms and ascend into the Golden Gates. These sounds repel all, exorcise all, deliver all, and accomplish all—they are the Great One’s celestial and spontaneous sounds.

Profound wisdom illumines the pure, the vast and mysterious abides in mystery.

*The Marvelous Scripture of the Numinous Treasure, the Upper Grade for Delivering All Beings, Chapter Six Concludes*
*Chapter Seven*

**Chapter on Manifesting Auspicious Signs and Responses**

The Dao spoke: Long ago in the Great Cinnabar Heaven, within the Mysterious Yang’s secluded and desolate Crimson Essence Realm, the Primordial Beginning received the *Upper Scripture on Manifesting Auspicious Signs and Responses for Delivering All Beings*. When the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning was to expound this scripture, he circumambulated ten times to summon the ten directions, then ascended his seat. Manifesting transformation spirits, lords of auspicious numina, perfected ones of talismanic response, and countless hosts arrived borne upon the void. They drifted upon the purple clouds of qi, riding jade carriages and latticed chariots, canopies of blossoms casting shade, gold and azure radiance intermingling, flying clouds dense and lush, illuminating the vast expanse.

For nine days and nine nights, the celestial net’s wheel turned, felicitous mists soared aloft, the Seven Luminaries congealed their splendor, earthly spirits emitted omens, the Three Origins grew solemn, the Four Qi clarified, the jeweled towers of the heavens’ palaces and jasper pavilions were suffused with auspicious glow, all revealing the Eight Assemblies’ true writ, resplendent within the Upper Palace, without a single discordant hue. The assembled perfected ones attended the seat as the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning sat in mystery upon a floating five-colored mountain of treasure.

When the scripture was expounded once, the host of sages throughout the heavens simultaneously proclaimed its excellence, and suddenly a cinnabar phoenix and yellow dragon came to announce universal peace. When expounded twice, the mountains and rivers of the great earth yielded forth the Seven Treasures. When expounded thrice, the distant shadows of yin blossoms formed luminous layered wheels. When expounded four times, the Celestial Market and Supreme Subtlety constellations manifested auspicious stars. When expounded five times, jade blossoms filled the void, felicitous clouds scattered in the four directions. When expounded six times, sweet dew congealed into pearls, moistening all things. When expounded seven times, city walls and towers, terraces and observatories sprouted jade mushrooms in profusion. When expounded eight times, numinous scriptures unfolded, true talismans descended. When expounded nine times, the heavens bestowed the Mysterious Chart, the emperor received the precious register. When expounded ten times, the people enjoyed well-being, universally receiving a hundred blessings; grasses and trees, birds and insects all equally attained the supreme transformation.

At that time, every man and woman in the land, without exception, turned their hearts in devotion, beholding the mysterious auspices, their signs aligning with the sagely era. Each received protection and deliverance, all attaining longevity. The Dao spoke: When the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning expounded the scripture once, the Vast and Boundless Hosts of Immortal-Raising Spirits from the eastern direction arrived borne upon the void. When expounded twice, the Vast and Boundless Crimson Pool Spirits from the southern direction, with their countless hosts, arrived borne upon the void. When expounded thrice, the Vast and Boundless Luminous Radiance Spirits from the western direction, with their countless hosts, arrived borne upon the void. When expounded four times, the Vast and Boundless Twin Gates Spirits from the northern direction, with their countless hosts, arrived borne upon the void. When expounded five times, the Vast and Boundless Azure Cloud Spirits from the northeastern direction, with their countless hosts, arrived borne upon the void. When expounded six times, the Vast and Boundless Yellow Earth Spirits from the southeastern direction, with their countless hosts, arrived borne upon the void. When expounded seven times, the Vast and Boundless Central August Spirits from the southwestern direction, with their countless hosts, arrived borne upon the void. When expounded eight times, the Vast and Boundless Heavenly Origin Spirits from the northwestern direction, with their countless hosts, arrived borne upon the void. When expounded nine times, the Vast and Boundless Mysterious Void Spirits from the upper direction, with their countless hosts, arrived borne upon the void. When expounded ten times, the Vast and Boundless Abyssal Depth Spirits from the lower direction, with their countless hosts, arrived borne upon the void.

When the ten circumambulations were complete, the Vast and Boundless Spirits of Manifest Auspicious Signs and Responses from the ten directions arrived simultaneously. Every man and woman in the land said to one another: “We once heard that when the Five Chapters first emerged, the Three Realms were first divided, the Celestial Worthy and the emperor descended to be born among the heavens, numinous spirits announced auspices, and transformations unfolded therein. Now we hear the Primordial Beginning expounding the origins of heaven and earth, all of which return to the emperor. The emperor’s virtue matches heaven and earth; the Dao flourishes, virtue expands, spirit is complete, qi is replete. The Five Agents’ supreme essences each manifest their mysterious wonders, spontaneously generating marvels to proclaim to the emperor as auspicious signs and responses, principles encompassing the profound and mysterious.”

Their hearts turned in devotion, those who came were like the tide’s appointed return or the wind’s timely signal—countless hosts so vast that half the land sank beneath their weight, an irresistible force. Thereupon the Primordial Beginning emitted a great radiance, now hidden, now revealed, beyond measure. The treasure mountain upon which he rode transformed into a single pearl, vast as the bright moon, suspended in the great void ten thousand leagues above the earth. The Primordial Beginning ascended, leading the perfected ones of the Nine Heavens, the exalted sages, the transcendent immortals of wondrous practice, the Vast and Boundless Spirits of Auspicious Response from the ten directions, and their countless hosts—all entered the pearl. The heavenly beings gazed upward, seeing only a shimmering light entering through the pearl’s mouth. Once within, their whereabouts were unknown. The people of the land dispersed, the earth returned to levelness, the uneven sinking no more.

Within the pearl, the Primordial Beginning completed the full exposition of the scripture. The assembled perfected ones oversaw the deliverance and transmitted it to me. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words. The ritual matters concluded, the heavens’ hosts returned to their stations. In an instant, all was silent, without lingering resonance. At that time, the heavenly beings who encountered the scriptural Dharma were universally delivered, preserving their allotted years without harm. The entire land turned in devotion, all cultivating good hearts—neither reckless nor transgressive, neither partisan nor biased, neither careless nor flattering, neither indulgent nor arrogant, neither negligent nor deceitful. Their hearts practiced reverence and yielding, their mouths spoke no frivolous words. They were uniformly compassionate and loving, transforming even strangers into kin. The land was at peace, the people prosperous, all rejoicing in great tranquility.

When the scripture first emerged as teaching, the entire land followed the Dao. Those who in advance had held sincere hearts, revered and honored it, all attained deliverance across the ages. The Dao spoke: What the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning expounded in the scripture are all the primordial qi of the Mysterious and Numinous, the inner names of the Numinous Treasure, the hidden rhymes of sound—also the concealed names of the perfected ones of descending auspicious talismans and transcendent immortals, not the common words of the world. The exalted sages who have already attained perfection, who fathom the mysterious and investigate the subtle, can fully grasp its chapters. Reciting it ten times, the heavens descend auspices, the myriad emperors bestow talismans, rivers and seas grow still, mountains and peaks conceal their clouds, earthly omens manifest clearly, lofty spirits illuminate the hidden, and demonic hosts bind their forms.

Ghostly spirits vanish in clarity, the dead revive from corpses, and white bones become human. For those of utmost learning, reciting it ten times brings the Five Emperors to bestow auspices, the Three Realms to pledge alliance, manifest responses of utmost benevolence, and the exalted Dao to be proclaimed. The reason for this is that heaven and earth emit auspiciousness, their signs aligning with the perfected and sacred—this is the qi of auspices. Its qi is wondrous and subtle, conceivable yet unattainable, discussable yet unknowable; the myriad things transform through it, and the Five Phases generate marvels. When people resonate with its essence, they do not become withered corpses. To recite this chapter lightly brings calamity upon oneself; to revere and honor it brings prosperity to one’s household. Generation after generation flourishes, bound to good karmic causes; ten thousand disasters do not approach, and divine companions guard the gate. This scripture is exalted and wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital; it delivers countless beings and is the root of the myriad Dao. Its towering greatness and virtue are beyond measure.

The Dao spoke: Those who recite this scripture ten times with focused devotion move the Supreme Mystery, gathering auspicious signs; wondrous qi congeals, and the myriad things transform into radiance. It aids the sovereign above, ensuring the Dao’s fortune is boundless and preserving it for a hundred million years. Those who diligently study this scripture, fulfilling their merit and perfecting their virtue, all attain divine transcendence, ascending to the Golden Gates and roaming the Jade Capital. For scholars of the highest learning who cultivate and recite this scripture, celestial auspices shine forth, and blessings extend to the entire region. Their names are submitted to the celestial bureaus and recorded in the Southern Palace. When the people of the world recite it, magic mushrooms sprout, pools well with sweet springs, and the qi of the Dao descends and gathers. Refining and ingesting its essence, they extend their years and lengthen their lives, wandering the Five Peaks and attaining the rank of earthbound transcendent.

This scripture is subtle and wondrous, its blessings boundless; all celestial and human beings receive its grace, and immeasurable fortune extends to the living and the dead. Treasured by the heavens, it is not transmitted to the lower world. Only the most devoted offer gold and treasures, pledging their hearts to heaven before passing it on. To leak or slight it lightly brings misfortune to the Seven Mysteries and endless servitude to the ghostly officials. The Five Emperors assign twelve jade lads and twelve jade maidens each to attend the scripture, safeguarding its precious chapters and protecting the body of the one who receives it.

The Dao spoke: During the long fast of the first month, recite and chant this scripture to harmonize the celestial qi, make grasses and trees flourish, ensure no blight afflicts beings, and bring all treasures to fruition. During the long fast of the seventh month, recite and chant this scripture to summon the gods of the Nine Heavens, make mountains and peaks conceive essence, and give birth to worthy ones who yearn for the Dao and study transcendence. During the long fast of the tenth month, recite and chant this scripture to open the paths of heaven and earth, seal mountains to invoke their spirits, and bring talismanic auspices to gather in the imperial court, eternally stabilizing all directions and bringing the people to acclaim great peace. On the days of the eight solar terms, recite and chant this scripture to make the five grains flourish abundantly and rare blossoms present auspices. On the last day of the month, recite and chant this scripture to obtain cinnabar and azure magic mushrooms, which deliver one’s body without undergoing trials. One’s body shines with light, jade radiance gleams, feathered canopies and banners welcome them, and the myriad spirits pay homage. Their names are inscribed in the heavens above. When merit is fulfilled and virtue perfected, they ascend to the Supreme Clarity.

The Dao spoke: On the days of practicing the Dao, one should bathe in fragrant waters, enter the chamber in purification, face east, and knock the teeth thirty-two times to reach the thirty-two heavens above. Bow thirty-two times in the heart, close the eyes, and silently visualize oneself seated amidst clouds of azure, crimson, and vermilion qi, the interior and exterior shrouded in mist. A green dragon, white tiger, vermilion bird, dark warrior, lion, and white crane array themselves to the left and right. The sun and moon illuminate brightly, filling the chamber with brilliance. A circular image appears above the neck, its light shining in all directions—all this must be vividly clear. The secret incantation says:

*"Supreme Mystery of the Primordial, Most High Dao Lord, summon forth from within this servant’s body the thirty-five Merit Officers, the attendants of the left and right, the jade lads who tend incense, the jade maidens who transmit words, the talismanic attendants of the Five Emperors, and the incense officials of the appointed day—thirty-two each—to open and convey these words. Today is an auspicious day, a long fast in the pure hall, cultivating the supreme scripture to deliver countless beings. May these words ascend directly to the Primordial Supreme Lord of the Thirty-Two Heavens before the Celestial Worthy’s throne."*

Afterward, draw in qi thirty-two times and recite the scripture facing east.

The Primordial *Dongxuan Lingbao* Original Chapter, Supreme Grade, manifests auspicious signs and responses, transforming and delivering beings. Its subtle and hidden rhymes align with spontaneity. The primordial chaos flows with essence, refining the embryo to form transcendent beings. Wondrous light and radiance generate crimson script; interwoven and structured, auspicious mists entwine. Planting the root of the Mystery, it shines brilliantly across the heavens. Cinnabar light and jade script universally gather the Five Spirits, vast and boundless, floating echoes in the profound stillness. The true palace’s imperial qi, crimson and green, generates sound, flowing through the Nine Heavens; water and fire soar. This is the precious auspice, the dwelling of primordial unity. The Seven Treasures’ Mysterious Terrace, the Supreme Palace of the Purple Tenuity, ascends to the Great Non-Being, the lofty Clarity of Yu Shan. Grasping the primordial mechanism, towering and supreme, it governs yin and yang, creating and completing all things. Its pattern spans the void and silence, its principles subtle and profoundly hidden. It dwells in the Great Net, gazing afar across the ten directions. Within it resides the true one of the Primordial Great Transformation; within it resides the Lord of the Seven Transformations of the Supreme Clarity; within it resides the Exalted One who manifests celestial auspices; within it resides the perfected one who aligns with the imperial fortune; within it reside the gods who revolve the celestial net, stabilize the earthly records, traverse the empty realms, and establish the supreme pole. They collectively review the charts and records, the boundless transformed bodies. Today, at this auspicious gathering, the myriad spirits attend the court.

Together they ride upon crimson mist, jade chariots and jasper carriages, beneath purple canopies and dragon banners, drawn by celestial deer and flanked by spirit phoenixes and *zouyu*. They bear the standards of Mystic Radiance and the Three Pristine Banners. To their left stand the Flying Heavenly Generals; to their right follow the Flowing Gold Fire Bells. Heavenly horses and *qilin* leap and prance, warding off evil, while tenfold blossoms mark their path, and five attendants flank their shafts. Myriad chariots and ten thousand riders float through the void to arrive. Divine light shines in return, summoning immortals and gathering perfected beings.

From the Tortoise Terrace’s canonical records, the Kunlun’s *Langfeng*, the Mystic Bureau’s sovereigns, and the Auspicious Divine Ones of Signs—all holding tablets and attending to writs—proceed together to the Jade Court. As their radiance manifests, they summon and gather the hosts of heaven. Universally they proclaim to the divine realms and sacred isles within the world’s bounds, to the Eight Seas and Four Rivers, the famous mountains and great streams, the grotto-heavens and palatial precincts, the Twelve Spirit Sources, the earthly bureaus and departments, the Yellow Gates and Nine Palaces: swiftly spread the Dao’s transformation, initiate auspicious omens, and let no obstruction hinder the advent of primordial signs.

The True Kings receive the talismans, and their blessings shade the people below. Cold and heat follow their seasons, and the Three Luminaries shine forever. No disasters or plagues afflict beings; the hundred grains flourish abundantly. Transformation extends to the four barbarians; benevolence reaches even insects. All follow their nature in carefree ease, rejoicing in great peace. Through the turning of kalpas, all together attain flight as immortals. Forever they sever the trials of the Six Heavens’ demons, tread the void aloft, and wander in feast through the Great Darkness.

In the Heaven of Great Darkness, the Celestial Emperor of Literary Prosperity presides over the ultimate realm of the Dao’s pure practices.

Within the heavens’ empty caverns, the natural numinous chapters; the heavens’ hidden melodies, the Great Cavern’s sounds. The honored ones of the Numinous Treasure, the divine ones of auspicious response, who open blessings and initiate fortune, the spirits of blended qi.

Through nine revolutions and ten traversals, they ascend the void and tread the empty sky. Divine, wondrous, and profoundly mysterious, they overshadow the Two Modes. Scattering cinnabar blossoms, they manifest responses to heaven and humanity. Today, all together rejoice in the ultimate transformation, moved by the heavens’ influences. Floating upon the purple clouds of dawn, they dance in return within the cloudy encampments. Transcending the weak abyss, jade radiance gleams upon the numinous ford. Immortals and sages bestow talismans; they receive the writs at the Emperor’s Gate.

The Eastern Dipper moves the spirits; the Western Dipper refines the essence. The Northern Dipper congeals and binds; the Southern Dipper spreads the numinous. The Central Dipper gathers qi, and auspicious signs transform and give birth.

The Azure Heaven commands the perfected; the White Heaven elevates the immortals. The Mystic Heaven determines the records; the Vermilion Heaven summons the immortals. The Yellow Heaven celebrates the assembly, together opening the Primordial Pass.

The Divine King of Vast Clouds oversees the warp and weft of scriptures. The Divine King of Eternal Fire blazes upward in flowing smoke. The Divine King of Prosperous Opening governs the seven passes. The Divine King of *Yudan* refines the eight mights. The Divine King of Central Yellow monitors the perfected and corrects transgressions.

The Five Heavenly High Perfected, honored ones of myriad transformations, govern the heavens’ administration and turn the jade pivot. Riding dragons and driving clouds, they fly through the Grand Tenuity. Illuminating and dispelling baleful qi, the upright qi returns in unison.

The Supreme Thearch descends the charts; the cinnabar radiance of the flaming landscape blazes. The Great Lord receives the decree, his majesty ruling the ten directions. All evil is shattered and destroyed; the Dao’s transformation spreads and extends. Auspicious signs arrive; the realms become clear and pure. The Five Phases follow their courses; the imperial Dao shines forever. Should any dare to act with violence and disorder, they shall be bound and delivered to the Lady of Azure.

The Three Primes’ ranked bureaus determine crimes and impose severe punishments. The Nine Heavens and Eight Poles examine and assess without cease. The human sovereign receives blessings; the state is secure and the people prosperous. The altars of soil and grain endure forever, through kalpas without end. They enjoy great peace, flourishing together with the Dao. Spirits fly to the Jade Capital, feasting and wandering in the Upper Palaces.

Proclaiming to the myriad spirits, universally announcing without end, the Three Realms’ Five Thearchs present their memorials to the lofty vault. The great destiny becomes clear and vast, initiating the ultimate cinnabar radiance. Establishing the heavens, they flow through the transformations of yin and yang. Above, the Three Qi ascend; below, the hundred constants transform. The Primordial Cavern’s profound mysteries, the flying standards’ firm strength.

The Mystic Calendar completes its cycles, through the Six Turbidities and Nine Purities. The Great Desert broods in obscurity, formless and shapeless. In the chaos of primordial chaos and the Yellow Mystery, the numinous sound scatters and arises. It unfolds my supreme transformation, vast and naturally operating.

The fiery essence fans the whirlwind, stirring the celestial abyss. Jade tablets and vermilion slips, the Jade Register’s true script. It gathers and summons the primordial qi, commanding the myriad spirits. The celestial writings spread in array, the great Dharma expands and extends.

Following the kalpas, it unfolds the Great Simplicity’s wondrous chapters. Bestowing the chart upon the Divine Empyrean, it eternally guards the Jasper Palace. The numbers align with the auspicious convergence, the felicitous destiny flowing and transmitting. Universally delivering all beings, together they return to the Three Origins.

The supreme teaching is clear and luminous, its merit equaling the Highest Mystery. Within the Mystic, auspicious omens respond to the Perfected. The people rejoice in well-being, the lands remain perpetually tranquil. Radiance concealed and effulgence hidden, it pacifies and abides endlessly.

Preserving the essence of the Mystic Flower, refining the embryo in purple mist. Riding the rosy clouds and drifting light, the form ascends as a flying immortal. Through a thousand transformations and myriad changes, it unites with qi to attain the true. Within the true, the supreme spirit, the Lord of the Myriad Ways.

Rightfully governing the heavens and wielding the supreme pole, uniquely revered through kalpas unnumbered. Named the Primordial Beginning, this is my own body. The Three Realms’ administrative offices, governing the roots of life. Above, roaming the Jade Void, the spirit soars to the Great Nothingness.

Within the Round Net, amid the Primal Yellow, the Profound Abyss is colorless. The Eight Poles’ numinous gates. Swiftly summoning the great demons, convening at the Mystic Capital. Ten revolutions of the returning wind, blessings extend to the hidden and dark.

The Dao of Heaven descends auspiciousness, delivering beings without measure. Above, opening the Gate of Life, the scripture enters the Flying Wheel. Examining and assessing the charts and registers, the causes of good and evil. All receive deliverance and salvation, the dead souls gain new bodies.

Having attained rebirth, they ascend to memorialize the Purple Purity. Above the Purple Purity, each possesses its Mystic Sound. Within it, the manifest auspicious omens and responsive chapters, the Three Simplicities’ Jade Stanzas, their words equaling the Highest Perfected.

**First: The Flying Immortal’s Chant of the Primordial Beginning Establishing the Pole**
Vast and distant, beholding the Great Nothingness,
All heavens revere the Void Sovereign.
Since the Dragon Han has passed,
In darkness, it measures the extended well-being.
Heaven and earth return to primordial chaos,
The Eight Enclosures conceal their essence and light.
The Three Realms all dissolve and vanish,
Living spirits thus become faint and indistinct.
Only the realm of the Ultimate Dao remains,
Where all existence suffers no premature harm.
Crimson light unfolds the Mystic Chart,
True scriptures scatter in the ten directions.
Wondrous qi descends to the Pure and Subtle,
The Flying Wheel binds the Primal Net.
The Numinous Treasure nurtures the Three Luminaries,
Myriad transformations again flourish and manifest.
Mystic talismans guard the Five Mountains,
The world’s mandate endures without end.
The Supreme Sage sits in the Round Net,
Ever dwelling in the Hall of Great Fortune.
The orthodox and imperial Dao of the Pole,
Is forever entrusted to the Perfected King.

**Second: The Great Demon’s Hymn of Praise, Expounding the Scripture’s Illuminating Influence**
Resplendent, the Mystic Net,
Circulating through the Eight Voids.
The wheels turn through all heavens,
Governing and convening at the Mystic Capital.
Majestic, the myriad spirits,
Encircling and attending the Emperor’s abode.
The Supreme Sage magnifies the supreme teaching,
The Yang-Permeating Net’s scriptures.
Ten transgressions unfold the numinous chapters,
All beings are illuminated and revived.
The wondrous Dao knows no limit,
A myriad heavens conceal a single pearl.
The immortals and Perfected rejoice without end,
The Jade Void receives the Mystic Talisman.
Crimson scriptures blaze in the azure empyrean,
Auspicious mists fill the floating void.
The great earth brings forth treasures and rarities,
The soaring trees bear jade pendants.
Phoenixes and unicorns descend to the world,
Jade mushrooms flourish in courtyard corners.
Through ten thousand kalpas, they attain peace,
The Mystic Transformation henceforth spreads.

**Third: The Perfected’s Proclamation of Manifest Auspicious Omens**
The Primordial Beginning, the Void Sovereign,
Loftily dwelling in the Jade Purity.
Giving birth to the Three Luminaries,
Establishing the heavens’ root.
To the right, arrayed in Mystic Splendor,
To the left, revolving the Round Brightness.
Dividing qi to descend to the Middle Heaven,
The Dipper and Pole Star are the supreme lords.
Uprightly seated, facing the Eight Directions,
Below, responding to the human sovereign.
If the human sovereign follows the Dao of Heaven,
Auspicious omens arise with virtue.
The earth yields the Register of Longevity,
Heaven bestows the Mystic Luminous Script.
Mountains and rivers float with refined qi,
Precious omens gather in the royal court.
The people suffer no disasters or pestilence,
The five grains ensure abundant harvests.
Clearly proclaiming the Supreme Lord’s decree,
All heavens are made to hear.
All beings rejoice and delight,
Bowing their heads to bear the Mystic Grace.

Above the Three Realms, amid the flying void,
The true demons’ song,
Its sound equaling the cavernous stanzas.
Reciting it a hundred times,
The name is recorded in the Southern Palace.
Reciting it a thousand times,
The true demons protect and welcome.
Ten thousand recitations, the Dao is complete,
Ascending to the Great Void,
Passing beyond the Three Realms,
Attaining the rank of Immortal Duke.
Those who hear the numinous sound,
Heavenly omens descend upon their bodies.
Demon kings revere their forms,
Commanding and restraining earthly deities.
Attending and escorting, sending and receiving,
They extricate them from the earthly gates.
The Five Sufferings and Eight Difficulties,
Seven generations of ancestors ascend and migrate,
Forever departing the Dark Palace,
Their souls cross the Vermilion Mound,
Undergoing refinement and rebirth.

This is called the immeasurable,
Universally delivering without end.
There are secret celestial writings,
Revered by all heavens.
Those who leak or profane them fall into hell,
Bringing calamity to their seven generations of ancestors.

The Dao says: These two chapters are the most numinous and hidden sounds of the Heavenly Emperors of all heavens. The qi of the Supreme Origin’s Great Harmony and Myriad Blessings, serving as omens and auspicious signs, are manifestly proclaimed to the sovereign. In humans, they become loyal, virtuous, and wise; in things, they become precious jades and wondrous marvels; among birds and beasts, they become unicorns, phoenixes, tortoises, and dragons; on earth, they become the five mushrooms, rare trees, precious stones, and the mountains and rivers’ auspices; in heaven, they become auspicious clouds, luminous stars, and sweet dew. When the human sovereign possesses the Dao, omens respond to the virtue he practices.

All are the words of the Great Brahma,
Not the common speech of the world.
Their words lack ornate beauty,
Their melodies lack florid embellishment,
Thus they are called profound and obscure,
Difficult to fathom in detail.
Heaven treasures them,
Secretly kept in the Divine Empyrean’s Jade Purity, the Jade Treasury’s Eastern Repository.
When the numbers align with the ren-chen day,
The destiny responds and transmits them below.
If a Perfected One offers gold and treasures with a sincere heart,
Following the old protocols to pledge alliance with the Three Heavens,
Only then are they bestowed.

The Dao says: When one practices benevolent virtue,
Heaven manifests auspicious omens to reward the sovereign.
When one commits the transgressions of an evil age,
Heaven displays calamities and anomalies to warn the people.
Thus, when the cycles of heaven and earth reach their end,
When the sun, moon, and five planets wane and wax,
When the sagely and divine persons prosper or decline,
When the lesser scholars suffer illness and harm—
In all such disasters,
Those of the same qi should unite in heart to perform purification rites,
Burn incense in the six watches,
Recite the scriptures ten times.
Auspicious omens will immediately descend,
Dispelling all inauspiciousness.

The scriptures of boundless measure deliver all beings without end.

The Dao says: When lesser scholars of shallow attainment face the destined end of their mortal span, their bodies passing through the Great Yin, at the moment of their passing, fellow practitioners of the Dao should burn incense and recite the scriptures ten times to properly conduct the departed form. Subtle and auspicious qi will silently descend upon the body, and the hun-soul will ascend directly to the Southern Palace, where, according to the merit of their studies, they will be reborn after a calculated number of days. Once the Wheel of Rebirth is no longer a source of confusion, they will attain the rank of divine immortals.

The Dao says: When the cycles of heaven and earth reach their end, when the constellations fall out of alignment, when the sun and moon lose their brightness, when the four seasons fall into disorder, when yin and yang are out of balance, when the realm is unsettled, when agriculture and commerce fail, when pestilence and poison spread—when the people suffer death and injury, when teachers and companions pass away—all should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures. For the merit of purification rites and scripture recitation is profound: above, it dispels heavenly disasters and safeguards the emperor; below, it wards off poison and harm, delivering the people. In life and death, all depend upon it, and its blessings are immeasurable. Thus it is called "boundless," universally delivering heaven and humanity.

The Dao says: Whoever possesses this scripture and performs these meritorious deeds for the rulers of heaven and earth and the people—on days of calamity, if they resolve to perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures ten times—auspicious omens will descend at once, and great peace will be eternally preserved. All the heavens will record their names, and the ten thousand spirits will attend and protect them. Those exceptional practitioners who succeed will become ministers of the Golden Gates of the Sage Lord. The heavens record the merits and transgressions of people without the slightest error. The true demons of heaven will also protect and recommend them, and those who attain the Dao will fully comprehend these most profound words.

Within the heavens, the Great Brahma’s hidden language resounds in boundless tones—composed by the Dao Lord, the *Primal Beginning’s Numinous Writ of Auspicious Talismans, the Melodic Chapter*.

The Dao says: These are the Great Brahma’s hidden words within the heavens, the boundless tones recorded in the ancient texts of the Heavenly Yellow Numinous Terrace. They summon the Twelve Mysterious Auspices and the Twenty-Four Responses within the realm of the Five Elders of the Primal Beginning’s Great Blessing Hall. The vermilion script and jade writ reveal the inception of auspicious talismans and responses, each character a full *zhang* in length. The Heavenly Perfected and August Ones of old inscribed these words to establish the correct sounds. Those who know these sounds and recite them with purification rites will have the Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings of all the heavens descend to observe them, record their merits, and report to the heavens above. The ten thousand spirits will pay homage, the earthly deities will attend at their gates, and the Great Merit True Demons will protect and recommend them to the Divine Empyrean. Once their Dao is complete, they will traverse the Three Realms and ascend through the Golden Gates.

This sound averts all, wards off all, delivers all, and accomplishes all—it is the natural sound of the Heavenly Perfected. Thus, reciting it causes the Flying Heavenly Ones to descend in observation, the Supreme Emperor to chant from afar, the ten thousand spirits to pay homage, the Three Realms to attend in reverence, the myriad demons to bow their heads, and ghostly spirits to vanish of their own accord. The chiming of jade-like tones resounds, the ten directions grow solemn and clear, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks swallow their mists, the ten thousand spirits tremble and submit, and the host of immortals is summoned. The heavens are free of impurity, the earth is free of demonic dust, dark wisdom becomes perfectly clear, and the boundless mystery of mysteries is revealed.

*The Supreme Wondrous Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for the Boundless Deliverance of Humanity, Upper Chapter, Scroll the Seventh—End. Scroll the Eighth.*

**The Pure and Subtle Golden Regulations**

The Dao spoke: Long ago, in the wondrous bounds of the Supreme Ultimate Heaven, within the numinous cavern of the Cloud-Soaring Tone of the Grand Mystery Transformation Realm, the Primordial Beginning received the *Pure and Subtle Golden Regulations of the Boundless Upper Chapters for the Deliverance of Humanity*. As the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning was about to expound this scripture, he circumambulated ten times to summon the ten directions, then took his seat.

The Heavenly Perfected Divinities, the Lofty and Venerable Upper Sages, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Nine Sages of the Pure and Subtle, the Heavenly Officials of the Upper Origin, the Guardian Immortal Kings of the Dharma, and an innumerable host arrived borne upon the void. Jade radiance and emerald chariots, the threefold purity of soaring clouds, feathered canopies streaming splendor, the dark emptiness scattering rosy mists, cinnabar landscapes floating in blossoming light—all dazzled the vast heavens.

For seven days and seven nights, the yang palaces and yin temples of the various heavens, the golden towers and jade pavilions, arrayed the true writ. A numinous breeze fanned the skies, concealed rhythms gave birth to sound, the primal net ceased its motion, and the twin luminaries ascended in brilliance. The lands, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees of the entire realm were leveled as one, no longer high or low, the earth transformed into azure jade, without any differing hue.

The host of Perfected attended the seat as the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, in profound repose, floated upon a nine-colored divine dragon. When the scripture was expounded once, the great sages of the various heavens simultaneously proclaimed its excellence. At that time, the men and women of the realm each roused their sincere devotion, yearning to behold the wondrous mystery.

When the scripture was expounded a second time, the numinous palace became empty and luminous, and understanding opened boundlessly. When expounded a third time, spirit and qi merged as one, and the ten directions were beheld in contemplation. When expounded a fourth time, enlightenment arose within the heart, and the power to transform and guide others was attained. When expounded a fifth time, future sentient beings were broadly received and led forth. When expounded a sixth time, the celestial immortals’ karma was realized, and the path of the Upper Perfected was cultivated. When expounded a seventh time, they transcended the Three Realms, becoming the seed-people of heaven. When expounded an eighth time, they beheld the Primordial Worthy and received divine titles and ranks. When expounded a ninth time, their names were inscribed in the Pure and Subtle register, entering the Upper Golden Regulations. When expounded a tenth time, they united with the sagely and became Perfected, forever severing the cycle of rebirth.

At that time, all the men and women of the realm, without exception, turned their hearts in devotion. All received protection and deliverance, attaining everlasting life.

The Dao spoke: At that time,

When the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded the scripture once, the Great Divine Lords of Boundless and Measureless Ranks who preside over generation in the eastern direction, with their innumerable hosts, arrived floating through the void. When expounded a second time, the Great Divine Lords of Boundless and Measureless Ranks who strike and uphold the law in the southern direction, with their innumerable hosts, arrived floating through the void. When expounded a third time, the Great Divine Lords of Boundless and Measureless Ranks who determine names in the western direction, with their innumerable hosts, arrived floating through the void. When expounded a fourth time, the Great Divine Lords of Boundless and Measureless Ranks who govern transformation in the northern direction, with their innumerable hosts, arrived floating through the void. When expounded a fifth time, the Great Divine Lords of Boundless and Measureless Ranks who review and memorialize in the northeastern direction, with their innumerable hosts, arrived floating through the void. When expounded a sixth time, the Great Divine Lords of Boundless and Measureless Ranks who disseminate teachings in the southeastern direction, with their innumerable hosts, arrived floating through the void. When expounded a seventh time, the Great Divine Lords of Boundless and Measureless Ranks who wield transformation in the southwestern direction, with their innumerable hosts, arrived floating through the void. When expounded an eighth time, the Great Divine Lords of Boundless and Measureless Ranks who inspect and examine in the northwestern direction, with their innumerable hosts, arrived floating through the void. When expounded a ninth time, the Great Divine Lords of Boundless and Measureless Ranks who oversee and observe in the upper direction, with their innumerable hosts, arrived floating through the void. When expounded a tenth time, the Great Divine Lords of Boundless and Measureless Ranks who perfect virtue in the lower direction, with their innumerable hosts, arrived floating through the void.

When the ten expositions were complete, the Great Perfected Divine Lords of the Ten Directions’ Boundless Realms arrived all at once. The men and women of the realm turned their hearts in devotion and reverence. Those who came were like fine rain or dense mist—innumerable hosts so vast that half the land of the realm sank beneath their weight, an event beyond restraint.

Thereupon, the Primordial Worthy gathered the subtle and wondrous qi of the Pure and Subtle, transforming it into a precious pearl. Its radiance was like a great star, suspended in the empty void a hundred paces above the earth. The Primordial Worthy ascended and led forth, and the Golden Regulations gave birth to the Perfected. The exalted transformations of the Highest Worthy manifested as Perfected of qi. The Great Divine Lords of the Ten Directions’ Boundless Realms who open and guide, with their innumerable hosts, all entered into the precious pearl. The celestials gazed upward and saw only a surging stream entering the pearl’s mouth. Once within, their whereabouts were unknown. The people of the realm dispersed, and the earth returned to levelness, no longer sunken or slanted.

Within the precious pearl, the Primordial Worthy completed the full exposition of the scripture. The Perfected oversaw the deliverance and bestowed it upon me. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words. When the Dharma affairs were roughly concluded, the myriad heavens returned to their stations. In an instant, all was silent, with no lingering resonance.

At that time, the celestials who encountered the scripture universally attained deliverance. All sentient beings realized auspicious conditions. The entire realm turned in reverence, all harmonizing with emptiness and clarity. Marvelous sight and marvelous hearing, marvelous awakening and marvelous knowing, marvelous being and marvelous non-being, marvelous union and marvelous separation, marvelous transformation and marvelous change—words aligned with the Supreme Dao, hearts practiced great compassion. Together they attained profound awakening, pure and unconditioned. The realm was at peace, the people prosperous, rejoicing in great harmony. From the scripture’s first promulgation, the realm was guided by the Dao. Those who had cultivated utmost sincerity, revered and honored it, all immediately received deliverance.

The Dao spoke: What the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded in the scripture are the concealed sacred titles of the Celestial Sovereigns of Transformative qi, the hidden and esoteric names of the Highest Perfected of the Ten Directions’ Boundless Realms, the inner secret chapters. These are also the sounds of the Nine Tiers establishing the Ultimate, the texts by which the Hundred Demons are examined—words not of this world’s common speech. The Supreme Perfected inscribed and recorded the Golden Regulations, concealing them within the Pure and Subtle. The prohibitions are most severe; even demonic officials cannot hear them. Within the Jade Void’s Mysterious Cavern, the Great Ultimate and Great Clarity, the thirty-nine heavens of the four realms, the divine immortals and Perfected, can all comprehend these chapters. Reciting them ten times, one’s voice shakes the Circular Net; the Great One oversees and protects, securing heaven and earth for kalpas without end. The Five Luminaries follow the Dao, sun and moon remain ever bright, the lands are at peace, and great harmony is forever preserved. The dead are revived, white bones become living persons. Flying immortals of the Great Void—reciting ten times, the Five Elders will sponsor them. The Three Realms bow in reverence, great demons submit in obeisance. Heavenly officials record their merit, and they ascend into the Cavern Perfected, forever attending the Primordial Worthy. Earthly immortals of the Nine Palaces—reciting ten times, the Primordial Elders descend to their courts, delivering them according to their wishes. Great compassion embraces all beings; the Jade Edict commands their reception, and they ascend to the heavens. Those who recite these chapters lightly bring calamity upon themselves. Those who honor and revere them will see their households flourish, generation after generation prospering, bound to auspicious conditions. Ten thousand disasters will not approach; a hundred spirits will guard their bodies.

This scripture is most exalted and wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital. It delivers countless beings, serving as the root of the myriad Dao. Its majestic model is of virtue beyond measure.

The Dao spoke: Whenever this scripture is recited ten times, all heavens arrive in unison. The suffering souls of ancestors from a hundred thousand generations are immediately delivered, ascending to the Vermilion Palace. After nine years of refinement, they receive transformation and rebirth, becoming noble persons. Those who diligently study the wondrous scripture, fulfilling their merit and perfecting their virtue, all attain divine immortality, ascending to the Golden Gates and roaming the Jade Capital. Scholars of the highest learning who cultivate and recite this scripture will have their names inscribed in the Golden Regulations. Myriad virtues will be perfected, and they will immediately receive deliverance, ascending to the Southern Palace. Those in the world who recite it will have divine officials descend to their bodies, extending their years and granting long life. Thereafter, all will realize the Dao of flying immortality. Their mysterious merit manifests externally, their divine qi fills them internally. Form and spirit are both wondrous, roaming the Great Void. This scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally delivering without end. All celestials receive its blessings; the living and the dead are graced with its kindness.

This treasure of heaven is not transmitted to the lower world. Only the most devoted scholars, offering gold and treasures to express their sincerity, may receive it by swearing an oath to heaven. Those who lightly disclose or disrespect it will bring calamity upon nine generations, eternally bound to serve as ghostly officials. The Cinnabar Jade Lads and Azure-Waisted Jade Maidens, forty-two each, patrol and guard the sacred text, protecting those who receive the scripture.

The Dao spoke: During the first month’s prolonged fast, recite and chant this scripture to open and guide the Nine Springs, illuminating the Nine Dark Realms. For the departed souls of past generations, sever their earthly bonds and deliver them to the Southern Palace.

In the seventh month’s prolonged fast, recite and chant this scripture, presenting petitions to the Clear and Subtle Realm. Your name shall ascend to the Golden Register, and your body shall attain immortality. The heavens shall inscribe your merit, and upon the Yellow Register and White Tablet, your death shall be erased and your life exalted.

In the tenth month’s prolonged fast, recite and chant this scripture. The Three Primes shall shine brightly, and your merit shall be attributed to the Lord Emperor. For the lord and master of the nation, for ruler and minister, father and son, may the dynastic fortune be securely established, the celestial mandate preserved, and the lineage endure unbroken. May he ever remain the sovereign of men, securely ruling his domain, and may the people proclaim great peace.

On the eight seasonal festivals, recite and chant this scripture. The heavenly immortals shall welcome you, and you shall become a Perfected One of the Nine Palaces.

On your natal day, recite and chant this scripture. Your soul and spirit shall become pure and upright, and the myriad qi shall unite with the immortal. You shall not endure suffering or distress; your form shall ascend and be promoted. Your radiance shall illuminate the Eight Darknesses, the Five Emperors shall attend your court, and the myriad spirits shall pay homage. Your name shall be inscribed in the heavens, and when your merit is complete and your virtue perfected, you shall ascend to the Great Mystery.

The Dao spoke: On the days of practicing the Dao, you must bathe in fragrant waters, fast, and enter the chamber. Face east, strike your teeth thirty-two times to ascend to the Thirty-Two Heavens, and bow in reverence thirty-two times. Close your eyes and silently envision yourself seated amidst clouds of blue, yellow, and white qi, both within and without shrouded in mist. A Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Lion, and White Crane stand arrayed to your left and right. The sun and moon illuminate the chamber with radiant brilliance. A circular halo emerges from your crown, its light suffusing the ten directions—all this must be vividly perceived.

Recite the secret incantation:
*"Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Lord of the Dao, summon forth from within my body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Attendant Messengers of the Left and Right, the Jade Lads who tend the incense, the Jade Maidens who transmit words, the Direct Attendants of the Five Emperors, and the Incense Officials of the Day—thirty-two each in number—to convey my entreaty. Today is an auspicious occasion, a prolonged fast in the pure hall, the cultivation of the supreme scripture for the boundless deliverance of beings. May my words ascend directly to the presence of the Most Honored One before the Supreme Thirty-Two Heavens of the Primordial Beginning."*

Conclude by drawing in qi thirty-two times, then face east and recite the scripture.

*The Supreme Primordial Scripture of Boundless Salvation, Wondrous Upper Chapter*

The Primordial Beginning’s Mysterious Treasure, the Root Canon of the Clear and Subtle Golden Register, Upper Chapter—its talismans respond to deliver humanity. The hidden secrets of celestial perfected ones coalesce with the qi of spontaneity, merging with the mysterious writ to conceal its utmost essence. The Void Sovereign opened the kalpa, giving birth to the manifold heavens. The radiant light of the Cavern expanded, and the Three Qi soared. It encompasses the great image and establishes the root of heaven. Inscribed on blue-green tablets and golden slips, it records the spirits universally. It upholds and extends the true Dao, resplendent in the unseen. The Twin Origins fly as luminous scenes, and the Five Qi flow as forms. Profoundly illuminating transformations, it generates and completes all kinds—this is the subtle and wondrous, the origin of the myriad Dao.

The Grand Tenuity’s Yang Florescence, the Purple Empyrean’s Jade Palace, ascends to the Great Veil and the lofty void of the Brahma heavens. The Three Perfected Ones dwell in profound obscurity, boundless and infinite. The Crimson Chaos merges with the Great Nonbeing, and the Jade Realm holds the honored seat. Manifesting in the ten directions, its boundless emanations spread the teachings of the Clear and Subtle, inscribing names in the Golden Register. Within it are the names of the myriad heavens and ten thousand emperors; within it is the Jade Emperor, the true ruler who roams the Brahma heavens; within it are the forms of mountains, rivers, seas, and peaks; within it are the texts for examining the multitude of demons; within it are the Three Heavens—Cavern Real, Cavern Mystery, and Cavern Spirit.

Opening heaven and establishing the ultimate, the great statutes soar as wheels. I now proclaim and universally summon the hundred spirits. The Three Primes convene as one, and the manifold heavens attend the court.

Together they ride upon luminous jade chariots and radiant cloud-borne carriages, drawn by threefold-pure flying clouds and celestial steeds with variegated beasts. Azure dragons gleam, and phoenix standards are raised. Streaming banners of light flutter, with the Nine Heavens’ feathered guards to the left and the Three Realms’ divine soldiers to the right. The Supreme Unity’s Primordial Emperor governs the myriad spirits, with the Crimson Emperor leading the way and the Dark Elder overseeing the covenant. Countless chariots and ten thousand riders float through the void, their luminous procession turning back as they summon immortals and gather perfected ones.

The imperial qi of the Clear and Subtle, the Great Cavern’s Mysterious Palace—nine luminaries assist in governance, and the great spirits merge as one. They collectively uphold the Golden Register, arraying their ranks in welcome. They review talismanic mandates and conceal the names of immortals and sages. Universally announcing to the Three Realms, the boundless and exalted ones, the Jade Towers of the Great Empyrean, the kalpa-measuring jade peaks—

The Purple Tenuity’s Northern Mansion, the Thirty-Nine Lords, seven revolutions and seven transformations, whirling waters dance in the heavens. The Mysterious Subtle coalesces into radiance, governing the Fengdu below. Curved mornings fly with canopies, convening at the Eastern River. Light unfurls the whirlwind, turning the celestial gate. The Dipper and Pole Star center the directions, aligning Kunlun. Unfolding the utmost subtlety, descending the qi of the mysterious elixir, it weaves through heaven and earth, preserving and delivering humanity. Generating, completing, and nurturing, it unites with me as an immortal. The Five Spirits become clear and bright, enduring for a billion kalpas without decline. Forever delivering the heavens’ practitioners, the people who study the Dao—inscribe their names on golden tablets and present them to the Purple Court.

below reaching the profound abyss, the Yellow Gate’s Mysterious Palace.
Turning back to the Nine Ramparts, the Thirty-Six August Ones,
the Five Great Domains’ pacification, the Ten Isles of the Immortals.
Cavern-heavens and blessed lands, boundless famous mountains,
the Eight Seas and Four Watercourses, the governing spirits and numina.

The Three Primordials’ Palace Lords, the boundless flying immortals,
all bestowed with true talismans, their merits inscribed in the imperial celestial archives.
Ranked in order and registers fixed, reported upward to the Three Heavens—
above the Three Heavens, joyous assemblies and karmic affinities arise.

Within lies the Golden Statutes of the Pristine Subtlety,
sacred realms’ immortal hymns, verses matching the lofty perfected.
**First: The Hymn of the Pristine Subtlety’s Transformative Qi**

Vast and distant, above Great Luo,
imperial qi descends to the Pristine Subtlety.
True radiance illumines the Jade Capital,
grasping and guiding the mechanism of right transformation.
Boundless, traversing the Dragon’s Haven,
flying past defeat and accomplishment.
The Three Realms dissolve into emptiness,
the great earth sinks into the Nine Abysses.
The Primordial Beginning pities the multitudes,
jade chapters descend upon the Five Mountains.
Dual luminaries soar with brilliance,
the primordial net encompasses the ten thousand spirits.
The *Dongzhen* conceals the jade texts,
the *Lingbao* establishes the root of heaven.
The *Dongshen* governs mysterious transformations,
the myriad forms arise therefrom.
The Heavenly Emperors of all directions are commanded,
to collectively examine the long-lived.
The firm winds uphold the earth’s pivot,
heaven’s decrees return to the August Lord.
Living beings bear great shelter,
through kalpas unnumbered, forever unshaken.

**Second: The Golden Statutes’ Register-Fixing Chapter**

Phoenix chariots dance in the wheeling sky,
halting their steeds at the misty mountain’s curve.
Kalpas measure the vast emptiness,
in an instant, the Three Florets unfold.
The Primordial Sage reviews the registers,
summoning spirits and demons from the void.
The Grand Clarity is difficult to cross,
revolving like dust and sand.
Pitying this cycle of departure and return,
flying immortals chant their odes.
Vast is the Dragon Han’s foundation,
the Dark Peak towers, lofty and jagged.
The ten thousand spirits gather at the imperial court,
the Eastern Well pierces the Celestial River.
Impure realms follow karmic bonds,
sinking and drowning—what recourse remains?
Recite this Pristine Subtlety’s scripture,
upright qi dispels perverse afflictions.
The Three Realms’ celestial folk,
all hasten to bathe in the Luminous Net.
May your Dao-fruit ripen,
your name carved in the Golden Statutes.
Eternally attuned to the principle of long life,
what are mere billions of years?

**Third: The True Immortals’ Hymn of the Sacred Realm**

The Round Net enfolds the Jade Void,
towering high, the Palace of Great Possession.
The soaring forests canopy the heavens,
the Nine Sages tread the numinous winds.
Feasting on radiance, embracing floral brilliance,
they wander carefree in the Grand Primordial.
Below, they roam the Mysterious Cavern’s realm,
commanding and guiding the flying celestial dragons.
The Thirty-Nine Dao Lords,
pay homage to the Void Sovereign.
Great compassion shakes the Dharma’s sound,
sacred blessings ever mist-like.
Edicts and seals open the celestial gates,
dispersing the Three Luminaries’ texts.
Jade decrees descend to Fengdu,
delivering the long-night souls.
Ghostly officials cease their interrogations,
yang light illumines the Nine Netherworlds.
The Three Paths’ torments still,
the Eight Ways’ flying wheels turn.
All beings preserve long years,
the world’s lands forever at peace.

This, above the Three Realms,
amidst the flying void,
the true immortals’ hymns,
their sounds matching the cavern’s scriptures.
Recite them a hundred times,
your name ascends to the Southern Palace.
Recite them a thousand times,
the demon kings guard and welcome you.
Ten thousand recitations, the Dao complete,
you ascend to the great void,
pass beyond the Three Realms,
and attain the rank of Immortal Duke.
Those who hear the true sounds,
spirits and demons show reverence,
edicts command earth deities,
to escort and receive you.
Delivered from the earth’s gates,
the Five Sufferings and Eight Hardships,
seven generations of ancestors ascend,
forever freed from ghostly officials,
souls cross to Vermilion Mound,
refined and reborn anew.

This is called boundless,
universal deliverance without end.
Yet these are the secret celestial texts,
revered by all heavens—
those who leak them fall to hell,
bringing calamity to seven generations of ancestors.

The Dao states:
These two chapters, along with the hymns of the Celestial Emperors and the Numinous Perfected Kings,
are hidden sounds,
all the speech of the Great Brahma,
not the common words of the mortal world.
Their words lack ornate beauty,
their melodies lack florid grace—
thus they are called profound and obscure,
difficult to fathom in detail.
Treasured by heaven,
secretly kept in the Jade Capital of the Divine Empyrean’s Mysterious Bureau,
they descend in accordance with the mysterious statutes every thirty-seven thousand years.
Only if a perfected person offers gold and treasures with a sincere heart,
following the old protocols to pledge allegiance to the Jade Clarity,
are they then transmitted.

The Dao states:
The revolutions of heaven and earth, too, have their ends.
The sun, moon, and five planets, too, wax and wane.
The utmost sagely divine persons, too, have their flourishing and decline.
The lesser learners, too, suffer illness and harm.

Whenever such calamities arise, all of like qi must unite in heart to perform purification rites, burn incense in the six periods, recite the scriptures ten times through, and harmonize the Three Qi with the spirits—thus all ten thousand disasters dissolve, heaven and earth attain clarity and tranquility, and the qi of the Mysterious Real descends.

The Golden Statutes and Jade Laws subdue and command spirits; the boundless scriptures universally deliver the limitless. The Dao states:

Those of shallow learning in the Dao, whose immortal ranks remain unfulfilled, when their destined time of dissolution arrives and their bodies pass through the Great Yin, at the moment of their crossing, fellow perfected persons of the same learning shall burn incense and recite the scriptures ten times on their behalf, thereby delivering the corporeal form according to the proper method. Unbroken and unharmed, their bodies remain firm and whole, their hun and shen ascend directly to the Southern Palace, and in accordance with their accumulated merit, they are reborn after a calculated span of days. With the Wheel of Transmigration unceasing, they then attain the immortality of divine transcendents.

The Dao states:

When the revolutions of heaven and earth reach their end and the great kalpa shifts, the stellar lodgings fall into disorder, the sun and moon lose their brightness, the four seasons lose their measure, yin and yang fall out of harmony, the lands suffer famine in their years, floods and droughts arise in their seasons, pestilential toxins spread, and masters and companions pass away—all should then perform purification rites, burn incense, recite scriptures, and meditate upon the Golden Statutes of the Pure and Subtle, invoking the qi of the Yang Florescence and the spirits of the Great Subtlety to sweep away the miasma of disaster.

The merit of purification rites and scripture recitation is most weighty: above, it dissolves the calamities of heaven and safeguards the sovereign; below, it wards off poisonous harms and delivers the myriad people. In life and death, all rely upon it—its blessings are immeasurable, universally delivering heaven and humanity.

The Dao states:

Whoever possesses this scripture and performs these meritorious deeds for the lords of heaven and earth and the myriad people—on the day of calamity, if they resolve in heart to perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture ten times—all the heavens shall record their names, and the ten thousand spirits shall attend and guard them. Those of exceptional attainment shall become sagely lords and ministers of the Golden Towers. The heavens record the merits and transgressions of people with flawless precision to the finest detail. The True Kings of Heaven shall also protect and recommend them. Only those who attain the Dao shall fully comprehend these most profound words.

The boundless hidden speech of the Great Brahma in the heavens—
*Scripture of the Primordial Numinous Writ: Golden Statutes and Jade Chapters of the Pure and Subtle*
Composed by the Dao Lord of the Eight Heavens of the East

The Flying Celestials convene in vast assembly, drifting transformations endlessly shift.
Dwelling long in the Primordial Pear, they oversee the expanses of the Southern Dipper.
Yin and Yang govern the straight path, bearing the golden shores of the marsh.
Vacuity is enriched to the utmost, the transmitted writ alone divides.
The Jade Ultimate awaits its threading, tribute and promotion turn the true wheel.
When the fruits of practice are perfected, the Pure Net’s script and clouds emerge.
Yet those who incline toward shallowness may only match the numinous origin in talent.
Wave-flowers still, winds cease, qi ascends to summon the years.

**Southern Eighth Heaven**
Mountains extend in luminous clarity, dark discourses flow in harmonious passage.
Radiance scatters through empty space, the Dipper’s tail scatters pearls.
Mountain thorns bind the records, bright revolutions respond to the tally.
Cinnabar dwellings blaze with cavernous flame, the Astral Strider points to the jade girdle.
Dazzling concealment draws upon repose, the Jasper Palace casts into the void.
What bamboo gives birth to nurture? The numinous court’s cypress-script.
Vast simplicity and righteous blossoms, the Dark Ford’s palace-capital.
Verdant pillars, crimson heavens, the Purple Empyrean floats in true alignment.

**Western Eighth Heaven**
The Boundary Master drifts in mist, establishing Jin and forging auxiliary bonds.
Great Purple recounts the Net, carefree and offering plainness.
Yang Tang records the directions, winding paths barely reach.
True awakening fills Wu, the imperial decree remains unfurled.
Luminous fluids intermingle, efficacious incantations guard the door alone.
The Gate of Reverence truly hastens, the vulgar expanse pities the measure.
Illumination pierces the hidden depths, intent and seal yearn for admiration.
First omens yield to harmony, ascending to the jade reins of leisure.

**Northern Eighth Heaven**
Primordial Simplicity, Eternal Light, the drum sounds before Xi Lü.
Supervision spreads to neighboring realms, martial brightness precedes righteousness.
The Northern Seal summons the ultimate, the Dragon Emperor’s flame and smoke.
Spirits distant, guiding birds, all causes contemplate the pattern.
Wondrous mystery circles six times, galloping ceases at Feng’s cinnabar.
Youthful constancy extends compassion, sincerity and vacuity dwell in the tranquil palace.
The Window’s strategy aids diligently, transcribing and dispelling with grasped brush.
Decrees bind the beginning of nurture, numinous themes compose the script.

**Dao’s Words:**
These are the boundless hidden speeches of the Great Brahma within the heavens, ancient scripts carved and inscribed within the Golden Towers and Jade Pavilions of the Flowering Chambers, to harmonize and regulate the Three Qi and pacify the myriad spirits. Each character spans a full *zhang* in breadth. The Heavenly Perfected and August Ones of old inscribed these texts to establish the true sounds. Those who know these sounds and can purify themselves to recite them shall have all the heavens dispatch Flying Celestial Divine Kings to descend and observe their persons, record their meritorious diligence, and ascend to report to the heavens. The myriad spirits shall pay homage, earthly deities attend at the gates, and the Great Merit Demon Kings shall protect and recommend the Three Mysteries. With the Dao perfected and attained, they may wander the Three Realms and ascend through the Golden Gate.

These sounds repel all, exorcise all, deliver all, and accomplish all—sounds of the Heavenly Perfected, spontaneous and natural. Thus, to recite them is to summon divine kings to descend and observe, the Supreme Emperor to chant from afar, the myriad spirits to pay homage, the Three Realms to attend in reverence. All malevolent beings bow their heads, ghostly essences vanish of themselves, jade chimes resound, the ten directions grow solemn and clear, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks swallow their mists. The myriad spirits tremble and submit, gathering immortals in assembly. The heavens are free of defilement, the earth devoid of demonic dust. Dark wisdom shines with luminous clarity, the vast measure is profoundly mysterious.

*The Marvelous Scripture of the Upper Chapters on the Limitless Salvation of Humanity, Scroll the Eighth—Concluded*
*Scroll the Ninth*

**The Jade Statutes of Yu-Yu: A Chapter**

The Dao spoke: Long ago in the Golden Radiance Azure-Light Heaven, within the Vermilion Empyrean’s flowing hymns of the Supreme Mystery’s wondrous land, the Limitless Upper Chapters of the Yu-Yu Jade Statutes were received from the Primordial Beginning’s salvation of humanity.

As the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning was about to expound this scripture, he circumambulated ten times to summon the ten directions, then ascended his seat. Heavenly perfected spirits, exalted sages, lofty worthies, perfected beings of wondrous conduct, the Nine Perfected of Highest Clarity, the perfected immortals of Yu-Yu, the true kings of the Three Realms, and countless multitudes arrived borne upon the void. Verdant blossoms and purple mists, jeweled chariots and cloud-borne carriages, numinous radiance and kingfisher canopies intermingled with the dawn’s glow, myriad hues resplendent, illuminating the empyrean vastness. For seven days and seven nights, the suns and moons of all heavens converged their light, the stars and constellations stilled their motion, and jade towers and pearl palaces shone as one. Heavenly winds brought gentle harmony, seas and mountains grew serene and clear. Throughout the land, mountains, rivers, forests, and groves leveled to perfect evenness, no longer high or low; the earth turned lustrous azure, moist and gleaming, its hues undifferentiated.

The assembled perfected beings took their seats as the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning sat in profound stillness upon a ninefold luminous jade-flowered treasure dais floating in the void. When he had expounded the scripture once, the great sages of all heavens simultaneously voiced their approval. At that moment, all men and women of the land awakened to the perfect enlightenment of wondrous nature, each attaining numinous clarity.

When he had expounded it a second time, their ears and eyes grew keen, awakening to Highest Clarity as the realm of Primordial Emptiness.

When he had expounded it a third time, their spirit and essence became firmly real.

When he had expounded it a fourth time, accumulated karmic deeds dissolved, and together they realized pure emptiness.

When he had expounded it a fifth time, calamities and illnesses ceased, and the seasons turned harmonious.

When he had expounded it a sixth time, wondrous qi transformed and circulated, and all things flourished.

When he had expounded it a seventh time, the true wind suffused all, and virtue/power renewed daily.

When he had expounded it an eighth time, the aged and infirm regained youth, all attaining long years.

When he had expounded it a ninth time, all universally received deliverance, ascending together as immortals.

When he had expounded it a tenth time, above in the heavens and below upon the earth, the myriad sages voiced their praise. At that moment, all men and women of the land were enveloped in the profound grace of the Dao, gazing upward in boundless reverence.

The Dao spoke: As the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning expounded the scripture once, the boundless and limitless perfected great spirits of the eastern direction, countless in number, arrived floating upon the void.

When he had expounded it a second time, the boundless and limitless perfected great spirits of the southern direction, countless in number, arrived floating upon the void.

When he had expounded it a third time, the boundless and limitless perfected great spirits of the western direction, countless in number, arrived floating upon the void.

When he had expounded it a fourth time, the boundless and limitless perfected great spirits of the northern direction, countless in number, arrived floating upon the void.

When he had expounded it a fifth time, the boundless and limitless perfected great spirits of the northeastern direction, countless in number, arrived floating upon the void.

When he had expounded it a sixth time, the boundless and limitless perfected great spirits of the southeastern direction, countless in number, arrived floating upon the void.

When he had expounded it a seventh time, the boundless and limitless perfected great spirits of the southwestern direction, countless in number, arrived floating upon the void.

When he had expounded it an eighth time, the boundless and limitless perfected great spirits of the northwestern direction, countless in number, arrived floating upon the void.

When he had expounded it a ninth time, the boundless and limitless perfected great spirits of the upper direction, countless in number, arrived floating upon the void.

When he had expounded it a tenth time, the boundless and limitless perfected great spirits of the lower direction, countless in number, arrived floating upon the void.

When the ten recitations were complete, the boundless perfected great spirits of the ten directions arrived as one. All men and women of the land turned their hearts in devotion, their numbers like fine rain or dense mist. Heavenly beings of subtle wonder merged with the utmost reality, their transformed bodies taking shape, branching into countless millions. Each declared to the other: “Through kalpas of awakening, we have realized the Dao, free from all defilements of dust. We have attained the dharmakāya, entered the contemplation of qi, and awakened to the profound emptiness. First, we dwelt in the Great Crimson Realm of Primordial Qi, the domain of the Dao’s wondrousness, within the realm of non-action. Next, we reached Yu-Yu, advancing in purity and truth, attaining the wondrous fruit and traversing the ultimate of the Dao. *Yu* speaks of vastness, *yu* of remoteness—boundless and infinite, thus it is called Yu-Yu, merging with the primordial essence to encompass all.”

“We have heard the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning expound the teachings, revealing the text of the Yu-Yu Jade Statutes, the supreme and greatest Dharma. It examines the true and tests the immortal, commands the myriad demons, dispels evil spirits, and transforms malevolence into goodness. Yet countless multitudes, half the land’s population, have caused the earth to sink unevenly, beyond restraint.”

The Celestial Worthy gazed down and addressed them all: “You who now study the Dao and ascend to truth, ranked among the Highest Clarity, dwelling in Yu-Yu—your dharmic nature is spontaneous, no longer subject to change. Gross habits are purified, subtle attachments do not arise; naturally, there are no faults, so what need is there for statutes? If one establishes teachings and imparts instruction to others, yet does not institute precepts and statutes to guide cultivation—it is like the Heavenly Emperor and the perfected immortals, who have transcended the nine grades and exhausted all karmic conditions, yet still wear square-toed shoes and round caps, bear swords and hold jade tablets, ride feathered chariots, and display dragon banners and phoenix canopies. These are established as models; how can they be disregarded? Now, I reveal the wondrousness of the Yu-Yu Jade Statutes, the texts that regulate the gods and sages of heaven and earth. Uphold them in your person, and their blessings will extend to ten thousand ancestors; practice them for a thousand days, and their grace will pervade the ten directions. Listen with reverence; do not neglect this divine text.”

Thereupon, the Celestial Worthy suspended a single treasure pearl, as large as a millet grain, in the midst of the empty mystery, five *zhang* above the earth. The Celestial Worthy led the way as the heavenly perfected spirits, exalted sages, lofty worthies, perfected beings of wondrous conduct, and the boundless perfected great spirits of the ten directions—countless multitudes—all entered the pearl. The heavenly beings gazed upward, seeing only a shimmering light entering the pearl’s mouth. Once inside, they knew not where they were. The people of the land dispersed, and the earth returned to levelness, no longer uneven or sunken.

Within the treasure pearl, the Celestial Worthy expounded the sutra in its entirety. The assembled perfected beings oversaw the transmission, bestowing it upon me. At that moment, joy and celebration defied expression. Once the ritual affairs were roughly concluded, the myriad heavens resumed their positions, and in an instant, all fell silent without a trace of lingering resonance.

At that time, the celestial and mortal beings who encountered this scriptural Dharma were universally delivered and saved, preserving their allotted years without harm or injury. The entire land turned in reverence, all practicing the true Dao. Without selfishness or malice, without leakage or defilement, without entanglement or delusion, without desire or impurity, without greed or wrath. Their words were free from falsehood, their mouths chanting only virtuous sounds. Equal in compassion and love, even those of different bones became kin. The land was at peace, the people prosperous, rejoicing in great harmony as the scripture first emerged to teach.

In a kingdom where the Dao prevailed, those with sincere devotion who revered and honored it were all delivered across the world. The Dao declared: The teachings expounded by the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning within this sutra are the inner names of the myriad heavenly Thearchs, the hidden rhymes of sound, as well as the concealed appellations of the True King of Jade Law of Yu Yu and the hundred spirits. They are the secrets of the Highest Clarity and the essentials of the Nine Perfected. Those who comprehend this Dao, through the Dharma, become real; through reality, they meet the Dao; the Dao’s subtlety merges with the spirit, forgetting the spirit in emptiness and guarding the Dao in nothingness. It presides before heaven and earth, and dwells alone after heaven and earth. Without the Jade Law of Yu Yu, how could the divine transformations reach every corner? This is no ordinary speech of the world.

The exalted sages who have attained perfection, who fathom the profound and investigate the subtle, can fully grasp its chapters. Reciting it ten times, the various immortals praise it, the ten thousand Thearchs rejoice, heaven and earth become pure and solemn, harmonious qi surges and blends. The Three Origins bestow auspicious signs, the Nine Ramparts emit blessings, subduing evil and demons, dispelling malevolent spirits and omens. The realms of suffering vanish, and all ascend to bliss. For those scholars devoted to learning, reciting it ten times will summon descending perfected spirits, attract wondrous essences, refine the spirit to attain immortality, and command the life-protecting deities to welcome them. They will deliver their seven ancestors, receive transformation in the Vermilion Mound, avert and dispel calamities—nothing will not be divine.

The reason for this is that the primordial true qi emerges from the Supreme Sovereign; the sounds of the mysterious void fully accord with the utmost extremity. The Primordial Chaos intermingles and excites, spreading virtue to generate and complete. All things in the multitude universally receive its grace. To recite this chapter lightly brings misfortune upon oneself. To honor and revere it brings prosperity to one’s household, flourishing through the generations, intertwined with good causes. Ten thousand disasters will not encroach, and divine luminaries will guard the gate.

This sutra is revered and wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital. It delivers boundless beings and is the origin of the ten thousand Dao. Its majestic and vast model is of virtue too great to surpass. The Dao declared: Whenever this sutra is recited ten times, the ten thousand sages stand in awe, and the myriad heavens arrive in unison. With the Jade Law of Yu Yu, they examine and restrain the immortals and sages, commanding the divine spirits—none fail to revere and fear it. It commands the release of the Northern Feng, delivering the suffering souls of billions of ancestors, guiding them to ascend to the Vermilion Palace, where after nine years of refinement, they receive transformation and rebirth, becoming noble persons.

Those who diligently study this sutra, fulfilling their merit and perfecting their virtue, will govern the ten thousand spirits, their Dao extending to all beings, all attaining divine immortality. They will ascend to the Golden Gates and wander in the Jade Capital. For advanced scholars who cultivate and recite this sutra, the divine Thearchs descend in assembly. The Three Fields and Nine Palaces, the Caverns of Radiance, gather and illuminate, their jade light resplendent. The body’s spiritual fortress is secured, and they attain longevity.

For mortals who receive and recite it, past sins are dissolved. Those who follow the Dao and aspire to immortality, accumulating good deeds, will transcend worldly bonds. Later, they will all achieve the Dao of liberation through apparent death, their souls and spirits temporarily extinguished, bypassing hell to immediately regain their forms and roam the great void. This sutra is subtle and wondrous, universally delivering without end. All celestial and mortal beings receive its blessings, its boundless fortune bestowing grace upon life and death.

It is treasured by heaven and not transmitted to the lower world. Only the most devoted scholars, offering gold and treasures to express their sincerity, may swear an oath to heaven and transmit it. To leak or disrespect it lightly brings calamity upon nine generations, condemning them to long servitude under the ghost officials. The Five Thearchs attend the sutra, with twenty-four Jade Lads and twenty-four Jade Maidens each, safeguarding the divine text and protecting the bodies of those who receive it.

The Dao declared: During the long fast of the first month, recite and chant this sutra, and the Azure Thearch will uphold the law, the Heavenly Officials will report merit, delivering the souls of past generations from earthly servitude to ascend to the Southern Palace. During the long fast of the seventh month, recite and chant this sutra, and the White Thearch will uphold the law, the Earthly Officials will report merit. The body attains divine immortality, and the names of the various heavens are inscribed on the Yellow Register and White Slips, erasing death and recording life. During the long fast of the tenth month, recite and chant this sutra, and the Black Thearch will uphold the law, the Water Officials will report merit. For kings, emperors, lords, ministers, fathers, and sons, it will stabilize the nation’s destiny, preserving the heavens’ longevity, ensuring the lineage endures through the generations, perpetually ruling as sovereigns, securing their domains, and bringing peace to the people.

On the days of the eight solar terms, recite and chant this sutra, and the laws will encompass the eight heavens, alerting and exhorting the hundred spirits, enabling one to become a Perfected of the Nine Palaces. On one’s natal day, recite and chant this sutra, and the Crimson Palace will receive the true, summoning spirits in accordance with the law. The hun and po souls will be purified, the ten thousand qi will endure, suffering will be avoided, and the body will radiate light. The Three Realms will attend and guard, the Five Thearchs will welcome, the ten thousand spirits will pay homage, the name will be inscribed in heaven. With merit fulfilled and virtue perfected, one will ascend to the Highest Clarity.

The Dao declared: On the days of practicing the Dao, one should bathe with fragrant water, enter the chamber in purification, face east, and knock the teeth thirty-two times, ascending to be heard by the thirty-two heavens. Bow thirty-two times in the heart. Close the eyes and silently envision the body seated amidst clouds of nine-colored luminous qi, both within and without shrouded in mystery. A Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Lion, and White Crane array themselves to the left and right. The sun and moon illuminate brilliantly, suffusing the chamber with radiance. A circular image appears above the neck, its light shining in the ten directions—all clearly manifest.

The secret incantation says:
"Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Dao Lord, summon forth from within my body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the left and right official messengers, the Jade Lads attending incense, the Jade Maidens transmitting words, the Five Thearchs’ direct talismans, the incense officials of the day—thirty-two each—to report and convey these words."

Today is an auspicious and joyous occasion, the hall purified through prolonged fasting, the scripture of cultivation recited to deliver boundless beings. May these words ascend unobstructed, reaching the august presence of the Most High Primordial Sovereign of the Thirty-Two Heavens. Conclude by drawing qi thirty-two times, then face east to recite the scripture:

the Heavenly Title: Great Crimson.

The Origin as Jade Clarity, the Heavenly Title: Pure Subtlety.
Before the Three Qi divided, all cavernously merged as one;
when the Three Radiances opened their light, the Three Qi then separated.

In the era of Crimson Chaos, the Jade Rhythm lay hidden,
primordial qi interwoven, forming patterns in its embrace.
Its qi concealed and stored, merging into jade essence,
through countless eons in the midst of primordial chaos.

wondrous qi vast and boundless, jade light congealing into essence.

Determining and selecting the lofty spirits, encompassing the mysterious registers,
promoting and delivering those destined for immortality, ascending to roam Supreme Clarity,
entering and exiting the Flowery Chambers, descending to extend true qi.
The essence of numinous subtlety, descending to irrigate the Gate of Life,
the Crimson Chamber of the Muddy Pellet, harmonizing the Five Qi within,
merging the hundred spirits.

bodies attaining rebirth, ascending to report to the various heavens.
Above the various heavens, each has its immortal gate.
Within lies the Cavernous Void’s ballad and song,
the true kings’ numinous chapters, verses matching the lofty Perfected.

**First: The Jade Rhythm of Yu Yu, the Pure Mystery’s Flying Void Melody**
Beyond the three realms, vast and distant,
primordial qi congeals into cinnabar mystery.
Amid jade towers and resplendent mists,
crimson gates connect with vermilion smoke.
Within resides the Lord of Emptiness,
governing and transforming, ruling all heavens.
Wondrously inspecting, inscribing jade script,
emerging before the Great Beginning.
The Three Luminaries radiant and bright,
weaving and encompassing all spirits.
Investigating and restraining a hundred wrongs,
preserving and delivering moral people.
Aligning with the pure and responding to the standard,
what need to fear demonic hordes?
Cavernous radiance without distant burdens,
countless kalpas forgetting loss and gain.
Who knows this ultimate use?
It can preserve eternal endurance.

**Second: The Jade Rhythm’s Chapter on Inspecting and Restraining Spirits**
At the dawn of the Crimson Clarity’s great kalpa,
mysterious purity illuminated jade script.
Majestic the Numinous Treasure Lord,
grasping the origin of all transformations.
Lord of heaven, earth, mountains, and rivers,
spirits and controllers wield my authority.
Yin and yang harmoniously unite,
vast and boundless, free from evil and treachery.
Regulating the qi of great peace,
evil and upright must not interfere.
Upholding my rhythmic scriptures,
daily preserving the flourishing of virtue and power.

Should any dare to spread poisonous tyranny,
defiling my pure and tranquil breeze,
the Five Emperors shall unleash their might,
swiftly dispatching them to the Flowing Fire Palace.
Deceit and recklessness, though clamorous,
shall find no tolerance in my restraint.
Merits and faults bear no slightest error—
their records ascend to the Jade Firmament’s halls.
Those with karmic affinity transcend,
together returning to the Great Mystery.

**Third: The Jade Rhythm’s Hymn of the Primordial Sovereign’s Ascension**
I traverse the Upper Clarity’s realm,
gazing back upon the Three Realms below.
With a gesture, I overlook the myriad heavens;
in an instant, I rein the soaring dragons.
The human body is but a temporary hut,
while the inch-field is assailed by a hundred delusions.
Unknowing that spirit and qi will exhaust,
the Five Paths become like cages.
One must contemplate the vision of absolute learning,
where the Dao’s qi perpetually intermingles.
Spirit congeals, form naturally parts,
mysterious shadows blend in obscurity.
Yin extinguished, demonic filth vanishes,
pure emptiness merges with the Great Void.
Refined into an immortal’s essence,
the record ascends to the Azure Lads.
When true subtlety fills to overflowing,
blessings extend to ancestral lineages.
Treading the radiance, I stride the vast expanse—
how could ten thousand kalpas ever end?
Were I not a lofty perfected one,
how could I aspire to the Primordial Chaos?
Heavenly beings join my journey,
unsurpassed joy knows no bounds.
Were it not for these rhythmic precepts,
how could the mysterious breeze be stirred?

Above the Three Realms,
within the flight of emptiness,
resounds the song of the True Kings,
its melody interwoven with cavernous hymns.
Recite it a hundred times,
and your name shall pass through the Southern Palace.
Recite it a thousand times,
and the True Kings shall safeguard and welcome you.
Ten thousand recitations complete the Dao,
ascending through the Great Void,
transcending the Three Realms,
to be enthroned as an Immortal Duke.
Those who hear this numinous sound
shall be revered by the True Kings,
who command earthly deities
to escort and attend them.
Delivered from the earthly gates,
the Five Sufferings and Eight Hardships,
seven generations of ancestors ascend,
forever freed from the earthly barriers.
The soul crosses the Vermilion Mound,
undergoes refinement, and is reborn—
this is called the immeasurable,
universal deliverance without end.

Secret scriptures of the heavens above,
revered by all celestial realms.
To leak or profane them is to fall into hell,
bringing calamity upon seven generations of ancestors.

The Dao declares: These two chapters are the hidden melodies of the Celestial Emperors and the Numinous True Kings, the Jade Rhythms of Yu’s Remnant. They govern heaven and earth, restrain immortals and spirits, and comprise the most solemn celestial prohibitions—no ordinary words of the world. Their language lacks ornate beauty, their tunes lack florid embellishment; thus, they are profound and obscure, difficult to fathom. Treasured by the heavens, they are concealed within the Eastern Scripture’s Treasure Chamber of the Divine Firmament’s Jade Clarity. When the Dao Lord opened the teachings, they flowed forth in accordance with the kalpa’s turning.

Should a perfected one, bearing gold and treasures with a sincere heart, follow the ancient rites to pledge allegiance to the Ten Heavens, only then shall they be bestowed.

The Dao declares: The Jade Rhythms of Yu’s Remnant oversee the myriad perfected ones, recording merits and faults, scrutinizing the hundred spirits. When heaven and earth’s movements reach their end, when the sun, moon, and five stars wane and wax, when the most sagely and divine suffer decline, or when lesser scholars fall ill—all such disasters are governed by celestial officials appointed to oversee them. Thus, the gains and losses of the azure heavens are subject to the Jade Rhythms’ examination; no private interference is permitted. Should any dare to conceal or act recklessly, inviting misfortune and blame, the Rhythms shall not pardon them. All of shared destiny must unite in heart to perform purification rites, burn incense in the six periods, and recite the scriptures ten times.

When Daoists ascend the altar, solemn and orderly, reciting this great scripture of the Jade Rhythms in accordance with the rites, blessings and virtue shall descend at once, dispelling all inauspicious omens. This boundless text universally delivers without end.

The Dao declares: When lesser scholars of shallow attainment, or those whose immortal rank remains unfulfilled, face the kalpa’s end and pass through the Great Yin, at the moment of their crossing, fellow scholars and perfected ones shall burn incense and recite the scriptures ten times on their behalf, to deliver the corpse in accordance with the rites. Then the Earthly Officials, upholding the Rhythms, shall investigate; earthly deities shall restrain the soul and refine the corpse. The wind-tigers within the earth shall not harm them, and the soul shall ascend directly to the Southern Palace, where, according to their accumulated merit, they shall be reborn after a calculated time. No longer bewildered by the turning wheel, they shall attain immortality.

The Dao declares: When the movements of heaven and earth reach their end, when the constellations fall into disarray, the sun and moon lose their brightness, the four seasons falter, yin and yang fall out of harmony, nations suffer floods and droughts, warfare and banditry arise, plagues and poisons spread, the people perish in great numbers, masters and friends pass away, and those of shared destiny meet their end—all such transgressions against the Jade Rhythms and violations feared by the spirits—one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures. The merit of fasting and reciting scriptures is profound: above, it dispels celestial disasters and safeguards the emperor; below, it wards off poisons and delivers the people. Both the living and the dead benefit, their blessings beyond measure—thus it is called the immeasurable, universally delivering heaven and humanity.

The Dao declares: Whoever possesses this scripture and performs these meritorious deeds for the rulers of heaven and earth and the people shall, on days of disaster, resolve to perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures ten times. All the heavens shall record their names, and the myriad spirits shall attend and protect them. Those distinguished as perfected ones shall become ministers of the Golden Gates of the Sagely Lord. The heavens record merits and faults with flawless precision. The True Kings of the heavens shall also safeguard and recommend them, and those who attain the Dao shall thoroughly comprehend these ultimate words.

The immeasurable hidden sounds of the Great Brahma in the heavens—
Composed by the Dao Lord,
The Jade Volume of the Numinous Writings of Yu’s Remnant from the Primordial Beginning,
The Eight Heavens of the Eastern Direction.

The Chamber and Heaven’s Odes intertwine, Han and Tuo pledge in darkness.
Veiled leaks and the Marquises of Yi, the true Alignments of Guan and Shen.
Encroaching shadows and silk-bound strikes, azure threads winding through courier peaks.
Jade endures to revive governance, proclaimed as the Nine Nets of Huan.
Elusive nets and upright ugliness, rosy clouds spun to discard gold.
Dew’s radiance suddenly soars, rejoicing in the embankments of streams.
Joy unfolds in jade stillness, the treasure-fluid cauldron overflows.
Discerning the celestial stems’ auspices, the Three Perfected of Ren and He.

**The Eight Heavens of the Southern Direction**
The Divine Auroras of Shenxiao, alerting the Azure Tiger’s mists.
The pot’s square settles within, decrees empowering the numinous.
Peaks shall slay demons, wisdom’s light purifies the primordial.
Relying on shamans to appear, examining souls and hidden proclamations.
Immortal arts depend on intent, the true flower’s mandate summons.
Escaping the scorched path to save the burning, the Great Celestial Purple Lord.
The Heavenly Peak’s secret taboos, the inner seclusion of the Dharma Wheel.
The Pengfu oversees and monitors, transforming and delivering the seed-people.

**The Eight Heavens of the Western Direction**
The Jade Gates of the Luminous Capital, unveiling the Kunlun’s jade moon.
Fire commands hurl thunder, the Eight Slaughters restrain and inspect.
The stalwart fortresses of divine emperors, quaking sincerity governs immortals.
Vast and drifting, servitude and punishment, the outstanding summon the Dragon Crags.
Engraving distant paths, the Prosperous Gate enters the true.
Flying armor and hastening halberds, stabilizing the marvelous Left Spirits.
Surveying Jin and Yin’s springs, darkly penetrating the lucid souls.
Returning transformations to hidden protection, the Eastern Talisman Dao Lord.

**The Eight Heavens of the Northern Direction**
The Dao’s vast beauty in time, the void’s essence and the Yellow Governance.
Pervasive samādhi, Dharma treasures played and presented.
The Jade Mystery’s radiant scripture, the Mao light’s embryonic subtlety.
Concealed purity spans the distant, the silent abyss of pure subtlety.
Crimson shrines awaken the numinous, relying on them to assist the king.
Glancing to aid vast shores, moisture nourishing the splendid wilderness.
The Dipper Youth records the charts, unfolding the ford’s ancestral roots.
Endless obscurity without trace, the echoing resilience of Lu’s strength.

The Dao states: These are the Great Brahma’s hidden sounds within the heavens, the inner stanzas of the Jade Canon, the immeasurable tones. The ancient text was inscribed upon the Jade Gates of Yu’s Remnant, to rectify the script of the Jade Canon. The Upper, Middle, and Lower Perfected, the honored spirits of the heavenly officials, reverently bear it and dare not transgress. It is not for the governors of the underworld, the two-thousand-bushel lords, to receive and uphold. Each character spans a full *zhang* in length. Those who study and attain it may soar in spirit to Yu’s Remnant, receive office in the Jade Celestial Court, or dwell hidden in cloud abodes, descending to wander among mortals. They may employ its Dao to summon and command mountain spirits, examine and record the myriad ghosts, and inscribe their names in the Upper Clarity.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign of old transcribed this text to establish the correct intonation. Those who know its sounds and can fast and recite it shall have all the heavens dispatch the Central Heaven’s demonic generals—seven named great commanders—and the Perfected Immortals of the Great One to descend and observe their bodies, attaching to their original spirits. For the multitudes, they bestow numinosity, record their meritorious diligence, and memorialize the heavens. The myriad spirits pay homage, earth deities attend at the gates, and the Great Merit Perfected Kings safeguard and recommend the Divine Auroras. When the Dao is complete and attained, one may wander the Three Realms and ascend through the Golden Gates.

This sound repels all, exorcises all, delivers all, and accomplishes all—it is the Heavenly Perfected’s natural tone. Thus, reciting it causes divine demons to descend and observe, the Celestial Thearch to echo in song, the myriad spirits to pay homage, the Three Realms to attend at the chariots, and all malevolent beings to bow their heads while ghostly essences perish of themselves. The jade-like resonance vibrates, the ten directions grow solemn and pure, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks swallow their mists. The myriad spirits tremble and submit, summoning and gathering the host of immortals. Heaven is free of miasmic filth, earth is without demonic dust. Profound wisdom illuminates the pure, the vast and mysterious abyss of the abyss.

**The Wondrous Sutra of the Numinous Treasure’s Immeasurable Deliverance of Humanity, Upper Chapter, Scroll the Ninth—Concluded**
**Scroll the Tenth**

**The Great Scarlet Writ of the Numinous Treasure**

The Dao spoke: Long ago in the Purple Dawn Heaven, within the Great Luminous Treasure Land of soaring golden and azure radiance, the Primordial Beginning received the *Great Scarlet Writ of the Immeasurable Upper Chapters on Deliverance*. As the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning was about to expound this sutra, he circumambulated ten times to summon the ten directions, then ascended his seat.

The Heavenly Perfected, the Most High and Venerable, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the True Kings of Grand Purity, the Sages of the Seven Heavens, the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Ultimate, their attendant officials left and right, the numinous officials and youths—an innumerable host—came riding upon the void. Cloud-borne chariots and flying carriages, jade palanquins and wheel-rimmed coaches, crimson canopies casting shadows, jade blossoms scattering radiance, five hues streaming in dazzling brilliance, illumining the vast firmament.

For five days and five nights, the realms of the heavens and the Dao’s domains, the profound and flourishing carriages, the divine nets ceasing their wheels, the jade standards and golden pivots—all halted their motion at once. The winds of heaven stilled their whispers, empty images congealed in the empyrean, clouds concealed their ripples, and the cosmos grew serene and pure. The lands, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees of the entire realm leveled into perfect evenness, no longer high or low; the earth became translucent, its piled verdure glowing with radiance, no hue differing from another.

The host of Perfected attended the seat as the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning sat in profound stillness upon a floating five-hued luminous jade lotus. After expounding the sutra once, the great sages of the heavens all praised it as excellent. At that moment, all men and women of the realm awakened to the Great Void and attained the Dao of non-action.

After expounding the sutra a second time, they perceived the Dharma-body in its entirety, forever free from the dust of defilement.

After expounding it a third time, their minds transcended the wondrous origin, penetrating all Dharma-aspects.

After expounding it a fourth time, their divine wisdom became complete, and they roamed freely in flight.

After expounding it a fifth time, their eloquence flowed like a stream, proclaiming the supreme Dao.

After expounding it a sixth time, they reflected upon the radiance of the womb-light, their concentration endless.

After expounding it a seventh time, the Jade Palaces harmonized their qi, and the divine palaces streamed with pearls.

After expounding it an eighth time, the kalpa-trees turned their shadows, universally shading the heavens.

After expounding it a ninth time, the myriad beings flourished, none perishing prematurely.

After expounding it a tenth time, heavenly music floated in the void, cloud encampments and auspicious mists gathered. At that moment, all men and women of the realm turned their hearts in devotion, all received protection and deliverance, and all attained longevity.

The Dao spoke: At that time, as the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning expounded the sutra once, the boundless and immeasurable Perfected Great Spirits of the East, an innumerable host, arrived floating upon the void.

After expounding it a second time, the boundless and immeasurable Perfected Great Spirits of the South, an innumerable host, arrived floating upon the void.

After expounding it a third time, the boundless and immeasurable Perfected Great Spirits of the West, an innumerable host, arrived floating upon the void.

After expounding it a fourth time, the boundless and immeasurable Perfected Great Spirits of the North, an innumerable host, arrived floating upon the void.

After expounding it a fifth time, the boundless and immeasurable Perfected Great Spirits of the Northeast, an innumerable host, arrived floating upon the void.

After expounding it a sixth time, the boundless and immeasurable Perfected Great Spirits of the Southeast, an innumerable host, arrived floating upon the void.

After expounding it a seventh time, the boundless and immeasurable Perfected Great Spirits of the Southwest, an innumerable host, arrived floating upon the void.

After expounding it an eighth time, the boundless and immeasurable Perfected Great Spirits of the Northwest, an innumerable host, arrived floating upon the void.

After expounding it a ninth time, the boundless and immeasurable Perfected Great Spirits of the Upper Realm, an innumerable host, arrived floating upon the void.

After expounding it a tenth time, the boundless and immeasurable Perfected Great Spirits of the Primordial Ultimate of the Lower Realm, an innumerable host, arrived floating upon the void.

When the ten recitations were complete, the boundless Heavenly Perfected Great Spirits of the ten directions and ten realms arrived as one. All men and women of the realm turned their hearts in devotion. Those who came were like drifting clouds laden with rain—an innumerable host, each bowing their heads to reverently salute the jade steps.

They declared: "Our heavens reside above the multitudes of living beings, within the Great Scarlet Void of Grand Purity. The myriad phenomena of heaven arise with thought and vanish with its cessation. Vast and boundless, radiant and expansive, within the realm of the Dao, the nine qi and sacred ranks ascend beyond all karmic entanglements. All empty imaginings, neither existing nor non-existing, are transcended, and enlightenment is eternal.

The Great Scarlet Heaven is the third of the Great Voids, its luminous realm suffused with the hues of the Three Flowers. Below, it stabilizes the revolving wheels, safeguarding the celestial palaces. We reverently hear that the Celestial Worthy has revealed this Numinous Writ in the Supreme Ultimate and August Perfected Immortal Realm, manifesting its profound mysteries. Within the empyrean, all beings—even those in the divine continents and immeasurable worlds—attain the supreme fruit and accumulate boundless merit. We each align our minds with the Dao, awaiting the supreme words of the Great Perfected Law."

Thereupon, the Primordial Beginning suspended a single treasure-pearl, as large as a millet grain, in the void five *zhang* above the earth. The Celestial Worthy ascended and led the Heavenly Perfected, the Most High and Venerable, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the boundless and immeasurable Perfected Great Spirits of the ten directions, and the innumerable host—all entering into the treasure-pearl. The heavenly beings gazed upward and saw the Great Scarlet Writ of the Numinous Treasure entirely within the pearl, its expanse a *zhang* wide, its eight corners casting rays. They saw only a surging brilliance entering through the pearl’s opening. Once inside, its whereabouts were unknown.

The people dispersed, and the earth returned to levelness, no longer sunken. Within the treasure-pearl, the Celestial Worthy completed the sutra’s exposition in full. The host of Perfected oversaw its transmission, bestowing it upon me. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words.

When the Dharma rites were roughly concluded, the heavens returned to their stations. In an instant, all was silent, no sound lingering. At that time, the heavenly beings who encountered the sutra’s teachings were universally delivered, their lifespans preserved in full, free from harm. The entire realm turned in devotion, all attaining the mysterious void—thoughtless and unthinking, formless and soundless, free from killing and desire, from defilement and filth, from delusion and selfishness.

Words held no florid adornment, speech bore no harsh sound. Alike in compassion and love, even those of different bones became kin. The land stood secure, the people prospered, rejoicing in great peace. When the sutra first emerged as teaching, the entire realm followed the Dao. Those who held utmost sincerity, revered and honored it, all attained deliverance across the ages.

The Dao declared: The names spoken by the Boundless Celestial Worthy within the sutra’s exposition are the inner appellations of the myriad heavenly Lords, the hidden rhymes of sound, also the Great Crimson Numinous Script, the Jade Characters of the Nine Empyreans, the concealed names of the Supreme Perfected. They are not the common words of this world.

The ranked sages, having realized true immortality, penetrated the profound and fathomed the subtle, girding themselves with the Crimson Script. Those who master its chapters and recite them ten times over—heavenly hosts chant afar, the ten thousand Emperors render homage, the numinous script unfolds in vastness, transforming the ten directions into mystery. All divine spirits return to perfect resonance; the true Dao emerges in manifestation. Hordes of demons bind their forms, ghostly essences extinguish their clarity, cinnabar characters open life, reviving corpses from death, transmuting white bones into living beings.

For scholars of the highest learning, reciting it ten times elevates their qi beyond the five celestial bodies, their virtue stirs the three realms. Demon essences lose their sight, ghostly perversities extinguish their clarity. Those on the brink of death are rescued and delivered; the sunken rise to ascend.

The reason for this: when scholars first comprehend the mysterious void, their Dao ascends to the Great Crimson, reverently savoring the numinous script. Though their embodiment has yet to merge with the ultimate truth, they wield power to restrain the hundred demons and penetrate the profound. They deliver the myriad subtleties, yet only ascend—unable to fully penetrate the mystery.

To recite these chapters lightly brings calamity upon oneself. To offer reverent devotion and honor opens the gates to flourishing; generation after generation thrives in splendor, bound to good karmic causes. Ten thousand disasters cannot encroach; divine luminaries guard the gate. This sutra is most venerable and wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital. It delivers countless beings, serving as the root of all Dao. Its majestic and vast model of virtue is beyond measure.

The Dao speaks: Those who recite this sutra ten times and attain comprehension shall have their Dao harmonize with the Great Crimson, their qi unite with the Supreme Clarity. All karmic entanglements and worldly obstructions dissolve in that very moment. Abiding in singular mystery and void, faint as a shadow, radiant and serene, they perceive with crystalline clarity the wondrous essence of the Dao—thus becoming perfected beings. All heavens assemble; billions of ancestors across myriad generations, along with suffering souls in darkness, are immediately delivered. They ascend to the Vermilion Palace, where after nine years of refinement, they undergo transformation and rebirth, attaining noble status. Those who diligently study this sutra, fulfilling their merit and perfecting their virtue, all achieve immortality, soaring to the Golden Gates and roaming the Jade Capital.

Scholars of higher learning who cultivate and recite this sutra, awakening to the Dao and realizing the profound, ascend to the Palace of the Great Ultimate. All worldly entanglements dissolve into emptiness; silently aligning with this principle, they awaken to the luminous void, forever unchanging. Transcending mortality, they attain eternal life, undergoing refinement to ascend to the Southern Palace.

For those in the world who recite this sutra without entering true stillness, gradually relinquishing attachment to thought, true qi naturally arises within the Great Void. Infusing their mortal form, it extends their years and prolongs life. Later, they achieve the Dao of liberation through simulated death: their ethereal soul temporarily departs, bypassing hell, and swiftly regains form to roam the Great Void.

This sutra is subtle and wondrous, universally delivering boundless beings. All heavenly and mortal realms receive its blessings. Immeasurable fortune arises; life and death are graced with its favor. Treasured by the heavens above, it is not transmitted to the lower world. Only the most devoted offer gold and treasures, swearing celestial oaths to transmit it. Those who lightly disclose or disrespect it bring calamity upon nine generations, condemned to eternal servitude under demonic officials.

Five Emperors attend this sutra, with twenty-four Jade Lads and twenty-four Jade Maidens each, safeguarding its divine script and protecting those who receive it.

The Dao speaks: During the long fast of the first month, recite this sutra. Harmonious divine winds will circulate, nurturing all spirits. Karmic bonds dissolve, merging with the primordial essence. For ancestors of past ages, earthly servitude is severed, and they ascend to the Southern Palace.

During the long fast of the seventh month, recite this sutra. Golden perfection stirs the clouds, summoning the primordial to unite with the true. Communing with spirits, they attain immortality and ascend. The heavens inscribe their names on yellow registers and white tablets, erasing death and granting eternal life.

During the long fast of the tenth month, recite this sutra. Purple clouds refine their forms; whirlwinds spiral leftward. The Eight Luminaries and Three Perfected Ones meet the deities of destiny. Roaring, they command tiger legions. For kings, emperors, rulers, ministers, fathers, and sons, the nation is stabilized, its mandate secured. Heaven’s longevity is preserved; generations endure unbroken. They remain sovereigns, governing their realms in peace, with people proclaiming great harmony.

On the eight seasonal nodes, recite this sutra. The Eight Luminaries open; the Five Palaces become perfectly clear. The body enters the Great Non-Being, merging with the mysterious void, becoming a Perfected One of the Nine Palaces.

On one’s life-destiny day, recite this sutra. The numinous script of the Great Crimson aligns with one’s fate. Through countless transformations, one naturally attains truth. The ethereal soul becomes pure and upright; myriad qi endure forever. Free from suffering, the body radiates light. The Three Realms attend; the Five Emperors welcome. Myriad spirits pay homage; names are inscribed in heaven. Merit fulfilled and virtue perfected, they ascend to the Supreme Clarity.

The Dao speaks: On days of ritual practice, bathe in fragrant waters, fast, and enter the chamber. Face east, knock the teeth thirty-two times to resonate with the thirty-two heavens, and bow thirty-two times in reverence. Close the eyes and silently envision the body seated amidst clouds of azure, crimson, and yellow. Within and without, all is veiled in mist. A Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Lion, and White Crane array to left and right. Sun and moon illuminate the chamber, its interior resplendent. A circular halo emanates from the crown, its light suffusing the ten directions—all vividly manifest.

Recite the secret incantation:
*"Supreme Mystery and Primordial Origin, Most High Dao Lord, summon forth from within this servant the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Attendant Messengers of the Left and Right, the Jade Lads who tend incense, the Jade Maidens who transmit words, the Direct Attendants of the Five Emperors, and the Incense Officials of the Day—thirty-two each—to convey this petition. Today is an auspicious occasion; the hall is pure for the long fast. We cultivate the supreme sutra, delivering boundless beings. May this prayer ascend swiftly to the presence of the Most High Primordial Sovereign of the Thirty-Two Heavens."*

Conclude by drawing qi thirty-two times. Face east and recite the sutra:

They drive the nine-dragon vast-and-boundless carriages, raise the vermilion-cloud flying-life chariots.
They brandish the command-sage’s staffs, the ten-flowered great banners; before them, jade hymns are sung in unison; behind them, harmonious chants resound as one.

A hundred million chariots and ten thousand riders float through the void, their light cascading as they turn their reins to oversee the deliverance of the living.

The Great Crimson Numinous Script’s divine qi flows in mystery, transforming above into the celestial palaces, extending below to the deepest springs.
The Most High wields the tally, the Supreme August One transcribes the chapters, universally proclaiming to the Three Realms and the azure empyrean’s divine lands.
The star-arrayed bureaus, the Northern Culmen’s primordial net, the Three Enclosures and Nine Paths, the Twelve Celestial Thoroughfares—

No longer detained, their forms unite with the lofty immortals; by the Primordial Beginning’s talismanic command, they ascend in due time.
In the Northern Capital’s Frigid Pool, the guardians of form and soul restrain demons, ensure promotion, and deliver ranks to the Southern Palace.

Today, rejoicing in the reception of deliverance, passing through the heavens’ barriers, they beseech the eradication of the Three Evils and the severing of earthly roots.
Bearing the Numinous Script, their names are inscribed in the Supreme Mystery; the Perfected Kings oversee their promotion, unrestrained at the celestial gates.

Universally proclaimed without end, the myriad spirits all heed.

**The Precious Chapter of the Numinous Script of the Great Crimson Heaven of Grand Clarity**
Written in vermilion on azure bamboo slips,
burned to ash on the Three Primordials’ days,
consumed with east-flowing water,
it commands ghosts and spirits, granting seated knowledge of longevity.
Those who wear it as immortals find stone spirits bowing in reverence, all endeavors succeeding.
Those who grasp its essence attain the Dao and ascend to perfection.

Primordial qi undergoes refinement; true fire blazes through the cavern.
Ninety-nine thousand nine qi transform into vermilion script.
When the six sixes’ count is complete, the celestial origin is perfected—
jade towers and cinnabar palaces, soaring pavilions of the divine capital.

Of old, within the Mysterious Womb, the initial dragon had not yet flourished.
Through countless eons in the midst of primordial chaos,
above, no color existed; below, no abyss.
Winds coursed through the empty void, accumulating hardness into firmness.
Firmness’s nature became metal; metal dew flowed as springs.
Springs became white water, which received the metal abyss.
Metal and water congealed, transforming into earth and generating heaven.
Above heaven and below heaven, no darkness, no obscurity,
no form, no shadow, no limit, no end—
the vast, uncarved primordial, boundless and lightless.
The Great Crimson’s Numinous Script operates and conveys naturally.
The Primordial Beginning pacifies and stabilizes; the Cinnabar Origin is the supreme scripture.
Vermilion script and jade characters, fire-forged dragon script,
preserve and regulate the kalpic destiny, ensuring heaven’s eternal endurance.

Primordial qi pervades the boundless; myriad patterns unfold.
Original essence flows and cascades through the thirty-two passes.
Revolving without color, it ascends into the Muddy Pellet,
circulating through the ten directions, treading fire and wading springs.
Rotating the Dipper and traversing the Winnowing Basket,
it cycles through the five constants.
White clouds transform into liquid; jade dew and mysterious frost.
Thirty-five divisions gather qi into the Upper Origin.
The Eight Effulgences merge in darkness; qi enters the Mysterious-Mysterious.
Within the mysterious dwells the utmost numinous—
the Primordial Lady, the Mysterious Sovereign,
floating through the Purple Void, whistling and chanting cavernous tones.
Golden radiance harmonizes qi, flowing through the cloud palaces.
Jade tones transform into effulgences; divine luminosity revolves with the wind.
The Grand Clarity’s supreme transformation flourishes in eightfold splendor.
A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—naturally attaining perfection.
Within perfection dwells the spirit, the Great Lord of Longevity,
the Most Mysterious of the Golden Watchtower, the White Prime of the Non-Ultimate.
The Jade Consort of Flourishing Yang, the Supreme Perfected of the Great One,
the Nine Palaces’ Controller of Destiny, the Peach and Ginseng of Longevity.
Grasping the Numinous Script, they preserve life and root existence,
roaming the Highest Clarity, entering and exiting the Flourishing Chamber.
Within the Eight Darknesses, amid the minutest subtleties,
they descend to guard the human body—the Muddy Pellet and Crimson Palace.
Centrally governing the five qi, blending the hundred spirits,
ten revolutions return the numinous; myriad qi unite as immortals.
The immortal Dao values life; the qi of life conveys humanity.
Opening the eight gates above, the celestial methods are transmitted.
Transgressions and blessings, prohibitions and karmic conditions—
universally received and delivered, the dead souls gain new bodies.
Those whose bodies receive new life ascend to report to the heavens.
Above the heavens, each has its gate of life.
Within lies the chapter of the Empty Cavern’s chants,
the numinous scripture of the Perfected Kings, whose words join the loftiest perfected.

**First: Primordial Qi Generates the Flying Song of the Great Crimson Heaven**
Red and black in equal measure, it is called the Mysterious.
Subtle yin and wondrous yang—also named the Grand Origin.
Vast emptiness without defilement, the original substance made clear.
Comparing this luminous emptiness, it names itself through self-cultivation.
Red and black come to reside; primordial qi then spreads.
The Mysterious is yin and yang, distant and unopened in diagrams.
When yin is exhausted, the red appears—the Great Crimson is its domain.
Below the Highest Clarity, above the seed people,
it governs the twelve heavens, the Supreme’s abode.
The third qi’s contemplation is the Dao’s celestial thoroughfare.
Like one who practices the Dao, desiring to exhaust the shadow’s residue—
if the mind’s emptiness is incomplete, the shadow’s traces remain.
Unpenetrated by the Dao, one is constrained by emptiness.
Thus it is called Grand Clarity, the courtyard of the nine immortals.
Only by eliminating shadows and forsaking desire can the Dao be seen.
If you do not know the true, you merely dwell in mountains and forests.
The Great Crimson possesses the Numinous Script—chanting it, you ride the whirlwind’s wheel.

**Second: The Great Crimson Heaven as the Immortal Realm of Grand Clarity**
Qi vast and boundless, pure yang emits smoke.
Refined by true fire, red jade becomes heaven.
Before the fire’s color subsides, the Great Crimson gains its name.
When fire departs and truth remains, the Grand Clarity is vast and desolate.
Cinnabar towers become palaces; purple clouds become courtyards.
Towering within the Great Crimson, above it connects the Jade Capital.
The Supreme dons yellow brocade robes, floating through effulgences with golden bells.
To the left, nine dragons are commanded to harness; to the right, divine tigers are reined.
Wind and rain lead the advance; bells and drums form the rear guard.
The demons of the Three Realms’ heavens bow their heads, entreating true deliverance.
Yin and yang rightly descend to the dust; all things are stirred by this dance.
The Great Crimson’s Numinous Script is revered by all lofty spirits.

**Third: The Divine Transformation of the Numinous Script’s Perfected King, Sung**
Primordial qi like broken threads rides the wind like a wandering dragon.
Floating, floating through the Great Void, nine suns arise within.
Spontaneously, the Great Crimson’s color, curved like a slanted bow.
Weaving emptiness, it forms characters—the Numinous Script’s body soars aloft.
The august one wields the purple brush, naturally matching the celestial perfected.
Talismanic writings command the myriad spirits; the merit of conveying humanity is boundless.
If you can arouse faith in your heart and wear it, gazing up to the vault of heaven,
swallowing and summoning primordial qi, jade nectar flows freely.
The stomach’s pool generates crimson smoke; bones and joints are polished like bronze.

The Six Dings come bearing silken cloths, transforming the mysteries of the nether darkness.
Whistling songs, they ascend to the Great Purity; their divine movement leaves no trace.
Above these Three Realms, amid the flight through emptiness,
the True King’s song resounds—its tones interweave with cavernous hymns.
Recite it a hundred times, and your name is recorded in the Southern Palace.
Recite it a thousand times, and the True King personally welcomes you.
After ten thousand recitations, the Dao is complete: you soar through the Great Void,
pass beyond the Three Realms, and ascend to the rank of Immortal Duke.
Those who hear the numinous sound—before the True King’s reverent form,
he commands the earth spirits to attend and escort them.
Drawn forth from the earthly gate, freed from the Five Sufferings and Eight Hardships,
their seven generations of ancestors ascend, forever departing the Yellow Springs’ barrier.
Their souls cross to the Divine Empyrean, undergo refinement, and are reborn—
this is called the boundless, the universal deliverance without end.

There exists a secret celestial scripture, revered by all heavens.
Those who leak or slight it fall into hell, their misfortune extending to seven generations of ancestors.
The Dao declares: These two chapters are the Great Crimson’s numinous script,
the hidden tones of the Celestial Thearchs.
They harmonize heaven and pacify earth, exorcise and stabilize the nation,
induce perfection when worn, avert calamity and dispel misfortune,
assist the Dao’s transformation above, and eternally protect the people.
All are the words of the Great Brahma, not the common speech of the mundane world.
Their words lack ornate beauty, their melodies lack florid grace—
thus they are called profound and obscure, difficult to fathom in detail.
Treasured by the heavens, they are secreted in the Divine Empyrean’s Jade Purity Jade Treasury’s eastern repository.
The Dao Lord enacts the teaching, transmitted below in accord with the karmic moment.
If there be a perfected person who offers gold and precious goods with sincere heart,
following the ancient protocol to pledge alliance with the Jade Purity,
only then shall they be bestowed.

The Dao declares: The Great Crimson’s numinous script is the origin of the Three Qi,
rescuing those on the brink of death, accomplishing all without fail.
When heaven and earth’s revolutions reach their end, when sun, moon, and five planets wane and wax,
when the most sagely divine persons prosper or decline, when lesser scholars fall ill or perish—
whenever such disasters occur, all of like qi must unite in heart to perform purification rites,
burn incense in the six periods, and recite the scripture ten times.
Virtue and blessing will descend at once, dissolving all inauspicious omens.
This boundless script is the universal deliverance without end.

The Dao declares: When lesser Dao students, their immortal rank not yet fulfilled,
face the karmic moment of passing, their bodies entering the Great Yin—
at the hour of their departure, their fellow students and perfected persons
shall burn incense and recite the scripture ten times to deliver the corpse according to ritual.
With the Great Crimson’s numinous script, written in cinnabar on azure silk,
worn upon the body or placed before the heart,
the soul will ascend directly to the Southern Palace,
there to be reborn according to the merit of their studies, their days counted.
No longer bewildered by the turning wheel, they attain divine immortality.

The Dao declares: When heaven and earth’s revolutions end,
when stellar lodgings fall into disarray, when sun and moon lose their light,
when the four seasons falter, when yin and yang fall out of harmony,
when the nation suffers calamity, when demonic qi flows freely,
when pestilence and plague spread, when the people perish and are harmed,
when teachers and friends pass away, when loved ones meet their end—
in all such times, perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture.
The merit is most weighty:
above, it dissolves celestial disasters and safeguards the emperor;
below, it exorcises poison and harm, delivering the people.
In life and death, all depend upon it—its blessings are beyond measure.
Thus it is called boundless, the universal deliverance of heaven and humanity.

The Dao declares: Whoever possesses this scripture
and performs these meritorious deeds for the Thearchs of heaven and earth and the people—
on days of disaster, if they arouse their hearts to sponsor rites,
burn incense, and recite the scripture ten times,
all the heavens record their names, and the myriad spirits attend and protect them.
Those who distinguish themselves as perfected persons shall become ministers of the Golden Gates of the Sage Lord.
The heavens record the merits and faults of all people, not missing even the slightest measure.
The True King of the Celestial Center also vouches for your words and person.

The boundless hidden speech of the Great Brahma in the heavens—
*Composed by the Dao Lord*
*The Central Chapter of the Primordial Great Crimson’s Numinous Script*
*The Eight Heavens of the Eastern Direction*

At Yi and Tan, embracing the seasons, the azure springs are dim and obscure.
Through cavernous passes and forked capitals, the land winds in reverence and turns in awe.
The radiance of the Primordial Immortal’s site gleams; the halls congeal with subtle masters.
The banner of Jianhu remains unfurled; compassionate knocks draw forth the mechanism.
Profound benefits are further explored; depths multiply their branches and covenants.
Hence the realm hastens in frequency; the Dao refines and the mountains rest.
Qi weaves through the Dark and Yellow; the unseen moves through the regions.
The Pure and Mighty Han Palace unfolds its warp and treads upon firmness.

*The Eight Heavens of the Southern Direction*

The essence-child floats in dawn’s glow; seven reflections mirror the jade pool.
The settled steeds of qi are rewarded; the profound ripples are clarified and stilled.
Flowering strands meet the fluid; the spirit perches where the soul bows.
Gentle luster bathes in moisture; sudden radiance is concealed and held.
Bright and joyful, roaming in forbearance; careful crossing knows no constancy.
Refined threads gather wondrous saltiness; the tranquil and free raise their cheeks.
The Purple Mountain’s Great Void—trust and thought are fitting for merit.
Inquiring of immortals shines with clarity; cinnabar brightens and jade glimmers.

*The Eight Heavens of the Western Direction*

In stillness, what is there to do? Guarding the spirit, its radiance is complete.
Vast brilliance alternates with luminescence; transformations bind the Kunlun peaks.
The Dao nurtures and the essence transmits; overflowing cries compose the seasons.
Celestial nectar ripples of itself; dark splendor illumines the River of Stars.
Seals of command bestow charts; Yin’s balance subdues demons.
The fountains’ hosts are restrained; the fierce are beheaded and the malevolent slain.
The script of the numinous commands the perfected; it guards the Golden Gates of the Thearch.
Awaiting the sea, listening to emptiness; the substance of sincerity receives the tally.

*The Eight Heavens of the Northern Direction*

The Dipper’s handle grasps the Chou; principles and words transform into immortals.
True exchanges are resplendent and blazing; qi abounds in the dark springs.
Grasping the pendants, they greet the desert; establishing regions, they follow the walls.
The stalks of destiny bear nine teeth; the couriers’ shrines stretch in continuity.
The toad’s essence blends with the blossoms; the Dipper’s clans meet in chariots.
The Han oversees the Lesser Primordial; the Mounds draw from the First Chamber.
Judgments disperse the Cao decrees; the Horn innovates and the Platter departs from its dish.
The Moon’s outskirts and Du’s palace; Teng’s brightness and Ruan’s radiance.

The Dao states: These are the boundless hidden speeches of the Great Brahma in the heavens,
the sounds of the immeasurable, ancient texts inscribed upon the Crimson Towers of the Great Red Heaven,
to govern the affairs of heaven and earth, assist the transformations of Yin and Yang,
and command the myriad spirits. Each character spans a full *zhang* in breadth.
The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign of Old inscribed these words to establish the correct sounds.
Those who know these sounds and can purify themselves to recite them—
all the heavens dispatch the divine kings of the Red Heaven to descend and observe their persons,
record their diligent merits, and report them to the Divine Empyrean.
The myriad spirits pay homage; the earthly deities attend at their gates.
The Great Merit True King vouches for them before the Upper Clarity.
When the Dao is complete and they distinguish themselves, they may wander the Three Realms
and ascend through the Golden Gates.

These sounds repel nothing, dispel nothing, deliver nothing they do not, and accomplish nothing they do not.
They are the natural sounds of the Heavenly Perfected.
Thus, to recite them is to make the numinous script appear in the void,
purple clouds fill the chamber, a hundred spirits attend at the eaves, and ten thousand immortals pay homage.
To wear them is to have the Thearch descend with a tally; the Eight Effulgences ascend at dawn.
To ingest them is to blend the five viscera, circulate the jade essence,
delight the Three Primordials, and congeal auspicious qi.
To embody them is to wander in the Grand Clarity, ride the crimson qi,
wondrously merge with the Great Void, and transcend the ten thousand existences.
To divide one’s form into a thousand myriads, to sit and yet be gone, to stand and yet vanish—
the chiming of jade pendants resounds, the ten directions grow solemn and clear,
rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks swallow their mists.
Numinous demons submit in awe; immortals are summoned and gathered.
Emptiness and clarity unite with the mysterious; spiritual transformations arise naturally.
Dark wisdom pervades the pure; through vast kalpas, nothing shifts.

*The Upper Chapter of the Numinous Treasure’s Immeasurable Scripture for the Salvation of Humanity, Scroll Ten, Concludes*

*Scroll Eleven: The Jade Brightness’s Conveyance of Salvation*

The Dao spoke: Long ago, in the Azure Vault of Heaven, within the Great Jeweled Realm of Jade Radiance, the Primordial Beginning bestowed the *Jade Brightness’s Conveyance of Salvation*, the Immeasurable Upper Scripture. When the Primordial Heavenly Worthy was to expound this sutra, he circumambulated ten times to summon the ten directions, and only then ascended his seat. Celestial perfected spirits, exalted sages, transcendents of wondrous practice, and boundless multitudes arrived riding the void. Purple auroras flared with splendor; crimson blossoms unfurled their hues. Phoenix-borne chariots and dragon-drawn carriages, cloud-canopied and rainbow-wheeled, cast shimmering shadows, their fivefold colors luminously intermingling, adorning the vast firmament with resplendence.

For nine days and nine nights, the sun, moon, and stars of all heavens, along with the lingering glow of dawn, halted their courses. The Jade Celestial Mechanism stilled its light; the Golden Balance ceased its motion. Divine winds hushed; clouds withdrew from seas and mountains. The six qi aligned in clarity. Throughout the land, mountains, rivers, forests, and groves leveled as one, no longer high or low. The earth transformed into jade brightness, its azure hue undifferentiated.

The assembled perfected ones took their seats as the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, in profound repose, occupied the floating jeweled throne—an efflorescence of golden ninefold phoenix qi. After he expounded the sutra once, the celestial great sages simultaneously voiced their approval. At that time, the men and women of the land enjoyed long lives, free from calamity or premature death.

When he expounded it a second time, waters surged and fires descended; harm and punishment ceased to arise. A third recitation harmonized the six qi, and the world grew tranquil. A fourth brought forth wondrous incense wafting through the sky, with floating canopies filling the void. A fifth caused mountains and marshes to manifest auspicious signs—jade gleamed and pearls drifted. A sixth awakened beings to the roots of life and death, as spirits attested to the true realm. A seventh purified the denizens of the Desire Realm, eradicating all dust-like defilements. An eighth equalized the five movements, and the myriad things flourished. A ninth drew the gaze of heavenly light downward, illuminating the dark prisons. A tenth universally conveyed salvation, deeply imparting the Dharma gate.

At that time, every man and woman of the land turned their hearts in devotion, all receiving protection and deliverance, attaining longevity without end.

The Dao spoke: When the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded the sutra once, the boundless multitudes of the *Jade Brightness’s Conveyance of Salvation* Perfected Great Spirits from the immeasurable Upper Realm of the East arrived floating through the void. A second recitation summoned those from the South; a third, the West; a fourth, the North. A fifth brought those from the Northeast; a sixth, the Southeast; a seventh, the Southwest; an eighth, the Northwest. A ninth called forth those from the Upper Realm; a tenth, the Lower Realm. When the ten recitations were complete, the Perfected Great Spirits of the *Jade Brightness’s Conveyance of Salvation* from the ten immeasurable directions arrived simultaneously. The men and women of the land turned their hearts in reverence.

From afar, they beheld the Primordial Beginning ascend his seat to preach the Dharma, scattering great radiance that illumined the boundless heavens and worlds. The men and women of the land, along with the celestial beings—numberless in their multitudes—each dwelled in their own heaven, abiding in their own transformed realm. Each listened with rapt attention, reverently hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s jade-like voice resound as he proclaimed the subtle *Jade Brightness’s Conveyance of Salvation*. Then they conferred among themselves, saying: "The Primordial Heavenly Worthy now expounds the *Jade Brightness’s Conveyance of Salvation*, revealing the reckoning of great and small kalpas. We know that the root of life and death for all celestial and human beings lies entirely in this conveyance. The reckoning of conveyance originates in yin and yang. The qi of yin and yang is none other than life and death. Yang qi is life; yin qi is death. Once we take form through the turning of yin and yang, the reckoning of life, death, and conveyance arises. If we attain the Dao and ascend into formlessness, transcending yin and yang, then life and death—and the reckoning of great and small kalpas—will cease to bind us. Let us, this great assembly, each direct our minds to the Great Jeweled Heaven of Azure Vault, to entreat the essential teaching: How does one cultivate the *Jade Brightness’s Conveyance of Salvation*? How does one depart from yin and yang, escape life and death, realize the wondrous embodied existence, become a great Dharma king, and deliver all beings from the vast kalpa-sea?"

Those who came were like fine rain or dense mist—boundless multitudes so vast that half the land sank beneath their weight, an influx beyond restraint. Thereupon, the Primordial Beginning suspended a single precious pearl, no larger than a millet grain, in the void five measures above the earth. Ascending with divine guidance, the Perfected Great Spirits, exalted sages, transcendents of wondrous practice, and boundless multitudes all entered the pearl. Gazing upward, the celestial beings saw only a shimmering stream entering the pearl’s mouth. Once within, they knew not where they were.

Then the Primordial Beginning revealed a divine transformation: within the pearl, the vastness embraced the heavens of the ten directions and all lands. Amidst the great assembly, he emanated purple-golden radiance, forming sevenfold hues. From each color arose clouds of wondrous fragrance, suffusing the pearl’s interior. Turning his sapphire-lotus eyes, he gazed down upon the multitude, then took up a table inlaid with hundred-jeweled, dragon-carved auspicious jade. His voice, harmonious and joyful, addressed the great assembly: "Jade Brightness is the celestial designation of innate talent."

The myriad heavens each enact their revolutions, their revolutions ceaseless, and birth-and-death unending. All celestial beings, ensnared by views of activity and inactivity, toil and repose, fall into the revolutions, forsake the ocean of virtue and power, and enter the stream of birth-and-death. This arises from sentient beings’ minds clinging to preferences, severing habitual views, and yielding to greed, desire, joy, and anger. They enter the forging of yin and yang, the revolutions’ transformations, dying and being born ten thousand times, never attaining formlessness, never recognizing the essence of the Dao.

Now I proclaim the essential Dharma, the radiant revolutions. These revolutions are the reckoning of Heaven and Earth. One yin, one yang—these are the roots of Heaven and Earth, the roots of birth-and-death. Qi has beginning and end, thus there is the reckoning of revolutions. Heaven’s reckoning shifts slightly every thirty years, transforms in a century, and undergoes great change every five hundred years. Three great changes make one epoch, three epochs make a grand completion—six thousand years in all. Heaven’s round has twelve guiding principles, Earth’s square has twelve records. Heaven’s guiding principles span three hundred sixty days, completing one revolution. Earth’s records turn three thousand three hundred days, advancing the mechanism once. Heaven’s revolution completes three hundred sixty cycles as yang surges—three hundred years. Earth’s mechanism advances three thousand three hundred degrees as yin wanes—thirty thousand years. When nine thousand nine hundred degrees pass, Heaven and Earth’s qi intermingle, totaling ninety thousand years, called the Great Yang Nine, the Great Hundred Six, the Great Kalpa Revolution. The Lesser Yang Nine, Lesser Hundred Six, and Lesser Kalpa Revolution follow likewise.

At the time of the Great Revolution, Heaven’s qi is exhausted in the Supreme Yin, becoming fire. Earth’s qi reaches its limit in the Supreme Yang, becoming water. The two qi oppose each other, and all things dissolve. Then the primordial qi reunites, returning to chaos—this is called the reckoning of kalpas. When the Great Kalpa arrives, the disasters of water and fire ascend to the heights above the Three Realms and descend to the depths below the Nine Earths, annihilating all without a trace. Since all things are born of yin and yang, they perish with these two qi. Above the Three Realms, the heavens of the Four Peoples, and the realm where I dwell—the Three Clarities’ Great Luo City, the ultimate boundary of the Dao—water and fire cannot reach, calamities do not arrive, transcending the dual qi of yin-yang and birth-death.

Nine great revolutions make one kalpa, eighty-one myriad years form the Great Revolution. Ninety thousand years make a Lesser Kalpa, the Lesser Revolution. When the Great Kalpa Revolution concludes, from my realm flow forth golden texts and jade characters, dragon-script and phoenix-writings, all scriptures returning to the Great Luo Jade Capital. Chaos divides anew, the true texts reemerge, sages disseminate them, transmitting them once more to the world below.

All sentient beings who weary of birth-and-death, sever all defilements and worldly habits, and cause this spirit-qi to wondrously merge with the Great Void—its empty essence being natural, not belonging to yin and yang—will be free from birth-and-death. Harmonizing with this wondrous emptiness, they respond to thoughts by manifesting forms, ascending into formlessness. When the revolutions end, they soar into the Great Luo, escape the Three Realms’ lands, forever leave birth-and-death, attain the Dao’s fruition, and become Celestial Perfected—only then is it called "attaining the Dao."

All sentient beings who study the Dao dwell in the Lesser Vehicle, some with lifespans spanning kalpas, flying and traveling, multiplying forms and scattering shadows, riding dragons and phoenixes—these are all attachments, not yet called "exhaustion of outflows." Hearing these words, the great assembly transcended the Three Voids, realized the Supreme Perfected Dao, the multitudes dispersed, and the land returned to levelness, no longer slanting or sinking.

Then, within the pearl, the Primordial Beginning completed the sutra’s discourse. The Perfected Ones oversaw the transmission, bestowing it upon me. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words. The Dharma affair roughly concluded, the celestial beings returned to their positions. In an instant, silence reigned—utter stillness without remnant echo.

At that time, celestial beings who encountered the sutra’s Dharma universally attained deliverance, preserving their original years without harm. The entire land turned in reverence, all realizing the Supreme Perfection. Killing, harm, jealousy, lust, theft, greed, hatred, and all karmic minds dissolved into emptiness. They saw neither yin nor yang, neither birth nor death. Speech was free from fear and attachment, mouths devoid of wishes and fortune. Equal in compassion, they transformed strangers into kin. The land was secure, the people prosperous, rejoicing in great peace.

From the sutra’s initial teaching, those with utmost sincerity in one realm followed the Dao, revered and honored it, all attaining deliverance from the world. The Dao declared: The Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s sutra contains the inner names of the Jade Brightness Emperor, hidden rhymes and sounds—also the inner taboos of demon kings, the concealed names of the hundred spirits.

Know that primordial qi is the root of birth-and-death, and yin-yang is the gate of birth-and-death. Birth-and-death arise from revolutions. If revolutions do not arise, there is no death. Attaining the Dao and becoming Perfected, embodying the Great Void, forever leaving birth-and-death, transcending the Three Realms—these are not the common words of the world. The Supreme Perfected, having become Perfected Ones, penetrate the mysterious and investigate the subtle.

Those who master its chapters and recite them ten times will have the myriad heavens chant from afar, the ten thousand emperors pay homage, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks conceal their clouds. Heaven’s gates cease movement, Earth’s mechanisms halt, revolutions pause, and people attain longevity. Demons bind their forms, ghostly spirits lose their clarity, the dead revive, and white bones become human.

For devoted scholars who recite it ten times, the Five Phases align harmoniously, yin and yang remain unharmed, revolutions and transformations endure, bringing fortune, joy, longevity, and health. Demon spirits lose their sight, ghostly demons lose their clarity, delivering the dying and reviving the deceased. The reason is this: scholars and Perfected Ones are bound by qi to yin and yang, their bodies not yet penetrating the true. They summon and command the ten directions, their might not yet governing Heaven’s governance, their virtue able to subdue Earth’s deities, bind demonic spirits, and merely delay death—but cannot restore life.

Those who recite this chapter lightly will bring misfortune upon themselves. Honoring and revering it will cause households to flourish, generations to prosper, forming good karmic connections. Ten thousand calamities will not approach, and divine beings will guard the gates.

This scripture is most venerable and wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital, delivering boundless beings and serving as the origin of all Dao. Its majestic and vast model is of virtue too great to be surpassed.

The Dao declares: Those who recite this scripture ten times will summon all the heavens, which will open the radiance of deliverance. Those sunk in dark ignorance, bidding farewell to yin and yearning for yang, along with the suffering souls of billions of ancestors, will all be delivered at once. They will ascend to the Crimson Palace, where after nine years of refinement, they will be transformed and reborn as noble persons.

Those who diligently study this scripture, their merit complete and virtue perfected, will all attain immortality, soaring to the Golden Gates and roaming the Jade Capital. Advanced scholars who cultivate and recite this scripture will be delivered at once, ascending to the Southern Palace. When the people of the world recite it, the Jade Luminance descends with qi, and the Way of Life comes to dwell, extending their years and granting long life. Thereafter, they will all attain the Way of Corpse Liberation. Their souls will briefly dissolve, avoiding the hells, and immediately regain form, roaming the vast heavens.

This scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally delivering the limitless. All heavenly beings receive its blessings. Boundless fortune bestows grace upon life and death. Treasured by the heavens above, it is not transmitted to the lower world. Only the most devoted scholars, offering gold and treasures with sincere hearts and swearing oaths to Heaven, may receive it. To carelessly leak or profane it brings calamity upon nine generations, condemning them to long servitude under the ghostly officials.

Five Emperors attend this scripture, along with twenty-four Jade Lads and twenty-four Jade Maidens, who safeguard its divine writ and protect the bodies of those who receive it.

The Dao declares: During the long fast of the first month, recite this scripture, and the Jade Luminance will revolve eastward, delivering those born under *ding* and *ren*. Life’s virtue will unfold its radiance, the Nine Perfected will record their names, and the Great Unity’s Azure Talismans will deliver the imprisoned souls of past ages, severing their earthly bonds and sending them to the Southern Palace.

During the long fast of the seventh month, recite this scripture, and the Jade Luminance will traverse the west, delivering those born under *yi* and *geng*. The solemn qi will congeal into metal, and the Tortoise Terrace will dredge its numinous power. The White Silk Jade Talismans will refine and transform their forms, allowing them to attain immortality. The heavens will inscribe their names on the Yellow Register and White Slips, erasing death and granting life.

During the long fast of the tenth month, recite this scripture, and the Jade Luminance will ascend northward, delivering those born under *bing* and *xin*. The upright qi will form dragons, and the Purple Court will command immortality. The Imperial Perfected will issue the Mysterious Edict, assisting the Emperor in attaining long life. For kings, emperors, lords, ministers, fathers, and sons, it will secure and stabilize the nation’s destiny, preserving Heaven’s eternal existence. Generation after generation, they will remain sovereigns, securing their domains, and the people will proclaim great peace.

On the days of the eight solar terms, recite this scripture, and the Jade Luminance will converge in radiance, delivering those in perfect harmony. The primordial qi will divide its splendor, the Eight Gates will open in brightness, and the Divine Tiger’s Red Writ will inscribe their names upon the Emperor’s steps, granting them the rank of Perfected of the Nine Palaces.

On one’s natal day, recite this scripture, and the Jade Luminance will protect one’s life, delivering a thousand years. The Dipper Palace will record their merit, inscribing their destiny as true. The Seven Primes’ Treasure Chapters will flow like stars into the Great Abyss. Their souls will be purified and rectified, and the myriad qi will endure forever. They will avoid suffering and affliction, their bodies suffused with light. The Three Realms will attend them, the Five Emperors will welcome them, and the myriad spirits will pay homage. Their names will be inscribed in the heavens above. With merit complete and virtue perfected, they will ascend to the Highest Clarity.

The Dao declares: On the days of ritual practice, one must bathe in fragrant waters, fast, and enter the chamber. Facing east, knock the teeth thirty-two times, making it heard in the thirty-two heavens. Bow thirty-two times in reverence, close the eyes, and silently visualize oneself seated amidst clouds of azure, green, and white. Within and without, all is lush and dark. A Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Lion, and White Crane stand arrayed to the left and right. The sun and moon shine brightly, illuminating the chamber. A circular halo appears above the head, its light radiating in all directions. All this must be clearly envisioned.

The secret incantation is as follows:
*"Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Dao Lord, summon forth from within my body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Jade Lads who tend the incense, the Jade Maidens who transmit words, the Direct Talismans of the Five Emperors, and the Incense Officials of the Day—sixty-four each—opening the gates to relay my words. Today is an auspicious day, a long fast in a pure hall, cultivating the supreme scripture to deliver boundless beings. May my entreaties ascend swiftly to the presence of the Most High Primordial Sovereign of the Thirty-Two Heavens."*

After this, draw qi thirty-two times, then face east and recite the scripture.

*The Supreme Primordial Most Wondrous Scripture of Boundless Deliverance*
The original harmony dwells in the Cavernous Mystery, the numinous guest of the root chapter. The Jade Luminance delivers, the wondrous beginning of the supreme.
Countless beings are delivered, the hundred demons hide their rhymes. Separation and union arise naturally, merging with the Great Vastness.
The Nine Voids’ Dao Ancestor, the primordial qi within the expanse, the Jade Luminance illumines the mysterious.
The Primordial divides into two. Yin and yang are then complete, commanding qi and moving the spirits.
The peerless supreme truth, the Primordial Ancestral Kalpa. Delivering all heavens, eight, nine, six, seven—kalpas turn without end.
The Great Yin generates fire, the Great Yang becomes water, the five phases reverse their transmission.
The Three Luminaries open in brightness—this is the root of Heaven. The Jade Luminance’s Brahmanic splendor, only the Dao as body.
Deliverance shifts and moves, the five colors ride the heavens. Mysterious light forms the script, fire refines it into fathoms.
The five colors settle into place, rosy clouds weave the chapters. The five writs array their images, universally planting the divine spirits.
No writ without light, no writ without brightness, no writ without establishment, no writ without completion, no writ without deliverance, no writ without life.
This is the Great Brahman Heaven within Heaven, the Yü-luo Hsiao Terrace, the Jade Luminance’s Upper Capital, the supreme of the supremes, the Great Luo’s Jade Clarity.
Vast and distant, kalpas measured in *jen*, as if absent, as if present—three flowers part and depart. The Great Existence’s wondrous court.
Golden gates and jade chambers, a forest of purity and clarity. The divine auroras of the Divine Empyrean encircle the ten directions.
Within it dwells the immortal-delivering spirit, within it dwells the Southern Culmen’s Lord of Long Life, within it dwells the Jade Luminance’s Deliverance Marshal, the Great Divinity, within it dwells the Life-Cherishing Elder Lord Han, within it dwell the Southern Supreme’s Registrar of Life and Destiny, the Extender of Lifespan, the Reliever of Calamities, and the Venerable Divinities.
They turn bones back to life, deliver boundless beings. Today, the celestial audit begins, and all the heavens descend in attendance.

Together they ride upon purple scaled dragons, their forms adorned with patterns of jade, borne upon crimson clouds of auspicious radiance, phoenix chariots and dragon carriages, jade canopies and golden wheels, drawn by beasts of cinnabar whales and jade-maned golden essence. They raise the standards of the Nine Qi and the banners of the Ten Poles. Before them, resonant chants and harmonious hymns intertwine; behind them, celestial choruses and Brahmanic chants resound in unison.

Immortal maidens and pure youths sing with the voices of simurghs. The Three August Ones open the path, the Nine Elders [ ] the way. Myriad chariots and ten thousand riders arrive floating through the void.

Their radiant light bends the course of their journey, inaugurating kalpas and renewing life. They propel the movement of deliverance, kalpas turning without end, driving yin and steering yang, revolving through death and rebirth.

The Jade Luminance’s Chancellor, the Supreme Minister of Southern Prosperity, the Pivotal Perfected in array, the Registrar Han, the Overseers of Life and Death, the Mighty Spirits of the Numinous and the Demonic—conveying the reckoning of destinies, encompassing the Six Voids, discerning the fates of beings amidst water, fire, and the calamities of war.

Holding the registers and grasping the ledgers, they assemble before the Emperor. According to those who are to be delivered, they strictly audit the heavens.

Universally proclaimed to the Three Realms, the Boundless Divine Lands, the Yellow Springs’ courts, the Northern Capital of Fengdu, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the Twelve River Sources.

They absolve the sins of ancestors and kin across kalpas, swiftly erasing the records of transgressions, extinguishing the roots of evil, forbidding their detention or coercion into ghostly throngs.

By the Mandate of the Primordial Beginning, at the appointed hour, they ascend and advance. In the Frigid Pools of the Northern Capital, they guard and escort the forms and souls.

They restrain demons and uphold deliverance, elevating ranks in the Southern Palace. The dead receive refinement, transformed into immortals. The living receive deliverance, enduring through kalpas, revolving with the turning of ages, their years harmonized with heaven.

Forever delivered from the Three Paths, the Five Sufferings, and the Eight Adversities, they transcend the Three Realms, roaming freely in the Upper Clarity.

In the Heaven of Upper Clarity, the Celestial Emperor abides in the Cavernous Void, the realm of formlessness and Brahmanic conduct.

The Thirty-Two Heavens, the Thirty-Two Emperors, the Sixty-Four Layers—all governed by the Jade Luminance’s Movement and Deliverance.

Encircling and returning to the beginning, the Dharma’s image weaves the net of interdependence. Yin and yang rise again, kalpas interlinking, generation and transformation unceasing.

The secrets of the heavens, the hidden names of the heavens, the empty caverns within the heavens, the spontaneous numinous chapters.

The hidden melodies of the heavens, the sounds of the Jade Luminance, the honor of the Jade Name, the divinity of the Jade Luminance.

The Nine Yang Brahmanic Realms, the numinous power of deliverance, transforming into the Upper Clarity—boundless mysteries too profound to detail.

The divine perfected descend in array, universally delivering celestial and mortal beings.

Today, they propel the movement of deliverance, governing death and distinguishing life. The marvel of the Dao’s convergence lies in formlessness as truth, unity with the void, hidden yet eternally named. Divine transformations emerge and vanish, the spontaneity of the numinous.

Delivered through water and fire, through the great kalpas of blades and warfare.

Their bodies gleam with golden hue, steadfast and unshaken. Rejoicing in their deliverance, they pass through the barriers of the heavens, beseeching transcendence beyond the Three Voids, severing the roots of yin and yang.

Soaring through the Five Passes, their names inscribed in the Great Mystery. The Perfected and Demons oversee...

Raise, unbound by the Celestial Gate.
The Eastern Dipper receives consciousness, the Western Dipper forges form,
The Northern Dipper bestows wisdom, the Southern Dipper governs the heart,
The Central Dipper embodies the Great Void—this is the true form of the Dao.
The Azure Emperor manifests color, the White Emperor illumines emptiness,
The Vermilion Emperor stirs awareness, the Black Emperor darkly pervades,
The Yellow Emperor directs intention—resonant convergence gives rise to transformation.

The Azure-Realm Perfected King governs the Wood Kalpa, *Dī Ā*.
The Vermilion-Realm Perfected King governs the Fire Kalpa, *Bù Nán*.
The White-Realm Perfected King governs the Metal Kalpa, *Gāng Cuó*.
The Black-Realm Perfected King governs the Water Kalpa, *Yān Luó*.
The Yellow-Realm Perfected King governs the Earth Kalpa, *Shén Qiū*.
The Five-Realm Perfected Kings are the origin of the ten thousand spirits.
They restrain and extend the movement of deliverance, their moments unyielding,
Soaring in flight, drums resounding, commanding the divine hosts.
Banners wave, drums beat in rhythm, roaming and gazing through the Great Void,
Their mighty commands resplendent, all heavens unite in merit.
Transcending kalpas of tribulation, sternly subduing the Northern Feng,
The Perfected Kings receive their mandate, universally sweeping away inauspiciousness.
White tigers spew venom, celestial steeds spread forth in four directions,
Crimson-armored vanguards advance, wielding the great slaughtering blade.
Flinging fire for ten thousand leagues, streaming bells through the eight directions—
Who dares to test or obstruct the perfected above?
Golden axes execute the foremost.
The Great Heavenly Queen metes out punishment, butchering and severing demonic fiends,
Wind and fire unceasing.
Thousands upon thousands of heads severed, myriad upon myriad forms—
Demons dare not trespass! Ghosts dare not harbor malevolent essence.
The Three Officials of the Northern Feng inspect the demonic camps,
No concealment permitted, reported by the Golden Horse Courier.
Universally proclaimed without end.
The ten thousand spirits all heed, the Three Realms and Five Emperors,
Arrayed before the Highest Clarity.
The Primordial Cavern’s Jade Chronicle records the kalpas’ weighty barriers,
From the inception of the Primordial Beginning, giving birth to heaven and earth,
Chaos coalesced—its numbers countless.
Since the primordial qi first conjoined with the undifferentiated,
The ages have been immeasurable.
Vast kalpas stretch into the distant past, from *Yuánlóng* to *Dákāng*,
Jade luminosity and the round void, the movement of deliverance in mutual accord,
The Great One containing the movement—its form spontaneous.
Vast and boundless, the empty radiance, the origin of the Great Dao,
Giving rise to the two luminaries, gestating the Two Modes.
This Dao is most wondrous, yet the world knows it not.
The movement of deliverance cycles to its utmost, jade luminosity taking form,
The great qi suffuses the radiance, now floating, now sinking.
The true earth transmits it, shaped like an egg’s roundness,
Its movement coursing through the center, myriad circuits without deviation.
Within the Five Phases, the movement of deliverance takes precedence,
Jade luminosity as its color, primordial qi as its abyss.
Its principle resembles steaming: qi ascends as dew, descends as springs,
Stirred by the divine wind.
Refined into true lead, lead as the ancestor of metal,
Metal as heaven—its movement proceeds leftward.
Ninety-nine thousand cycles complete the Five Movements’ measure.
Ninety-nine thousand cycles, then water succeeds it.
Water courses through heaven, flowing beneath the nine earths,
Kunlun’s springs surge forth, above heaven and below,
No darkness nor obscurity, no form nor shadow,
No limit nor end—all reverently follow the Great Dao,
Vast and boundless, without light.
The Vermilion Clarity unfurls its chart, the movement of deliverance spontaneous,
Its course harmonizing with measure, the six qi forming heaven.
When movement errs, the ten thousand things falter.
The numbers of jade luminosity are transmitted through the movement of deliverance.
The Primordial Beginning securely establishes, unfolding the Five Chapters,
Vermilion script on jade, the eight mighty dragon scripts,
Preserving and regulating the kalpas’ tribulations, ensuring heaven’s eternal endurance.
The Brahmanic qi pervades the net of Indra, myriad patterns unfolding,
The primordial warp flowing forth, the sixty-four heavens.
Revolving without color, circling the ten directions,
The Dipper and Winnowing Basket traverse, their movement encompassing the four quarters.
Passing through the Five Constants, thirty-five divisions.
The Upper Origin of the total qi is the homeland of jade luminosity.
The Eight Radiant Ones obscurely merge, qi entering the empty mystery,
The Mysterious Void and the Great Sovereign, the Highest Perfected of the Celestial Emperor.
Suffusing the great rosy clouds, chanting the cavernous hymns,
Golden perfection’s luminous luxuriance, flowing echoes through the cloudy encampments.
Jade tones gather qi, numinous winds amass mist,
The Purple Void’s luxuriant elegance, aiding the ten thousand immortals.
A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions, the movement of deliverance pervading the body,
Heaven’s movement conjoining with humanity, spontaneously becoming perfected.
Within the perfected, jade luminosity—the Great Lord of Longevity,
The Azure Radiance Noble, the Eastern Florescence Emperor,
The Luminous Azure Imperial Consort, the White Primordial Venerable Spirit,
The Purple Court’s Great One, the Controller of Destinies Perfected Lord,
Peach Blossom Longevity and Union, Jade Radiance and Purple Numinosity.
Grasping talismans, wielding registers, preserving life and rooting existence,
Ascending to roam the Highest Clarity, entering and exiting the Flowery Chambers.
Within the Eight Obscurities, amid the subtlest realms,
Jade essence flows as liquid, descending to stabilize the human body.
The Crimson Palace of the Muddy Pellet, centrally governing the five qi,
Merging with the hundred spirits, ten revolutions returning the numinous.
The ten thousand qi unite as immortals, the immortal path valuing life,
Delivering beings without limit, the movement flowing through the eight gates.
The great Brahmanic wheel of the flying heavens, revolving through brightness and darkness,
Turning and propelling death and life, transgressions and blessings, prohibitions and precepts,
Karmic causes and conditions—universally receiving liberation,
The dead souls and living bodies, bodies attaining rebirth,
Ascending to be heard by the various heavens.
Above the various heavens, each has its gate of life,
Within, the empty cavern’s hymns and songs, the Perfected Kings’ numinous scriptures,
Verses that join the Highest Perfected.

**First: The Jade Luminosity’s Soaring Void Hymn**
Vast and desolate, the Primordial Azure—names of ten thousand kalpas.
Dyeing the void to become emerald, transforming jade to soft luminosity,
Becoming the mother of the nine qi, the root of all heavens.
Profoundly serene, the radiant clouds, towering above the azure forests,
Above, intermingling with the soaring clouds, branches overspreading the ten thousand heavens.
True rosy clouds in a thousand strands, golden hues in myriad layers—
All are celestial scriptures, shaking the divine winds.
The Nine Elders of the Imperial Perfected, the divine immortals and perfected humans,
Emerging and vanishing, manifesting within this heaven.
A single leaf of the precious scripture, the words of the Eight Assemblies,
Whistling and singing the cavernous tones, extinguishing the ten thousand evils.
Those who hear this jade luminosity’s decree attain the Dao without end.

**Second: The Jade Luminosity’s Movement of Deliverance Hymn**
The movement of Highest Clarity, the nine qi as its bulwark,
The Dipper and Winnowing Basket revolving, traversing the five directions.
Life follows the current, death opposes it—bearing the hundred flourishing things.
The Five Movements’ course begins with yin and yang,
Yin and yang’s creation and transformation, possessing number and name.
The domain of names and numbers is the process of life and death.
The qi’s flowing movement forms the wheel of the Three Realms.

The movements of deliverance summon forth, their flow unceasing.
The joys of heaven’s halls, the torments of hell’s depths—
None of these are the Dao, but the karmic fruits of causes.
Why not refine your nature to emptiness?
Emptiness that is no-emptiness, subtlety beyond form.
In an instant or kalpas, a thousand years as an infant,
Transcending yin and yang, departing the Five Movements,
Without birth or death—this is true eternal life.

I move this hymn to open the hearts of all beings.
The world’s desires surge and sink, floating and drowning.
But if you preserve this heart, measure it against emptiness,
In time it will settle, hidden in the Great Vastness.
Emerging as a perfected one, blessings vast and boundless,
Seated in witness of the Highest Heaven, the Jade Pool and Golden Gates.

**Third: The Jade Luminosity’s True King Hymn**
The nine heavens stand like ramparts, leaning upon this terrace of mirrors.
The mystic canopy’s jeweled tiers, the master gates swing open.
Flowering chambers and bud-palaces, containing pearls and sprouting down,
Crimson and azure in ten thousand strands, radiance entwining the six dragons.
The net of deliverance’s discipline, governed by divine Brahma’s principle.
The King’s luminosity vast, embracing the Nine Clarities within.
Named the Void Sovereign, the court of unending light.

If you would be true, you must witness the formless.
The movements of deliverance do not constrain—take the Dao as your body.
Divine transformations and changes arise at will.
If you wish to know this, first cast out the five desires.
Let the empty light remain unobstructed, companion to the Dao.
Abiding in non-action, roaming with the perfected ones.

This hymn of jade sound serves as a vessel of compassion,
Ferrying you from the shore of birth and death,
Ascending Kunlun’s heights.
Sun and moon like tossed pellets—how can they bring you sorrow?
Above these Three Realms, in the midst of soaring emptiness,
The True King’s hymn resounds, its tones interwoven with cavernous hymns.
Recite it a hundred times, and your name is recorded in the Southern Palace.
Recite it a thousand times, and the True King himself welcomes you.
Ten thousand recitations complete the Dao,
Soaring into the Great Void, traversing the Three Realms,
Ascending to the rank of Immortal Duke.

Those who hear this numinous sound,
The True King honors in form,
Commanding earthly deities to attend and escort,
Liberating them from the earth’s gates,
The five sufferings and eight hardships.
Seven generations of ancestors ascend,
Forever departing the Three Palaces,
Their souls crossing the Vermilion Mound,
Undergoing refinement and rebirth.
This is called boundless deliverance, universal salvation without end.

There is a secret celestial scripture,
Revered by all heavens.
To leak or profane it is to fall into hell,
Bringing calamity upon seven generations of ancestors.

The Dao says: These two hymns are the hidden sounds of the Heavenly Emperors and the Numinous True Kings.
The celestial body of jade luminosity, naturally exalted and congealed,
The movements of deliverance forming kalpas, drifting through life and death.
The perfected one stands alone, remote and formless,
Unbound by existence, untouched by wisdom or emotion,
Merged in primordial purity—from this the Dao arises.
Roaming the Three Realms, eternal peace spans the kalpas.
All are the words of the Great Brahma, not the common speech of the world.
Their words lack ornate beauty, their melodies lack florid grace,
Thus they are called profound and obscure, difficult to fathom.

Heaven treasures them, secreting them in the Eastern Chamber of the Jade Capital’s Highest Mystery, the Jade Treasury Scripture Hall of the Divine Empyrean.
The Dao Lord enacts transformation, the movement aligned with the *ren-chen* year,
Transmitting them according to the statutes.
If there is a perfected one who offers gold and treasures with a sincere heart,
Following the old rites to pledge allegiance to the Divine Empyrean,
Advancing on knees with exposed cinnabar,
Only then are they entrusted.

The Dao says: When the movements of heaven and earth reach their end,
When the sun, moon, and five planets wane and wax,
When the most sagely and divine suffer decline,
The unlearned and hasty invite harm.
Whenever such disasters arise,
All of like qi must unite in heart to perform purification rites,
Burning incense in the six watches, reciting the scriptures ten times.
Blessings and virtue will descend at once, dispelling all misfortune.

This boundless scripture delivers without end.

The Dao says: When the unlearned’s Dao is shallow, or their immortal rank unfulfilled, their jade brightness and qi exhausted, the celestial cycles reaching their end, their fate nearing extinction—when their body enters the Great Yin and the hour of passing arrives—fellow students and perfected ones shall burn incense for them and recite the scriptures ten times, conducting the rites to deliver the corpse-form according to the law. Then the Great Unity shall turn back the banner, the Lord of No-Flourishing shall command the pennant, the Noble Son shall transmit the talisman, and the jade brightness shall return in its course. The hun-soul shall ascend directly to the Southern Palace, where, according to their accumulated merit, they shall be reborn after a calculated span of days. Once the wheel turns without confusion, they shall attain the rank of divine immortals.

The Dao says: When the cycles of heaven and earth reach their end, the stellar lodgings fall into disarray, the sun and moon lose their light, the four seasons fail in their governance, yin and yang fall out of harmony, the land suffers yearly calamities, armies and famine arise, ghosts and bandits appear, plagues and poisons spread, the multitudes perish, teachers and friends pass away, and clans and lineages are extinguished—then one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures. The merit of purification, recitation, and scripture-chanting is exceedingly weighty. Above, it dispels celestial disasters and safeguards the emperor; below, it wards off poison and harm, delivering the multitudes. In life and death, all receive its grace—its blessings are boundless, universally delivering heaven and humanity.

The Dao says: Whoever possesses this scripture and performs these meritorious deeds for the rulers of heaven and earth and the multitudes—on the day of calamity, if they resolve in their heart to perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures ten times—all the heavens shall record their names, the ten thousand spirits shall attend and guard them, and those distinguished as perfected ones shall become ministers of the Golden Gates of the Sagely Lord. The heavens record the merits and transgressions of people without the slightest error. The True Kings of Heaven shall also protect and recommend them, and those who attain the Dao shall fully comprehend these most profound words.

The Great Brahma’s hidden speech in the heavens, the boundless sounds—
Composed by the Dao Lord,
*The Central Scroll of the Numinous Writ of the Primordial Beginning*,
*The Eight Heavens of the Eastern Direction*.

At the brink of Yang’s cauldron, the Dipper’s winnowing—
The peaks stand straight, the mysteries gather in darkness.
The Qiang sweep clear the bright beams,
The sandalwood and music roll back resentment.
The Peng and Chou guard the immortal precincts,
The Li and Fan blaze in radiant transformation.
Refined and tempered, they cherish their jade ornaments,
The chambers examine and present their offerings.
The intercalary moon augments the fruitful journey,
The Lan and Lin determine the welcoming.
Pervasive compassion devises the plan,
The ranks of rivers and branches govern.
The gleaming blades array their splendor,
The sheltering grounds establish their foundations.
They chant the southern Yi’s calendar,
Rushing toward the sun’s eclipsed faintness.

*The Eight Heavens of the Southern Direction*

The rosy clouds ignite in radiant ascent,
The Wen and Lu assist the perfected.
They reform the masters and cloud flutes,
The pavilions rest and suddenly return.
The Xiang and Mang repeatedly extend,
The Bo and Kui part in speech.
The Ye and Shen adorn the palace,
The talismans follow in the rosy observance.
The Bao peaks and orchid companions,
Repay the Ying’s dark descent.
They pour forth mist and raise their plumes,
The crowned youths bestow their calculations.
The Zhuang and Xi soar through kalpas,
The Dong and Mian trace their ancestral roots.
They略 the primordial purity of the peaks,
The moon’s steeds follow the wild geese.

*The Eight Heavens of the Western Direction*

The light weaves and subdues the ramparts,
The blazing and writhing renew.
The profound and vast shake the cords,
The hidden dragons record their ministers.
The companions assist the azure,
The Yue and Jia fill with jasper.
The river’s pivot and swallow’s treasury,
The courts align in stillness and green.
The radiant thoughts command the following,
The military charts compile the registers.
The hooked halberds uphold their might,
The fire’s rhythm extends its power.
The Song spirits and Chu’s lingzhi,
The Lang and Du behold the capital.
The lodging stars and Dipper’s Han,
The flourishing life hastens the call.

*The Eight Heavens of the Northern Direction*

The mysterious caverns flee in strength,
The qi’s chariots boundless.
The wondrous fingers urge the hosts,
The eight luminaries stand in tranquil majesty.
The lightning’s mouth leaks its veins,
The propping branches and Kun’s yellow.
They bestow and proclaim the nine celestial bodies,
The Xiao and Ci grasp their leisure.
Far and without hearing emotions,
The cold huts gleam in freshness.
The empty numen and sea’s prosperity,
The flowing mist and Meng’s mountains.
The veiled vessels bow to the mystery,
The parables of flowers curse the immortals.
The southern Kui holds the spirits,
The distant and unbound wear serene countenances.

The Dao states: These are the Great Brahma’s hidden speech within the heavens, the boundless sounds. The ancient texts inscribed them upon the Jade Luminance Gate, within the Mystery’s Left Terrace, above the Heavenly Pass and Earthly Mechanism, to rectify the five kalpas, nine completions, and ten realms, the revolutions of water, fire, metal, and wood, to enact the flowing evolution of the Three Luminaries and Five Celestial Bodies, the degrees of the stellar palaces and lodgings—retreat, stay, and retrogression. The celestial revolutions and stellar degrees record the kalpas’ numbers, the great and small Yang’s ninety-six cycles of beginning and end. The lesser extremity spans three hundred and sixty-five days, the greater extremity eighty-one myriad, or nine thousand nine hundred and ninety billion qi’s reckoning.

The celestial officials manage the calculations, observe the qi, and survey the signs, adhering to the charts to know the Jade Luminance’s revolutions and degrees. The revolutions conclude in yin and yang, yin and yang root in life and death. Life and death flow and turn, yoked to yin and yang. Able to release thought into emptiness, extinguish the heart into nothingness, merge qi with the vast, and unite the spirit with the void—then the seed’s minute form, refined like plain silk, like light, like shadow, like wind, like that which cannot be contained, the body’s tangible obstruction. Like the snake’s scales, like the cicada’s wings. One should cast off the robes and ascend as a perfected being. The cosmos all spans a chang in breadth and length.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign of Antiquity inscribed these words to establish the correct sounds. Those who know these sounds and can purify themselves to recite them—the heavens shall dispatch the true officials who govern the revolutions and degrees to descend and observe their bodies, record their meritorious diligence, and ascend to report to the heavens. The myriad spirits shall pay homage, the earthly deities shall attend the Dipper. The great and moving Perfected Kings shall protect and recommend them to the Upper Clarity! Those who perfect the Dao shall be able to wander the Three Realms, ascend through the Golden Gates. These sounds repel nothing, adorn nothing, deliver nothing, and fail to accomplish nothing—they are the heavens’ spontaneous and true sounds.

Thus, reciting them summons the celestial officers to descend and observe, the Supreme Thearch to chant from afar, the myriad spirits to pay homage, the Three Realms to attend the chariots. The host of demons bow their heads, the ghostly essences vanish of themselves. The jade-like tones resound. The ten directions grow solemn and clear. The rivers and seas fall silent, the mountains and peaks swallow the mist, the myriad numina tremble and submit, summoning and gathering the host of immortals. The heavens are free of foul vapors, the earth free of demonic dust. The dark wisdom dissolves in the profound, the great measure of the Mystery’s Mystery.

*The Upper Chapter of the Numinous Treasure’s Immeasurable Scripture of Salvation, Scroll Eleven—Concluded*
*Scroll Twelve*

**The Chapter on the Transformation and Generation of Yin and Yang**

The Dao spoke: Long ago, in the Supreme Primordial Heaven of the Grand Simplicity, within the Purple Dawn’s Flowing Radiance and the Great Goodness Bright Land, the Primordial Beginning received the *Uppermost Scripture of the Immeasurable Salvation of the Transformation and Generation of Yin and Yang*. The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning was about to expound this scripture. He circumambulated ten times to summon the ten directions. As he took his seat, the celestial perfected, the lofty sages, the exalted worthies, and the innumerable hosts of the wondrously accomplished perfected arrived borne upon the void. Azure clouds congealed their brilliance, purple and gold intermingled their splendor, jade blossoms gathered on all sides, celestial winds composed their sounds. Vermilion jade chariots and golden flowered treasure carriages, brocade canopies casting shade, resplendent hues in dazzling display—threefold purities encircled the wheels, ninefold perfected drew the reins. For seven days and seven nights, ritual lusters intermingled their radiance; the five planets grew serene and bright, auspicious mists soared into the sky. Fragrant forests flourished in lush verdure; throughout the land, mountains, rivers, groves, and trees were leveled as one. No longer did high and low persist; the earth and marshes turned deep crimson, moist and rich. Flowering pavilions sent forth rosy clouds.

The host of perfected attended the seat as the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, in profound repose, floated upon a five-colored lion. He expounded the scripture once. The great sages of the myriad heavens simultaneously proclaimed its goodness. At that moment, the men and women of the land awakened to the mechanism of life, no longer dying prematurely or meeting untimely ends.

When he expounded the scripture a second time, yin and yang conjoined their virtue, and the mysterious elixir ascended in harmony.

When he expounded it a third time, flying immortals tread the void, and numinous perfected bestowed registers.

When he expounded it a fourth time, divine dragons roused themselves, dispelling evil and dissolving calamity.

When he expounded it a fifth time, green chambers exhaled mist, and spirit windows shone through.

When he expounded it a sixth time, buds split their husks, and yang’s virtue surged aloft.

When he expounded it a seventh time, the Way of life became universally complete, and all forms attained perfect symmetry.

When he expounded it an eighth time, numinous radiance cast its shade, and winding springs received grace.

When he expounded it a ninth time, the heavens and earth in all their ranks brought forth life and transformation.

When he expounded it a tenth time, the host of perfected witnessed the covenant, revealing the great Dharma. At that moment, every man and woman of the land turned their hearts in devotion, all received protection and deliverance, and each attained long life.

The Dao spoke: As the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning expounded the scripture once, the Boundless and Immeasurable Great Spirits of the Non-Transforming East arrived with their innumerable hosts, floating upon the void.

When he expounded it a second time, the Boundless and Immeasurable Crimson Crystal Great Spirits of the South arrived with their innumerable hosts, floating upon the void.

When he expounded it a third time, the Boundless and Immeasurable House of Might Great Spirits of the West arrived with their innumerable hosts, floating upon the void.

When he expounded it a fourth time, the Boundless and Immeasurable Constant Subtlety Great Spirits of the North arrived with their innumerable hosts, floating upon the void.

When he expounded it a fifth time, the Boundless and Immeasurable Stabilizing Pole Great Spirits of the Northeast arrived with their innumerable hosts, floating upon the void.

When he expounded it a sixth time, the Boundless and Immeasurable Wind Wheel Great Spirits of the Southeast arrived with their innumerable hosts, floating upon the void.

When he expounded it a seventh time, the Boundless and Immeasurable Great Empyrean Great Spirits of the Southwest arrived with their innumerable hosts, floating upon the void.

When he expounded it an eighth time, the Boundless and Immeasurable Vast Circulation Great Spirits of the Northwest arrived with their innumerable hosts, floating upon the void.

When he expounded it a ninth time, the Boundless and Immeasurable Lofty Mystery Great Spirits of the Upper Realm arrived with their innumerable hosts, floating upon the void.

When he expounded it a tenth time, the Boundless and Immeasurable Upholding Completion Great Spirits of the Lower Realm arrived with their innumerable hosts, floating upon the void.

When the ten circumambulations were complete, the Boundless Celestial Perfected of the ten directions arrived as one. The men and women of the land turned their hearts in reverence, bearing treasure banners and flowered canopies in profusion. Cloud chariots and wind steeds gathered in countless multitudes. Gazing upward, they awaited the Celestial Worthy as he unfolded the subtle and wondrous great Dharma of the transformation and generation of yin and yang. The innumerable hosts filled the land; the earth yielded gold and jade, and sweet dew suffused the sky.

Then the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, from between his brows, emitted the radiance of the sun and moon—nine rays and ten blossoms, each as large as a pellet, hovering nine feet from his face, leaping and soaring. Their brilliance blazed forth, and in an instant, they filled heaven and earth. The ten directions merged into a single hue; the celestial and human sage multitudes gazed in rapture, unable to turn away. The sun and moon intermingled their light, transforming into a single pearl of wondrous and unique color, astonishing all who beheld it.

Within this pearl appeared celestial writings in great characters, jade-script true diagrams, dragon-phoenix treasure seals, and the configurations of the hearth serpents, vast and deeply arrayed. And within the pearl’s radiance, towering pavilions and lofty terraces of many fathoms, phoenix towers and unicorn halls, jade forests and resplendent hues, all fused into the azure void, suspended a hundred yards above this land.

The Celestial Worthy ascended, leading the celestial perfected, the lofty sages, the exalted worthies, the wondrously accomplished perfected, and the innumerable hosts of the Boundless Great Spirits of the Transformation and Generation of Yin and Yang from the ten directions—all entered the divine pearl. The celestial and human multitudes gazed upward, seeing only flickering forms entering through the pearl’s mouth. Once within, their whereabouts were unknown. The people of the land dispersed, and the earth returned to levelness, no longer sloping or sinking.

Then, within the divine pearl, in the treasure hall, the Celestial Worthy summoned the Thearchs of the Myriad Heavens to govern yin and yang and regulate the nurturing of transformation and generation. The Celestial Worthies of the Myriad Heavens, the True Lords of the Eight Directions, the Five Elder Thearchs, the Great Lords of Long Life, the Purple Dawn Emperor of the Eastern Ultimate’s Upper Palace, the Pristine Radiance of the Golden Court’s Ancestral Qi and Primordial Sovereign, the Southern Brilliance’s Jade Perfected, the Northern Dark Water Thearch, the Central Yellow Supreme Perfected, the Jade Flower Numinous Consort, the Mother of the Great Mystery’s Qi, the Ninefold Numinous Supreme Mystery, the Mother of the Transformation and Generation of Yin and Yang, the Mother of the Myriad Dao, and the Lofty Emperor of the Thearchs—all took their seats above. The ten directions reflected their forms as though seen through crystal. Their radiance merged into darkness, and celestial songs lifted their voices. The sound was graceful and refined, the wind harmonious and wafting. All things thus attained completion.

The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning turned his gaze upon the immortal throng, surveying the wondrous and sublime. The myriad heavens paid homage; dragons leapt and tigers bounded, transforming to reveal the five-wheel purple-golden luminous circular image.

Then, smoothing the flowing clouds and the verdant, mist-woven mountain waters of his robe, and grasping the table of carved jade, strung pearls, and golden essence radiating flying light, he proclaimed to the assembled perfected beings: "These celestial scriptures of great characters are the primordial root of yin and yang. In their indistinctness, they form the gate; spirit is the basis of transformation, and qi is the cause of generation.

The two substances of yin and yang, originally nameless, seek each other and thus open the way to all change. One floats, one sinks; one follows, one resists; one is firm, one is yielding; one is inner, one is outer; one is yin, one is yang; one is dragon, one is tiger. They embrace, conceive, and construct essence, thereby giving birth to the Great Void. The Great Void gives birth to the Great Non-Being; the Great Non-Being gives birth to the Great Cavern; the Great Cavern gives birth to the Great Emptiness; the Great Emptiness gives birth to the Great Vastness.

This Great Vastness lies beyond the boundless and the limitless of empty mystery. Through the interplay of yin and yang, the Two Modes are born. The Two Modes give birth to the Three Powers; the Three Powers give birth to the myriad things. The Three Realms are complete, and immortals and perfected beings stand apart. The Golden Towers and Jade Capitals, with their millions of palaces, mountains standing in ranks, rivers and seas serene—all these are the great vessels of the Primordial Beginning’s creation. From this, the Thearchs of the various heavens, the lofty perfected emperors, the divine sages, and the wise and enlightened are also born. Even down to the Nine Bureaus of the Northern Darkness, the gates of the Nine Earths, the spirits, demons, and demon marshals—all follow this same Dao.

As for humans ascending to become immortals, turning from the mortal to become sacred, and attaining the ranks of the perfected—this is like yin and yang establishing heaven and earth. By refining yin and yang, dragon and tiger, in their reversal and compliance, one may refine the form with spirit and qi, refine qi with form, refine spirit with qi, and refine the primordial with spirit, merging with the non-being of the Dao to become a lofty perfected being. The true spirit soars and transforms, penetrating into spontaneity, transforming and generating, becoming one with the Dao. Its resonance spans ten thousand kalpas, its light enduring through countless nights and days.

If you fail to awaken, you will revolve through the karmic conditions of the various destinies, suffering retribution and encountering hardship—all because you do not understand the wonders of yin and yang’s generation and the origins of the great vessel of creation. There are also those who gather the essence of yin and yang, ascending and descending with water and fire, the sun to the left and the moon to the right, containing within the Great Non-Being. Circulating the nine nines, it congeals into a purple efflorescence. If you can ingest this, you will merge with the radiance and ascend, ascending to pay homage in the Grand Purity. This, too, is the external manifestation of the harmonious Dao of yin and yang’s transformation and generation.

These profound and hidden mysteries are detailed in the golden tablets and jade registers, sealed within the Highest Perfected King’s Jade Capital of the Grand Mystery’s precinct in the Eastern Florescence’s treasure vault. When a great kalpa unfolds, the deliverance of beings is boundless."

Then, within the divine pearl, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning completed his exposition of the sutra. The perfected beings oversaw the transmission, bestowing it upon me. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words. The ritual matters were roughly concluded, and the various heavens returned to their stations. In an instant, all was silent, without lingering resonance.

At that time, the celestial and human beings who encountered this scripture universally attained deliverance, awakening to the transformations of generation. Their lifespans became as long as heaven’s. The lands turned in reverence, all witnessing the transformation of the Dao’s origin and nature, the manifestation of transformation, the illumination of transformation, the causes of transformation, the generation of spirit, the generation of qi, the generation of essence, the generation of movement, and the generation of things. Their bodies bore jade radiance, and their voices resounded with numinous tones. They became equally compassionate and loving, even strangers becoming kin. The nations were at peace, the people prosperous, rejoicing in great harmony. From the scripture’s initial revelation, the land was thus transformed. Those who had devoted their hearts, revered and honored it, all attained deliverance from the world.

The Dao declares: The names spoken by the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning in this sutra are the inner names of the Thearchs of the various heavens. The sounds perceived in contemplation are also the inner appellations of the lofty perfected ones, the true kings of yin and yang’s transformation and generation, the hidden names of the hundred spirits. These are not ordinary words of the world. The perfected beings who have already attained realization, who have penetrated the mysteries and investigated the subtle, can fully comprehend these passages. Reciting them ten times, the various heavens flourish from afar. The myriad emperors establish rites. Celestial waves ripple with auspiciousness, purple seas congeal with mist, the sun and moon emit their radiance, and the jade celestial sphere shines with surpassing brilliance. The courts of the various heavens gather in formation, and demonic spirits lose their clarity. Corpses revive, and the dead return to life. The most devoted scholars, reciting this ten times, will have the Five Thearchs attend them, the Three Realms bow in reverence, demonic essences lose their sight, and demonic perversities vanish. They will deliver those on the verge of death, snatching them back from the brink of extinction.

Thus it is: by exploring the origins of yin and yang’s transformation and generation, mending what is broken and reviving what is injured, one regains the root of life and nature. The Dao is the father, virtue the mother, spirit the teacher, and life the master. Impure qi universally dissipates, and the body gradually merges with the true. One summons and commands the ten directions, wielding authority over demonic spirits, subduing the earth’s only ones, and binding malevolent perversities. Yet this only averts death—it cannot restore life. To recite this passage lightly brings calamity upon oneself. To honor and revere it brings prosperity to one’s household. Generation after generation flourishes, forming good karmic connections. Ten thousand disasters do not approach, and divine luminaries guard the gate.

This scripture is revered and wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital. It delivers boundless beings and is the root of the myriad Dao. Its majestic model is of virtue beyond measure.

The Dao declares: Whoever recites this sutra ten times invokes the Celestial Assembly. The suffering souls of countless generations of ancestors, trapped in the dark realms, all immediately receive deliverance, ascending to the Vermilion Palace. After nine years of refinement, they are transformed and reborn, becoming noble persons. Those who diligently study this sutra, fulfilling their merit and perfecting their virtue, all attain divine transcendence, soaring to the Golden Towers and roaming the Jade Capital.

The most devoted scholars who cultivate and recite this sutra all immediately receive deliverance, ascending to the Southern Palace. Those in the world who recite it find yin and yang harmoniously transformed, the Dao of life entering their bodies. Their lifespans extend, and they attain peace. Later, they all achieve the Dao of liberation through apparent death, their spirit-souls briefly extinguished without passing through hell. They immediately regain their forms and roam the Great Emptiness.

This scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally delivering without end. All celestial and human beings receive its blessings. Boundless merit arises, and the living and the dead are moved. It is treasured by heaven and not transmitted to the lower world. Only the most devoted scholars, offering gold with sincere hearts and swearing oaths to heaven, may receive it.

Those who lightly disclose or arrogantly neglect it bring calamity upon the seven ancestral generations, subjecting them to the servitude of the underworld officials. They shall attend this scripture before the Five Emperors. Twenty-four Jade Lads and twenty-four Jade Maidens shall guard and protect the scripture’s recipient, shielding their body with divine talismans.

The Dao declares: In the first month, observe a prolonged fast and recite this scripture, thereby extolling Heaven and Earth. All things transform and flourish in their season. Withered forests and dried trunks regain lushness; white bones and decayed remains receive the harmony of Heaven, their essence restored. True nourishment wells within, the Red Writ operates, and the Great Mystery generates talismans. The hundred spirits are summoned back, and for the departed souls of past ages, the bonds of earthly servitude are severed, allowing them to ascend to the Southern Palace.

In the seventh month, observe a prolonged fast and recite this scripture. The Celestial Perfected descend in attendance, and the myriad treasures ripen. Yin transforms into yang, hardness softens, and the skin congeals. The Five Flowers knit into bloom, and the cinnabar soul radiates its spirit. Green bones are forged anew, sinews of gold and marrow of jade form. The body attains immortality, and one’s name is inscribed in the registers of Heaven. On the Yellow Register and White Tablet, death is erased and life is conferred.

In the tenth month, observe a prolonged fast and recite this scripture. The Mysterious One stands before, the True One serves in attendance, and the Great One abides at the center. Yin and yang converge, and the numinous arises from the indistinct. The primordial simplicity is restored, and the Dao’s movement renews daily. For kings and emperors, rulers and ministers, fathers and sons, the nation is stabilized, the mandate secured, and Heaven’s longevity preserved. Generation after generation, they remain sovereigns, ruling their domains in peace, and the people proclaim great harmony.

On the eight nodal days, recite this scripture. The Eight Radiant Spirits gather, and primordial qi intermingles. Yang bestows, yin receives; essence is complete, and nature is true. The cycle returns in full, and one’s name is recorded in golden script. Through the Eight Gates and Nine Chambers, one ascends at will, becoming a Perfected of the Nine Palaces.

On one’s natal day, recite this scripture. The embryo of truth begins to form, its origin in the Great Perfected. Yin and yang follow the Dao, and Heaven’s blessings arise naturally. The hun and po souls are firmly preserved, and the myriad qi attain immortality without undergoing trials. Lifespan stretches endlessly, one’s celestial register is fixed, and the great demons announce one’s name. The myriad spirits pay homage, one’s name is inscribed in Heaven, and with merit fulfilled and virtue perfected, one ascends to the Great Mystery.

The Dao declares: On the day of practicing the Dao, bathe in fragrant waters, fast, and enter the chamber. Face east, knock the teeth thirty-two times to reach the Thirty-Two Heavens, and bow thirty-two times in reverence. Close the eyes and silently envision oneself seated amidst clouds of blue, yellow, and white qi, the inner and outer suffused with mist. A Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Lion, and White Crane array themselves to left and right. Sun and moon illuminate the chamber, and a circular halo emanates from the crown, its light suffusing the ten directions. All must be vividly perceived.

Recite the secret incantation:
*"Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Dao Lord, summon forth from within my body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Attendant Officials to the Left and Right, the Jade Lads who tend incense, the Jade Maidens who transmit words, the Talisman-Bearing Officers of the Five Emperors, and the Incense Officials of the Day—thirty-six each in number—to convey my entreaty. Today is an auspicious day, a prolonged fast in a purified hall, practicing this supreme scripture to deliver boundless beings. May my words ascend swiftly to the presence of the Most High Primordial Sovereign of the Thirty-Two Heavens."*

Conclude by drawing qi thirty-two times, then face east and recite the scripture:

*The Supreme Primordial Wondrous Scripture of the Limitless Salvation of Beings*
*The Primordial Cavern-Mysterious, the Numinous Treasure’s Original Chapter, yin and yang transform and generate, ten cycles deliver beings. The Heavenly Origin’s hidden rhymes, the primordial chaos’s spontaneity, vast kalpas beyond naming, yin and yang conjoin their essence. Qi permeates the firmament, the Great Image unfolds in clarity. Movement reaches its extreme and becomes flame; stillness reaches its extreme and becomes a spring. Yang exhales, yin inhales, and the myriad origins are transformed. The dragon calls to the tiger, the tiger plunges into the abyss; the dragon emerges from fire, and transformation endlessly recurs. The Mysterious Wave’s wondrous existence, the void’s extremity forms shape. The Five Movements inaugurate creation, and the Golden Perfected becomes Heaven. Jade palaces and jasper towers rise upon the Nine Verdant Mountains. Within the Inner Capital, a hundred million spirits govern the myriad immortals. Jade essence congeals into splendor, cloud-script treasures unfold. Sixty-four bodies branch into eight thousand transformations; yin and yang’s qi intermingle, generating the Red Writ. No script is without divinity, no script without illumination, no script without establishment, no script without form, no script without transformation, no script without ascent—this is the Great Brahma Heaven within the heavens.*

*From the indistinct, existence and non-existence arise; the true Dao propels change. Those who grasp its subtlety transform their bodies into immortals. Immortality values long life, and the qi of life stretches endlessly. The qi of the Nine Heavens’ phoenix abides on the Great Possession Mountain, governing the hundred passes below, the long valleys, and the Great Origin. One hundred twenty officials encircle and attend the Great Mystery. The Great Brahma Qi circulates through the ten directions. Within it dwells the spirit of delivering beings from death, the Great Lord of Longevity of the Southern Culmen, the Emperor of Peace and Treasure of the Eastern Grove, the Great Spirit Sima who delivers the world, the Venerable Han Jun who cherishes life, the Exalted Deities of the Southern Upper Bureau—Life-Controllers, Recorders, Extenders of Lifespan, and Dispellers of Misfortune—who restore bones and revive the dead, delivering boundless beings. Today, the celestial registers are reviewed, and the various heavens descend in attendance.*

*The Eastern Limitless Dao Statute Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, delivers boundless beings.*
*The Southern Limitless Divine Response Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, delivers boundless beings.*
*The Western Limitless Black Convergence Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, delivers boundless beings.*
*The Northern Limitless Mysterious Unity Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, delivers boundless beings.*
*The Northeastern Limitless Yang Boundary Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, delivers boundless beings.*
*The Southeastern Limitless Yin Realm Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, delivers boundless beings.*
*The Southwestern Limitless True Nature Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, delivers boundless beings.*
*The Northwestern Limitless Intent Transformation Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, delivers boundless beings.*
*The Upper Limitless Numinous Wonder Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, delivers boundless beings.*
*The Lower Limitless True Spirit Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, delivers boundless beings.*

*The Ten Directions’ Divine Kings of Longevity, who transform and generate through yin and yang, deliver boundless beings. All ride upon jasper-script purple-cloud celestial chariots, their radiant canopies streaming light, flying feathered canopies shimmering with azure mist. Their pearl-encrusted cinnabar carriages are shaded by white clouds, their rainbow wheels turning in the void. They are drawn by divine phoenixes and white tigers, bearing ten-flowered banners and demon-subduing staffs. Their cloud-brocade pennants gleam, and their purple-jade standards ripple. Heavenly dragons and numinous beasts roar and sing in unison. The Primordial Sovereign opens the way, and wondrous ranks flank the chariots. A hundred million chariots and ten thousand riders float through the void to arrive.*

Their radiant chariots turn back, overseeing the deliverance of the true and the salvation of the living. The Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity, the Perfected of the Jade Tower, the Central Yellow Venerable, and the Primordial Essence Dao Lord—all wielders of the Cavernous Scriptures—gather before the Imperial Throne. They refine and transmute, then proclaim their decrees to the myriad heavens.

Through karmic consciousness and conditioned arising, the Five Phases transform and give birth. The Three Primes and Nine Bureaus distinguish the ranks of the sacred and the profane. Below, they inspect the Three Realms and the boundless divine lands: the Great Cinnabar’s crimson mists, the Purple Crossing’s blazing light, the Jade Crystal’s golden steeds, the Stone Radiance’s central realm, the Celestial Ford’s imperial terrace, and the Dark Gate of Fusang.

They intermingle and purify, harmonizing yin and yang, reviewing the jade registers to rectify the luminous wheel of the true Dao. They establish domains within yin and yang, where the two qi merge, nurturing the ten thousand kinds and unfolding the primordial root of transformation.

Those who awaken to the wondrous primordial return to their divine essence. The Three Palaces circulate their flow, and the Jade Tower blooms with splendor. The body attains immortality, blessings extend to descendants, and nine generations of ancestors—seven lineages of forebears—are delivered. Black ledgers are swiftly erased, sins expunged, and none are left to linger. The Dark Gates open without delay.

The August Sovereign of the Void issues his decree, marking the hour of ascension. In the Northern Capital’s frigid pools, the guardians marshal form and soul. Yang transforms the soul, yin nurtures the form; when form and soul unite with the Dao, they soar across the Vermilion Mound. Liberated and carefree, they ascend as the seed-people of transformation. All living beings rejoice, abiding by the turning of the cosmic wheel, their years matching heaven’s span. They forever transcend the trials of the great demon, the ordeals of celestial testing, rising beyond the Three Realms to roam the Supreme Clarity.

In the Heaven of Supreme Clarity, the Heavenly Emperor’s profound mystery dwells within the formless realm of pure conduct.

The Thirty-Two Heavens. The Thirty-Two Emperors. The hidden taboos of the heavens. The hidden names of the heavens. The empty cavern of the celestial center, the spontaneous numinous scriptures, the hidden rhymes of the heavens—the celestial center’s sound, the celestial center’s reverence, the celestial center’s spirits, the celestial center’s great demons, the celestial center’s numina.

Nine yangs and ten yins, the root of transformation and arising, the unfathomable mystery—profound beyond reckoning. The divine perfected scatter and descend, universally delivering heavenly and mortal beings. Yang’s womb and yin’s embryo are sealed and secured by spirit. Spirit is the root of the heart; the heart moves through intention. When heart and intention unite with the Dao, they dwell within a forced name. Without knowing the natural, the spirit shifts and changes. Guarding the path’s crevices, the spirit transforms into cinnabar. Cinnabar transforms into the ancestral qi, the mysterious unfolds endlessly. Yin bestows, yang flourishes; refine essence to preserve spirit. The divine soul is eternally firm.

Uniting with radiance, they ascend in flight, roaming and feasting across the Eight Poles. Knots of stagnation dissolve. The wondrous root of the Nine Primordials opens the barrier of the mysterious realm. In the great kalpa of primordial chaos, the Three Paths surge and intertwine. The Demon Kings oversee and summon, unrestrained by the celestial gates.

The Eastern Dipper’s yang essence, the Western Dipper’s yin fluid, the Northern Dipper’s nurturing of the embryo, the Southern Dipper’s bestowal of life, the Central Dipper’s revolving governance—five qi merge in darkness. The Azure Emperor enacts governance, the White Emperor spreads virtue, the Vermilion Emperor nurtures and refines, the Black Emperor transforms and fosters, the Yellow Emperor guards the Dao—none among the myriad spirits transgress.

The Azure Heaven’s Demon King, Dragon Radiance of the Mystic Pattern. The Vermilion Heaven’s Demon King, Cinnabar Spirit’s Inspired Manifestation. The White Heaven’s Demon King, Luminous Splendor of Jade Moisture. The Black Heaven’s Demon King, Spirit Gate’s Penetrating Clarity. The Yellow Heaven’s Demon King, Vermilion Infant’s Concealed Moon. The Five Emperors’ Great Demons, ancestors of the myriad spirits, fly through the Three Realms, commanding the immortal legions.

Their banners wave, drums beat, and standards flutter as they roam the vast emptiness. The boundless yin expanse stirs with divine winds. The Nine Yangs’ primordial transformation, the Three Radiances’ net across the void—realms great and small, the perfected lords and immortal sages. In the ten thousand shifts of the indistinct, fierce horses and venomous dragons, towering spears leaning against the sky, jade pestles shattering peaks. True talismans stream fire, incinerating malevolent fiends. The Nine Heavens advance in formation, the Great Uglies submit to discipline. Arrayed before the Northern Capital, they slay a hundred million ghosts. Unobstructed, yin and yang each follow their transformations and give birth.

The Three Mysteries and Nine Palaces—let none disperse or stray. Jade petitions ascend in offering, golden steeds soar on high. A universal proclamation resounds without end, the ten thousand *qi* converge as one. The Three Realms and Five Emperors rouse the primal mechanism. The Hidden Capital’s cavernous purity gleams with veiled divine radiance; Brahmanic conduct weaves a net, clouds congeal into a celestial metropolis. Azure peaks float in the void, the Great Granary refines its courtyard. Mist swirls, winds sway, and the myriad spirits of Yu Lü gather in throngs.

The imperial *qi* of the primordial origin suffuses hundreds and thousands, arising from one completion and branching into kings and infants. The Way of yin enacts vast transformation, the yang soul wields authority. Nine changes and ten unions link the golden gates in a haloed chain. Green windows exhale sunlight, the numinous net commands immortals. Water becomes the Great One, its form like a lotus in bloom. The great spirit of transformation bears the jade title *Jingyan*, clad in brocade robes and a jade turban, enthroned to govern the ten thousand heavens.

Yet it too arises from yin and yang, transmitted through the transformations of generation. The five talismans and jade scriptures are the root of the supreme Dao. From them, heaven and earth are born, sun and moon cycle endlessly. Within the nine *qi* of the great void lies a jade abyss. Its still mirror reflects inner images, while the stars trace their paths beyond. Above heaven and below heaven, no darkness is too deep, no shadow too faint—without limit, without end.

The vast Brahmanic expanse stretches boundless, lightless. Crimson clarity opens the path, its revolution turning naturally. The primordial vast *qi* drifts like clouds, like mist, coalescing in the void to form characters—treasured seals of golden script. Crimson writings and jade talismans, the eight luminous texts of mystery, preserve and regulate the kalpas, ensuring heaven’s eternal endurance.

Brahmanic *qi* pervades the net of all things, unfolding the ten thousand forms. The primal warp flows forth, the thirty-two heavens. Wheeling without color, circling the ten directions, revolving the Dipper and Winnowing Basket, cycling through the five constants. Thirty-five divisions gather the *qi* of the Upper Origin; the eight luminosities merge in darkness, *qi* entering the profoundest mystery.

The profound is the mother of spirits, yin commands the yang officials. It regulates growth and decline, movement and stillness, vast and minute. Through unchanging constancy, earth aligns with heaven. The left enters the right, the last reaches the first. The mechanism of the supreme Dao transcends the great void’s barriers. The true One equals emptiness, the root of transformation.

At the extreme of transformation, change arises; at the extreme of change, the profound emerges. Within the profound dwells the Great August One, the upper luminosity coiling in flight. Vermilion auroras dance in the sky, harmonious chants resound at the banquet. Golden perfection shines brightly, flowing through the cloud palaces. Jade script summons *qi*, the profound wind scatters mist. The grand empyrean flourishes in elegance, aiding the flight of immortals.

A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—naturally they become real. Within the real dwells the spirit, the Great Lord of Longevity. The Yellow Elder of the Grotto Chamber, the Azure Emperor, the jade consorts to left and right, the august deities of the Great One. The Controller of Destiny resides in the heart, peach and vitality circulate essence. Crimson script adorns the brain’s membranes, blending with the primordial yellow truth.

The nameless is called the profound; crimson script commands the spirits. Holding talismans and grasping registers, it preserves life and roots existence. Ascending to the Jade Hut, entering and exiting the Yellow Court, within the eight darknesses and the subtlest realms. Below, it governs the human body, the Mud Pill Palace and Crimson Palace. At the center, it orders the five *qi* and harmonizes the hundred spirits. Ten revolutions return the numinous, the ten thousand *qi* unite as immortals.

The immortal way values life, endlessly delivering beings. Above, it opens the eight gates, the flying heavenly dharma-wheel. Sin and fortune, prohibitions and precepts, karmic causes and conditions. Universally receiving liberation, the dead soul gains a living body. The body attains rebirth, ascending to be heard by the various heavens. Above the various heavens, each has its gate of generation. Within lies the chapter of the great void’s transformations, the hidden texts of demon kings, and the words that match the lofty perfected.

**First: The Hidden Formula of the Desire Realm’s Demon King—Yin-Yang Transformation for Prolonging Life**
The Great One abides in empty nothingness, solitary and serene. Stillness reaches its extreme, and movement arises; yin and yang then nurture. Yang fire and yin water circulate fully. At the center, great harmony flourishes, the ten thousand *qi* all fresh. Mysterious resonance responds in wondrous accord; yellow chambers emit mist. At the gate of white clouds, *qi* flows like a spring. Take from that to obtain this, take from this to obtain that. Endlessly flowing, the spirit settles and halts.

Crimson enters black, black returns to crimson. Sometimes guard with the masculine, sometimes with the feminine. Transforming emotions and nature, preserve this to attain longevity.

**Second: The Hidden Formula of the Form Realm’s Demon King—Yin-Yang Transformation for Ascending as an Immortal**

Boundless and formless, the great void is dark and obscure. Two forces devour each other, and suddenly the primordial chaos arises. Brahma-*qi* intertwines, spanning ninety trillion leagues. In profound stillness, the spirit is born, and celestial essence blazes radiant. A perfect circle a thousand *li* in diameter holds divine script within. Dragons and phoenixes coil and twist, transmuting the Three Spirits. The Jade Capital and the Dark Mountain brim with the *qi* of the Nine Perfected. The golden well gleams limpid, its waters trickling in abundance. Crimson towers rise through ten thousand heavens, all sharing a single root. Return to the origin, shed all adornment, and ascend to the immortal realm. If you grasp this in your heart, inhale and swallow the flowing rosy clouds. They scatter like jade beads, like lingzhi and cinnabar. None but the wondrous may glimpse this—daily, the dragon chariot turns.

**Third: The Hidden Formula of the Formless Realm’s Demon King—Yin-Yang Transformation for Creating Heaven and Earth**

When desire and form are exhausted, the formless appears before you. Vast and indistinct, the empty expanse conceals ten thousand heavens within. Dwell in formless intent, and let your mind be true and pure. Summon with your mind, and it arrives—five stars and three luminaries hasten forth. The essence of the sun and the radiance of the moon take root in luminous splendor. Within the square-inch palace of the spirit, jade perfected ones array themselves. The heart’s fire, ninefold yang, refines the bones into gold. Above, it reaches the utmost height; below, it delves into the deepest source. Let the fire command swiftness, and the flying dragon circles eight times. Now yin, now yang—transformation and concealment arise of themselves. The great cauldron of heaven and earth divides water and fire at its center. The origin of life remains unknown; the gate to the Dao is unseen. Life arises from joyful resonance, where spirit and *qi* attain utmost purity. Auspicious mists drift gently, bathing and refining all spirits. The Three Realms stand firm, the great desert merges into oneness. Mount the dragon and soar through the clouds, your feathered canopy and azure skirt trailing behind.

Above these Three Realms, amidst the flight through empty space, the Demon Kings chant their songs, their verses harmonizing with the cavern hymns. Recite them a hundred times, and your name ascends to the Southern Palace. Recite them a thousand times, and the Demon Kings will safeguard and welcome you. With the Dao perfected in ten thousand apertures, you will ascend to the great void, traverse the Three Realms, and attain the rank of Immortal Duke. Those who hear these sacred verses will command the reverence of the Demon Kings, who will dispatch earth spirits to escort and attend you, liberating you from the earthly prison. The five sufferings and eight hardships will be overcome, your seven ancestors will ascend, and you will forever depart the realm of ghosts. Your soul will cross the Vermilion Mound, undergo refinement, and be reborn anew. This is called boundless deliverance, universal salvation without end.

There exists a secret celestial script, revered by all heavens. To leak or profane it is to fall into hell, bringing calamity upon your seven ancestors. The Dao declares: These two chapters are the hidden songs of the Heavenly Emperors and the numinous Demon Kings. They reveal the inner workings of yin-yang transformation, the union of heaven and earth, and the esoteric essence by which the ten thousand things are conceived. Those who grasp their essentials will enjoy prolonged vision and extended years, attaining the immortality of the divine transcendent. In the highest sense, they emulate the Three Honored Ones, giving birth to heaven and establishing earth, nurturing the primordial chaos. In the middle sense, they shift and harmonize yin and yang, contracting and expanding creation, aligning with the virtue of heaven. In the lowest sense, they blend the yin and yang of dragon and tiger, uniting the hundred spirits, summoning the returning wind and purple mist, harmonizing the hundred joints, and subtly employing the five phases. Through the ebb and flow of yin and yang, they attain the Dao. All these are the words of the Great Brahma, not the common speech of the mundane world. Their language lacks ornate beauty, their melodies lack florid embellishment—thus they are called profound and obscure, difficult to fathom in detail.

This treasure of the heavens is concealed within the Purple Vault of the Dark Capital’s Upper Palace. According to the dark statutes, it is transmitted but once every forty thousand kalpas. If a perfected one arrives bearing gold and treasures, offering sincerity, and follows the ancient rites to pledge allegiance to the Ten Heavens, the text may then be entrusted to them after the sacred shuttle is woven.

The Dao declares: This scripture, expounding the Dao of yin-yang transformation, was spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. Those who recite it will see their virtue flourish and never meet their end. Within it lies the hidden secret of yin-yang, the principle by which generative *qi* brings forth auspiciousness. Misfortunes and calamities dissolve, and primordial fortune is naturally attained. Should the revolutions of heaven and earth reach their inauspicious end, should the sun and moon and five planets wane and wax erratically, should the sagely and divine withdraw or the unlearned suffer affliction—whenever such disasters arise, all beings of the same *qi* must unite in heart to perform purification rites. For six hours, they will burn incense; ten times, they will recite the scripture. Blessings and virtue will descend at once, dispelling all misfortune. This is the boundless scripture, universal deliverance without end.

The Dao speaks: When the unlearned’s cultivation of the Way is shallow or their immortal rank incomplete, their destined time of dissolution arrives, and their body enters the Great Yin. At the moment of their passing, fellow students and perfected beings shall burn incense and recite this scripture ten times to deliver their corporeal form according to the proper method. The officials of yin and yang will transform their generative *qi* into spirit, and their five viscera will regenerate of themselves. Their complexion shall return to the fairness of youth, and their spirit-soul will ascend directly to the Southern Palace. According to the merit of their cultivation, they will be reborn after a calculated number of days. Revolving without cessation, they will attain the rank of divine immortals.

The Dao speaks: Within the great vessel of primordial chaos lies the divine wind, which governs generation and transformation. It expands and contracts in accord with the seasons, like a key turning in a lock. Yin and yang become spirits, moving to and fro within it, their *qi* and spirits intermingling. Hard and soft unite in essence, and transformation occurs naturally, though none perceive its arising. Generation has no beginning, and its bounds are unseen. When this scripture is recited, the spirits of generation descend, and the primordial *qi* surges in abundance.

When the revolutions of heaven and earth reach their end, when the stellar lodges deviate from their courses, when the sun and moon lose their proper times of rising and setting, when the four seasons fall out of order, when yin and yang are unbalanced, when the realm suffers poor harvests, when warfare and invasion arise, when pestilence and poison spread, when the people perish young, when teachers and friends pass away—whenever such calamities occur, all must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture. The merit of great purification rites and scripture recitation is profound. Above, it dissolves heavenly disasters and safeguards the emperor; below, it wards off poison and harm, delivering the people. In life and death, all depend upon it, and its blessings are beyond measure. Thus it is called boundless, universally delivering heaven and humanity.

The Dao speaks: Whoever possesses this scripture and performs these meritorious deeds for the sake of the lord of heaven and earth and the people—on the day of calamity, if they resolve to perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture ten times—all the heavens will record their names, the myriad spirits will attend and protect them, and the perfected beings on high will enable them to become ministers of the Golden Gates of the Sagely Lord. The heavens record the merits and transgressions of people with utmost precision, down to the finest detail. Even the demon kings of heaven will safeguard their persons. Those who attain the Way shall fully comprehend these most profound words.

Within the heavens, the great Brahma’s hidden speech resounds in boundless tones.
—*The Middle Chapter of the Numinous Writ of the Primordial Beginning*, composed by the Lord of the Dao of the Eight Heavens of the East.

The Elixir of Valley’s Origin, darkly nurtured, radiantly bright.
Mournful reverence stirs the secret furnace; the vast pool recites its inscriptions.
The hollow yin gives rise to yang; the Three Primes take flight in essence.
The Northern Numen’s paired script bears qi’s form, conceiving the true.
Jade peaks and golden springs—divine liquid drips in purity.
At last, the jade-like kernel enfolds the azure husk; the primal root abides in the numinous marsh.
The mighty and luminous chant within the cavern; the resplendent thunder divides and conjoins.
Transforming and irrigating the great source, blossoms arise in precious splendor.

In the Eight Heavens of the South:
The liquid of the heart, blended with metal, surges in dragon waves of dense radiance.
Bright clouds moisten lead; the nest’s fire advances in exaltation.
Dispersing and suffusing the luminous blossoms, nurturing cinnabar into ointment.
Jade-like brilliance drips as dew; the winding pavilion blooms upon its terrace.
The swift gale of intent thunders; the Nine Banners summon through the void.
Fierce smoke blends with the subtle; the forge’s melt congeals as syrup.
The jeweled strands rejoice in harmony; the Yellow Chamber mediates in peace.
The male guards the Great Expanse; the female embraces the dark marrow.

In the Eight Heavens of the West:
The wheel of flame, the crimson numen, interlaces with the Dipper’s ministers.
The cauldron’s aid turns to azure; the Feng’s restraint shatters might.
Bing seeks Gui’s fellowship; the radiant and elegant flourish in the western darkness.
The Great Mound’s purple blaze steams in the morning’s departure.
Sprouting transformations of the Tail’s lineage, illuminating the Pure Subtlety.
Birth alters substance to hardness; blending transforms the banquet’s rites.
The hook’s earth stirs the Winnowing Basket; the hall’s brilliance unfurls in splendor.
The rosy clouds bestow again; the vast and boundless drift in distant bends.

In the Eight Heavens of the North:
The perfected complete the luminous capital; the Mao Stream’s dryad maidens.
Vast and boundless, encircling the bells; assisting and expanding the clustered obscurity.
The thief’s few summonings shift; the mournful lord’s circuitous passage.
Privately attaining return to darkness; the muddy script in purple haze.
The boundless and distant, the distant and remote—walking the true in the hidden peaks.
Preserving benefit and vast life; the Great Vastness of the dark vault.
The distant cosmos in minute detail; dragons conceal immortal traces.
The sea’s lineage expands in brilliance; the jade descendants of the numinous palace.

The Dao speaks: These are the great Brahma’s hidden utterances within the heavens, the boundless tones—ancient script concealed in the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace—to illuminate the transformations of yin and yang, the divine changes of creation, the true mechanism of the Three Realms, the profound mysteries of the Great Dao, the five-colored clouds coiling into characters. The boundaries are of purple gold; the scrolls are of dragon brocade. Each character spans a full *zhang* in length. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign of Old inscribed these words to establish the correct intonation.

Those who know these tones and can purify themselves in fasting to recite them shall have all the heavens dispatch the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings to descend and observe their persons, record their meritorious diligence, and report it above to the heavens. The myriad spirits shall pay homage; the earthly deities shall attend at their gates. The mighty demon kings shall safeguard and recommend the perfected. With the Dao complete, they shall attain the ability to wander the Three Realms and ascend through the Golden Gates.

These tones repel all, exorcise all, deliver all, and accomplish all—tones of the Heavenly Perfected, natural and spontaneous. Thus, reciting them summons the Flying Heavenly Ones to descend in observation. The Supreme Lord chants from afar; the myriad spirits pay homage. The Three Realms attend in their chariots; the host of demons bow their heads. Ghostly essences vanish of themselves; the jade-like chimes resound. The ten directions grow solemn and clear; rivers and seas fall silent. Mountains and peaks swallow their mists; the myriad numina tremble and submit. The gathered immortals are summoned; the heavens are free of defilement, the earth free of demonic dust. Profound wisdom illumines the pure; the vast and mysterious abides in the most profound mystery.

The *Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for the Limitless Salvation of Humanity*, Scroll Twelve, concludes.
Scroll Thirteen.

The *Supreme Scripture of the Primordial Essence of the Great One*

The Dao spoke: Long ago, in the Primordial Yellow Heaven, within the Purple Void and Golden Azure Realm of Great Radiance, the Primordial Beginning received the *Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial Essence of the Great One for the Limitless Salvation of Humanity*. As the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning was about to expound this scripture, he circumambulated ten times to summon the ten directions, and only then ascended his throne.

The Heavenly Perfected, the Most August and Exalted, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Primordial Emperor of the Yellow and the Old, the Primordial Essence of the Great One, the Perfected Lord of the Wondrous Void, the Ninefold Central Citadel, the Thirty-Six August Sovereigns and Immortal Kings, the Earthly Perfected, the True Sovereigns and Numinous Immortals within the Earth, the officials and marshals beneath the soil—an innumerable host—all came riding upon the void. Azure mists and golden clouds, jade palanquins and wheeling chariots, cinnabar blossoms casting shade, the jade-like radiance of primordial essence, auspicious hues converging in splendor, illumined the vast heavens.

For five days and five nights, the Perfected of the Great One pervaded all heavens, the palaces of the sun and moon, the celestial courts of the stars and constellations. Dragon-drawn chariots halted their course; jade mechanisms stilled their motion. Traversing orbits congealed in brilliance; the void shone like gold. The cool breeze grew tranquil; the celestial valleys deepened in stillness. Verdant mists settled low; luminous radiance shone forth. Azure heavens flowed with cosmic order; purple mists drifted as mist. The Three Origins surged in vast cycles; the Four Qi stretched into distant clarity.

The lands of the realm—its mountains, rivers, forests, and groves—all lay smooth and level, without height or depth. The earth became golden glass, thick and yielding, suffused with radiance. Brocade-like clouds and rosy hues appeared, yet no other colors remained.

The assembled Perfected attended the throne as the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning sat upon his mysterious dais, floating above five-colored divine dragons. As he expounded the scripture once, the Great Sages of all heavens simultaneously acclaimed its virtue.

At that moment, the men and women of the realm beheld with their eyes and pondered in their hearts: from whence did the heavens and earth, the celestial bodies and terrestrial realms, the jeweled terraces and treasure pavilions, the immortals, sages, ghosts, and spirits arise, and how did they come to possess these forms?

As he expounded the scripture a second time, they reflected upon the sun and moon in their ceaseless flow, the rivers and seas in their converging currents—by what power do they move and turn, and upon what do they depend to stand alone in the void?

As he expounded the scripture a third time, all the heaven-dwellers turned their radiance inward in profound vision; their qi entered the Primordial Origin, and their Dao merged with the Sovereign of the Void.

As he expounded the scripture a fourth time, all the heaven-dwellers gazed upon the Three Realms above and below, where clouds stirred and winds bestowed auspicious omens.

As he expounded the scripture a fifth time, they awakened to the transformative origin: the Primordial Essence of the Great One, the Ninefold True Earth, which through resonance gives rise to all things.

As he expounded the scripture a sixth time, their numinous minds suddenly opened, and they comprehended the heavens and earth, the harmonious progression of yin and yang, and the completion of the myriad things.

As he expounded the scripture a seventh time, the primordial vastness overflowed and scattered; jade mushrooms sprouted of themselves. Dragons and tigers intoned in sorrow, awakening to the dharma-realm.

As he expounded the scripture an eighth time, their bodies refined into emptiness, and emptiness transformed into the Real. Such divine transformations were truly rare.

As he expounded the scripture a ninth time, the great assembly rejoiced as one. Gazing upon the Primordial Beginning, they awakened to the mechanism of the Dao, and the Primordial Essence revealed its wonder.

As he expounded the scripture a tenth time, celestial music flowed in melody; all sounds harmonized as one. Jade-like forms descended in compassion, pure as the void and unadorned.

At that moment, all the men and women of the realm turned their hearts in devotion, received protection and deliverance, and attained longevity without exception.

The Dao spoke: As the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning expounded the scripture once, the boundless and immeasurable Perfected of the Primordial Essence of the Great One from the eastern direction, with their innumerable host, arrived floating upon the void.

As he expounded the scripture a second time, those from the southern direction arrived in like manner.

As he expounded the scripture a third time, those from the western direction arrived in like manner.

As he expounded the scripture a fourth time, those from the northern direction arrived in like manner.

As he expounded the scripture a fifth time, those from the northeastern direction arrived in like manner.

As he expounded the scripture a sixth time, those from the southeastern direction arrived in like manner.

As he expounded the scripture a seventh time, those from the southwestern direction arrived in like manner.

As he expounded the scripture an eighth time, those from the northwestern direction arrived in like manner.

As he expounded the scripture a ninth time, those from the upper direction arrived in like manner.

As he expounded the scripture a tenth time, those from the lower direction arrived in like manner.

When the ten recitations were complete, the boundless Perfected of the Primordial Essence of the Great One from the ten directions arrived simultaneously. The men and women of the realm turned their hearts in reverence.

All heard the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning proclaim the teachings of the Primordial Essence of the Great One, declaring that the heavens and earth, the immortals, sages, ghosts, and spirits of the Three Realms, all depend upon the True Earth for gestation, nurturance, and completion.

This True Earth is not the coarse, inert soil of the mundane world, but rather the perfected transformation of the Five Agents, existing before heaven and earth, the complete embodiment of the Dao—formless True Earth. Those who recognize this True Earth naturally attain the Dao.

They must pay homage to the Primordial Beginning and seek this wondrous teaching. The arriving multitude was like fine rain or dense mist, an innumerable host, pressing upon the land until half the realm sank beneath them, beyond all restraint.

Thereupon, the Primordial Beginning suspended a precious pearl, as small as a millet grain, in the mysterious void five *zhang* above the earth. The Celestial Worthy ascended and led the Heavenly Perfected, the Most August and Exalted, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Primordial Emperor of the Yellow and the Old, the Primordial Essence of the Great One, the Perfected Lord of the Wondrous Void, all the true numina within and beneath the earth, the boundless assembly of sages, and the boundless Perfected of the Primordial Essence of the Great One from the ten directions—all entered the pearl.

Gazing upward, the heaven-dwellers saw only a gentle stirring as all passed through the pearl’s opening.

Once they entered the pearl’s mouth, none knew where they had gone. The people of the realm dispersed, and the land returned to levelness, no longer slanting or sinking. Within the precious pearl, the Primordial Beginning then expounded the sutra in full, while the assembled Perfected oversaw the transmission, bestowing it upon me. At that moment, joy and celebration defied description. When the ritual matters were roughly complete, the heavens resumed their positions, and in the space of a breath, all fell silent without a trace of lingering sound.

At that time, the heaven-dwellers and mortals who encountered this sutra universally attained deliverance, preserving their allotted years without harm or injury. The entire realm turned in reverence, all cultivating faith of the heart. They trusted in the Dao and the sutra, trusted in the master and the dharma, trusted in the rank and the realization, trusted in the eternal and the living, trusted in transformation and the root. Their words held no embellishment or deceit, their mouths uttered no false sounds. With unified compassion and love, even those of different bones became kin. The realm knew peace, the people abundance, and all rejoiced in great harmony. From the moment the sutra’s teachings emerged, the entire realm followed the Dao. Those who had cultivated utmost sincerity, revered and honored it, all attained transcendence of the world.

The Dao declares: All that the Primordial Celestial Worthy spoke within this sutra are the inner names of the Heavenly Emperors, the hidden rhymes of sound, as well as the inner taboos of the true kings and the concealed names of the hundred spirits. The Primordial Essence of the Great One is the formless true earth. True earth being formless is the Great Void. The Great Void as earth gives birth to all within the Three Realms—heaven and earth, true immortals, dragons, gods, humans, and ghosts. If one knows this and unites being with non-being, nature with emptiness, spirit with the Dao, one becomes a lofty Perfected. Those who reject these constant teachings are not the same as the exalted sages who have already attained Perfected-hood, who penetrate the mysterious and exhaust the subtle, and who can fully grasp its verses.

Reciting it ten times, the heavens chant from afar, the myriad gods pay homage, the Great One descends in radiance, rivers and seas grow still, primordial essence spreads transformation, mountains and peaks conceal their clouds, true earth nurtures light, the inner sun and moon appear, the formless manifests signs, and the celestial pivot ceases its turning. All demons bind their forms, ghostly spirits lose their clarity, the dead return to life, and white bones become human again. For those of utmost learning who recite it ten times, the Five Emperors stand guard, the Three Realms bow in reverence, demonic spirits lose their sight, ghostly evils vanish, the dying are delivered, the severed are restored to life, the Great One bestows virtue, primordial essence scatters numinous power, qi is gathered from the void, spirits are summoned from non-being, life is prolonged, and rebirth continues—earth precedes life.

The reason for this is that scholars’ impure qi has not yet dissipated, their bodies have not fully penetrated the true, and though they may govern the ten directions, their might does not yet command the celestial administration. Their virtue can only subdue earthly deities, bind demonic spirits, and avert death, but they cannot restore life. To recite this chapter lightly brings misfortune upon oneself. To honor and revere it brings prosperity to one’s household. Generation after generation flourishes, bound to good karmic conditions, untouched by the ten thousand calamities, with divine luminaries guarding the gate.

This sutra is supremely wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital. It delivers countless beings and serves as the root of the ten thousand Daoist teachings. Its majestic and vast model of virtue is beyond measure.

The Dao declares: For those who recite this sutra ten times, all the heavens arrive in unison, the Primordial Essence of the Great One and the true earth transform and give life. The embryo of the Dao divides the spirit, the hidden springs and valleys brighten, and the suffering souls of ancestors across billions of generations are all immediately delivered, ascending to the Vermilion Palace. After nine years of refinement, they receive transformation and rebirth, becoming noble persons. Those who diligently study this sutra, when their merit is complete and their virtue perfected, all attain divine transcendence, soaring to the Golden Gates and roaming the Jade Capital.

Those of higher learning who cultivate and recite this sutra have the Great One nurture their numinous power, the earth lord bestows the five fortunes, and primordial essence enters their bodies—all attain deliverance and ascend to the Southern Palace. For mortals who recite it, their lifespans are extended, their years prolonged. Earth is the mother of metal, water the grandson of earth. Earth is primordial qi, metal true lead. When water encounters metal, lead unites with mercury. Those who recognize this do not die; those who encounter it know the true. Thereafter, all may practice the Dao of corpse liberation—though the soul and spirit temporarily vanish, they do not pass through hell but immediately regain their forms, roaming the Great Void. Ingesting the essence of earth, they deliver boundless beings, and all heaven-dwellers and mortals receive blessings. Immeasurable fortune and grace extend to life and death, treasured by heaven and not transmitted to the lower world. Only the most devoted scholars, offering gold and treasures with sincere hearts and swearing oaths to heaven, may receive it. To leak or slight it lightly brings calamity upon seven generations of ancestors, condemning them to long servitude in the Three Wretched Realms.

Five Emperors attend this sutra, with twenty-four Jade Lads and twenty-four Jade Maidens each, safeguarding the sacred script and protecting the bodies of those who receive it.

The Dao declares: During the long fast of the first month, reciting this sutra causes the Primordial Essence of the Great One to transform and take myriad forms, delivering the souls of the departed from past ages, severing their earthly servitude, and ascending them to the Southern Palace. During the long fast of the seventh month, reciting this sutra causes the Primordial Essence of the Great One to become the root of life in earth, and the body attains divine transcendence. The heavens record their names on yellow registers and white tablets, erasing death and inscribing life. During the long fast of the tenth month, reciting this sutra causes the Primordial Essence of the Great One to be titled the Imperial Lord of Earth, who oversees the four directions from the center, riding a yellow chariot adorned with abundant patterns. As king, emperor, lord, minister, father, and son, he stabilizes the nation’s destiny, ensuring the heavens’ eternal protection, the dynasty’s unbroken continuity, and perpetual rule over the realm. The people rejoice in great peace.

On the days of the eight solar terms, reciting this sutra causes the Primordial Essence of the Great One to gather the eight winds at the origin, the Great One to appear in the courtyard, and the five fortunes to come as blessings. The eight difficulties are avoided, and one becomes a Perfected of the Nine Palaces. On one’s life-destiny day, reciting this sutra causes the Primordial Essence of the Great One to protect life and bestow long life. The formless ancestors, the former lives of the Primordial Beginning, the root of life—all are hidden in the Great Mystery. Opening one’s eyes, one sees nothing but the empty mystery. The empty mystery is the treasure; awakening to it, one ascends as an immortal. The soul and spirit become pure and upright, the ten thousand qi endure forever, suffering is avoided, the body radiates light, the Three Realms stand guard, the Five Emperors oversee the reception, the myriad gods pay homage, one’s name is inscribed in heaven, and when merit is complete and virtue perfected, one soars to the Upper Clarity.

The Dao speaks: On the day of practicing the Dao, one must bathe in fragrant waters, fast and purify, then enter the chamber. Facing east, knock the teeth thirty-two times, so that it is heard in the thirty-two heavens. Bow in the heart thirty-two times. Close the eyes and silently visualize the body seated amidst clouds of blue, yellow, and white qi, both within and without shrouded in mist. There appear the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Lion, and White Crane, arrayed to left and right. The sun and moon shine brightly, illuminating the chamber. The qi of the Primordial Essence of the Great One blazes as a crimson radiance above the crown of the head, with a circular image forming at the nape, its light illuminating the ten directions—all in vivid clarity.

The secret incantation says:
Supreme Mystery and Primordial Origin, Most High Dao Lord,
Summon forth from within my body the Three and Five Merit Officers,
The attendants of the left and right, the jade lads who tend incense,
The jade maidens who transmit words, the Five Emperors’ direct talismans,
The incense officials of the day—thirty-six each—
To open and convey my words.
Today is auspicious; the hall is pure with long fasting.
I cultivate the supreme sutra to deliver boundless beings.
May what I now declare ascend directly to the august presence
Of the Most High Primordial Lord of the Thirty-Two Heavens.

Conclude by drawing qi thirty-two times, then face east and recite the sutra.

*The Supreme Primordial Sutra of Boundless Salvation*

Only the Dao is the body.
Where there is no place, there is no Void;

The mother of the Dao.
The formless is the Void;
The formed is Earth.
The Void gives birth to transformation—
This is the true Void.

This is the true Earth.

Those who comprehend the Void become immortals.
The Void can transform alone;
Earth possesses the supreme pattern.

Is the name of the true Earth.
The Five Patterns unfold and expand,
Universally nurturing the divine spirits.
Without pattern, there is no light;

Without pattern, there is no completion;
Without pattern, there is no deliverance;
Without pattern, there is no birth.
This is the Heaven within the Great Brahmā Heaven,

Drawn by yellow phoenixes and five-colored golden dragons,
Bearing the banner of the Great One,
With the Primordial Essence’s numinous pennants fluttering ahead,
Pí and tigers chanting in unison behind,
Luan and cranes singing together,
Lions and apotropaic beasts roaring,
The Five Elders leading the way,
Legions of immortals flanking the carriage,
Myriad chariots and ten thousand riders,
Floating through the void to arrive,
Turning their radiant chariots to oversee the deliverance of beings.

The Prime Minister of the Imperial Culmen,
The Supreme Palace of Southern Prosperity,
The Recorder Han who oversees life,
The great deities who monitor existence,
Holding registers and grasping ledgers,
All assemble before the Emperor,
Their bodies transforming to probe the mysteries,
Examining the numinous gates.
The Gate of the Mysterious Female,
The root of the Eight Poles.
Drawing in the Great Void,
The qi of Earth swirling and billowing.
Within the Void dwells the Perfected,
The spirit of ancestral destiny.
Harmonizing and swallowing saliva,
The brain contains the essence of Earth.
Flowing downward to the Yellow Court,
Ascending to connect with the Muddy Pellet,
The Mysterious Female’s breath,
The boundless qi of the Void.
Heavenly light enters the abyss,
The seven generations become immortals.
As each is delivered according to their due,
The heavens conduct their solemn audit.

Proclaiming universally to the Three Realms,
The boundless divine lands,
The subterranean courts of the Yellow Springs,
The Northern Capital of Fengdu,
The Three Offices and Nine Bureaus,
The Twelve River Sources—
Absolve the ancestors,
Relatives of past kalpas,
Swiftly erase the ledgers of sins,
Extinguish the roots of evil,
That they may not be detained
Or forced into the company of ghosts.
By the Primordial Beginning’s talismanic command,
At this very moment, ascend and be promoted.
In the cold pools of the Northern Capital,
Guard the forms and souls,
Restrain demons and protect the promoted,
Delivering them to the Southern Palace for ranking.
The dead souls receive refinement,
Transforming into immortals;
The living receive deliverance,
Abiding through kalpas,
Revolving with the kalpas,
Their years equaling heaven’s.

Ever deliver them from the Three Ways,
The Five Sufferings and Eight Hardships,
Transcend the Three Realms,
And roam freely in the Supreme Clarity.

Too profound to detail.

Universally delivering heaven and humanity.

Earth traverses the Six Voids,

From one Earth all things are born,
All heavens are perfected—
Without Earth, nothing is born,
Without Earth, there is no yang.
Ancestral Earth is emptiness,
Below, the Dragon’s Prosperity emerges,
In the boundless kalpas of the distant past,
Within the primordial chaos.

Above, emptiness generates color,
Below, emptiness generates the abyss,
Emptiness’s extremity generates wind,
Wind sways and waters topple,
Wind and marsh cavernously void,
The Diamond rides the heavens.
Above and below the heavens,
No darkness, no obscurity,
No form, no shadow,
No limit, no end.

The primordial Earth of the vast expanse,
Named the Great One,
Internally called the Primordial Essence.

Vast and dim, without light,
Crimson brightness unfolds the chart,
Revolving deliverance naturally.
The Primordial Beginning precedes the Dao,
Pacifying and stabilizing Earth’s origin.
Emptiness and Brahman compose the scripture,
Scattering the Five Chapters.
Crimson Script and Jade Palace,

Preserving and controlling the kalpic destiny,
Ensuring the heavens endure forever.

Brahmanic qi suffuses the net of the cosmos,
Myriad patterns unfold,
The primordial net flows and evolves—
The Thirty-Two Heavens.

A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—
Naturally becoming true.

Universally receiving liberation,
The dead soul revives in a new body,
The body attains rebirth,
Ascending to the various heavens.
Above the various heavens,
Each has its Gate of Life.
Within lies the cavernous hymn of chanting,
The sacred scripture of the True Kings,
Verses that join the High Perfected.

**First: The Sound of the Primordial Essence of the Great One and the Vast Emptiness**
Before the Three Realms were formed,
Heaven and Earth had no name.
The Ten Directions were all empty—
Emptiness, too, was but a borrowed term.
Not knowing the Dao’s Ancestor,
One describes form through emptiness.
Emptiness is non-being,
Pervading all in undifferentiated completion.
All sentient beings
Know only the name of earth.
Obstructed by emptiness,
They do not see the truth of the Dao.
Those who do not know emptiness
Take emptiness as its original name.
Clinging to emptiness, they abandon the Dao,
Attached to emptiness, they stagnate in sound.
Not knowing that emptiness
Is the emptiness of formlessness.
What is formless?
It is the essence of true earth.
Not knowing true earth,
They mistakenly regard it as emptiness.
The nature of emptiness is stubborn and sluggish—
How could things arise from it?
Thus, the Three Realms,
The myriad heavens and the Nine Clarities,
The Jade Capital’s great mountain,
The lofty terraces of Yu Luo—
None can exist of themselves,
But arise through earth.
Earth is named true emptiness,
Giving birth to the ten thousand transformations.
To seek the true apart from emptiness
Is all illusion and falsity.
Do not grasp this emptiness,
Lest it blind your eyes.
Brush away the obscuring film of emptiness,
And true earth reveals its form.
The boundless body of the Dao
Accomplishes all without exception.
Your mysterious female,
Daily drinks the essence of earth.
Thus can you attain long life,
Roaming the Crimson City.
The qi of true earth
Instantly establishes the immortal body.

**Second: The Chapter of the True King of the Primordial Essence of the Great One**
The Highest Divine Empyrean,
A million leagues from earth,
Surrounding the Eight Directions,
The true journey descends in gaze.
The realm of the Divine Empyrean,
With azure emptiness as its companion.
Not knowing azure emptiness
Is where earth resides.
This is not the yin-turbid earth
Of the mundane world,
Which alone can nurture life,
Changing with the years and months.
Reviving at spring’s arrival,
Flourishing in summer.
How much more is this true earth,
Formless and without action,
Neither existing nor non-existing,
The gateway of the ten thousand transformations.
Accumulated clouds form the empyrean,
Sustained by the qi of hardness.
Treading upon it is like silk,
Yet it supports ten thousand jun.
Jade terraces endure for a thousand kalpas,
Vast towers with eightfold eaves.
Carried by Brahmanic qi,
Though high, it does not tower.
Within lies true earth,
Its divine power firmly upholding.
The Primordial Essence of the Great One—
The world cannot know it.
Now I compose this chapter,
Its pure tones naturally harmonize and part.

**Third: The True King of the Primordial Essence of the Great One Sings**
At dawn, I ascend the Great Primordial Peak,
At dusk, I feast at the source of the Celestial River.
In the human realm, two kalpas have passed,
In the Chambered Wind, spring is fresh.
Star-feathered ones adjust their towering crowns,
Reining dragons to ride the divine winds.
The empyrean journey knows no measure of distance,
Only purple clouds, dim and hazy.
Jade maidens strike the ringing *geng*,
Their pure tones echo in the vastness.
Calling to those lost in the vast kalpa,
Joyful and carefree, they mount the cloudy waves.
Incense smoke rises from green windows,
Crimson brocade winds through the purple empyrean.
Emerald hues startle the long towers,
Lightning banners follow the drifting clouds.
Rainbow bridges span the jade beams,
Myriad immortals dance to the numinous hymns.
The world measures three thousand,
Molded by true earth.
Not knowing the Mother of Dao and virtue,
They abandon the sacred to chase after vanities.
Mourning those adrift in the dust,
I sing this to soothe the cloud harp.
Above the Three Realms,
Amid the flying emptiness,
The song of the True King,
Its tones joining the cavernous chapters.
Recite it a hundred times,
And your name ascends to the Southern Palace.
Recite it a thousand times,
The True King protects and welcomes you.
Ten thousand recitations complete the Dao,
Ascending to the Great Emptiness,
Transcending the Three Realms,
Attaining the rank of Duke of Position.
Hearing the numinous tones,
The True King manifests in reverence,
Commanding earth spirits,
To escort and receive you,
Delivering you from the earthly prison,
The five sufferings and eight difficulties.
Seven generations of ancestors ascend,
Forever departing the ghostly bureaus,
The soul crosses the Vermilion Mound,
Undergoes refinement and is reborn.
This is called the limitless,
Universally delivering without end.
There is a secret celestial scripture,
Revered by all heavens.
To leak or profane it
Is to fall into hell,
Bringing calamity to seven generations of ancestors.

The Dao says: These two chapters are the hidden tones of the Celestial Emperors and the Numinous True Kings, pointing to true earth as the return of the Dao, the Primordial Essence of the Great One, which nurtures and radiates splendor. If you can embody this, no misfortune or decline will befall you. Nature is metal, emptiness is earth—child follows mother in harmony. Stabilize and guard it, never parting even for a breath.

The mountain of the Great Primordial,
Twin streams of the colossal tower,
Inhales the true and exhales qi,
The foundation of your destiny.
Extinguish emptiness to see earth,
The myriad qi can be replenished,
Spirit and qi merge,
The gate of death seals itself.
All are the words of the Great Brahman,
Not the common speech of the world.
Their language lacks ornate beauty,
Their melodies lack florid embellishment.
Thus they are called profound and obscure,
Difficult to fathom in detail.
Treasured by the heavens above,
Secretly kept in the Jade Clarity Palace of the Divine Empyrean in the Mysterious Capital,
Circulating in the *ren-chen* year,
The Great Lord descends,
Transmitting by decree.
If there is a perfected one who offers gold and treasures with a sincere heart,
Following the old protocols to pledge alliance with the Ten Heavens,
Only then will it be bestowed.

The Dao speaks: When heaven and earth complete their cyclical decline, when the sun, moon, and five stars wane and wax, when the most sagely and divine persons prosper or falter, when those of shallow learning fall ill or suffer harm—whenever such calamities arise, all of like qi must unite in heart to perform the six-hour purification rites, burn incense, and recite the sutra ten times in succession. Blessings and virtue will descend at once, dissolving all inauspicious omens. The boundless scripture delivers limitless salvation.

The Dao speaks: Those of shallow learning, whose immortal rank remains unfulfilled, whose destined time of passing arrives, whose bodies enter the Great Yin—when the hour of their departure draws near, their fellow students and perfected ones shall burn incense and recite the sutra ten times on their behalf, guiding their corporeal forms according to the proper method. Then the Great One will guard their dwelling, primordial essence will bathe their form, and the True King’s everlasting life-qi will merge with their ethereal and spiritual souls, ascending directly to the Southern Palace. According to the measure of their cultivation, they shall be reborn after a calculated span of days. Freed from the cycle of delusion, they shall attain the immortality of the divine.

The Dao speaks: When heaven and earth reach their cyclical end, when the stellar lodgings fall into disarray, when the sun and moon lose their radiance, when the four seasons fall out of order, when yin and yang fall into discord, when the land suffers calamity—when warfare, punishment, malevolent spirits, banditry, epidemics, and poisons spread, when the multitudes perish or are wounded, when masters and companions pass away, when the Dharma and its students meet with misfortune—then too must purification rites be performed, incense burned, and sutras recited. The merit of purification rites and sutra recitation is profoundly weighty. Above, it dispels heavenly disasters and safeguards the sovereign; below, it wards off poison and harm, delivering the multitudes. In life and death, all depend upon it—its blessings are beyond measure. Thus it is called boundless, universally delivering heaven and humanity.

The Dao speaks: Whoever possesses this sutra and performs these meritorious deeds for the sake of heaven, earth, the sovereign, and the multitudes—on the day of calamity, if they resolve in their hearts to perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the sutra ten times—all the heavens will record their names, and the ten thousand spirits will attend and protect them. Those of exceptional attainment shall be distinguished and become ministers of the Golden Portals of the Sagely Lord. The heavens record the merits and transgressions of all people, leaving not even a hair’s breadth unaccounted. The True Kings of the heavens shall also safeguard and elevate such persons, and those who attain the Dao shall come to comprehend these most profound words.

The great, hidden speech of the Brahman in the heavens resounds with boundless tones.
Composed by the Dao Lord,
*The Central Scripture of the Primordial Essence of the Great One from the Numinous Writ of the Origin*,
The Eight Heavens of the Eastern Direction.

Amidst the flourishing horns of splendor, the radiance pervades the numinous obscurity.
To the darkest valleys of discernment, the stern decree gallops in even measure.
Offering the sun’s cyclic path, severing the bonds of neighboring lands.
Summoning witnesses to bear the crown, the mat of deliverance beckons the lords.
Huan stands tall in the wilds, Lu and Ding are famed in purity.
The horse’s enclosure calls to stillness, crossing the well of Geng.
The sprouting lingzhi and the sphere’s domain, the soaring numen ascends the heights.
Overflowing and yielding, bearing and slackening, guilt and slander purified in clarity.

The Southern Eight Heavens:
Yue and Yu in solemnity, Bi and Yan in fiery advantage.
The vast and lustrous span time, the recumbent Ruan wheels his skill.
Bursting wells and courier posts, the ox and the rain-laden chariot’s tally.
Governance ceases and all things grow solemn, the cinnabar peaks and ancient isles.
The swallow’s leak and the cauldron’s cavern, the Peng’s confluence flows apart.
The handle of negation spurs the earnest, strength and mystery blaze in the profound.
Seeking in concealment the fierce demand, the liquid cauldron records the Kun’s lineage.
The true and lofty perch on the few, the radiant Brahman approaches warmth.

The Western Eight Heavens:
Beholding the boundless expanse, the mind’s Brahman in tranquil kindred.
Joy in vastness and singular grandeur, sincere thoughts in the dark and vast.
The blessing’s enclosure and cultured mastery, the Dipper’s pass and the vast reliance.
Treading joy and hastening power, the refined and true drift in subtle clouds.
The withered and the blooming await the hour, welcoming the east’s stomach banner.
Refining the ancestors in sudden thought, the distant and boundless draped in jade.
The town’s copy and the calamity’s inscription, the harmonious faction builds the grand.
Spreading and bestowing the lineage, the abyssal awakening in secret whispers.

The Northern Eight Heavens:
The reeking and desolate marsh’s halls, the Dipper’s army and the Han’s governance.
The courtyard’s reckoning and Pan’s truth, the golden chamber and the jade’s perfection.
The servant’s livestock and the turbid isles, the Ba’s dragon in the hidden rapids.
Releasing the pond’s sudden soul, the myriad completions coil to the left.
The axle’s fence in lush patrol, the You’s crags and the zither’s gaze.
The Xia’s rosy clouds pour wisdom, the brief Qian’s cavernous pass.
Seizing the writ and commanding the spirits, the Emperor’s tally in the misty deep.
Forging the covenant in the scorching sea, the ravine’s chapter in full splendor.

The Dao speaks: These are the great Brahman’s hidden words within the heavens, the boundless tones. The True Kings of the Primordial Beginning of old inscribed them with the profound hunt’s brush, summarizing and writing them within the Great Void. Now concealed, now revealed, they summon the qi of the Primordial One’s essence. The Primordial Ancestral Earth gives birth to the myriad numina, becoming the mother of the formed within the chaos, the forerunner of the mandate within the Great Mystery. Those who can comprehend this merge with the hidden and the submerged. The self’s body is fundamentally empty, lodging essence to form the body. From having comes loss of reality; reality departs and returns to the void. The void is but an empty name; the body enters the Great Nothingness. Entering the void like smoke, dispersing and transforming across the ten thousand heavens; emerging from the void to become an immortal, responding to stimuli and following the verdant. Contemplating it, it manifests; forgetting it, it returns to the mysterious. Not knowing the reason, it is naturally so.

Each character spans a full *zhang* in length. The Heavenly Perfected and August Ones of old inscribed these words to establish the correct pronunciation. Those who know these sounds and can purify themselves to recite them shall have all the heavens dispatch the Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings to descend and observe their bodies, recording their meritorious diligence. This shall be reported to the heavens above, where the myriad spirits shall pay homage, the earthly deities shall attend at the gates, and the great demon-kings shall safeguard and recommend the perfected. With the Dao complete and mastery attained, they may roam the Three Realms and ascend through the Golden Portals.

These sounds repel all, expiate all, deliver all, and accomplish all—such are the Heavenly Perfected’s natural tones. Thus, reciting them causes the True Kings to descend in observation, the Supreme Emperor to chant from afar, the myriad spirits to pay homage, the Three Realms to attend in reverence, the legions of malevolence to bow their heads, and the ghostly essences to perish of themselves. The jade-like resonance vibrates, the ten directions grow solemn and clear, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks swallow their mists, the myriad numina tremble in submission, and the host of immortals is summoned. The heavens are free of foul vapors, the earth is free of demonic dust, the hidden wisdom shines in clarity, and the vast measure is profoundly mysterious.

*The Wondrous Scripture of the Upper Chapters of the Numinous Treasure’s Boundless Deliverance of Humanity*, Chapter Thirteen Concludes.
Chapter Fourteen.

**The Radiant Yang of Solar Essence**

The Dao spoke: In the past, during the Red Clarity Heaven, the Purple Yang chanted in the Great Treasure Light Land, receiving from the Primordial Beginning the *Upper Chapters of the Boundless Deliverance of Humanity: The Radiant Yang of Solar Essence*.

When the Primordial Heavenly Worthy was about to expound this scripture, he circumambulated ten times to summon the ten directions, and only then ascended his seat. The Heavenly Perfected, the Supreme Sages, the Exalted Honored Ones, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Empresses and Consorts of the Solar Palace of Cavernous Yang, the Celestial Officials and Immortals within the sun, and an innumerable host arrived borne upon the void. Crimson clouds and cinnabar auroras, jade chariots and wheeling constellations, canopies of blossoming shade, the solar essence and radiant yang—nine-hued vapors surged in abundance, illuminating the vast heavens. For seven days and seven nights, the stellar spirits of the myriad heavens flew forth, their trailing rays intersecting in splendor, their brilliance piercing the farthest reaches of the void. The divine palaces grew still, the celestial pivots ceased their turning, the Jade Armillary and Golden Balance stood poised and motionless, the divine winds fell silent, mountains and seas concealed their clouds. The celestial landscape shone with radiant yang, the flow of qi gleamed with clarity. The land, mountains, rivers, forests, and groves of the entire realm were leveled to perfect evenness, no longer distinguished by height or depth, and the earth transformed entirely into red jade, without variation in hue.

The assembled Perfected attended the seat as the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, in profound repose, sat upon the floating nine-dragon throne of the Radiant Yang’s Flaming Pearl Treasure Mountain. When he had expounded the scripture once, the Great Saints of the heavens simultaneously voiced their approval. At that time, the men and women of the realm gazed upward at the solar essence, its ninefold resplendent rays, the radiant yang’s rosy qi spreading throughout the heavens. They recognized this true essence as the progenitor of the ten thousand things.

When he had expounded the scripture a second time, the palaces within the sun appeared in a thousand jeweled hues, and the celestial immortals and people all returned to the true Dao.

When he had expounded it a third time, the world within the sun, upheld by the adamantine winds, stood alone in the midst of the void, traversing boundless space.

When he had expounded it a fourth time, jade axles rode the clouds, amassing purple-golden light that shone downward without limit, ripening and maturing all things.

When he had expounded it a fifth time, the great celestial patterns and the vast Brahmā were all beheld within the sun. The characters revolved and spiraled, their rosy rays bending and curving, their hidden words and profound mysteries all thoroughly comprehended.

When he had expounded it a sixth time, the qi of Cavernous Yang, nine million leagues in height, descended to the eight extremities, and the worthy sages and golden treasures were formed by its power.

When he had expounded it a seventh time, the luminous clarity of Cavernous Yang pierced the darkest night. White bones and frozen remains were warmed by its radiance, ascending with its light to emerge from the sea of darkness.

When he had expounded it an eighth time, vermilion light spread in all four directions, and jade and stone absorbed its essence. The yang souls responded to its touch, all transforming into cinnabar blossoms.

When he had expounded it a ninth time, the cavern-chambers and mountain peaks, where Perfected and hidden immortals dwelled, drew in the light and hastened toward the dawn, their ancestral roots flourishing in abundance.

When he had expounded it a tenth time, the solar essence abided in auspiciousness, the ten thousand things congealed and thrived, golden nectar flowed in abundance, and the withered and decayed became treasures. At that time, every man and woman of the realm turned their hearts in devotion, all received protection and deliverance, and each attained longevity.

The Dao spoke: At that time, when the Primordial Heavenly Worthy had expounded the scripture once, the Great Spirit of the Azure Emperor of the Solar Palace in the Eastern Limitless and Boundless Realm arrived borne upon the void with an innumerable host.

When he had expounded it a second time, the Great Spirit of the Vermilion Emperor of the Solar Palace in the Southern Limitless and Boundless Realm arrived borne upon the void with an innumerable host.

When he had expounded it a third time, the Great Spirit of the White Emperor of the Solar Palace in the Western Limitless and Boundless Realm arrived borne upon the void with an innumerable host.

When he had expounded it a fourth time, the Great Spirit of the Black Emperor of the Solar Palace in the Northern Limitless and Boundless Realm arrived borne upon the void with an innumerable host.

When he had expounded it a fifth time, the Great Spirit of the Yellow Emperor of the Solar Palace in the Northeastern Limitless and Boundless Realm arrived borne upon the void with an innumerable host.

When he had expounded it a sixth time, the Great Spirit of the Crimson Whirlwind of the Solar Palace in the Southeastern Limitless and Boundless Realm arrived borne upon the void with an innumerable host.

When he had expounded it a seventh time, the Secondary Spirit of the Purple Crystal of the Solar Palace in the Southwestern Limitless and Boundless Realm arrived borne upon the void with an innumerable host.

When he had expounded it an eighth time, the Great Spirit of the Blazing Elephant of the Solar Palace in the Northwestern Limitless and Boundless Realm arrived borne upon the void with an innumerable host.

When he had expounded it a ninth time, the Great Spirit of the Golden Treasury of the Solar Palace in the Upper Limitless and Boundless Realm arrived borne upon the void with an innumerable host.

When he had expounded it a tenth time, the Great Spirit of the Radiant Yang of the Solar Palace in the Lower Limitless and Boundless Realm arrived borne upon the void with an innumerable host.

When the ten recitations were complete, the Solar Soul Emperor Lords of the Ten Limitless Directions and the Heavenly Perfected, the Boundless Great Spirits, all arrived at once. The men and women of the realm turned their hearts in devotion and reverence. Each addressed the others, saying together: "We have long enjoyed the causes of good fortune and for ages received the power of the Dao, born and dwelling in the realm of the Dao, abiding above the sun and moon. Yet we knew only how to ride the flowing light and radiant essence, illuminating the heavens, surging and rushing through seas and mountains. Our palaces and gardens, all transformed into the wondrous hues of true gold. Today, the Primordial Beginning has revealed to us the method of the Radiant Yang of Solar Essence, refining and purifying the double yang, inhaling the resplendent hues, permeating the marrow with supreme yang, transmuting flesh and bone into gold. The Three Origins and Nine Qi nurture and foster the ten thousand things—without the solar essence, none could be nourished. Those who pursue learning externally refine metals and minerals, regulating water and fire. The sun and moon have their cycles, and transformation attains numinosity. Those who cultivate internally nurture their singular form, for the sun is the image of the heart. The qi within the sun illumines the hundred passages, and thirty thousand divine youths hasten toward the yang’s rising light. The sun is the Fire Dragon, producing jade nectar. The stomach is the earthen cauldron, where the primordial fire refines and smelts. With a thousand days of effort, the true Dao is swiftly accomplished. What we have known are but the outer edges of the method. What the Primordial Beginning has proclaimed must surely be the most profound and hidden. We wish to hear the supreme method, to remove the mountains of our obstructions."

Those who came were like fine rain or dense mist, an innumerable host, pressing upon the land until half the realm sank beneath them, an unstoppable force.

Thereupon, the Primordial Beginning surveyed the great assembly, gazing upon all in attendance. Extending his arm of purple-golden radiance, adorned in the nine-hued Cavernous Auroral Fire Jade Net Garment, he reached forth with his hand, and through his great divine power, stretching thirty-three myriad leagues in length, he plucked the solar orb as one might pluck a sweet fruit.

The radiant flame stood resplendent, its light suffusing the ten directions, emanating from the empty mystery. The solar orb shone perfectly round and lustrous, within which lay mountains and forests, rivers and seas, palaces and cities, gates and battlements—countless immortals dwelling in carefree ease, as though golden hues were contained within a jewel of beryl. All the heavenly beings in that assembly drew near to behold it.

Thereupon, the Primordial Beginning transformed this solar orb into a precious pearl, vast as a grain of millet, suspended in the empty mystery nine *zhang* above the earth. The Primordial Beginning ascended and led the Celestial Perfected, the Great Divinities, the Exalted Worthies, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Emperors and Empresses of the Sun, and the boundless host of great spirits—all entered into the precious pearl. The heavenly beings gazed upward, seeing only a gentle stirring as they passed through the pearl’s mouth. Once within, their whereabouts were unknown.

The people of the land dispersed, and the earth returned to levelness, no longer slanted or sunken. Within the precious pearl, the Primordial Beginning expounded the sutra in its entirety. The assembled Perfected oversaw the transmission, bestowing it upon me. At that moment, joy and celebration defied description. The affairs now roughly settled, the deities of the heavens returned to their stations. In an instant, all fell silent, leaving no trace of sound.

From that time forth, the heavenly beings who encountered the scriptural Dharma were universally delivered, their original lifespans preserved without harm. The entire land turned in reverence, their hearts inclined toward goodness. They illuminated the Dao and the True, the Dharma and the Precepts, the Sutras and the Principles. They illuminated yin and yang, the divine and the qi. Their words aligned with the profound chapters, their mouths free of reckless speech. United in compassion and love, even those of different bones became kin. The land knew peace, the people abundance, and all rejoiced in great harmony. From the scripture’s first promulgation, the kingdom was guided by the Dao. Those who had cultivated utmost sincerity, who revered and honored it, all attained deliverance across the ages.

The Dao spoke: What the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounds within the scripture are the inner names of the Sun’s Supreme Emperor, the sounds of the yang rhymes—also the hidden names of the Sun’s officials, the concealed appellations of Yang Brightness. The Sun is the origin of the Three Qi and the father of all yang. Gazing upon it, immortals become boundless; drawing from it, the Celestial Valley fills with emptiness and plenitude. Within it arises the Purple Perfected; preserving it dispels the corpse and refines the hun-soul; facing it, the Nine Auroras pour forth numinous power. Through it, creation attains its course; by it, the divine and sagely gain illumination—these are no ordinary words of the world. Only the perfected Realized Ones, who have penetrated the profound and plumbed the subtle, can fully grasp its chapters. Reciting it ten times, auspicious light manifests portents: the Five Emperors offer rites, divine crows fan their radiance, golden essence soars in splendor, crimson chariots halt their wheels. The cinnabar hubs cease turning, all demons bind their forms, ghostly spirits lose their clarity. The dead beyond decay rise again; from bones, humans are reborn.

For scholars of the highest learning, if their masters recite it ten times, the Five Emperors stand guard, the Three Realms bow in reverence, Yang Brightness illumines all with penetrating light. Flowing fire blazes fiercely, demonic essences lose their sight, ghostly perils fade in clarity. The dying are delivered, the severed restored to life. The reason for this: scholars’ impure qi has not yet dissipated, their bodies have not fully attained the Perfected Dao. They harness the essence of the Sun, yet their power does not govern the celestial administration. Their virtue may subdue and command earthly spirits, binding and dispelling demonic numina—but this only releases the dead, not restores them to life. To recite this chapter lightly brings calamity upon oneself. To honor and revere it with offerings ensures the flourishing of one’s household, prosperity through generations, and karmic bonds with goodness. Ten thousand disasters will not assail them; divine luminaries guard their gates.

This scripture is most revered and wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital. It delivers countless beings, serving as the root of all Dao. Vast and majestic, its virtue is beyond measure.

The Dao spoke: For those who recite this scripture ten times, Yang Brightness descends with immortals, the Sun’s gate turns its mechanism, the Nine Yin dispel their obscurations. The gates of the Yellow Springs radiate light; ancestors of a hundred million generations, suffering souls in the dark realms, all immediately receive deliverance. They ascend to the Vermilion Palace, where after nine years of refinement, they are transformed and reborn, becoming noble persons. Those who diligently study this scripture cast off the yin of the Dao. The Nine Yang refine their substance, divine light enters their hearts, their hearts shine like the morning sun, their five viscera become gold. All receive deliverance, ascending to the Southern Palace.

For those in the world who recite it, their lifespans are extended, their years prolonged. Thereafter, they all attain the Dao of corpse liberation. The essence of the Sun floats in the void, purple mist swirls thickly, their divine dwellings are serene and tranquil, celestial numina soar on high. Their hun and shen briefly vanish, yet they do not pass through hell, immediately regaining their forms to roam the Great Void. This scripture is utterly wondrous, universally delivering boundless beings. All heavenly and mortal beings receive its blessings. Limitless blessings bestow grace upon life and death. What Heaven truly treasures is not transmitted to the lower world. Only the most devoted scholars, offering gold and treasures with sincerity, may swear oaths to Heaven and transmit it.

Reckless disclosure and negligent transmission bring calamity upon nine generations, condemning them to eternal servitude under the officials of the netherworld. Those who uphold this scripture are attended by the Five Thearchs, with twenty-four Jade Lads and twenty-four Jade Maidens each, who safeguard the sacred writ and shield the bodies of its recipients.

The Dao declares: In the first month, observe a prolonged fast and recite this scripture. The Five Thearchs will bestow registers, the Radiant Yang will deliver souls, and for the departed of former generations, it severs earthly bonds and liberates them from servitude, ascending them to the Southern Palace.

In the seventh month, observe a prolonged fast and recite this scripture. The essence of the Sun flows like molten gold. The Crimson Lad bears a flask, offering you jade nectar to drink, ensuring eternal stability and immortality. Your name is inscribed in the heavens, recorded on yellow registers and white tablets, erasing death and granting life.

In the tenth month, observe a prolonged fast and recite this scripture. The Sun’s pool radiates light, crimson blossoms and jade petals play amidst dewdrops, golden auroras waft fragrance. For kings and emperors, rulers and ministers, fathers and sons, it secures the throne, stabilizes the nation, and preserves Heaven’s enduring favor. Dynasties endure unbroken, perpetually ruling as sovereigns, pacifying their realms, and bringing joyous peace to the people.

On the eight seasonal festivals, recite this scripture. The essence of the Sun merges with primordial light, circulating through the Jade Capital. Gazing upon the golden radiance, aspiring toward the Radiant Yang, one becomes a Perfected of the Nine Palaces.

On one’s natal day, recite this scripture. It fortifies the divine palace within, crimson chariots and brocade banners arise with the Sun. Attaining the name of the Dao, the hun and shen become pure and upright, the myriad qi endure eternally, sparing one from suffering and affliction. The body emanates luminous brilliance. The Three Realms provide escort, the Five Thearchs oversee reception, the ten thousand spirits pay homage, names are inscribed in Heaven, merits are fulfilled, and virtue is perfected. One ascends in flight to the Upper Clarity.

The Dao declares: On the day of practicing the Dao, one must bathe in fragrant waters, observe purification rites, and enter the chamber facing east. Knock the teeth thirty-two times, making it heard in the thirty-two heavens. Bow thirty-two times in reverence. Close the eyes and silently envision oneself seated within a nine-colored purple cloud, enveloped in profound darkness, with the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Lion, and White Crane arrayed to the left and right. The Sun and Moon illuminate brilliantly, suffusing the chamber with radiance. A circular halo emerges from the crown, its light pervading the ten directions—this vision must be held clearly. Recite the secret incantation:

"Supreme Mystery and Origin, Most High Dao Lord, summon forth the Three and Five Merit Officers within my body, the attendants of the left and right, the Jade Lads bearing incense, the Jade Maidens transmitting words, the Five Thearchs’ direct talismans, and the thirty-six incense officials of the day. Open the gates to convey my words. Today is an auspicious occasion, a prolonged fast in the purified hall, practicing the supreme scripture to deliver boundless beings. May my entreaties ascend directly to the presence of the Most High, the Primordial Celestial Worthy of the Thirty-Two Heavens."

Conclude by drawing qi thirty-two times, then face east and recite the scripture:

*The Supreme Primordial’s Wondrous Scripture of Limitless Salvation*

The Supreme Primordial’s Cavernous Mystery, Numinous Treasure’s fundamental chapter, the Sun’s essence and Radiant Yang’s supreme scripture, pours forth light to deliver humanity. The hundred demons conceal their tones, parting and uniting naturally. The Crimson Clarity of the Primal Cavern, the peerless Perfected of Non-Being, existed before Heaven and Earth, eternally self-subsistent since antiquity.

The Moon is the water’s embryo; the Sun is the gold’s essence. The Sun resembles a pellet, enveloped by the Moon’s dark embryo, shaped like a hen’s egg, containing five colors that swirl into five luminosities. The Sun resides within; the Moon embraces it without. Primordial qi enfolds them, gradually transforming into Heaven and Earth. Earth ascends to Heaven; Heaven merges with Earth. Their essence intermingles in chaos, pure and turbid yet undivided, called the Embryo of Origin.

Once Heaven and Earth opened, the Sun and Moon separated from the embryo. The Sun’s essence, Radiant Yang, holds the number nine-five, corresponding to the Qian position. The Sun ascends the Eastern Mulberry, the flying dragon soars in the heavens, metal and water part forms, and the Sun’s essence takes shape. Rising by day and descending by night, the Zi and Wu hours serve as its meridian.

The Sun is ninety thousand li in circumference, containing within it the Golden City and the Cavernous Yang Palace, the Azure Grove. Consuming its blossoms and fruits grants longevity equal to the Sun’s, enabling flight to the Upper Clarity and traversal of the firmament’s paths.

In the Primordial Ancestral Kalpa, the Supreme Primordial transformed and gave birth to the myriad heavens, illuminating the Three Luminaries—this is the root of Heaven. Above, there is no further ancestor; only the Dao is its body.

The Treasured Chapters of Yu Yi, the Sun Thearch’s divine writ, the Crimson Script’s expansive revelation, universally establishes the numinous. Without script, there is no illumination; without script, there is no clarity; without script, there is no establishment; without script, there is no completion; without script, there is no deliverance; without script, there is no generation. This is the Great Brahma Heaven within Heaven, the Crimson Pool and Vermilion Terrace, the Crimson Grove and Cinnabar Capital, the Nine Dragons’ Solar Forge ascending to the Sun’s city.

Vast and distant, the kalpa’s blade exists as if absent, yet present. The earth’s blossoms part, revealing the wondrous court. Golden gates and jade chambers stand in serried ranks, pure and resplendent. The divine auroras of the Numinous Empyrean circulate through the ten directions. Within resides the Sun’s essence and Radiant Yang’s spirit, the Lord of Longevity of the Southern Culmen, the Azure Florescence Thearch of the Eastern Culmen, the Great Divinity Sima who delivers the world, the Venerable Lord Han who cherishes life, the Exalted Divinities of the Southern Supreme who govern fate, record years, extend lifespan, and deliver from calamity.

These reverse decay and revive the dead, delivering boundless beings. Today, the celestial records are examined as the myriad heavens descend in attendance.

The Boundless Flying Celestial Sun-Centered Divine Kings of the East, Great Sages of Longevity, deliver boundless beings.
The Boundless Flying Celestial Sun-Centered Divine Kings of the South, Great Sages of Longevity, deliver boundless beings.
The Boundless Flying Celestial Sun-Centered Divine Kings of the West, Great Sages of Longevity, deliver boundless beings.
The Boundless Flying Celestial Sun-Centered Divine Kings of the North, Great Sages of Longevity, deliver boundless beings.
The Boundless Flying Celestial Sun-Centered Divine Kings of the Northeast, Great Sages of Longevity, deliver boundless beings.
The Boundless Flying Celestial Sun-Centered Divine Kings of the Southeast, Great Sages of Longevity, deliver boundless beings.
The Boundless Flying Celestial Sun-Centered Divine Kings of the Southwest, Great Sages of Longevity, deliver boundless beings.
The Boundless Flying Celestial Sun-Centered Divine Kings of the Northwest, Great Sages of Longevity, deliver boundless beings.
The Boundless Flying Celestial Sun-Centered Divine Kings of the Above, Great Sages of Longevity, deliver boundless beings.

The Boundless Flying Celestial Sun-Centered Divine Kings of the Below, Great Sages of Longevity, deliver boundless beings. The Perfected of the Ten Directions, Flying Celestial Sun-Centered Divine Kings, deliver the world with longevity, boundless great spirits. Together they ride clouds of rosy dawn mist and radiant hues, their ranks adorned with flowing bells and cinnabar jade. Crimson hibiscus and vermilion wheels bear them forth, drawn by vermilion phoenixes and fire-dragons of solar essence. They raise standards of luminous gauze, crimson coral banners fluttering before them as nine phoenixes cry in unison, while eight simurghs sing in harmony behind. Divine lions and sacred birds chant and intone, their melodies resounding. The Five Thearchs open the way, solar immortals steady the shafts, and a hundred million chariots with ten thousand riders float through the void. Their light bends back as they turn their reins, overseeing the Perfected and delivering the living.

The Gold Tower’s Chancellor, the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, Han the Director of Records, and the Great Spirits who oversee life—holding registers and grasping ledgers—all assemble before the Emperor. According to those who ought to be delivered, they strictly examine the heavens.

Universally proclaimed to the boundless divine realms of the Three Realms, the subterranean courts of the Yellow Springs, the Northern Capital of Fengdu, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the Twelve River Sources: may the ancestors of past generations, the karmic kin of a hundred kalpas, swiftly have their names stricken from the ledgers of sin, their evil roots severed and destroyed. They must not be detained or forced into the ranks of ghosts. By the Sun Emperor’s talismanic command, they ascend at the appointed hour. From the Cold Pool of the Northern Capital, their forms and souls are guarded and escorted, demons restrained, merits protected, and their ranks delivered to the Southern Palace. The dead receive refinement and transform into immortals; the living receive deliverance and endure through kalpas. With each turning of the kalpa, they share the same lifespan as Heaven. Forever delivered from the Three Paths, the Five Sufferings, and the Eight Difficulties, they transcend the Three Realms and roam freely in the Upper Clarity.

In the Heaven of Upper Clarity, the Jade Emperor’s radiance illuminates the formless realm of Brahman conduct. The Eight Heavens of the East: the Heaven of Imperial Splendor and Jade Beams, where the Emperor subdues demonic might; the Heaven of Nine Elixirs’ Radiant Glory, where the Emperor feasts in profound harmony; the Heaven of Azure Forests Stirring the Sun, where the Emperor’s jade resounds with rare brilliance; the Heaven of Sun Perfection and Treasure Wisdom, where the Emperor’s grace purifies and guards the golden; the Heaven of Dawn’s Enlightenment and Secret Mystery, where the Emperor’s essence ascends in subtlety; the Heaven of Joyous Realms Observing the Origin, where the Emperor’s arts abide; the Heaven of Azure Wilds Transforming the Capital, where the Emperor stirs clouds in the cavernous heights; the Heaven of Starry Brilliance and Radiance, where the Emperor’s orchids flourish in the pavilion.

The Eight Heavens of the South: the Heaven of Vermilion Chariots and Crimson Light, where the Emperor’s gaze burns red; the Heaven of the Crimson Sphere’s Left-Turning Divine Chariot, where the Emperor’s profit lies in hidden origins; the Heaven of Rounded Scenery and Lush Terraces, where the Emperor’s virtue spreads in distant dispatches; the Heaven of Purple Flourishing and Divine Preparation, where the Emperor’s audience is profound and sincere; the Heaven of Yellow Qi and Solar Essence, where the Emperor’s vastness extends to the celestial houses; the Heaven of Vermilion Splendor and Imperial Capitals, where the Emperor’s majesty holds the subtle; the Heaven of Floral Pavilions and Cloud Patterns, where the Emperor’s jade exudes fragrant rectitude; the Heaven of Yang’s Circumambulation, where the Emperor aids in resolute righteousness.

The Eight Heavens of the West: the Heaven of Absolute Peace and Pristine Spirits, where the Emperor seals the passes and swears to the yin; the Heaven of Elegant Joy and Celebratory Ascension, where the Emperor solemnly establishes the foundation; the Heaven of Golden Auras Gathering Radiance, where the Emperor’s azure clouds congeal into jade; the Heaven of Pristine Qi and Seven Classics, where the Emperor’s sword gleams with cinnabar marvel; the Heaven of Resourceful Strength and Swift Action, where the Emperor commands lightning and spirits; the Heaven of Recorded Substance and Protective Guardianship, where the Emperor’s distant journey is cultivated; the Heaven of Ritual Prohibitions and Demon-Severing, where the Emperor’s upright seal weighs heavily; the Heaven of Aspiring Immortals and Jade Dragons, where the Emperor’s blue axe reaches the teeth.

The Eight Heavens of the North: the Heaven of True Circulation and Boundless Extension, where the Emperor roams the high pivot; the Heaven of Divine Protection and Ancestral Harmony, where the Emperor examines principles and investigates the chambers; the Heaven of Solar Fullness and Capital Perfection, where the Emperor treads the numinous and shines with brilliance; the Heaven of Treasure Radiance and Life’s Mandate, where the Emperor’s utmost thoughts establish peace; the Heaven of Bluegreen Pillars Locking the Vast, where the Emperor’s brilliance diminishes and spreads; the Heaven of Silent Constancy and Embodied Clarity, where the Emperor’s connection is diligent and reverent; the Heaven of Reported Moments and Awakened Origin, where the Emperor’s rebuke reaches the profound; the Heaven of Primordial Clarity and Peaceful Compliance, where the Emperor’s casting completes the profound.

The Thirty-Two Heavens, the Thirty-Two Emperors—each heaven’s hidden taboos, each heaven’s hidden names. The empty void within the heavens, the natural numinous verses, each heaven’s hidden rhymes, the sounds within the sun. The honored within the sun, the Emperor within the sun, the Perfected August One within the sun, the numen within the sun. Nine lights and ten blossoms transform into Upper Clarity, boundless mysteries too profound to detail. They bestow upon the divine Perfected, universally delivering heaven and humanity.

Today, rejoicing in receiving deliverance, they descend to welcome the sun’s Perfected. They rinse with auroral mists and swallow solar effulgences, donning the radiance of yang brightness. Golden liquid tempers their bones, jade nectar restores their spirits. Their bodies ascend upon jeweled chariots, becoming the Emperor’s exalted guests. They rise to the ancestral halls of mystery, passing through the barriers of the heavens. They beseech the eradication of all evils, severing the roots of desire, flying beyond the Five Sufferings, their names inscribed in the Great Mystery.

The Eastern Dipper assists on the left, the Western Dipper aids on the right, the Northern Dipper commands the host, the Southern Dipper governs the Great Hub, and the Central Dipper follows the wheel, riding behind the sun. Vermilion peaks tower like palace gates, crimson capitals stand in jade splendor. As essence circulates and life is bestowed, the world’s Dao proceeds.

The Azure Thearch guards the hun-soul, the sun’s essence transmitting to the liver. The White Thearch attends the po-soul, the sun’s essence passing through the lungs. The Red Thearch nurtures qi, the sun’s essence refining the heart. The Black Thearch circulates the blood, the sun’s essence dispelling yin. The Yellow Thearch governs the spleen, upon which all things depend.

The Azure Thearch’s Divine King, with the majesty of Horn and Straddler constellations; the Red Thearch’s Divine King, swift as billowing smoke and scorching separation; the White Thearch’s Divine King, pristine as silver auras and blazing radiance; the Black Thearch’s Divine King, dark as profound purple light; the Yellow Thearch’s Divine King, golden and numinous with eightfold flight. The Five Thearchs, great spirits, are the ancestors of solar yang. They roam the empty brightness, flying and drumming in procession, commanding divine soldiers, wielding banners and drums, surveying the great void. Proclaiming their resplendent titles, the heavens unite in merit. Delivering humanity above, they strictly oversee Fengdu in the north.

The Divine Kings receive their mandate. Universally sweeping away misfortune, flames spew poison. Four crimson-armored fire soldiers with flaming heads lead the vanguard, solar generals brandish banners, hurling fire for ten thousand leagues, their flowing bells resounding in eight directions. Should any dare to challenge or obstruct the Perfected Above, the golden axes strike first. They behead the Queen of Heaven’s rebels, slaughtering and dismembering ghostly wraiths. Wind and fire never cease—thousands upon thousands of heads severed, ten thousand upon ten thousand forms destroyed. Demons dare not trespass, ghosts dare not harbor malevolent spirits. The Three Offices and Fengdu in the north clearly inspect the ghostly camps, permitting no concealment. The Golden Horse Post presents their reports.

A universal proclamation without end. All spirits hearken, the Three Realms and Five Emperors array their words before the Supreme Clarity. The Primordial Cavern’s Jade Chronicle, the Great Beginning’s Dragon Prosperity, the Cavern Yang’s qi-Origin, the hidden embryo’s latent store—dim and distant through kalpas untold. Within the chaos, it was as an egg in form. The sun’s essence, the crimson numen, embraced and gave birth. The root of the Three Luminaries. When metal and water split, the waxing and waning crescents divided. That which becomes light and brightness is the sun’s hun-soul. Above, the Crimson Cavern; below, the Painted Abyss. Wind and marsh expand the void. Great brilliance adorns the heavens. Above the heavens, below the heavens—no darkness, no obscurity, no form, no shadow, no limit, no end. The primordial flood is the Dao, vast and unillumined. The Crimson Radiance’s vast plan unfolds by its own measure. The Primordial Beginning—settled and secure. The reckoning scatters five scrolls: crimson script on jade, sun-borne jasper texts. They govern the kalpa’s course, ensuring heaven’s eternal endurance. Brahmā’s qi fills the cosmos; myriad patterns unfold. The sun’s essence, yang brightness—thirty-two heavens revolve without color, circling the ten directions. The Dipper wheels past the Winnowing Basket. The Five Constants revolve; thirty-five divisions gather the qi of the Upper Origin. The Eight Luminaries merge in darkness; qi enters the Mystery of Mysteries. Within the sun, the Grand August One, the Five Emperors and lofty Perfected, drift upon the Great Rosy Clouds, whistling and chanting cavern hymns. Golden Perfected gleam in radiance; their flowing echoes fill the cloud camps. Jade tones gather qi; numinous winds assemble mists. The Purple Radiance’s solemn splendor. Within the sun, ten thousand immortals. The sun’s essence enters the body, descending through the Three Fields. Refining gold into liquid, gestating earth as lead. Casting it into the stomach’s furnace, heart-fire and kidney-spring, the ceasing yin fans the bellows. Liquid flows through a hundred rivers; the azure sea’s divine turtle exhales qi like smoke. The golden liquid transmits through the ears. The embryo becomes a jade infant. A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—naturally attaining perfection. Within the Perfected dwells a spirit: the Ageless Great Elder. The Peerless Lord, the White Prime Honored Spirit, the Great One Who Oversees Destiny, the Peach Prosperity’s assembly hall. They grasp talismans and hold registers, preserving life and planting its root. Ascending to the Supreme Clarity, entering and exiting the Flowery Chambers, within the eight poles, amid the most subtle. Below, they settle within the human body: the Mud-Pill Palace and Crimson Palace. Within, they order the Five Qi and harmonize the hundred spirits. Ten revolutions return the numen; ten thousand qi unite the immortals. The immortal’s path values life, delivering boundlessly. Above, the Eight Gates open; the Wheel of Flying Heaven turns. Transgressions and blessings, prohibitions and precepts, karmic conditions from past lives. Universally receiving deliverance, the dead soul gains a living body. The body attains rebirth, ascending to be heard by the various heavens. Above the various heavens, each has its solar gate. Refining yin to complete yang, flowing fire transforms form. The sun’s essence congeals and infuses—thus one becomes an immortal Perfected. Within it are the empty cavern’s chants and songs, the Perfected King’s numinous scrolls, verses that join the lofty Perfected.

**First: The Sun’s Essence, Yang Brightness, Flying Void’s Sound**
The Primordial Beginning’s crimson essence. The Three Origins rely on its completion; vermilion radiance illuminates the colorless cavern’s dark depths. Azure forests, golden blossoms. Jade fruits glow faintly. Crimson walls stretch ten thousand leagues; vermilion towers and red courts. The Five Emperors act without contrivance; ten thousand immortals array as ministers. Countless people wander freely, drinking light and consuming blossoms. Consorts and jade maidens burn incense and present offerings. Those who can draw in the rosy clouds race to the numinous Supreme Clarity. Golden countenances, jeweled crowns, brocade banners, embroidered standards. Six Jia spirits lead the way; six Ding spirits follow behind. The might of yang brightness annihilates yin’s ugliness. The Emperor bestows long life, extending years and enduring ages. The path of the Supreme Perfected is called the Nine Yangs.

**Second: The Sun’s Essence, Yang Brightness, Perfected King’s Scroll**
The sun’s boundary roams the void, floating through the Nine Palaces. Riding solitary strength, it circles upon the numinous wind. The cosmos is golden; mountains and seas are as one. Myriad beings rely on it for life; the Three Origins share its merit. This is the Primordial Beginning’s body, dividing form and transforming appearance. Nine refinements of cavern yang emerge before the primordial flood. Vermilion rays, the numinous crow, inhaling and exhaling the Great Hub. Those who can resonate with it gain luminous wisdom and numinous penetration. Still observation, distant discernment—returning to youth from old age. Beings that resonate with it flourish in purity and elegance. Cinnabar, precious jades, resplendent jasper mushrooms. Pearls swim in cloud seas; phoenixes perch in the Purple Tenuity. The sun’s essence, yang brightness—this is the Dao’s true return. I chant the Boundless Scroll to protect you from misfortune and decline.

**Third: The Sun’s Essence, Yang Brightness, Perfected King’s Song**
Crimson rosy clouds fly with purple mist; jasper wheels surge from the bright sea. Fusang congeals golden rays—through ten thousand ages, its hue never fades. Thus we know the Primordial Beginning’s essence, concealed in the abyss before heaven. Nine dragons harness the yang chariot, suddenly rising beyond the world. Heaven and earth form a valley; the Three Qi are already harmonized. Sun and moon become the divine elixir; absorbing essence dispels death’s decay. Alas, these stubborn immortals, forging stones into mere lumps. Why not draw the dragon shafts, circulate the liquid to drop pearl and cowrie? Pierce the nodes, connect the hundred gates—solar qi shatters the dark and dim. Chew clouds, shatter red glass. Drink the radiance to intoxicate the spirit. Do not fathom Penglai’s waters, ever mourning life’s opposition to death. At dawn, before the Five Emperors, the Dao’s secret seeks the profound meeting. Above these Three Realms, within the flying void, the Perfected King’s song. Its sound joins the cavern hymns. Recite it a hundred times—your name enters the Southern Palace. Harmonize it a thousand times—the Perfected King safeguards and welcomes. Ten thousand recitations complete the Dao—ascend to the Great Void. Traverse the Three Realms, attain the rank of Immortal Duke. Those who hear the numinous sound, the Perfected King reveres their form, commands the Earth’s Only, and dispatches attendants to escort them. Drawn from the earth’s gates, freed from the Five Sufferings and Eight Woes. Seven ancestors ascend; forever parted from the Dark Offices. The hun-soul crosses Crimson Mound, receives refinement and rebirth—this is called the Boundless. Universally delivering without end.

There is a secret celestial text; all heavens revere it. Those who leak or slight it fall to the earth’s joy, calamity extending to seven ancestral grandfathers.

The Dao states: These two scrolls are the hidden sounds of the Five Emperors’ Solemn Splendor Perfected Kings within the sun, illuminating the sun’s essence, yang brightness, and the Gate of Dawn. They enter and exit the rosy clouds, aiding the Perfected’s deliverance. The Three Realms compare them to enlightenment; the Two Modes hold them to divide and judge. Those who can absorb the sun’s essence’s qi.

Adorning oneself with the radiance of yang brightness,
then golden blossoms transform into immortality,
and seven ancestors receive refinement.
All these are the words of the Great Brahma,
not the common speech of the mundane world.
Their words lack ornate rhythm,
their melodies lack florid embellishment—
thus are they called profound and obscure,
difficult to fathom in detail.
Treasured by the heavens above,
they are concealed within the Jade Clarity Kingly Palace of Highest Divine Empyrean in Mystic Capital.
When the Dao Lord descended to the world,
he transmitted them in accord with the turning of the kalpas.
Should a perfected one offer gold and treasures with sincere heart,
and follow the ancient rites to pledge alliance with the Ten Heavens,
only then shall they be bestowed.

The Dao states:
When the cycles of heaven and earth reach their end,
when the sun, moon, and five planets wane and wax,
when the most sagely divine ones face decline,
and those of shallow learning suffer affliction—
whenever such calamities arise,
all of like qi must unite in heart to perform purification rites,
burn incense through the six watches,
and recite the scripture ten times in full.
Virtue and blessing shall descend at once,
dispelling all inauspicious omens.
This boundless text universally delivers without end.

The Dao states:
When those of shallow learning in the Dao,
whose immortal rank remains unfulfilled,
face the destined end of their kalpa,
their bodies pass through the Great Yin.
At the moment of their crossing,
fellow perfected ones of the same learning shall burn incense for them
and recite the scripture ten times,
to deliver their corporeal forms according to the method.
The essence of the sun flows downward,
yang brightness opens the yin,
bones refine and corpses vanish,
qi merges with celestial perfection.
The hun-soul ascends directly to the Southern Palace,
where, according to the merit of their studies,
they shall be reborn after a calculated span of days.
Once the Wheel of Rebirth ceases to delude,
they shall attain divine immortality.

The Dao states:
When the cycles of heaven and earth reach their end,
when constellations deviate from their courses,
when the sun and moon lose their radiance,
when the four seasons fall into disorder,
when yin and yang fail to harmonize,
when the land suffers calamity,
when pestilence and poison spread,
when the people perish and are harmed,
when teachers and companions pass away—
then too must purification rites be performed,
incense burned, and scriptures recited.
For the merit of purification rites and scripture recitation is most weighty:
above, it dispels celestial disasters and safeguards the emperor;
below, it wards off poison and harm, delivering the people.
In life and death, all depend upon it—
its blessings are beyond measure.
Thus is it called boundless,
universally delivering heaven and humanity.

The Dao states:
Whoever possesses this scripture
and performs these meritorious deeds for the lords of heaven and earth and the people,
on the day of calamity,
if they resolve in heart to perform purification rites, burn incense,
and recite the scripture ten times,
all the heavens shall record their names,
and myriad spirits shall attend and guard them.
Those who distinguish themselves as perfected ones
shall become ministers of the Golden Gates of the Sagely Lord.
The heavens record the merits and transgressions of all people,
not a hair’s breadth missed.
The true kings of the celestial realms
shall also protect and recommend such persons.
Those who attain the Dao
shall then thoroughly comprehend these most profound words.

The boundless sounds of the Great Brahma’s hidden speech in the heavens—
*Scripture of the Sun’s Essence and Yang Brightness, Middle Scroll of the Numinous Writ of the Primordial Beginning*
Eight Heavens of the Eastern Direction.

Amidst the Azure Brightness, dragon ripples surge, while mossy verdure veils in vast obscurity.
Vast and desolate, the shifting sands stretch boundless; all floating and writhing things align as one.
Sandalwood blazes, and the withered revive; gazing, life’s radiant consorts emerge.
Fierce torrents pour forth, and the Dragon Gate’s hunt for corpses begins.
Bewitching miasmas spread across the wilds; the violent shores gather what is fitting.
Chanting flows through the celestial gates; the Dipper’s rings adorn the seasons.
Lush offerings of straight-awned grain suddenly gleam, the numinous mantle unfurled.
Storks and hounds leap in bright vigor; dark brows pour forth subtle libations.

**Eight Heavens of the Southern Direction**

The nest’s warmth stirs and uplifts; blazing truth shrouds in solemn obscurity.
Jeweled tiers report their fullness; dullness and rigidity proclaim flourishing clarity.
The starry axle soars through vast clouds; rivers yield swift blossoms.
Illuminating brilliance mourns the chart; familiar light caresses the jade flask.
Wise and sagely, they gather felicity; embracing the balance, they preserve luminosity.
In hidden depths, the base finds refuge; pillars of lead take flight in song.
Lofty canopies bestow praise; the fragrant and rank are cast aside.
Deep caverns blaze with cavernous flame; the plains’ radiant souls are driven forth.

**Eight Heavens of the Western Direction**

Dhyāna’s path lies in silent obscurity; the pure peaks await the river’s confluence.
Treading the profound, they requite karmic ties; the axle’s harmony brings flourishing longevity.
The metal path congeals in stillness; the clan’s elders stand in lofty dependence.
Sagely measure transcends all bounds; sustenance gathers in restful foundation.
Autumn’s blossoms ascend in chariots; by what means do they hasten and turn?
Traversing the bamboo slips, they pace in reverence; brushes are drawn, screens held firm.
Far off in the dark abyss, exuberance delights the multitudes.
Pervasive reliance and obeisance; the old craftsmen’s brows are bowed.

**Eight Heavens of the Northern Direction**

The garrisoned fields lie upon the mounds; the Jade Pool is the font of compassion.
The sea’s reflection first reaches; the celestial fire flows in swift return.
Jade pendants and circular treasures gleam pure; the path is obscured by radiant confusion.
Boundaries and discourses fortify governance; hanging harmony invites splendor.
Devoted emaciation refines the scribes; white omens sink into fulfillment.
Plowing the reeds, they summon the serpents; clear oversight arranges the rafts.
The third continuity commands the tigers; solemn solitude abides in stillness.
Holding the *chun* drums, they unfurl the threads; the parched bells transform the ladders.

The Dao speaks: Within these heavens lies the Hidden Speech of the Great Brahma, the sound of boundless resonance. The ancient script was inscribed upon the Scarlet Gates of the Long Tower of the Sun’s Deficiency, illumined by the radiance of Yang’s pent-up splendor. This Dao is most strictly forbidden, the decree of the Supreme that must not be divulged. The myriad beings depend upon it for repose; the thousand sages roam and abide by its sway. Those who can comprehend it summon numinous spirits and gather true essence, filling the Niwan Palace to overflowing. Petals scatter and nectar flows, divine transformations perfect immortality. Nine generations of ancestors receive blessings, and the body ascends upon celestial clouds. Each character spans a full *zhang* in breadth.

In former times, the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign inscribed this text to establish the correct intonation. Those who know its sound and can intone even a fraction of it in purification rites will have the Radiant Yang Spirit-Kings of all heavens descend to observe their form. Their diligence is recorded upon their bodies, then reported to the heavens. Ten thousand spirits come to pay homage; earthly deities stand at the gates in attendance. The Great Merit Perfected Kings safeguard and recommend them as Supreme Perfected. When their Dao is complete and attained, they wander the Three Realms and ascend through the Golden Gate.

This sound repels all harm, dispels all misfortune, delivers all beings, and accomplishes all ends—it is the natural sound of the Heavenly Perfected. Thus, reciting it summons the Spirit-Kings to descend and observe. The Solar Emperor chants from afar; ten thousand spirits pay homage. The Three Realms attend in reverence; all malevolent forces bow their heads. Ghostly essences perish by day; the chiming of jade and jasper resounds. The ten directions grow solemn and clear. Rivers and seas fall silent; mountains and peaks swallow their mists. Myriad spirits tremble in submission; immortals are gathered in assembly. The heavens are free of impurity; the earth is cleansed of demonic dust. Profound wisdom illumines the depths; the vast and mysterious abides in mystery.

*The Wondrous Scripture of the Numinous Treasure, Upper Chapter on Delivering Humanity, Volume Fourteen Concludes. Volume Fifteen.*

**The Moon’s Yin Radiance Chapter**

The Dao spoke: Long ago in the Treasure Bright Heaven, within the Great Simplicity’s Radiant Land of Yellow Blossom Brahma-Light, the Primordial Beginning received the *Uppermost Wondrous Scripture of the Moon’s Yin Radiance for Delivering Humanity*. As the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning was about to expound this scripture, he circumambulated ten times to summon the ten directions, then ascended his seat.

Heavenly Perfected, Great Spirits, exalted sages, high revered ones, Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Queen Consort and Lady of the Upper Palace of Broad Cold, her attendant immortals and divine officials, the Radiant Golden Lads scattering splendor, the Jade Maidens of Luminous Blossoms—an innumerable host—came riding upon the void. White clouds and jade skies, golden chariots and jasper wheels, feathered canopies casting shade, flowing essences of jade light, vast and resplendent hues, illumined the vastness of the Great Void.

For seven days and seven nights, the suns and moons of the various heavens, the stellar orbs and celestial pivots, halted their revolutions and stilled their wheels. Divine winds curled and coiled; mountains and seas grew limpid at their sources. The Eight Voids of heaven floated in emptiness; the Four Clarities of earth lay in stillness. Throughout the land, mountains, rivers, forests, and groves were leveled as one, no longer high or low. The soil transformed into golden glass and interlaced jade, their reflections merging without distinction of color.

The assembled Perfected attended the seat as the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning sat in profound stillness upon a nine-dragon jasper terrace amid layers of cloud.

When he had expounded the scripture once, the great sages of the various heavens simultaneously proclaimed its excellence. At that time, the men and women of the land first awakened to the true cause: the Yin became the Mother of the Dao, and the Three Origins merged in primordial chaos, wherein all things were conceived.

When he had expounded it twice, their minds perceived the nature of understanding, and they awakened to the source of the Dao.

When he had expounded it thrice, they transcended the Yin womb and were instantly transformed and nurtured.

When he had expounded it four times, by the power of this scripture, they attained the Dao of flying immortality.

When he had expounded it five times, hearing the Dharma, they comprehended its principles, and their spirits became serene in the Palace of Broad Cold.

When he had expounded it six times, golden light suffused the void, and the forest of kalpa-trees trembled with resonance.

When he had expounded it seven times, the profound mysteries of the Dharma were revealed, preserving the kalpa in enduring existence.

When he had expounded it eight times, empty songs and penetrating hymns echoed, and the ten thousand heavens chanted in unison.

When he had expounded it nine times, the Moon Queen descended in her chariot, and drifting blossoms congealed in beauty.

When he had expounded it ten times, the Six Yangs all paid homage, and suddenly myriad transformations arose.

At that time, every man and woman in the land turned their hearts in devotion, all received protection and deliverance, and each attained longevity.

The Dao spoke: At that time, when the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning had expounded the scripture once, the Great Spirits of the *Moon’s Yin Radiance of the Boundless and Immeasurable* from the East arrived floating upon the void.

When he had expounded it twice, the Great Spirits of the *Moon’s Yin Radiance of the Boundless and Immeasurable* from the South arrived floating upon the void.

When he had expounded it thrice, the Great Spirits of the *Moon’s Yin Radiance of the Boundless and Immeasurable* from the West arrived floating upon the void.

When he had expounded it four times, the Great Spirits of the *Moon’s Yin Radiance of the Boundless and Immeasurable* from the North arrived floating upon the void.

When he had expounded it five times, the Great Spirits of the *Moon’s Yin Radiance of the Boundless and Immeasurable* from the Northeast arrived floating upon the void.

When he had expounded it six times, the Great Spirits of the *Moon’s Yin Radiance of the Boundless and Immeasurable* from the Southeast arrived floating upon the void.

When he had expounded it seven times, the Great Spirits of the *Moon’s Yin Radiance of the Boundless and Immeasurable* from the Southwest arrived floating upon the void.

When he had expounded it eight times, the Great Spirits of the *Moon’s Yin Radiance of the Boundless and Immeasurable* from the Northwest arrived floating upon the void.

When he had expounded it nine times, the Great Spirits of the *Moon’s Yin Radiance of the Boundless and Immeasurable* from the Upper Realm arrived floating upon the void.

When he had expounded it ten times, the Great Spirits of the *Moon’s Yin Radiance of the Boundless and Immeasurable* from the Lower Realm arrived floating upon the void.

When the ten circumambulations were complete, the Great Spirits of the *Moon’s Yin Radiance of the Boundless and Immeasurable* from the ten directions arrived as one. The men and women of the land turned their hearts in devotion, all hearing that the Celestial Worthy was about to expound the great Dharma, the wondrous and supreme Dao of the Moon’s Yin Radiance.

They said to one another: "Having heard the scripture ten times, we gradually align with the profound teaching, yet the mechanism of Yin radiance has not fully revealed its secret mysteries. We have only heard that the moon originally has no light, appearing as a black mirror. The sun’s brilliance shines upon the waters, reflecting to create its brightness. The *qi* of metal and water coalesce to form Yin radiance. The waxing phase is metal; the waning phase is water. At the full moon, metal and water unite, the metal body becomes perfectly round, and the celestial image reaches completion. The moon attends the sun’s brightness; the sun relies on the moon’s illumination. At the full moon, it is pure Yang; at the dark moon, pure Yin. Yet we have known only that Yang’s supremacy makes one an immortal, unaware that Yin radiance is the mother of the Six Yangs. The sages honor Yang and esteem Yin for this very reason: Yin is born of Yang, and Yang can generate Yin. The dark crow and white hare intermingle with celestial essence; those who attain this by reversal do not die. The Celestial Worthy first proclaimed the Dao of the Moon’s Yin Radiance, and we each offer our secret treasures, hoping to receive and uphold it."

Those who came were as numerous as fine rain or dense mist, an innumerable host, and half the land sank beneath their weight, unable to be restrained. Thereupon, the Celestial Worthy, with great compassion, entered the Nine Yin Contemplation and abided in profound samādhi. The great assembly gazed upward and beheld the Celestial Worthy returning his spirit without cease, still as a precious mountain. After a long while, he transformed into a bright moon. Ten blossoms emerged from the moon, their numinous rays intermingling. Layer upon layer of Yin radiance appeared like pupils of eyes, purple light soaring through the void, its inner wheel concealed. The sea of assembly was astonished; the immortals prostrated themselves upon the ground.

Suddenly, within the vast moon’s orb, palaces and towers appeared, along with the Queen Consort’s halls, the immortals’ cities and ramparts, as clear as daylight. Moon blossoms streamed with light, their hues blending with myriad treasures. The entire assembly gazed in longing, their hearts and eyes filled with awe.

Then, gathering the moon’s radiance, he transformed it into a precious pearl, as large as a millet grain, suspended in the void five *zhang* above the earth. The Celestial Worthy ascended and led the Heavenly Perfected, Great Spirits, exalted sages, Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, and the innumerable host of Great Spirits of the *Moon’s Yin Radiance of the Boundless and Immeasurable* from the ten directions—all entered into the precious pearl.

The heavenly beings looked up and saw only a shimmering light entering through the pearl’s mouth. Once within, its whereabouts became unknown. The gathered multitude dispersed, and the earth returned to levelness, no longer slanted or sunken.

Within the precious pearl, the Celestial Worthy expounded the sutra in full. The assembled Perfected oversaw the transmission, bestowing it upon me. At that moment, joy and celebration defied expression. When the Dharma rites were roughly complete, the hosts of heaven resumed their stations, and in an instant, all fell silent without a trace of sound.

At that time, the heavenly beings who encountered this sutra universally attained deliverance, preserving their allotted years without harm. The land turned in reverence, awakening to the Dao and comprehending the Yin. The Yin Radiance, Yin Spirits, Yin qi, Yin essence, Yin fire, Yin transformation, Yin birth, Yin womb, and the return of Yin to Yang—all merged with the sun and moon as one. Speech became the blossom of Yang; the mouth, the gateway of Yin. With compassion and love as their measure, even those of different bones became kin. The land knew peace, the people abundance, and all rejoiced in great harmony. From the sutra’s first revelation, the kingdom was guided by the Dao. Those who approached with utmost sincerity, reverence, and devotion all attained transcendence.

The Dao declared: All names spoken by the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning within this sutra are the hidden appellations of the *Jielin* within the moon, the concealed resonances of its depths. They are also the inner taboo names of the Queen Consort and her ladies, the secret designations of the hundred spirits. Those who can comprehend them, draw forth their blossoms, and gather their radiance—from utmost Yin arises Yang, and from Yang’s culmination, the immortal body. The distant resonance of the Feminine Palace descends with the descent of the numinous Perfected, solidifying one’s blood and marrow, ensuring enduring existence.

The moon is the spirit of the Po; blood is the utmost Yin. Yang is detained by Yin; Yang is called the Womb of Yin. Yin is named the Ancestral Earth. The green script’s secret texts are not the common words of the world. Only the Perfected who have attained the highest sageliness, who penetrate the profound and fathom the subtle, can fully grasp their verses. Reciting them ten times summons the distant chanting of the myriad heavens, the obeisance of the ten thousand emperors. Rivers and seas fall silent; mountains and peaks conceal their clouds. The Yin Radiance of the moon descends, transforming the yellow essence and altering one’s form. Hordes of demons are bound; ghostly spirits lose their clarity. The dead are revived; white bones become living beings.

For the most devoted scholars who recite these verses ten times, the Five Emperors come to guard them. Yin aligns with Yang’s authenticity; the Six Dragons bear their chariot. The Three Realms bow in reverence. Demonic spirits lose their sight; ghostly malevolence is extinguished. The dying are delivered; the severed are restored to life. This is because the scholar’s defilements have not yet dissipated, their bodies not yet perfected in truth. They may summon and command the moon’s radiance, but their power does not govern the celestial administration. Their virtue may subdue earthly deities and bind demonic spirits, yet they can only avert death, not restore life. To recite these verses lightly brings calamity upon oneself. To honor and revere them brings prosperity to one’s household, flourishing through generations, forging good karmic ties. Ten thousand disasters will not encroach; divine luminaries will guard the gate.

This sutra is supremely wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital. It delivers countless beings and stands as the root of all Dao. Its majestic model of virtue is beyond measure.

The Dao declared: Whoever recites this sutra ten times will summon the assembled heavens, and the Perfected of the Moon will await at their pavilion. The Ladies of the Moon will recount to the adept the suffering souls of their countless ancestors and myriad forebears. All will immediately receive deliverance, ascending to the Vermilion Palace. After nine years of refinement, they will be transformed and reborn, becoming noble persons. Those who diligently study this sutra, fulfilling their merit and perfecting their virtue, will all attain divine transcendence, soaring to the Golden Portals and roaming the Jade Capital.

Scholars of the highest learning who cultivate and recite this sutra will see the moon’s radiance transform their fluids, transmute their bones, and refine their spirits. They will immediately receive deliverance, ascending to the Southern Palace. Those in the world who recite it will have golden essence enter their bodies, their cranial gates resonating of their own accord. Jade maidens will bear the scriptures; golden youths will attend their countenance. They will extend their years and lengthen their lives, later attaining the Dao of *shijie*, where the soul and spirit briefly dissolve, bypassing hell to swiftly regain their form and roam the great void. This sutra is subtle and wondrous, universally delivering boundless beings. All heavenly beings receive its blessings. Its immeasurable blessings extend to life and death, treasured by the heavens above. It is not transmitted to the lower world. Only the most devoted scholars, offering gold and treasures with sincerity and swearing celestial oaths, may receive it. To lightly disclose or profane it brings calamity upon nine generations, condemning them to eternal servitude under the ghostly officials.

The Five Emperors attend this sutra, accompanied by twenty-four Jade Boys and twenty-four Jade Maidens, who safeguard the sacred text and protect the bodies of those who receive it.

The Dao declared: During the first month’s extended fast, recite this sutra. Within the Yin Radiance of the moon, great spirits clad in dragon robes and tiger talismans will deliver the adept’s ancestors, liberating the souls of past generations from earthly toil and ascending them to the Southern Palace. During the seventh month’s extended fast, recite this sutra. Within the Yin Radiance of the moon, great spirits in yellow robes and jeweled script will inscribe the adept’s immortal name, granting them divine transcendence. The heavens will record their name on yellow registers and white tablets, erasing death and restoring life. During the tenth month’s extended fast, recite this sutra. Within the Yin Radiance of the moon, great spirits in embroidered robes and grand sashes will preside over the myriad spirits, ensuring the king, emperor, lord, ministers, fathers, and sons secure the nation’s destiny, preserving the heavens’ longevity. Through generations unbroken, they will remain sovereigns, ruling their lands in peace. The people will witness great harmony. On the eight seasonal nodes, recite this sutra. The Yin Radiance of the moon will spread its light across the eight heavens, granting the adept the rank of Perfected of the Nine Palaces. On one’s natal day, recite this sutra. The Yin Radiance of the moon will immediately manifest the adept’s living form, their spirit born within their abdomen. Jade pendants and golden earrings will adorn them; numinous fluids will fill their stomachs. Their bodies will attain longevity; their souls and spirits will be purified and upright. Their myriad qi will endure forever, sparing them from suffering and affliction. Their bodies will radiate light, attended by the Three Realms, welcomed by the Five Emperors, and revered by the myriad spirits. Their names will be inscribed in the heavens. Upon fulfilling their merit and perfecting their virtue, they will ascend to the Upper Clarity.

The Dao declared: On the days of practicing the Dao, one must bathe in fragrant waters, enter the chamber in purity, face east, and knock the teeth thirty-two times to reach the thirty-two heavens. Bow thirty-two times in the heart, close the eyes, and silently envision oneself seated amidst clouds of purple, yellow, and white. Within and without, all is dim and serene. A green dragon, white tiger, vermilion bird, dark warrior, lion, and white crane array themselves to the left and right. The sun and moon shine brightly, illuminating the chamber with radiance. A circular halo appears above the head, its light reflecting in all directions. All must be vividly clear.

The secret incantation states:

Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Dao Lord,
Summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officials,
Left and Right Attendant Messengers,
Incense-Bearing Jade Lads,
Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens,
Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans,
Direct-Day Incense Officials—
thirty-six each—
to open and convey these words.
On this auspicious day, in a hall of purity and prolonged fasting,
we cultivate the supreme scripture to deliver boundless beings.

May these entreaties ascend directly
to the august presence of the Most High Primordial Thearch
before the throne of the Thirty-Two Heavens.
Thus concluded, draw qi thirty-two times and, facing east, recite the scripture.

*The Supreme Primordial Scripture of Boundless Salvation, Most Exalted Wondrous Chapter*
The Primordial Cavern-Mysterious Numinous Treasure’s Fundamental Scripture,
Moon’s Radiance and Yin Shadow,
Most Exalted Wondrous Beginning.
Ten revolutions deliver beings,
knotting luminous hidden rhymes,
parting and uniting naturally,
merging with yin’s shadow.
The Non-Ultimate’s perfected ones,
black-metal qi,
Mysterious Unity’s embryo,
outer yin and inner yang.
Supreme essence yet unopened,
stillness at its extreme gives birth to spirit,
metal and water gather form,
round illumination spanning kalpas.
Seas and mountains serene and bright,
yang alone transforms and rests,
yin congeals and changes cease,
the two images darkly unite.
Mysterious Female’s body conjoined,
yin ascends as rain and dew,
yang descends as abyssal springs,
Primordial Beginning’s ancestral kalpa.
Giving birth to all heavens,
the ancestor as yin’s shadow,
moon’s radiance cradling lotus,
illuminating the Three Luminaries.
This is the Heavenly Root,
above which no ancestor remains—
only the Dao as body,
the moon’s numinous script.
Yellow Writ in the Qian Forest,
each leaf bearing jade chapters,
universally planting spirit and numen.
Without script, no illumination;
without script, no clarity;
without script, no establishment;
without script, no completion;
without script, no deliverance;
without script, no birth.
This is the Great Brahmā,
heaven within heaven,
Jade Tower of Lush Array,
Golden Terrace of Pistil Abyss.
Supreme beyond the supreme,

The primordial cavern’s first sprouting,
yin’s radiance gives birth to yang,
yang seeks yin,
yin abides in yang.
The beginning and end of the five movements,
from dragon to peace—
the sun resides within the moon,
water protects the metal chamber.
Yang arises from yin,
with yielding virtue overcoming hardness.
The body lacking great yin,
becomes reckless yang.
Yang severed, the form perishes,
not concealed by the sagely—
in the vastness of countless kalpas,
within primordial chaos.

Above, gold as color,
below, water as abyss,
within, the utmost non-being—
where spirit and qi find repose.
Wind and marsh pervade emptiness,
vajra ascends the heavens.
Above heaven and below heaven,
no darkness, no obscurity,
no form, no shadow,
no limit, no end.
The vast expanse of primordial chaos,
boundless and lightless—
yin’s radiance unfolds clarity,
deliverance moves naturally.

The Primordial Beginning securely governs,
scattering the five chapters,
red script on jade,
eight mighty dragon scripts.
Preserving and regulating the kalpa’s course,
ensuring heaven’s enduring existence—
brahmā qi pervades the cosmos,
myriad patterns unfold.
The primordial net flows and evolves,
the thirty-two heavens,
revolving without color,
circulating through the ten directions.
The revolving Dipper passes the Winnowing Basket,
returning through the five constants,
thirty-five divisions,
converging qi in the Upper Origin.
Eight radiant scenes merge in darkness,
qi enters the profound mystery—
within the profound, the Great August,
the Highest Perfected, the Supreme Thearch.

Floating scenes in great rosy clouds,
whistling and chanting cavernous verses,
golden perfected gleaming lushly,
flowing echoes in cloudy encampments.
Jade tones gather qi,
spirit winds assemble mist,
purple emptiness luxuriant and elegant—
yin’s radiance transforms into immortals,

naturally attaining perfection.

boundlessly delivering humanity.

The moon has ten gates,
the flying heavenly treasure wheel,
sin and fortune’s prohibitions,
karmic conditions of past lives.
Universally receiving initiation and deliverance,
the dead souls reborn in bodies,
bodies attaining rebirth,
ascending to be heard by the various heavens.

Above the various heavens,
each has its gate of life—
within, empty and cavernous verses of hymns,
true kings’ numinous chapters,
words matching the Highest Perfected.

The First Moon’s Yin Radiance Soaring Void Melody.

The Six Harmonies are all empty, originally without a single thing.
The empty suddenly exhales, qi and wind turn full.
The wind is called the Rigorous Wind, qi is the Primordial Qi.
Qi like black mist, wind drums and gathers it.
Transforming into a black moon, drifting without place.
Within blackness, red is born—red orb becomes the sun.
Heaven and earth blossom and bear fruit, the moon is the sun’s root.
The ten emerge everywhere, five colors flow as essences.
Moon’s Yin Radiance, the myriad spirits look up in reverence.
Supreme Yin generates Yang, its light then flourishes.
The root of creation, Yin and Yang as its barriers.
Five draughts congeal the essence of Lin, heaven and man come to my side.

**Second Moon’s Yin Radiance True King’s Chapter**
At the bend of Dragon Mountain, green silk embraces the moon.
Heavenly light stealthily meets, fourfold flying jade snow.
Supreme Yang generates Yin, Yin is lord of things.
Yin is still and without action, the myriad things teem.
Yang moves, Yin is still—Yin’s radiance naturally aligns.
Stillness brings transformation, each rectifies its nature and life.
The omen knows not the true, constantly laboring my spirit.
Breaking the self to dwell in emptiness, not knowing to embrace the spirit.
Embracing the spirit is called stillness, Yin’s radiance issues commands.
Within, Supreme Yang is born, the flying spirit treads the Big Dipper.
Swallowing golden liquid, roaming the land of white clouds.
Why delight in the world? Crimson countenance vainly ages.

**Third Moon’s Yin Radiance True King’s Song Says**
Divine wind harnesses the bright moon, the world follows clouds in motion.
Unknowing of the myriad towers, jade beams and rainbows arise.
Heavenly empress wears yellow embroidery, trailing jade rings chiming on the balance.
Light divides above the Nine Heavens, ten dragons gallop with white blossoms.
Above, learning gazes toward the divine hut, drawing forth blossoms containing supreme essence.
Changing bones thrice, washing the intestines, the Divine Empyrean carves the immortal’s name.
Brain and blood naturally overflow, Yin’s radiance extends distant years.
Mysterious dew arises from the sea’s jade, true water comes from the distant dark.
Southern Palace delivers the seven ancestors, Northern Capital dissolves the sinful infants.
Carefree, riding the flying chariot, hastening to the vast Cold Palace.
Through kalpas, preserving a fragrant countenance, for a thousand years without sorrow’s voice.
Thus know the Way of the Supreme Perfected, wondrously transforming the host of spirits.
I sing beneath the Great Clarity, gazing down upon the jade horses’ wheel.
Golden waves surge from heaven, their beauty as if graspable.
Moon’s nectar nourishes the hundred spirits, again I sing, again I chant.
Above the Three Realms, within the flying void, the True King’s song and sound,
sound matching the cavernous chapters.
Reciting it a hundred times, the name is delivered to the Southern Palace.
Reciting it a thousand times, the True King protects and welcomes.
Ten thousand recitations, the Dao is complete, ascending to fly in the Great Void,
passing beyond the Three Realms, attaining the rank of Immortal Duke.
Those who hear the numinous sound, the True King respects their form,
commands the earth spirits, to serve and escort,
drawing them out from the earth’s gates, from the Five Sufferings and Eight Difficulties.
Seven ancestors ascend and migrate, forever departing the Dark Bureau,
souls delivered to the Crimson Mound, receiving refinement and rebirth.
This is called the Boundless, universally delivering without end.
There are secret celestial texts, revered by all heavens.
Revealing them carelessly casts one into hell, calamity extending to the seven ancestral grandfathers.

The Dao says: These two chapters are together the hidden sounds of the High Perfected of the Moon,
the Moon’s Yin Radiance Divine Kings, congealing the essence of Lin—
the Way of Yin’s radiance, the precursor of Yang’s qi.
Yang is detained by Yin, the moon wanes with the sun,
black and white divide the embryo, metal and water’s nature complete.
Abiding breath extends life, nurturing the embryo to secure the years.
Heaven and earth sustain it, the moon’s blossom is the pistil’s abyss,
within generating the mother of qi, the origin of the myriad kinds.
Concealed, the primal ancestor, true fire continues the transmission.
The Three Bureaus come and go, the work of creation is complete.
The Highest Lord is without action, Primordial Virtue stealthily spreads—
all are the words of the Great Brahma, not the common speech of the world.
Words without ornate beauty, melodies without florid grace,
thus called profound and obscure, difficult to fathom in detail.
The heavens above treasure them, secreted in the Highest Divine Empyrean Jade Clarity King’s Palace of the Mystic Capital.
The Dao Lord descends to the world, transmitting them according to the turning of the kalpa.
If there is a perfected person offering gold and treasure with sincere heart,
following the old protocols to pledge alliance with the Ten Heavens,
only then are they bestowed.

The Dao says: When the heavens’ turning reaches its end,
the sun, moon, and five stars wane and wax,
the most sagely divine persons prosper or decline,
while those of shallow learning suffer harm.
Whenever such disasters occur, those of the same qi should all unite in heart to perform the fast,
burn incense in the six periods, recite the scripture ten times—
blessings and virtue will immediately descend, dissolving all inauspicious signs.
The Boundless Text universally delivers without end.

The Dao says: Those of shallow learning in the Dao, whose immortal rank is not yet full,
when their kalpa-determined end arrives, their bodies pass through the Supreme Yin.
At the moment of crossing, fellow students and perfected persons should burn incense for them,
recite the scripture ten times to deliver the corpse according to the method.
Then the moon’s blossom halts its radiance, Yin’s radiance descends its essence,
true qi suddenly arises, the Yang spirit fully restores.
Soul and spirit directly ascend to the Southern Palace,
according to their accumulated merit, calculating the days to attain rebirth.
The turning wheel does not perish, and they become immortals.

The Dao says: When the turning of heaven and earth reaches its end,
the constellations fall into disorder, the sun and moon lose their light,
the four seasons lose their order, Yin and Yang are not in harmony,
the land suffers calamity, pestilential toxins spread,
the people perish and are harmed, masters and friends pass away—
then one should perform the fast, burn incense, and recite the scripture.
The merit of fasting and reciting the scripture is most weighty.
Above, it dissolves heavenly calamities, protecting and stabilizing the emperor;
below, it wards off poisonous harm, delivering the people.
In life and death, they receive its benefit—its blessings are beyond measure.
Thus it is called the Boundless, universally delivering heaven and humanity.

The Dao says: Whoever possesses this scripture,
able to perform these meritorious deeds for the lord of heaven and earth and the people,
on days of calamity, resolves to perform the fast, burn incense,
and recite the scripture ten times—
then the various heavens record their name, the myriad spirits serve and protect,
distinguishing the perfected persons on the right,
enabling them to become ministers of the Golden Gates of the Sage Lord.
The various heavens record people’s merits and faults, not missing even a hair’s breadth.
The True Kings of the heavens also protect and recommend their persons—
only those who attain the Dao will thoroughly understand these supreme words.

**The Boundless Hidden Sounds of the Great Brahma in the Heavens**
**The Dao Lord’s Composition**
**The Central Chapter of the Moon’s Yin Radiance Numinous Scripture**
**The Eight Heavens of the East**

The yin gaze meets the radiance, moon pearls congeal into liquid.
The mountain’s foundation shines with luminous souls, azure mists cast their traces.
Pure merit is called the net of stars, the jade pearl gleams upon the ridge.
Delivering spirits in wondrous subtlety, numinous perfected ones surge with brilliance.
Within the radiant sands of Tan, secret tones labor in rhythm.
The flourishing horns of willows and ghosts, their marvelous brightness reflects the sun.
Transmitting the admonitions of the primordial lineage, the transformative pool lies deep in mystery.
Yang perfected ones become the wind, moving blossoms in harmonious order.

**The Eight Heavens of the South**
Cinnabar luminaries flourish in numinosity, awaiting the decisive moment to receive the pendants.
The yang compass ascends transversely, its essence flowing to the utmost limit.
Jade torrents enfold the void, the true and the fixed merge in transformation.
Flowing chariots traverse the lands, mending clouds that float along the galleries.
The relay stations soar in flames, the overseers hasten in swift currents.
Waves of charm fill the cavernous valleys, the forbidden true ones bathe in jasper streams.
The sharp blades of wisdom are dew upon the lingzhi, the resonant chimes store within the barriers.
Establishing and shaking the *vidyā*, the mysterious directions branch into peace.

**The Eight Heavens of the West**
The numinous holds and initiates transmission, the cloud generals wield their sharp blades.
The offerings are arrayed in vessels of rank, the three stars and the *Bi* asterism shine in response.
The august assembly of immortals, traversing the mists beyond the outer reaches.
Blue tablets honor the light, golden thunder rests in silence.
Refining the luxuriant and the delicate within the cage, the Three Primes inspect the gates.
Expounding the assisting records of treasures, the phoenix pass gleams in lofty splendor.
The canons govern with integrity, the mysterious village surges with divine vigor.
The clear and the dominant unfold in brilliance, the Long Star floats in auspiciousness.

**The Eight Heavens of the North**
The cavernous depths surge with mighty waves, opposing currents shine in radiant display.
Fragrant stores fill the admonishing aids, the dragon perfected ones grandly transmit.
Grasping the reins to array the demons, lifting the thunder to invoke the boundaries.
Fierce mountains topple in flight, the black void’s edge is sharp and perilous.
The dark tortoise and fire serpent, the hidden springs and the Dipper’s palace.
Subduing the deviant and beheading the grotesque, the crown’s strength and the shaman’s bells.
The vast and reverent treasure springs, the celestial paths trace the perilous wheels.
The canopy of stars upholds the terrace, the imperial gaze follows the gravel’s path.

The Dao says: These are the lunar *lin* texts within the various heavens, the boundless hidden sounds of the Great Brahma. The ancient script was inscribed upon the ten-rayed gate of the moon to summon and bind the great *lin* spirits, spreading the light of the Supreme Void, calling forth yang to perfect the true, so that the myriad kinds receive the script. Yang returns to true yin, true yin solidifies yang, enabling the spirit-qi to abide. Golden body and jade bones, the moon’s radiance refines the form, sweeping away defilement to attain immortality. The exalted ones hear and revere, praising the heavens without effort, myriad billions of blessings come to fruition. Each character spans a full *zhang* in breadth.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign of Old inscribed these texts to establish the correct sounds. Those who know these sounds and can fast and recite them will have the various heavens dispatch flying riders and divine kings to descend and observe their persons, recording their meritorious diligence. This is reported to the various heavens, where the myriad spirits pay homage, earth deities attend at the gates, and the great merit of the True Kings ensures the protection and recommendation of the perfected. With the Dao complete and attained, one may wander the Three Realms and ascend through the Golden Gates.

These sounds repel all, exorcise all, deliver all, and accomplish all—such are the natural sounds of the Heavenly Perfected. Thus, reciting them causes flying riders to descend in observation, the moon’s consorts to chant from afar, the myriad spirits to pay homage, the Three Realms to attend in their chariots, the host of malevolent beings to bow their heads, and ghostly essences to perish of themselves. The jade-like resonance vibrates, the ten directions grow solemn and clear, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks swallow their mists. The myriad spirits tremble and submit, summoning the assembly of immortals. The heavens are free of defilement, the earth is without demonic dust. Profound wisdom illumines the depths, the great measure is profoundly mysterious.

**The Wondrous Scripture of the Upper Chapters on the Limitless Salvation of Beings, Scroll Fifteen—Concluded**
**Scroll Sixteen**

**The Chapter on the Separation and Union of Yin-Yang and the Transformation of the Five Agents**

The Dao spoke: Long ago in the Heaven of Mystic Transformation, within the sacred land of Primordial Radiance and Numinous Song, the Great Perfected received the *Upper Chapters on the Limitless Salvation of Beings: The Separation and Union of Yin-Yang and the Transformation of the Five Agents* from the Primordial Beginning.

As the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning was about to expound this scripture, he circumambulated ten times to summon the ten directions, and only then ascended his seat. The Heavenly Perfected, the Supreme Sages, the Lofty and Venerable, and the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct—an innumerable host—came riding upon the void. Their radiance congealed in luminous emptiness; crimson chariots and cinnabar carriages bore canopies of kingfisher jade, their brilliance outshining mist, while auspicious qi swirled in eightfold veils and numinous light coiled in fourfold spirals.

For nine days and nine nights, the warp and weft of yin and yang in the myriad heavens stilled their motion; the Two Effulgences and Three Primordials halted their revolutions, and the Great Void soared in clarity, its depths too profound for naming. Wind and clouds grew hushed and solemn, while the forms of all things flourished in splendor. The land of that realm—its mountains, rivers, forests, and trees—was leveled to perfect evenness, no longer bearing high or low. The earth became patterned with jade, its veins interwoven with ten thousand hues.

The host of Perfected attended the seat as the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning sat in profound stillness upon the Tenfold Flowering, Ninefold Radiant Seat of the Supreme Ultimate suspended in the void. With the first recitation of the scripture, the Great Sages of the myriad heavens voiced their approval in unison. At that moment, the afflictions of all men and women in that land were wholly dispelled. With the second recitation, all beings attained their proper growth. With the third, the qi of the Dao returned to their forms. With the fourth, the people prospered and lived long, all gaining longevity. With the fifth, the ascent and descent of the Two Modes harmonized of themselves. With the sixth, the four seasons followed their virtue, nurturing and transforming without error. With the seventh, the hundred spirits aligned in transformation, and the myriad treasures flourished. With the eighth, within the four seas, all was secure, abundant, and prosperous; joy and great peace reigned, and the world was preserved in glory. With the ninth, customs grew pure and sincere, and the Dao and its Perfected were revered. With the tenth, both the living and the dead received its grace, universally benefiting from its profound favor.

At that time, every man and woman in that land turned their hearts in devotion, all receiving protection and deliverance to attain long life.

The Dao spoke: When the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning had recited the scripture once, the Boundless and Limitless Jade Treasure Great Spirits of the East—an innumerable host—arrived floating upon the void. With the second recitation, the Boundless and Limitless Mystic Perfected Great Spirits of the South—an innumerable host—arrived floating upon the void. With the third, the Boundless and Limitless Supreme Wondrous Great Spirits of the West—an innumerable host—arrived floating upon the void. With the fourth, the Boundless and Limitless Purple Yang Great Spirits of the North—an innumerable host—arrived floating upon the void. With the fifth, the Boundless and Limitless Deliverance and Transformation Great Spirits of the Northeast—an innumerable host—arrived floating upon the void. With the sixth, the Boundless and Limitless Life-Nurturing Great Spirits of the Southeast—an innumerable host—arrived floating upon the void. With the seventh, the Boundless and Limitless Radiant Flower Great Spirits of the Southwest—an innumerable host—arrived floating upon the void. With the eighth, the Boundless and Limitless Mystic Obscurity Great Spirits of the Northwest—an innumerable host—arrived floating upon the void. With the ninth, the Boundless and Limitless Jade Void Great Spirits of the Upper Realm—an innumerable host—arrived floating upon the void. With the tenth, the Boundless and Limitless Perfected August Great Spirits of the Lower Realm—an innumerable host—arrived floating upon the void.

When the ten recitations were complete, the Boundless Heavenly Perfected Great Spirits of the ten directions arrived as one. The men and women of that land turned their hearts in devotion and reverence. Those who came were like clouds in flight or mists gathering, their innumerable host pressing so closely that half the land sank beneath them, an event beyond restraint.

Thereupon, the Primordial Beginning gathered the Two Effulgences, the sun and moon, and the Mystic Root, coiling and entwining them to form a single Treasure Wheel, vast as a chariot’s hub, suspended nine *zhang* above the earth. The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning ascended and led the Heavenly Perfected, the Supreme Sages, the Lofty and Venerable, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, and the Boundless Great Spirits of the Five Agents of yin and yang from the ten directions—an innumerable host—all into the Treasure Wheel. The heavenly beings gazed upward and saw only a surging brilliance entering within. Once inside the Treasure Wheel, none knew where they had gone. The people of the land dispersed, and the earth returned to levelness, no longer slanting or sinking.

Within the Treasure Wheel, the Primordial Beginning completed the recitation of the scripture in full. The host of Perfected oversaw the deliverance and transmitted it to me. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words. When the ritual was roughly concluded, the myriad heavens returned to their stations, and in the space of a breath, all was silent, with no trace remaining.

At that time, the heavenly beings who encountered the scripture’s teachings were universally delivered, their allotted years preserved whole, free from harm. Heaven and earth, the four seas, and the Dao merged with the Utmost Perfected. There was no loss, no decay, no disturbance, no disorder, no error, no obstruction, no discord, no divergence, no decline, no extinction. Beings did not die young, and life attained longevity. Compassion and kindness were mutually preserved, and benevolence and goodness harmonized in heart. The land was secure, the people prosperous, and all rejoiced in great peace. From the scripture’s first appearance as teaching, the land was governed by the Dao. Those who had beforehand set their minds upon it, revered and honored it, all attained deliverance across the ages.

The Dao spoke: The names spoken by the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning in the recitation of this scripture are the inner names of the Emperors of the Myriad Heavens, the hidden rhymes of sound. They are also the inner taboos of the Perfected Kings and the concealed names of the hundred spirits. Emerging from being and entering non-being, separating and uniting yin and yang, transforming the Five Agents—these all return their forms to constancy. They can illumine, they can radiate, they can preserve, they can dissolve. Knowing and enacting them, one drives yin and moves yang, beyond the common words of the world. Only the Perfected who have already attained realization and penetrated the profound and subtle can fully grasp their verses. Reciting them ten times, the spirits of the myriad heavens and earths, of yin and yang and the Five Agents, the gods of transformation and movement, will all come to pay reverence with rites and devotion, aligning in veneration. Their wondrous efficacy remains in harmony, the upright qi is never forgotten, the wellsprings of life open of themselves, and the ten thousand kinds flourish in perfection, without ruin or decay.

Scholars of the highest learning who recite these verses ten times will find yin and yang aligning in virtue, the Five Agents harmonizing in function. They will ascend in accord with the celestial patterns, traversing the celestial degrees without end, preserving and delivering from adversity, cutting off calamity to gain extension. The reason for this is that scholars of the Dao have not yet purified their qi, their bodies have not yet merged with the divine, and though they regulate and harmonize to bring order, their station has not yet reached the profound. By their own effort, they may dispel the disasters of the times, avert and restrain the turning of fate—but this only removes harm and wards off misfortune.

To recite these verses lightly or carelessly brings punishment upon the self. To offer reverent devotion and honor to this scripture brings prosperity to one’s household, generation after generation flourishing in abundance, bound to good karmic causes. Ten thousand calamities will not touch them, and divine luminaries will guard their gates. This scripture is most exalted and wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital, delivering countless beings and serving as the root of all Dao. Its majestic and vast model of virtue is beyond measure.

The Dao declares: When one recites this scripture ten times, all the heavens assemble. The errant qi of yin and yang and the Five Agents, the principles of disorder and disharmony, all immediately harmonize, uniting with the utmost truth. After three years of the Dao’s completion, one’s transformative power penetrates the subtle, summoning the divine spirits to operate the mysterious gate, nurturing and bringing forth life as if wielding its authority. One’s name is recorded in the Golden Portal and inscribed in the Jade Purity.

Scholars of the highest learning who cultivate and recite this scripture find yin and yang, the Five Agents, and the inner and outer merging with the profound. Externally, they expand their scope; internally, they guard the celestial origin. The mechanisms of inner and outer align with spontaneity.

When mortals receive and recite this scripture, the sun, moon, and stars pour forth their essence upon them. Within their bodies, they later attain the Dao of liberation through simulated death, their ethereal souls briefly extinguished, sparing them the trials of hell. They immediately regain their form and roam the great void. This scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally delivering without end, and all heavenly and earthly beings receive its blessings. Boundless merit extends to life and death, for this treasure of the heavens is not transmitted to the lower world. Only the most devoted scholars, offering gold and treasures with sincere hearts and swearing oaths to heaven, may receive it. To leak or slight it lightly brings calamity upon seven generations, condemning them to long servitude under the ghostly officials.

Five Emperors attend this scripture, along with twenty-four Jade Lads and twenty-four Jade Maidens, who encircle and protect the sacred text, safeguarding those who receive it.

The Dao declares: During the long fast of the first month, recite and chant this scripture. Yin and yang separate and unite, and the ten thousand things receive life. Hard and soft harmonize, the Five Qi interweave, the transformed body remains unharmed, and form and spirit endure forever. During the long fast of the seventh month, recite and chant this scripture. Yin and yang separate and unite, and the ten thousand things receive completion. Nurturing the hun and embracing the po, the Five Virtues are fulfilled, the transformed body shines brightly, and form and spirit are eternally preserved. During the long fast of the tenth month, recite and chant this scripture. Yin and yang separate and unite, and the ten thousand things return to truth. The primordial root merges and blends, nurturing the Five Essences, the transformed body remains ever firm, and form and spirit flourish forever. In sum, the supreme Dao protects and stabilizes the emperor, ensuring the nation’s destiny endures without bound and governance knows no limit.

On the days of the eight solar terms, recite and chant this scripture to open and guide harmonious qi, gathering and aiding transformative power. Cultivate and accumulate without cease to ascend and attain the lineage of immortals. On one’s natal day, recite and chant this scripture. Yin and yang, the Five Agents, and the wondrous origin of the divine protect my life, assist my spirit, and drive away suffering. My body shines with light, the Three Realms attend me, the Five Emperors welcome me, and the myriad spirits pay homage. My name is inscribed in the heavens, and upon the completion of merit and virtue, I ascend to the Upper Clarity.

The Dao declares: On the days of practicing the Dao, one must bathe in fragrant waters, enter the chamber in purification, face east, and knock the teeth thirty-two times to ascend to the thirty-two heavens. Bow in the heart thirty-two times, close the eyes, and silently envision the body seated amidst clouds of blue, yellow, and white qi, the inner and outer shrouded in mist. A Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Lion, and White Crane array themselves to the left and right. The sun and moon illuminate brilliantly, suffusing the chamber with radiance. A circular image appears above the head, its light shining in all ten directions—all this must be clearly envisioned.

The secret incantation says:
Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Lord of the Dao,
Summon forth from within my body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the left and right attending messengers, the jade lads who tend the incense, the jade maidens who transmit words, the direct talismans of the Five Emperors, and the incense officials of the day—thirty-two each—to open and convey my words.
Today is an auspicious day, a long fast in the pure hall, cultivating the supreme scripture to deliver countless beings.
May what I now declare swiftly ascend to the presence of the Most High, the Primordial Lord of the Thirty-Two Heavens.
Conclude by drawing qi thirty-two times, then face east and recite the scripture.

*The Supreme, Boundless Deliverance, Uppermost Wondrous Scripture*
The Primordial, Cavernous Mystery, Numinous Treasure Root Chapter—
Yin and yang separate and unite, the Five Agents transform the body.
The wondrous uppermost beginning, delivering beings through the ten poles,
The Celestial Sovereign’s hidden rhymes, separating and uniting spontaneously.
The wondrous model of the Great Ultimate, subtle and profoundly mysterious,
The great chaos at its beginning, governing the transformations of the hundred spirits.
Pure and turbid distinguish their forms, yin and yang ascend and descend,
Intermingling and transforming, their brilliance shining forth.
The accumulated qi determines the numbers, the Five Functions divide the directions,
Below nurturing their forms, above adorning their essences.
Nurturing within, the Dao has its constancy,
Soft and hard, dry and damp, cold and heat, warmth and coolness.
The primordial harmony of the One, encompassing the numinous net,
Mutually aiding, mutually transforming, mutually overcoming, mutually completing.
Without this, nothing is established; without this, nothing is completed;
Without this, nothing is delivered; without this, nothing is born.
This is the Numinous Treasure, the true one within heaven,
The realm of jade and rosy clouds, the palace of the moon’s assembly.
Encompassing the ten thousand realms, governing the Jade Dawn,
Lush and fragrant, the root of the ethereal and distant.
The three gates and nine domains, receiving the wondrous lineage of light,
The Golden Portal and Jade Chamber, the pure and vast forest of stars.
The great flow of Brahma qi circulates through the ten directions.
Within are the gods of yin and yang’s creation and transformation,
Within are the lords who opened heaven and established the pole,
Within are the great gods who govern the mysterious mechanisms,
Within are the Three Primordials and the August Lords of the Three Origins,
Within are the deities who oversee the Five Numinosities, the Five Qi, the four seasons, the four sequences, and the honored gods of the Great Year.
Separating and uniting, transforming the body, delivering countless beings,
Today, as the recording is reviewed, all the heavens descend to the imperial terrace.

The Perfected Sovereigns of the Ten Directions, Divine Kings of Transformation, Eternal Life and Deliverance, Boundless Great Gods, all ascend in flying clouds, crimson chariots, and cinnabar carriages, adorned with kingfisher canopies, drawn by auspicious beasts and five-colored dragon steeds. They bear the standards of streaming fire and the darkly radiant great banners. Before them, the wondrous music of the Ten Heavens leads the way; behind them, the chants of the Three Realms follow. Vermilion script and cavernous chapters harmonize to produce celestial sound. The Ten Floras open the path, the Seven Essences uphold the shafts. Myriad immortals and ten thousand Perfected Ones come singing, traversing the void, treading the insubstantial, summoning qi and gathering clouds.

The Prime Minister of the Celestial Pivot, the Boundless Palace of the Origin, the Nine Numinous Mystic Assistants, and the Great Gods of Transformative Qi, holding registers and talismans, arrive together at the imperial court. As they open and transform, they turn the wheels of all heavens. Universally proclaiming to the Three Realms, illuminating the Six Passes of the Cavernous Dark, the Azure Lodge and Cinnabar Pool, the Yellow Pass and Yellow Springs Terrace—separating and uniting yin and yang, transforming the body through the Five Phases, driving and commanding responsive changes, all things come to life and take form. Encompassing and spreading, the two qi soar; the great transformation interweaves, ascending and descending in mutual embrace. The primal movement of the Four Voids, the warp and weft revolve; grasping the origin’s mechanism, yin’s po and yang’s hun. Profoundly awakening to the true and wondrous, the spirit soars to the Jade Capital. Refined by the Vermilion Mound’s fire, the immortal transformation transcends and ascends. Ascending as Perfected, receiving deliverance, enduring through kalpas, the turning wheel of yin and yang, sharing the years of heaven. Forever parted from demonic ghosts and the trials of the kalpa, transcending the Three Realms, carefree in the Grand Purity.

In the Heaven of Grand Purity, the Celestial Emperor transforms through light, the colorless realm of Brahma conduct.

The Thirty-Two Heavens, the Thirty-Two Emperors—each heaven’s hidden taboos, each heaven’s concealed names. Within the heavens, the empty and cavernous, the natural numinous chapters, each heaven’s hidden rhymes, the sounds of yin and yang. The honored ones of the Five Phases, the gods of separation and union, naturally transforming bodies, the numinous of exhaustive change. Nine harmonies and ten unions, transformations of the Highest Clarity, boundless mysteries, too profound to detail. Scattering and descending, the divine and Perfected universally deliver heaven and humanity.

Today, rejoicing in receiving deliverance, passing through the heavens’ passes, calling yin and summoning yang, gathering and dispersing, stirring and refining. The wood of spring nurtures fire, becoming summer’s flame; the metal of autumn nurtures water, becoming winter’s cold. The four seasons revolve with earth, and the myriad things attain completion. The three qi transform the body, separating and uniting the dark passes; the two luminaries ascend and change, thereby distinguishing the Five Phases. The three qi congeal essence, drumming and leaping, smelting and molding. Flying and hiding, sinking and appearing, the Dao exercises its power. The Three Realms stand upright, all things are at peace; again separating, again uniting, the divine essence spreads and proclaims. The Jade Elixir congeals, form possesses spirit and substance; the body transforms myriad changes, one Perfected naturally.

The Perfected Kings hold the keys, opening and unlocking the gates of heaven. The Eastern Dipper gives birth to yang, the Western Dipper brings forth yin; yin and yang’s dipper descends, metal’s po and wood’s hun. The Northern Dipper’s profound ford, the Southern Dipper’s crimson clarity; the Central Dipper governs all, constantly overseeing the multitude of spirits. The Azure Emperor engenders life, the White Emperor completes form, the Crimson Emperor spreads nurturance, the Black Emperor communicates essence, the Yellow Emperor stabilizes intent, commanding and restraining the myriad gods.

The Azure Heavenly Demon King, Bayuan Choubo.
The Crimson Heavenly Demon King, bearing heaven and carrying stone.
The White Heavenly Demon King, six-eyed mountain-overturner.
The Black Heavenly Demon King, overseeing ugliness and bright fragrance.
The Yellow Heavenly Demon King, spanning heaven with boundless strength.
The Five Thearch Demon Kings, ancestors of the myriad spirits.
Following qi’s separation and union, their forms transform and circulate;
soaring and converging, expanding and contracting, they are companions to the Dao.
They establish and plant great vessels, distributing across the nine mounds,
administering heaven and earth, wielding divine soldiers.
Holding talismans and grasping tablets, they traverse the great void,
proclaiming their radiant majesty, with all heavens sharing their merit.
Ascending to deliver humanity, they strictly govern the Northern Feng;
the Yellow and the Old receive the decree to annihilate demonic omens.
Kui-dragons command poisons, phosphorescent riders drive the vanguard;
the Tail of the Tiger warns ahead, Red Armor raises the banner.
Hurling fire for ten thousand leagues, casting ringing bells through the eight directions—
should any dare to test them, they resist and repel the Perfected Ones.
White spirits execute the van, fire soldiers punish the rear;
yin dissolves ghostly apparitions, slaughtering and vanquishing evil essences.
At dawn the records are settled, examinations proceed without cease.
Demons dare not trespass, ghosts dare not manifest.
The Six Heavens’ bureaus inspect ghostly encampments,
permitting no concealment, reporting swiftly as wind and fire.
Universally proclaimed to the Three Origins, all spirits heed the summons;
the Nine Abysses’ upper aides submit memorials to the Great Clarity.
Through cavernous kalpas vast and boundless, from the Great Beginning’s Dragon Prosperity,
through countless eons in the midst of primordial chaos,
yin and yang separate and unite, the five natures arise spontaneously.
Forms transform through emptiness and constancy, ascending to the Three Colors,
descending to the deepest abyss, winds revolving through the Nine Voids.
Metal and fire ride heaven, above heaven and below heaven—
no darkness, no obscurity, no form, no shadow,
no limit, no end, the primordial mist transforms into qi.
Vast and expansive, intertwining, cinnabar light unfolds the chart.
Kalpas pass naturally, the Primordial Beginning remains serene.
Spreading the Five Chapters, the red script of jade characters,
the Eight Might’s dragon script, safeguarding and regulating kalpic destiny,
ensuring heaven’s eternal endurance, the Brahma-qi suffuses the cosmos.
Myriad patterns unfold, the primordial net flows and evolves.
The Thirty-Two Heavens revolve without color,
circling the ten directions, wheeling through the Dipper and Winnowing Basket.
Revolving through the Five Constants, thirty-five divisions,
the Upper Origin’s qi unites, the Eight Effulgences merge in darkness.
Qi enters the profoundest mystery, within mystery the Great August,
the Most High Lord, floating through the radiance of great rosy clouds.
Chanting cavernous hymns, golden perfected ones gleam resplendent;
their flowing resonance fills the cloudy encampments, jade tones gather qi.
Divine winds assemble mists, the Purple Void flourishes in elegance,
assisting and sheltering the myriad immortals, all proceeding from yin and yang.
Separating and uniting the Five Phases, forms transform and manifest in fullness;
wondrous qi generates and completes, responsive change is the true Dao.
Opening and transforming the utmost Perfected, within the Perfected there is spirit.

The Great Lord of Longevity, the Great Emperor of Azure Radiance,
the Venerable Luminous Spirit, the Supreme Unity of Strategic Planning,
the Controller of Destiny who governs with clarity,
the Peach Prosperity who presides over life,
the Harmonious Extension of the Imperial Lord,
who holds talismans and grasps registers, safeguarding life and engendering roots.
Above, they roam the Nine Clarities, entering and exiting the Yellow Chamber,
within the dark elixir, amid the crimson qi.
Below, they govern the Six Gates, the cavernous abodes of primordial essence;
centrally, they regulate the Five Qi, blending the hundred spirits.
Ten revolutions return the numinous, myriad qi unite as immortals.
The immortal way values life, delivering boundless multitudes.
Above, they open the Eight Gates, the flying heavenly dharma-wheel,
prohibitions of sin and blessing, karmic conditions of past lives.
Universally receiving deliverance, the dead souls gain living bodies;
bodies attain rebirth, ascending to be heard by the various heavens.
Above the various heavens, each has its gate of life;
within them are the chapters of separating and uniting transforming forms,
the Perfected Kings’ numinous scriptures, verses that match the lofty Perfected.

**First: The Melody of Separation and Union in Flight through the Void**
Once qi splits open, the myriad transformations flow freely.
Yin and yang separate and unite, great kalpas intersect and revolve.
The Nine Heavens and Eight Extremes, the Thirty-Two Passes—
one separation, one union, qi’s reckoning shifts and changes.
Luminous and resplendent, the primordial image responds below to the human body.
Forests of palaces and towers govern and prepare the hundred spirits.
To sever the wheel of rebirth, cultivate the Five Phases in sequence.
The Five Phases’ transformations are called the Heavenly Origin.
If you can recognize this, you will ascend in form as a flying immortal.
If the numinous palace is turbid and dull, the Dao will not be accomplished.
How could one know that awakening to the Dao unites spirit and qi in ascent?
Yin and yang’s separation and union follow the sprouting of the myriad things.
Wandering beyond the Three Realms, naturally there is no life or death.
Spirits fly and step through the circular net, the twin towers pay homage to the lofty Perfected.

**Second: The Perfected’s Chapter of Transforming Forms**
Controlling the chariot, roaming the Eight Darknesses, halting the radiance at Kunlun’s slopes.
Golden towers bow to the Void Thearch, luxuriant clouds ride the great rosy clouds.
Forms transform within emptiness and nothingness, life and completion bathe in dark waves.
Clinging to form, desires not yet purified, yin thoughts without bound or shore.
Karmic thoughts pursue one another, endlessly sinking into the river of love.
Once fallen into the filthy and turbid realm, the bitter path gives rise to sorrowful songs.
I now spread the utmost teaching, the upright qi suppresses the source of evil.
The red script delivers the multitudes, the yellow banner summons the great demons.
Forever enjoying great fortune, what are a hundred million years?
Alas, you children of the dust, how could you turn your backs on the true?

**Third: The Song of the Five Phases and Yin-Yang**
Vast and distant, above the Three Heavens,
towering and majestic, the White Jade Capital.
The Primordial Beginning rides the bright effulgence, establishing this great transformative root.
Yin arises and binds the yellow blossom, yang’s light spreads the crimson wheel.
The two qi intertwine and weave, the great void flows with the Five Phases.
The Seven Effulgences suddenly soar and change, the myriad things arise therefrom.
The Five Phases mutually shift and alter—who can fathom success or failure?
The Divine Empyrean holds the dark record, universally examining all heaven’s people.
To the left, it captures the demons of the Three Realms; to the right, it controls the soldiers of the Six Heavens.
Precious chapters summon harmonious qi, jade talismans gather the hundred spirits.
Heavenly soldiers wield jasper axes, the Red Thearch hurls molten metal.
Capturing and subduing the multitude of demonic ugliness, all realms become pure and clear.
The true shade universally covers heaven, protecting for a hundred million kalpas without collapse.

This is above the Three Realms, within the flight through the void,
the Perfected Kings’ song and melody, melodies that match the cavernous hymns.
Reciting them a hundred times, names are registered in the Southern Palace.
Reciting them a thousand times, the Perfected Kings protect and welcome.
Ten thousand recitations complete the Dao, ascending to the great void,
passing beyond the Three Realms, attaining the rank of Immortal Duke.
Those who hear the numinous melody, the Perfected Kings respect their forms,
commanding and restraining earthly deities, escorting and welcoming,
extracting them from the earthly gates, the Five Sufferings and Eight Difficulties.
Seven generations of ancestors ascend and depart, forever leaving the ghostly bureaus;
souls cross the Vermilion Mound, receiving refinement and rebirth.

Here is the translation:

---

This is called the Boundless, universally delivering the infinite. There are secret celestial texts, revered by all heavens. Those who leak them arrogantly fall into hell, with calamity extending to seven generations of ancestors.

The Dao states: These two chapters are the hidden melodies of the Celestial Emperors and the Perfected Immortal Kings, the mysteries of yin-yang separation and union, the mechanisms of the Five Phases’ transformative embodiment. They initiate the creation of heaven, earth, and the Three Realms, dissecting the primordial chaos—all are the words of the Great Brahma, not the common speech of the mundane world. Their words lack ornate beauty, their melodies lack florid grace; thus, they are called profound and obscure, difficult to fathom in detail. Treasured by the heavens, they are concealed in the Divine Empyrean’s Jade Clarity King’s Mansion, within the Eastern Florescence Scripture Chamber. After passing through countless *ren-chen* years, they are transmitted downward according to the Mysterious Regulations. If a perfected person offers gold and treasures with a sincere heart, following the old protocols to petition and ally with the Perfected Kings, only then are they bestowed.

The Dao states: The revolutions of heaven and earth also have their ends. The sun, moon, and five planets also wax and wane. Even the most sagely and divine persons have their periods of decline. Those of shallow learning may also suffer illness and harm—all are manifestations of yin-yang separation and union, the transformations of embodied qi. Whenever such disasters occur, all of shared qi must unite in heart to perform purification rites, burn incense in the six periods, and recite the scriptures ten times. Blessings and virtue will descend at once, dissolving all inauspiciousness. The boundless texts universally deliver the infinite.

The Dao states: Those of shallow learning in the Dao, whose immortal ranks are not yet full, when their destined time of passing arrives and their bodies enter the Great Yin, at the moment of transition, their fellow perfected students should burn incense for them and recite the scriptures ten times. By thus delivering the corpse-form according to the method, the soul-spirit will ascend directly to the Southern Palace. According to the merit of their studies, they will be reborn after a calculated number of days. No longer confused by the cycles of rebirth, they will attain the rank of divine immortals.

The Dao states: When the revolutions of heaven and earth reach their end, the stellar lodges fall into disorder, the sun and moon lose their light, the four seasons lose their order, yin and yang fall out of harmony, the imperial domains suffer floods and droughts, pestilential toxins spread, and the multitudes perish. When teachers and friends pass away, these are the transformations of yin-yang and the Five Phases’ separation and union. In such times, all must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures. The merit of purification rites and scripture recitation is exceedingly weighty. Above, they dissolve celestial disasters and protect the emperor; below, they dispel poisonous harms and deliver the multitudes. Both the living and the dead rely upon them, their blessings immeasurable. Thus, it is said: boundless, universally delivering heaven and humanity.

The Dao states: Whoever possesses these scriptures and performs these meritorious deeds for the Celestial Thearchs, the earthly rulers, and the multitudes—on days of disaster, if they resolve in their hearts to perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures ten times—all the heavens will record their names, and the myriad spirits will attend and protect them. Those who distinguish themselves as perfected persons will be able to become ministers of the Golden Watchtower of the Sagely Lord. The heavens record the merits and transgressions of people without the slightest error. The Perfected Kings of the heavens will also protect and recommend them. Those who attain the Dao will then thoroughly comprehend these ultimate words.

The Dao speaks: Within these heavens lie the hidden words of the Great Brahmā, the boundless sounds. The primordial script of the Northern Dipper’s primal chief and the Southern Dipper’s Celestial Winnowing Basket enacts yin and yang, revolves and steers the Five Phases, stabilizes the Three Realms within the primordial chaos, and establishes the mysterious mechanism in the Great Clarity. Through separation and union, their Dao is exchanged; through water and fire, their numinous power flourishes. They govern and gather all beings, forging alliances with the perfected. Through endless kalpas, they never wane, and they present themselves at the Dark Emperor’s mystic court. Each character spans a full *zhang* in breadth.

In ancient times, the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign inscribed these words to serve as the correct intonation. Those who know these sounds and can purify themselves in fasting to recite them will have the flying heavenly spirit-kings of all heavens descend to observe their person, record their merits and diligence, and report them to the heavens. The myriad spirits will pay homage, earth deities will stand at their gates, and the great merit-perfected kings will safeguard and recommend them to the Divine Empyrean. Once their Dao is complete, they may traverse the Three Realms and ascend through the Golden Gate.

These sounds repel all harm, dispel all misfortune, deliver all beings, and accomplish all ends—they are the spontaneous sounds of the Heavenly Perfected. Thus, reciting them summons the descent of flying heavens to observe, the Celestial Thearch to chant from afar, and the myriad spirits to pay homage. The Three Realms attend their chariots, all demonic forces bow their heads, ghostly essences vanish of themselves, and the chiming of jade-like tones resounds. The ten directions grow solemn and clear, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks swallow their mists, and the myriad spirits tremble in submission. They summon and gather the host of immortals, the heavens become free of impurity, the earth is cleansed of demonic dust, dark wisdom illumines the pure, and the vastness of the mysterious deepens into profundity.

The Dao speaks: Long ago in the Azure Spirit Heaven, the Great Cloud-Sprout hymned the fertile soil of life, receiving from the Primordial Beginning the *Limitless Upper Chapters of Salvation* of the Mulberry and Azure Yang. As the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning was about to expound this scripture, he circled ten times to summon the ten directions. At the first recitation, the Heavenly Perfected, the Great Spirits, the Lofty and Venerable, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Great Emperor of the Mulberry, the Azure Radiance Emperor, the Azure Yang Treasure-Luster Wood Sovereign, the Nine Qi Upper Perfected Dao Lords, the Heavenly Officials and their retinues, the Perfected Immortals and True Persons—an innumerable host—rode the void and arrived. Jeweled clouds veiled the azure firmament, purple mists layered thick, jade-green chariots and eight-perfected flying palanquins advanced, canopies of precious foliage cast their shade, numinous radiance scattered across the sky, and seven-hued vapors blazed through the high heavens.

For nine days and nine nights, the sun, moon, and stars of all heavens halted their courses, the Five Wefts unfurled their light, the celestial scriptures flowed in order, the primordial net stilled, the Three Paths grew clear and level, streaming brilliance bound the passes, the Seven Luminaries blazed forth, and throughout the land—mountains, rivers, forests, and groves—all lay smooth and even, no longer high or low. The earth glistened with jade-like moisture, its hues undifferentiated.

The host of Perfected attended the throne as the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning sat in profound stillness upon a floating seat of azure unicorn, jade terrace, and sea-light treasure clouds. With the first recitation of the scripture, the Great Sages of all heavens voiced their approval in unison. At that moment, the men and women of the land saw their myriad evils dissolve, silently aligning with the True Dao.

With the second recitation, flowing essence descended into their bodies, fortifying the myriad spirits.
With the third, the five viscera bloomed with radiance, forever free of the hundred ailments.
With the fourth, golden light transformed their bones, and jade splendor refined their forms.
With the fifth, their entire beings grew empty and luminous, soaring and roaming at will.
With the sixth, their transformations spanned the Eight Extremes, universally delivering the ten directions.
With the seventh, the nether courts ceased their judgments, and they advanced to join the ranks of True Immortals.
With the eighth, the Primordial Elders and Five Emperors intoned wondrous sounds, and all heavenly beings came to know the Cloud-Sprout.
With the ninth, the heavens and earth manifested auspicious signs.
With the tenth, withered bones revived, returning to life and restoring their original destiny.

At that time, every man and woman in the land turned their hearts in devotion, all received protection and deliverance, and each attained longevity.

The Dao speaks: When the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning recited the scripture once, the Boundless and Limitless Vast-Life Great Spirits of the East, an innumerable host, arrived upon the void.
With the second recitation, the Boundless and Limitless Luminous Radiance Great Spirits of the South, an innumerable host, arrived upon the void.
With the third, the Boundless and Limitless Resplendent Purity Great Spirits of the West, an innumerable host, arrived upon the void.
With the fourth, the Boundless and Limitless Mysterious Transformation Great Spirits of the North, an innumerable host, arrived upon the void.
With the fifth, the Boundless and Limitless Numinous Brilliance Great Spirits of the Northeast, an innumerable host, arrived upon the void.
With the sixth, the Boundless and Limitless Blended Harmony Great Spirits of the Southeast, an innumerable host, arrived upon the void.
With the seventh, the Boundless and Limitless Stabilizing Peace Great Spirits of the Southwest, an innumerable host, arrived upon the void.
With the eighth, the Boundless and Limitless Returning Wind Great Spirits of the Northwest, an innumerable host, arrived upon the void.
With the ninth, the Boundless and Limitless Pure Virtue Great Spirits of the Above, an innumerable host, arrived upon the void.
With the tenth, the Boundless and Limitless Assisting Transformation Great Spirits of the Below, an innumerable host, arrived upon the void.

When the ten recitations were complete, the Boundless Heavenly Perfected of the Ten Directions and the Azure Yang Radiant Luminaries arrived as one. The men and women of the land turned their hearts in reverence. Each offered celestial treasure flowers, dragon incense, and a hundred fruits in respectful veneration. Those who came were like clouds or flying mists—an innumerable host—advancing until half the land had sunken, an unstoppable force.

Then the Primordial Beginning suspended a single treasure pearl, vast as a bright star, in the great void, nine *zhang* above the earth. The Celestial Worthy ascended, leading the Heavenly Perfected, the Great Spirits, the Lofty and Venerable, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Boundless Azure Yang Great Spirits of the Ten Directions, and the innumerable host—all entered the treasure pearl. Gazing upward, the heavenly beings saw only a surging throng pouring into the pearl’s mouth. Once inside, their whereabouts were unknown. The people of the land dispersed, and the earth returned to levelness, no longer slanted or sunken.

Within the treasure pearl, the Celestial Worthy completed the full recitation of the scripture. The host of Perfected oversaw the deliverance and transmitted it to me. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words. The ritual matters concluded, the heavens returned to their stations, and in an instant, all fell silent without a trace.

At that time, the heavenly beings who encountered the scripture’s teachings were universally saved, their allotted years preserved, free from harm. The entire land turned in reverence, all venerating the Lofty Perfected. They merged with the radiant, merged with the wondrous, merged with qi, merged with spirit, merged with the primordial, merged with the original, merged with wisdom, merged with the numinous, merged with transformation, merged with change, merged with nature, merged with luminosity. Their hearts aligned with the Lofty Sages, their conduct flowing as a model. The Azure Yang descended into their bodies, and the Cloud-Sprout flourished. The twin brilliances refined them, the True Dao was perfected, the scripture’s teachings spread, and the entire land looked to its guidance. All poured forth their utmost sincerity, safeguarding life and preserving their essence, each attaining deliverance across the ages.

The Dao speaks: The names spoken by the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning in the recitation of this scripture are the inner appellations of the Heavenly Thearchs, the hidden rhymes of sound, the inner taboos of the True Kings, and the concealed names of the hundred spirits. Proclaiming the Mulberry Emperor’s Radiant Mountain, it connects below to the Azure Yang qi of the Great Abyss, entwining the Nine Firmaments with a perfect radiance of true light spanning three hundred thousand *li*. Those who draw upon its radiance become Immortal Ministers; those who revere its splendor become Supreme Perfected. The ninefold crimson mists ferry the Three Spirits across, jade and jasper transform their essences, and precious blossoms unfold in profusion—words beyond the common speech of the world.

The perfected of highest sagacity, having attained the status of True Person, penetrate the mysterious and fathom the subtle. Those who master its verses and recite them ten times refine their spirits in the Mulberry’s crucible, where the radiance of Yang’s blossom naturally forms. Precious luminosity blazes forth, and great fortune arrives in full. The Dao of the highest sagacity races to embrace the five celestial bodies; wondrous qi merges with the formless. They ascend in flight to the Jade Capital, all demonic forces submit and vanish, great demons bind their forms, the dead return to life, and white bones become human again.

For scholars of utmost devotion who recite it ten times, green-robed attendants present the scripture, the Great Cinnabar emits its splendor, and they contain the radiance and float upon the light. Heavenly spirits open the gates, the Eastern Pole bestows its seal, and the myriad qi converge as one. They deliver and ferry all beings, roaming through the Grand Tenuity. The reason for this is that the Mulberry is the essence born of Kunlun’s jade, and the Azure Yang is the qi of the Nine Blossoms of longevity. It reverses the years and averts calamity, bestowing upon you the Dao of the Primordial Elder Thearch.

The spirits of dragon mist stretch and coil, shaking the celestial walls; the liver’s leaves unfold like jade, and purple mist fills the gateways. Those who know this Dao ascend as ranked immortals, their complexions renewed to that of an infant. They transform like divine springs, eternally preserving life’s subtlety, merging with qi to extend their years. They penetrate the true and reach the numinous, receiving boundless blessings. Those who recite this chapter lightly bring misfortune upon themselves. Those who honor and revere it see their households flourish, their generations prosper, and their good karmic connections endure. Ten thousand disasters will not touch them, and divine spirits guard their gates.

This scripture is supremely wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital. It delivers countless beings and is the root of the ten thousand Dao. Its majestic and vast model is a virtue too great to surpass.

Dao speaks: Whenever this scripture is recited ten times, all the heavens assemble. The Azure Prime High Thearch, the luminous essence of the Nine Blossoms, the Mulberry Thearch’s Green Jade Pavilion, and the Heavenly Treasure Palace of Lesser Yang’s Azure Jasper—all issue decrees. The Phoenix Radiance Jade Maidens bear the Great Mystery’s Luminous Azure True Talismans, and they command the Nine Dark Prisons of the Yellow Springs’ subterranean courts to summon the spirits of Azure Yang. Those who escape death and receive life, the host of spirits of Great Yang, ascend with the light. The nine generations of ancestral souls in the netherworld are delivered and ascend in flight. After nine years of refinement, they receive transformation and rebirth, becoming noble persons. Those who diligently study this scripture, their merit complete and virtue perfected, all attain divine transcendence, ascending in flight to the Jade Treasury to feast in the Square Cauldrons below.

For scholars of high learning who cultivate and recite this scripture, Azure Yang enters the body, jade essence transforms within, and the Flowing Radiance of the Primal Efflorescence circulates. The Majestic Luminosity wields its battle-axe, severing the roots of the corpse. All immediately receive deliverance, ascending in flight to the Jade Clarity.

When the people of the world recite it, their chambers become resplendent with jade and jasper, crimson fires gleam like pearl pendants, and the Yang Perfected respond. Cinnabar transforms into purple chambers, the Dao of life continues their destiny, and ten thousand buds diffuse their fragrance. They preserve the jade-like sweetness, the six palaces bear crimson script, and the Five Ladles adorn their breasts. They sit enthroned upon the Demon-Subduing Star, guarding its power.

This scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally delivering without limit. All heavenly and human beings receive its blessings. Boundless fortune bestows grace upon life and death. Treasured by the heavens above, it is not transmitted to the lower world. Only the most devoted scholars, offering gold and treasures to express their sincerity, may swear celestial oaths to transmit it. Those who lightly disclose or disdain it bring calamity upon their nine generations, condemned to eternal servitude under the netherworld officials.

Twelve Jade Lads of the Beginning Yang and twelve Vermilion Radiance Jade Maidens attend the scripture, safeguarding its jade-like script and protecting the bodies of those who receive it.

Dao speaks: During the long fast of the first month, recite and chant this scripture. The Mulberry’s branches hang low, Azure Yang scatters its blossoms, and the qi of life transforms the dark. The torments of the netherworld cease, allowing the souls of past generations, severed from earthly bonds and freed from servitude, to ascend to the Southern Palace.

During the long fast of the seventh month, recite and chant this scripture. The Square Cauldrons descend the true, and Azure Blossom summons the spirits. The body attains divine transcendence, and the names of all heavens are inscribed on yellow registers and white tablets, erasing death and inscribing life.

During the long fast of the tenth month, recite and chant this scripture. The Eastern Radiance preserves life, the Yang Valley opens and forms. The Eight Passes reveal their mysteries, and the Nine Qi unfold in completion. They become kings, emperors, and lords, their ministers, fathers, and sons. The nation is peacefully governed, the celestial mandate preserved, and the throne endures through generations without end. They perpetually reign as sovereigns, peacefully governing their lands, where the people delight in great peace.

On the days of the eight solar nodes, recite and chant this scripture. The Celestial Mountain connects with its radiance, the Jade Ultimate extends longevity, and one becomes a True Person of the Lower Primordial.

On one’s natal day, recite and chant this scripture. The Great Unity descends, the Azure Thearch oversees the covenant. Externally, the mysterious qi circulates; internally, the Three Infants are nurtured. The hun and shen become pure and upright, and the myriad qi endure forever. They avoid suffering and affliction, their bodies radiant with light. The Three Realms attend and guard them, the Five Thearchs receive and welcome them, and the ten thousand spirits pay homage. Their names are inscribed in the heavens above. With merit complete and virtue perfected, they ascend in flight to the Highest Clarity.

Dao speaks: On the days of practicing the Dao, one must bathe in fragrant waters, fast, and enter the chamber. Facing east, knock the teeth thirty-two times to ascend through the thirty-two heavens. Bow thirty-two times with the heart, close the eyes, and silently visualize the body seated amidst the Nine Yang’s azure clouds. Within and without, all is dark and lush. A green dragon, white tiger, vermilion bird, dark warrior, lion, and white crane array themselves to the left and right. The sun and moon shine brightly, illuminating the chamber within. A circular image forms above the head, its light radiating in the ten directions—all must be vividly clear.

Recite the secret incantation:
*"Supreme Mystery and Primordial, Most High Dao Lord. Summon forth from within my body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the left and right official messengers, the jade lads attending incense, the jade maidens transmitting words, the Five Thearchs’ direct talismans, and the incense officials of the day—thirty-two each—to open and convey my words. Today is an auspicious and joyous occasion, a long fast in the pure hall, cultivating the supreme scripture to deliver countless beings. May what I declare ascend directly to the presence of the Most High Primordial Thearch before the throne of the thirty-two heavens."*

Conclude by drawing qi thirty-two times, then face east and recite the scripture.

*The Primordial Beginning’s Wondrous Scripture of the Upper Grade for Delivering Countless Beings*
*The Primordial Beginning’s Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Root Chapter*
*Mulberry Azure Yang, Nine Blossoms Upper Grade*
*Transforming qi to deliver beings, the Primordial Crystal’s hidden rhymes*
*Correctly moving with spontaneity, the Eastern Pole’s Azure Perfected*
*The Mysterious Pass transforms the spirit, the Nine Rays’ Jade Azure*
*Illuminating the Yang Gate, the Great Non-Being’s Supreme Kalpa*

The Eight Numinous Spirits transform and give birth, the Azure Palace is first established. The Fusang tree rises a hundred million fathoms high, where coiling dragons intertwine. Jiaoli jade coils and twines, the essence of Azure Yang, ascending to become the Year Star, illuminating the verdant radiance. This is the root of Heaven, below it becomes Azure Florescence, the Jade Palace of Fangzhu, above it has no further origin. Coeternal with the Dao, the true qi of the Jade Enclosure, it divides into sacred script, securely anchoring the Eastern Quarter. Mysterious transformations pure in benevolence, drawing forth resplendent rays, knotting luminous clarity, where hidden mushrooms spontaneously grow. Jade marrow and golden sinews, azure talismans unfold vastness, universally planting divine script.

No script fails to spread, no script fails to penetrate, no script fails to establish, no script fails to exalt, no script fails to transform, no script fails to elevate—this is the utmost subtlety. The palace amidst Heaven, of jasper and jade, a net of jewels, the Dragon Mountain’s unyielding peaks. Ascending to the utmost height, its radiance encircles the lofty vault, a boundless transforming city, securely anchoring the Great Void.

Azure Florescence departs and convenes, divine transformations of the Nine Dragons. Golden towers and yellow chambers, an array of purity and brilliance, the divine qi of the Divine Empyrean pervades the celestial capital. Within it dwells the immortal-delivering deity of deathlessness; within it dwells the Azure Youth Dao Lord of Fangzhu; within it dwells the Southern Culmen Lord of Longevity; within it dwells the Eastern Culmen Azure Florescence Thearch; within it dwells the Radiance-Gathering, Light-Drawing, World-Delivering Marshal Great Deity; within it dwells the Life-Cherishing Venerable Lord Han; within it dwell the exalted deities of the Southern Supreme, the Life-Recording Bureau, the Longevity-Extending and Fate-Delivering Register.

They restore bones and raise the dead, delivering countless beings. Today, the celestial records are examined, as the hosts of Heaven descend in audience. The Eastern Infinite Flying Celestial Azure Talisman Divine King, the Great Sage of Longevity, the Boundless Deliverer of Beings. The Southern Infinite Flying Celestial Azure Qi Divine King, the Great Sage of Longevity, the Boundless Deliverer of Beings. The Western Infinite Flying Celestial Azure Flame Divine King, the Great Sage of Longevity, the Boundless Deliverer of Beings. The Northern Infinite Flying Celestial Azure Spirit Divine King, the Great Sage of Longevity, the Boundless Deliverer of Beings. The Northeastern Infinite Flying Celestial Azure Void Divine King, the Great Sage of Longevity, the Boundless Deliverer of Beings. The Southeastern Infinite Flying Celestial Azure Yang Divine King, the Great Sage of Longevity, the Boundless Deliverer of Beings. The Southwestern Infinite Flying Celestial Azure Fortune Divine King, the Great Sage of Longevity, the Boundless Deliverer of Beings. The Northwestern Infinite Flying Celestial Azure Thearch Divine King, the Great Sage of Longevity, the Boundless Deliverer of Beings. The Upper Infinite Flying Celestial Azure Radiance Divine King, the Great Sage of Longevity, the Boundless Deliverer of Beings. The Lower Infinite Flying Celestial Azure Sprout Divine King, the Great Sage of Longevity, the Boundless Deliverer of Beings.

The perfected divine kings of the Ten Directions, the flying celestial deities, the great gods of longevity and world-deliverance, all ride upon flying chariots of azure light, drawn by carriages of azure pearls and jade-green luster. Green canopies and dark wheels, paired with cinnabar phoenixes, nine-headed azure dragons bearing banners of flowing rosy clouds, broad life-bestowing pennants. Before them, the concordant performance of cavernous scriptures; behind them, the harmonious chanting of jade hymns. White phoenixes and qilin sing in unison, azure spirits open the path. The Year’s Radiance flanks the axle-tree, a hundred million chariots and ten thousand riders arrive floating through the void. Their luminous return illuminates the path as they oversee the deliverance of beings.

The Eastern Culmen’s Prime Minister, the Divine Palace of Yang Valley, the Thearch’s Controller of the Mysterious Unity, the Great Deity of the Nine Qi, guides the descent of azure essence, its light illuminating the Eight Darknesses. Azure mists scatter and fly, the Three and Five move in harmony. Bones generate golden radiance, their brilliance reflecting upon jasper blossoms. The Azure Thearch receives the scriptures, the ranks of immortals and perfected take their places. They examine and determine the multitude of classes, distinguishing the hosts of spirits, holding registers and grasping ledgers, all arrive at the Mysterious Court. According to those who ought to be delivered, they strictly examine the Pure Capital, universally proclaiming to the Ten Poles, the distant and boundless heights.

The transforming abyss’s mansion, the numinous dwelling of Northern Lang, the Gate Wind and Kunlun’s hills, the jade terrace and thearch’s ruins. Extending down to the Cold Pool, the long night’s hidden bolts, they deliver and uplift ancestors, severing evil roots. No lingering restraints remain, and all attain transcendence. The Azure Palace’s talismanic mandate flies without cease, the divine peaks of Yu Luo open to guard body and soul. Great demons oversee the examination, delivering ranks to the Vermilion Mound. Dead souls refine their qi, transforming decay into living beings. Those who receive deliverance in life endure through kalpas, revolving with the ages, their years equaling Heaven’s. They forever transcend the Three Calamities and Eight Adversities, the Nine Perils and Five Sufferings, rising beyond the Three Realms, roaming freely in the Nine Purities.

In the Nine Pure Heavens, the Heavenly Thearch ensures peace, the formless realm of Brahman conduct.

The Thirty-Two Heavens. The Thirty-Two Thearchs. The mysteries of the Heavens are concealed, the names of the Heavens are hidden. Within the Heavens is emptiness and cavernous space, the natural numinous scriptures, the hidden rhymes of the Heavens.

The sound of the Green Yang. The honor of the Green Yang. The spirit of the Green Yang, the Green Yang’s misty crystal. The numen of the Green Yang. The Nine Qi and Ten Flowers transform into the Upper Clarity, boundless mysteries. Profound and beyond full comprehension, they spread forth the divine perfected, universally delivering heaven and humanity.

Today, joyously celebrating the reception of deliverance, passing through the celestial passes of Xu Tian, the Nine Wooden Perfected of Mu Zhen lean upon the Fusang staff. The wondrous numen gathers qi, forming the Green Yang. The Green Yang’s flying essence ascends as azure light. The great circle illuminates the void, a hundred million qi as its measure. Benevolent virtue reaches downward. Blessings bestow upon the sagely lord. Universally covering the cosmos, transforming and giving life to spirits, the divine immortals and dragon spirits. Perfectly responding to the utmost numinous.

Harmonizing and radiant, compassionate and forgiving, subtly wondrous and manifestly bright, those who study above feel the numinous, gazing upward to savor the essence of Heaven. Divine light flows downward, bones like jade and countenance like gold. They ascend the divine clouds by strategy, donning robes adorned with woven patterns. Delivering from suffering and aiding the distressed, they shake and protect the living people. They beseech the eradication of the Three Evils, severing the roots of the earth.

The Fusang tree emits blossoms, its coiled branches scattering petals, jade-green leaves by the myriad. Azure clouds in a thousand layers. Above, the numinous treasures are born. Purple light and cinnabar clusters, nine rays entwining the void, blazing radiance in the eastern dawn. Distant thoughts of the green chariot, dragon banners in profusion, green qi like a bowstring, drawing forth the hues of the mysterious twilight.

Washing the marrow and refining the spirit, galloping through the jade fluids, flying through the Nine Gates, opening wide the Eight Doors. The perfected descend to oversee and raise, arraying and proclaiming to the primordial perfected. The Eastern Dipper descends yang, the Western Dipper shines brightness, the Northern Dipper’s dark vastness, the Southern Dipper’s radiant brilliance, the Central Dipper benefits life, together embracing the ten thousand spirits.

Green Florescence initiates splendor, luminous fragrance awakens nature. Cinnabar buds support and guard, dark fluids preserve life. Yellow blossoms penetrate the center, universally enacting the teachings and commands. The Great Thearch of the Azure Net establishes great peace in the Three Realms. The Upper Perfected of the Azure Origin, green qi from the eastern mulberry. The Upper Perfected of the Cinnabar Origin, refining jade and vermilion light. The Upper Perfected of the White Origin, luminous fragrance flowing forth. The Upper Perfected of the Dark Origin, the twin gates upholding the essentials. The Upper Perfected of the Central Origin, seated and guarding the Hall of Light.

The Five Origins’ utmost spirits, the perfected of the upper realms, containing fragrance and embracing dew, intertwining the twin canopies. Flying dragons ascend high, falling phoenixes soar among the stars, governing the spirits and demons, the ancestors of the ten thousand spirits. Flying through the Three Paths, commanding the immortal soldiers, demonic banners and drummed rhythms, roaming and observing the Nine Clarities. Self-proclaimed resplendent, the Heavens unite in merit, transforming the people above. Sternly governing the Feng and Ying.

The Perfected Kings receive their mandate, universally sweeping away the pernicious and inauspicious. The Earl of Hua descends with crystal, dragon radiance wielding the blade. Great cinnabar flows like clouds, majestic transformation without bounds. Divine marshals hurl fire, flying smoke for ten thousand miles. Golden bells strike forth, jade halberds hang in eight directions. Whoever dares to test them, defying the lofty immortals. The dark battle-axe executes in front, divine metal punishes behind, slaughtering and dissecting the pernicious and reckless, surging and stirring without cease.

Severing a thousand thousand heads, shearing ten thousand ten thousand forms. Demons dare not trespass, ghosts have no pernicious essence. The Three Offices and Nine Bureaus clearly investigate the demonic camps, permitting no concealment. Jade horses cross and present. Universally proclaimed without direction, the ten thousand classes all listen. The Five Thearchs of the Three Realms array their words to the Upper Clarity.

The Primordial Cavernous Jade Calendar, the easternmost Fusang. Before the Five Kalpas opened, the Green Yang was first distinguished. Yang’s blossoms arose, the Three Origins’ guiding principles. Born to become divine immortals, the pivot of the Dao already extended. Shocking and awakening, the Dragon Han extended its peace. In the distant and boundless kalpas, within the primordial chaos, green manifested as color, yang fell and formed the abyss. Wind became the spirit of wood, marsh became the origin of wood. Wind and marsh interpenetrated the void, metal and stone congealed the heavens. Above the heavens and below the heavens, the great transformation is obscure.

Yang’s light vast and boundless, without limit and without name. The vast and chaotic Great Dao, expansive and without light. Cinnabar radiance initiated the chart, the movements naturally measured. Green Florescence peacefully guarded, the green proclamations of jade chapters. Red writings of jade characters, the Nine Qi’s dragon script, preserving and controlling the kalpic movements, causing the heavens to endure forever.

Brahma qi pervaded the net, the ten thousand patterns opened and extended. The Wooden Perfected flowed and evolved, the Four Nets and all heavens. The revolving guiding principles, boundless cycles of deliverance. The turning horns and passing smiles, the resplendent Dipper’s chariot. Flanking and assisting the celestial scriptures, transforming the Five Thearchs.

The Jade City’s Nine Gates, the Green Thearch of the eastern quarter. Thirty-five divisions, gathering qi into the Upper Origin. The Eight Sceneries darkly unite, qi enters the mysterious and profound. Within the mysterious is the Great August, the jade ultimate and immortal perfected. Riding the scenery and pacing the void, descending to illuminate the mulberry groves. A thousand perfected together assemble in the Thearch’s court, drinking and eating of the Green Yang. Through profound kalpas and deep sinkings, floating scenery entwining the clouds, chanting and intoning the cavernous scriptures.

The golden perfected, bright and elegant, flowing echoes in the cloud palaces. Numinous sounds transform the scenery, blending and returning with the wind. The Great Void’s dense subtlety, assisting and winging the mysterious emptiness.

The Green Yang enters the liver, the Azure Jade Mountain. Within is the Youthful Lad, clad in brocade robes and fine caps, holding the celestial keys, blowing and exhaling through the hundred gates. Internally communicating with the realms. Feeling and responding, donning orchid, white pearls strung in rows, flowing through the Three Fields. Beating the bellows and inhaling harmony, resplendently forming the cinnabar. A thousand harmonies and ten thousand unions, naturally becoming perfected.

The perfected is the Green Yang, within yang is the spirit. The Great Lord of Longevity, the Radiant Yuan Lord’s son. The vast and crystalline honored spirit. The Square Reservoirs’ Controller of Destiny, the Yang Valley’s harmonious extension, holding talismans and grasping registers, preserving life and rooting existence. Ascending through the Nine Clarities, entering and exiting the jade chambers. Within the Eight Passes, amid the subtle and minute, descending to guard the human body.

The jade towers and crimson palaces, centrally governing the Five Qi, blending the hundred spirits. Ten revolutions return the numen, uniting with qi to become immortal. The immortal path values life, the azure enclosure delivers humanity.

The Nine Gates open above, a great wheel of azure light. It governs the celestial administration, subjugates ghosts and spirits below, and presides over the people in the middle, determining the karmic causes of sin and fortune. Universally receiving deliverance, the dead souls are reborn in bodies, and having received life, they ascend to be heard by the various heavens.

Above the various heavens, each has its Gate of Life. Within lies the *Green Mulberry Cloud-Leaf*, the spontaneous *Azure Yang Hollow Melody*, the *True King’s Numinous Scroll*, its verses harmonizing with the lofty perfected. The first: *The Flying Song of Fusang across the Azure Sea*

Jade Capital and Emerald Metropolis, linked below to the Azure Abyss.
Radiant rosy clouds in millions, the Nine Mysteries of Azure Yang.
Cold waves surge and overflow, the green expanse of Fusang.
Together they grow ten thousand fathoms, the divine wind transforming the net.
Leaves reflect the azure void, within are concealed the dragon scripts.
Singing in the void forms rhythm, branches dance with soaring luan birds.
Primal essence entwines in gauze, green blossoms and jade pendants.
Forests dense as clouds, within dwell the highest perfected.
Precious crowns towering, feathered skirts of intertwining dragons.
Their title: the Supreme Emperor, the Venerable of Fusang.
Wu Ying and Bo Hua, the nine-souled dragon embryo.
They preside over the ultimate teachings, refining the five forms.
A thousand transformations, ten thousand changes, the eight paths raise their banners.
They inscribe my supreme model, recording names in the Square Reservoirs.

The second: *The True King’s Chapter of Azure Yang’s Precious Radiance*

Fusang’s interwoven branches stand side by side.
Touching clouds, dragons ascend; pressing waves, thunder rises.
Coiling roots stretch sinuously, connecting a thousand miles of bends.
The great spirit of the Azure Palace, the Supreme Unity’s primordial honored one.
Azure rosy clouds layered, the Dark Elder of the Mysterious Phase.
The Three Realms look up to its virtue, the Nine Lands receive its grace.
The perfected of the Mulberry Forest, whose qi is named Azure Yang.
Ascending to the divine heavens, knotting blossoms in the purple chambers.
Precious radiance blazing, overturning the cinnabar-transformed realm.
Illuminating below the myriad heavens, boundless majesty and light.
Nurturing the ranked sages, flying deliverance to extend well-being.
Looking up to draw in divine rosy clouds, weaving through the heavens as constant principles.
Awakening to this, one attains the Dao of life; those who comprehend commune with the divine.
Chanting the *Azure Yang Chapter*, the Nine Heavens bow to the cloud wheel.

The third: *The Hymn of the Azure Flower Emperor Lord of the Eastern Ultimate* sings:

A precious mountain stands in the southeast, above lies the True King’s palace.
Its roots coil through the vast void, gazing down into the Nine Empyreans.
Within are arrayed the various spirit offices, governing the billions of heavenly lineages.
The primal heir assists the Supreme Emperor, commanding and reviving the true wind.
Observing below the Round Net, riding a chariot of flying celestial dragons.
The Ten Ultimates hold to the primal transformation, the Great Demon serves as examiner.
Subduing the armies of the Six Heavens, ensuring the Dao’s eternal flourishing.
Flying petitions request jade decrees, dark talismans absolve Fengdu’s netherworld.
Great compassion pities the long night, halting the Five Sufferings.
With me, it shares the same qi, soaring freely in the Crimson Clarity.
Transformations without bound, universally delivering the heavens’ people.
Why delight in fleeting pleasures, wearying the spirit with desires?
Not learning the supreme true Dao, passing years in vain sorrow.
I now sing this hymn, its pure tones moving the mysterious ones.

Above the Three Realms, amid the flying void, the True King’s song, its sounds harmonizing with the cavernous hymns. Reciting it a hundred times, one’s name is registered in the Southern Palace. Reciting it a thousand times, the True King protects and welcomes. Ten thousand recitations complete the Dao, soaring to the Great Void, transcending the Three Realms, and ascending to the rank of Immortal Duke. Hearing the numinous sound, the True King summons the spirits, commands the earth deities, and provides escort and reception. Drawn from the earthly prison, freed from the Five Sufferings and Eight Difficulties, seven generations of ancestors ascend, forever leaving the dark mountains. The soul crosses the Vermilion Mound, undergoes refinement, and is reborn. This is called boundless, universally delivering without end.

There are secret celestial texts, revered by all the heavens. Revealing them carelessly casts one into hell, bringing calamity to seven generations of ancestors. The Dao states: These two chapters are the hidden sounds of the Celestial Emperor and the various numinous True Kings, revealing the Fusang Mountain and its vast immortal realm. This mountain spans ten thousand *li* on each side, located east of the Azure Sea, ninety thousand *li* from the Middle Kingdom. Above, it connects to the Five Offices of the Divine Empyrean, within a hundred million *li*, where the Great True King, the Fusang Supreme Emperor, the Azure Lad Dao Lord of the Square Reservoirs, and the detached palace of the Azure Flower Emperor of the Eastern Ultimate reside.

The mountain bears a giant mulberry, yellow within and red without. Its flowers, when eaten, bestow longevity; its sap, like jade syrup, grants a thousand kalpas of life when consumed. Refined into elixir and ingested, it makes one a lofty perfected. Its roots draw the jade essence from the Jade Capital and Kunlun Mountains, gestating within the mulberry to produce jade ore below, like the pine roots of the world that bear *fuling*. The *fuling* grows for a thousand years, gaining numinous efficacy. Beneath Fusang lies jade ore, warm and lustrously beautiful, capable of commanding phoenixes to alight upon it. Below, jade forms incompletely, congealing into flowing liquid. Consuming it transforms one into an infant, with a lifespan equal to heaven and earth.

Above Fusang, there are spirit chickens, luan birds, and nine-colored phoenixes. At dawn, they ascend the *Ruomu* tree, while the golden crow flies upon the mulberry—this is the sun rising from Yang Valley. At Fusang’s summit, there is a qi named Azure Yang, which above becomes Jupiter. Its light illuminates three hundred thousand *li*, with a diameter of a hundred *li*. It completes one celestial circuit in twelve years, appearing and disappearing every 399 days. Over eighty-three years and seventy-six appearances, it completes seven celestial circuits. Within it, there are stellar emperors, empresses, consorts, officials, and attendants, with the Wood Sovereign as their ruler.

Cultivating this Dao, the Primal Cinnabar and Supreme Unity practice exhaling and inhaling the azure qi. The Supreme Heavenly Honored One bestows upon the practitioner the Azure Talisman. The Duke of Wu Ying drinks the azure essence with the practitioner. The Dragon Smoke Elder and the Mighty Alliance Perfected receive the practitioner’s Eastern True Script, ascending eastward with the Azure Yang. The subtle and wondrous tones are all the words of the Great Brahma, not the common speech of the world. Their words lack ornate beauty, their melodies lack florid grace—thus they are called profound and obscure, difficult to fathom in detail.

The heavens treasure them, secreting them in the Eastern Repository of the Jade Capital’s Highest Divine Empyrean Jade Treasury. According to the regulations, they are transmitted downward every thirty-seven thousand years when the time is ripe. If a perfected one offers gold and treasures with a sincere heart, following the old protocols to pledge allegiance to the Ten Heavens, they may then be bestowed.

The Dao speaks: The Azure Yang is the power that generates blessings, upon which all beings with form depend. When the revolutions of heaven and earth reach their end, when the sun, moon, and five planets wane and wax, when the most sagely and divine ones prosper or decline, and when those of shallow learning suffer harm—whenever such calamities arise, all of like qi must unite in heart to perform purification rites, burn incense in the six periods, and recite the scriptures ten times over. Then virtue and blessings will descend at once, dissolving all inauspiciousness. The boundless scriptures universally deliver the limitless.

The Dao speaks: When those of shallow learning in the Dao have not yet fulfilled their immortal rank and the time comes for their dissolution, their bodies pass through the Great Yin. At the hour of their passing, fellow perfected ones of the same learning burn incense and recite the scriptures ten times to deliver the corpse-form according to the proper method. Then the Azure Florescence Emperor of the Eastern Ultimate bestows the Talisman of Pervading Radiance, summoning the qi of the Azure Yang. In the Palace of the Peerless, the Primordial Azure Essence of the Great Mystery flows forth, entering the liver-residence of the practitioner. The Gate of Death is sealed, the Wood Sovereign roams within, and the Luminous Elder opens the Purple Orchid Chamber for the practitioner, unfastening the Azure Pearl Seal. There, the practitioner receives the hidden script of their own essence-spirit, reciting it in accordance. The hun-soul ascends directly to the Southern Palace, where, by the measure of their cultivated merit, they are reborn after a calculated number of days. No longer deluded by the turning wheel, they attain the immortality of divine transcendents.

The Dao speaks: When the revolutions of heaven and earth reach their end, when the stellar lodgings fall into disarray, when the sun and moon lose their brightness, when the four seasons fall out of order, when yin and yang are unbalanced, when the land is beset by calamities and portents, when water and fire bring dire straits, when pestilential toxins spread, when the people perish and suffer, when masters and companions pass away, when the virtuous meet untimely misfortune—then all must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures. The merit of purification rites and scripture recitation is most weighty: above, it dissolves heavenly disasters and safeguards the emperor; below, it wards off poisonous harm and delivers the people. In life and death, all depend upon it, its blessings beyond measure. Thus it is called boundless, universally delivering heaven and humanity.

The Dao speaks: Whoever possesses these scriptures and performs these meritorious deeds for the lords of heaven and earth and the people—on the day of calamity, if they resolve in heart to perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures ten times—all the heavens will record their names, the myriad spirits will attend and protect them, and the perfected ones of the right will distinguish them, enabling them to become ministers of the Golden Watchtower of the Sagely Lord. The heavens record the merits and transgressions of people without the slightest error. The True Kings of Heaven will also safeguard and recommend your person. Those who attain the Dao will then thoroughly comprehend the most profound words. The boundless hidden language of the Great Brahma resounds throughout the heavens.

The Heavenly Worthy of the Dao composed this,
The Numinous Writ of the Primordial One from the Fusang Azure Yang Jade Chapters of the Eight Heavens of the East.

The lofty peaks of Zhai and Xuan, the resounding hymns of Mo and Guang.
Through the ages, echoes reverberate, welcoming redemption at the Mystic Mound.
The rushing waters cascade in layers, firmly concealing the radiance of the abyss.
Compassion aligns with the traces of splendor, illuminating the chambers of the Shi and Fang.
The wondrous fish stands as consort, its ritual form tempered by firmness.
The nightly depths of Haizou, the unfurling brilliance of Linlang.
The inscribed tablet and the few unite as one, encountering fullness in the eastern auspices.
How much more the measuring of pheasants and ducks, the convergence of Hu and Tang.

**Southern Eight Heavens**
The blazing battles of Zhan and Chi, the soaring brilliance of Tuo and Teng.
The sorrowful youths of Qi and Ru, the dark abundance of Zang and Yin—
the demon lords establish their offices.
At the summit of the terrace, officials are commanded; swift messengers proclaim the strictures.
Yang resides at the primal capital, exhaustively investigating the origins of all divisions.
Fierce gatherings stabilize the thorns; the warmth of deer and the darkness of the prison.
The radiant supplements the imperial throne; the tranquil divisions maintain constancy.
Fierce and humble, the handle of power is weighty; auspicious omens convey trust.

**Western Eight Heavens**
The will of Senashi is numinous; the path of Ruda reaches the mark.
Atop the towering capital, Lu surveys all with complete assistance.
Anyi spreads ferocity; seeking the slightest measure, he examines correctness.
The wolf’s patterns and the ruggedness of Xie; the way is encamped with arrayed forces.
Yan Teng releases the brilliance of Lin; Bao Chou and Yin Cang.
The myriad scholars and masters of discipline; the pools and palaces, the corpses of nobility.
The fleeing and the hidden, the seals and the orchids; recounting the gates of darkness.
The spirits of the dark rivers and the Dipper; the golden names extend in invocation.

**Northern Eight Heavens**
The beams of Fusang support the rosy clouds; cutting off rebellion and stubbornness.
Illuminating learning and primordial quiescence, embracing the gate of the imperial grace.
The talisman of Ding in purple; the nightly abode pursues emulation.
Entrusting to marvels and hidden depths; the sands of Po and the praise of Yan.
Binding the springs and the hidden; intertwining wonders with the floating net.
Pure faith and shared dharma; without compassion, striking the high.
The profligate and the dragon’s gathering; the calculations of Luo and the transmissions of Zhuo.
The karma of Ye and Zheng, the brilliance of Fan; the stone thunder and the luminous clarity.

The Dao speaks: These are the boundless hidden languages of the Great Brahma within the heavens, the sounds of the infinite.
The ancient script was inscribed upon the Jade Terrace to the left of the Azure Emperor, the Azure Yang cavern resplendent.
The Way of Wood flourishes; benevolent grace pervades purely.
Longevity and joy extend afar; life is bestowed upon the earth, and virtuous power upon the heavens.
Roaming the utmost void, subtly returning to the Three Origins.
Fortune and nobility trace back to the beginning; the Dao rewards its mystery.
Each character spans a full *zhang* in breadth.
The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign of old transcribed this text, establishing it as the correct intonation.
Those who know its sounds and can fast and recite it shall have the flying heavenly spirit-kings of all heavens descend to observe their person.
Their diligence is recorded and reported above to the heavens; the myriad spirits pay homage, the earthly deities attend at the gates.
The Perfected King of Great Accomplishment safeguards and recommends the true essence of Wood.
With the Dao complete, one may roam the Three Realms and ascend through the Golden Gate.
This sound repels all, exorcises all, delivers all, and accomplishes all—it is the natural sound of the Heavenly Perfected.
Thus, reciting it summons the spirit-kings to descend and observe; the Supreme Emperor chants from afar.
The myriad spirits pay homage; the Three Realms attend in reverence.
All malevolent forces bow their heads; demonic essences vanish of themselves.
The jade-like resonance vibrates; the ten directions grow solemn and clear.
The rivers and seas fall silent; the mountains and peaks swallow their mists.
The myriad spirits tremble and submit; the assembled immortals are summoned.
The heavens are free of impurity; the earth is without demonic dust.
Dark wisdom is thoroughly purified; the vast measure is profoundly mysterious.

**The Wondrous Scripture of the Numinous Treasure, the Uppermost Rank for Delivering Humanity, Chapter Seventeen Concludes**
**Chapter Eighteen**

The Radiant Chapter of Pristine Light

The Dao spoke: Long ago in the Primordial Grotto-Heaven, amidst jubilant rosy clouds streaming with celestial sounds and the alchemical soil of the void, the Primordial Commencement transmitted the *Primal Scripture for Delivering Humanity, the Radiant Chapter of Pristine Light of the Uppermost Rank*. As the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Commencement was about to expound this scripture, he circumambulated ten times to summon the ten directions, then ascended his seat.

The Heavenly Perfected, the Most High and Revered, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Jade Consort of the Western Florescence, the True Kings of the Four Poles, the Primordial Sovereign of Yellow Simplicity, the Flying Celestial Couriers, the Divine Officials and Governors—an innumerable host—rode the void to arrive. White clouds and verdant mists bore their feathered chariots; their floral canopies drifted upon the dawn, pearls and jades interreflecting their radiance. Five-hued effulgences surged and billowed, illuminating the vastness of the Great Void.

For nine days and nine nights, the solar palaces and lunar mansions of the manifold heavens, the starry towers and celestial pavilions, the Primordial Dipper stilled its mechanism, the Three Paths aligned in perfect circuit. The adamantine winds grew tranquil; the Kunlun peaks withdrew their clouds. The earth floated upon five auspicious omens; the heavens opened their eight gates. The lands, mountains, rivers, cities, and forests stretched level and uniform, no longer distinguished by height or depth. All soil transformed into luminous jade, without variation in hue.

The assembled Perfected attended in reverence as the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Commencement, in profound repose, sat upon a lotus of ten thousand petals afloat in the void. When he had expounded the scripture once, the Great Saints of the manifold heavens simultaneously proclaimed its excellence. At that time, all men and women of the realm, gazing upward to heed the Dharma-sound, awakened in spirit and insight.

When he had expounded it twice, their numinous palaces grew empty and luminous.
When thrice, they silently accorded with the mysterious and wondrous.
When four times, true qi bathed their bodies, and all ailments were healed.
When five times, their forms harmonized with the Orthodox Dao, and all evils were dispelled.
When six times, the thirty-two heavens revealed their true scriptures.
When seven times, the Jade Realms of the Nine Heavens, the Mysterious Palaces of the Four Poles, and the Treasured Scriptures of the Three Caverns became clearly and fully visible.
When eight times, beneath the encircling heavens and within the Great Void, all sounds partook of the Great Pattern.
When nine times, nine-hued wondrous lights descended to illumine the darkest nights, universally absolving the suffering souls of the Northern Feng.
When ten times, the ten thousand kinds of the ten directions followed their natures in carefree wandering.

At that time, all men and women of the realm, without exception, turned their hearts in devotion. All received protection and deliverance, attaining longevity without end.

The Dao spoke: At that time,

When the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning expounded the scripture once, the boundless and measureless multitudes of the Flowery Forest Great Spirits of the Eastern Direction arrived floating through the void. When twice, the boundless and measureless multitudes of the Vermilion Script Great Spirits of the Southern Direction arrived floating through the void. When thrice, the boundless and measureless multitudes of the Imperial Talisman Great Spirits of the Western Direction arrived floating through the void. When four times, the boundless and measureless multitudes of the Primordial Radiance Great Spirits of the Northern Direction arrived floating through the void. When five times, the boundless and measureless multitudes of the Azure Essence Great Spirits of the Northeastern Direction arrived floating through the void. When six times, the boundless and measureless multitudes of the Round Pearl Great Spirits of the Southeastern Direction arrived floating through the void. When seven times, the boundless and measureless multitudes of the Vast Rosy Clouds Great Spirits of the Southwestern Direction arrived floating through the void. When eight times, the boundless and measureless multitudes of the Golden Flower Great Spirits of the Northwestern Direction arrived floating through the void. When nine times, the boundless and measureless multitudes of the Purple Empyrean Great Spirits of the Upper Direction arrived floating through the void. When ten times, the boundless and measureless multitudes of the Numinous Capital Great Spirits of the Lower Direction arrived floating through the void.

When the ten recitations were complete, the Perfected Great Spirits of the Nine Ultimates of the Ten Directions arrived all at once. All men and women of the realm turned their hearts in devotion, rejoicing to hear the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning proclaim the teachings of the Luminous Radiance of the Plain Light. Externally, they gave birth to heaven and earth, coalescing into primordial chaos; internally, they gave birth to the myriad things, transforming into mountains and rivers. All arose from the formless Five Agents, the true nature of primordial metal, their empty luminosity joining as one force, indestructible. Even the gods and spirits of humankind, with their perceptions of sorrow and joy, were formed from the uncarved hardness of the Plain Light and the illuminating, discerning body of Luminous Radiance. Things may be hard or brittle, yet their becoming is one. Humans may be sagely or common, yet their knowledge is one. Though we possess this metal, it has not yet been smelted. Now, encountering the Most High Lord’s method-fire, we refine this divine metal, casting it into ritual vessels, perfecting this power of the Dao, enabling boundless transformations.

Having spoken thus, they rejoiced and bowed again, then withdrew to the side of their seats. Those who came were like fine rain or dense mist—countless multitudes—so that half the land of the realm sank unevenly, beyond all restraint. Thereupon, the Most High Lord suspended a single precious pearl, as large as a millet grain, in the dark emptiness seven *zhang* above the earth. The Most High Lord ascended and led the Perfected Great Spirits of Heaven, the Lofty Perfected Ones, and the Wondrously Practiced Realized Ones, along with the boundless multitudes of the Luminous Radiance of the Plain Light from the Ten Directions, all entering into the pearl. The heavenly beings looked up and saw only a surging flow entering through the pearl’s mouth. Once inside, they knew not where they were. The people of the realm dispersed, and the earth returned to levelness, no longer uneven or sunken.

Within the pearl, the Most High Lord completed the full exposition of the scripture. The assembled Perfected Ones oversaw the transmission, bestowing it upon me. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words. When the ritual matters were roughly concluded, the myriad heavens returned to their places, and in an instant, all was silent, without lingering resonance.

At that time, the heavenly beings who encountered the scriptural teachings universally attained deliverance, preserving their original years without harm. The entire land turned in devotion, all perceiving the wondrous subtleties. Without attachment or stagnation, without thought or entanglement, without love or hatred, without suffering or affliction, without defeat or loss—their minds aligned with the true Dao, their words accorded with heavenly patterns. Equal in compassion and love, even those of different bones became kin. The land flourished in peace, forever celebrating great tranquility. From the scripture’s first emergence as teaching, the realm was guided by the Dao. Those who in advance held sincere hearts, revered and honored it, all attained transcendence of the world.

The Dao spoke: What the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning expounded in the scripture are the inner names of the Celestial Emperors of the various heavens, the hidden rhymes of sound, as well as the inner taboos of the True Kings and the concealed names of the hundred spirits. They reveal the wondrous subtleties of the Dao: the formless Five Agents, born before heaven and earth, cohabiting in a single *qi*, undivided through kalpas. Within lies divine metal, the Luminous Radiance of the Plain Light; externally, they form the various heavens, internally, the true spirits—hard and indestructible. The myriad things depend on them for completion. If you can know this, you may endure forever. These are not the common words of the world. Only the Perfected Ones who have already attained realization can fully grasp their verses. Reciting them ten times, the various heavens chant from afar, the ten thousand emperors perform rites, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks conceal their clouds, the golden wheel halts its radiance, the jade pivot ceases its turning. The vast and boundless Great Void flies through the Gate of Life. The soft becomes ultimate hardness, the empty becomes ultimate concealment. Vast beyond enclosure, broad beyond measure. Golden light and Plain Light, Luminous Radiance without limit, congealed yet flowing, attaining the frontier of the Dao. Hordes of demons bind their forms, ghostly spirits extinguish their clarity, the dead return to life, white bones become human.

For those of utmost learning who recite this ten times, the Golden Gate verifies their transcendence, the True Registers serve the Mysterious. The Five Emperors stand guard, the Three Realms bow in reverence. Demon spirits lose their sight, ghostly *xie* extinguish their clarity. They deliver those on the verge of death, reviving those who have perished. The reason for this is that the scholar’s polluted *qi* has not yet dissipated, their body has not yet penetrated the true, their divine metal is not yet firm—when exposed to fire, it melts. Their Plain Light is not yet pure, their Luminous Radiance dim and obscure. Though they summon and command the Ten Directions, their power does not yet govern the celestial administration. Their virtue can only subdue earthly spirits, bind demonic spirits, and avert death—but they cannot restore life. To recite these verses lightly brings calamity upon oneself. To offer reverent veneration opens the gateway to prosperity, flourishing through generations, forming good karmic conditions. Ten thousand disasters do not approach, and divine luminaries guard the gate.

This scripture is supremely wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital, delivering boundless beings as the root of the ten thousand Dao. Its majestic pattern is vast, its virtue beyond measure.

The Dao spoke: For those who recite this scripture ten times, the divine metal of Plain Light does not scatter, its numinous essence endures. The luminous soul remains forever, the Yin Pass opens of itself, and all heavens arrive together. Countless generations of ancestors, the souls of the dark realms if still sentient, all immediately receive deliverance, ascending to the Vermilion Palace. After nine years of refinement, they receive transformation and rebirth, becoming noble persons.

Those who diligently study the scriptures to their culmination, fulfilling their merit and perfecting their virtue, all attain divine transcendence, ascending to the Golden Gates and roaming the Jade Capital in celestial feasting. Scholars who cultivate and recite this scripture align their primordial luminosity with their nature, their empty bodies attaining the divine. Their golden bodies achieve the Dao, dwelling in the Supreme Clarity, all receiving deliverance and ascending to the Southern Palace.

When worldly beings recite it, preserving the True Unity within their bodies and safeguarding their golden virtue from decay, their karmic fires cannot consume them. Thus, they extend their years and attain longevity, later all achieving the Dao of liberation through simulated death. Their souls and spirits temporarily dissolve, never passing through hell, and swiftly regain their forms to roam the great void.

This scripture is subtly wondrous, universally delivering boundless beings. All heavenly and mortal beings receive its blessings. Immeasurable fortune arises, and the cycles of life and death are graced with its favor. Treasured by the heavens above, it is not transmitted to the lower worlds. Only the most devoted offer gold and treasures in sincerity, swearing celestial oaths to transmit it. Those who lightly disclose or profane it bring calamity upon nine generations, forever bound to serve as officials in the nether realms.

Five Emperors attend this scripture, with twenty-four Jade Lads and twenty-four Jade Maidens each, safeguarding its divine writ and protecting the bodies of those who receive it.

The Dao spoke: During the long fast of the first month, recite and chant this scripture. Wood manifests its golden embryo, and the five viscera generate spring. The withered, decayed, and aged are renewed, attaining eternal life. For the souls of the departed in past ages, it severs their earthly bonds and toils, delivering them to the Southern Palace.

During the long fast of the seventh month, recite and chant this scripture. The radiant essence of the golden stream shines within, and divine might pervades the inner darkness. A hundred passages grow firm and strong, the abyssal pool dredged of its numinous essence. The body attains divine transcendence, and the names of all heavens are inscribed—on yellow registers and white tablets, death is erased and life restored.

During the long fast of the tenth month, recite and chant this scripture. Water unites with metal, coalescing into a sacred embryo. Heaven and earth become a single speck of dust, most wondrous and most mysterious. Those who practice this transform and ascend as flying immortals.

For kings and emperors, rulers and ministers, fathers and sons, it brings peace and stabilizes the nation, preserving the celestial mandate for eternity. Dynasty after dynasty, they remain sovereigns, securing their realms, and the people proclaim great peace.

On the eight nodal days, recite and chant this scripture. Water, fire, earth, and wood are all subsumed by metal. The spirit is eternally fortified, and one becomes a True Person of the Nine Palaces.

On one’s natal day, recite and chant this scripture. The Supreme Unity descends, and the primordial radiance shines with numinous essence. The three souls are summoned—three on the left, seven on the right—ceaselessly employed. The souls and spirits become serene and upright, the ten thousand qi enduring forever. No suffering is endured, and the body emits light. The Three Realms attend in guard, the Five Emperors oversee the reception, and ten thousand spirits pay homage. Names are inscribed in the Earthly Heaven, and upon the fulfillment of merit and virtue, one ascends to the Supreme Clarity.

The Dao spoke: On the days of ritual practice, one must bathe in fragrant waters, fast, and enter the chamber. Facing east, knock the teeth thirty-two times, ascending to the thirty-two heavens. Bow thirty-two times in reverence, close the eyes, and silently envision the body seated amidst clouds of blue, yellow, and white qi, both within and without shrouded in mist. Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Lion, and White Crane array themselves to the left and right. The radiant essence of the primordial luminosity shines like the bright moon, its brilliance illuminating the crown. Sun and moon cast their light, suffusing the chamber with splendor. A circular image forms above the head, its radiance illuminating the ten directions—all must be vividly clear.

The secret incantation states:
Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Dao Lord.
Summon forth from within my body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Attendant Envoys of the Left and Right, the Jade Lads who tend incense, the Jade Maidens who transmit words, the Direct Attendants of the Five Emperors, and the Incense Officials of the Day—thirty-two each—opening the passage for my words.
On this auspicious day, in a pure hall of long fasting, cultivating the supreme scripture, delivering boundless beings, may my entreaties ascend directly to the presence of the Most High Primordial Sovereign of the Thirty-Two Heavens.
Conclude by drawing qi thirty-two times, then face east and recite the scripture.

*The Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial Limitless Deliverance of Beings, Supreme and Marvelous*
The Primordial Cavernous Mystery, Numinous Treasure’s Fundamental Chapter, the Supreme and Marvelous Beginning of the Radiant Primordial Luminosity, opens the heavens to deliver beings. The Hidden Rhythms of the Celestial Sovereign merge with spontaneity. The Great Cavern’s Primordial Metal, the Empty Mystery’s Utmost Perfection, is firm, resolute, and luminously decisive. Its divine transformations pervade all, indestructible and unstained. It transcends boundaries to reach the highest clarity, embracing the great void and generating the nine origins within. Formless and truly wondrous, the Dao’s nature is numinously mysterious.

The Primordial Sovereign spreads qi, establishing the myriad heavens. The firm winds stir within, and the primordial radiance revolves without. The utmost yang congeals into substance, the brahmic qi flowing like springs, coalescing into a great vessel. The two images then part. The radiant primordial luminosity emerges—this is the numinous root. Above, it has no further ancestor; only the Dao is its body. Its radiant splendor flows and coalesces, universally planting divine spirits.

The peerless jade scripture secures the Cinnabar Citadel. Without its writ, there is no illumination; without its writ, there is no clarity; without its writ, there is no establishment; without its writ, there is no completion; without its writ, there is no deliverance; without its writ, there is no life. This is the Heaven within the Great Brahmā Heaven, the solemn peaks of Yu Luo, the Golden Gates of the Jasper Mountain, ascending to the utmost mystery above the Great Crimson Clarity.

Vast and boundless through eons, now present, now absent, the Three Luminaries’ Imperial Chambers, the Great Yellow Court, the Jasper Blade and Vermilion Palace, the Heavenly Perfected’s Jade Chambers, the primordial qi of the Great Simplicity pervade the ten directions. Within it dwells the True One of radiant primordial luminosity; within it dwells the Nine Mysteries’ Lord of the Southern Culmen; within it dwells the Great Divine Elder who delivers the world; within it dwells the Perfected Person of Supreme Clarity’s Accomplished Mystery; within it dwells the Primordial Sovereign of the Purple Court, the Lord of the Dao of Primordial Simplicity; within it dwells the Venerable Deity of the Southern Prosperity’s Life-Determining Office, who governs transformation, records destiny, and safeguards the realm.

Reanimating the decayed and reviving the dead, delivering boundless beings, today the celestial records are examined as the myriad heavens descend in attendance.

The Boundless Divine King of the Eastern Flowery Grove, the Great Sage of Eternal Life who delivers boundless beings.
The Boundless Divine King of the Southern Vermilion Writ, the Great Sage of Eternal Life who delivers boundless beings.
The Boundless Divine King of the Western Imperial Talisman, the Great Sage of Eternal Life who delivers boundless beings.
The Boundless Divine King of the Northern Primordial Radiance, the Great Sage of Eternal Life who delivers boundless beings.
The Boundless Divine King of the Northeastern Azure Spirit, the Great Sage of Eternal Life who delivers boundless beings.

The Boundless Divine King of the Southeastern Round Pearl, the Great Sage of Eternal Life who delivers boundless beings.
The Boundless Divine King of the Southwestern Vast Radiance, the Great Sage of Eternal Life who delivers boundless beings.
The Boundless Divine King of the Northwestern Golden Flower, the Great Sage of Eternal Life who delivers boundless beings.
The Boundless Divine King of the Upper Purple Empyrean, the Great Sage of Eternal Life who delivers boundless beings.
The Boundless Divine King of the Lower Numinous Capital, the Great Sage of Eternal Life who delivers boundless beings.

The Ten Directions’ Radiant Divine Kings of Primordial Light, the Great Gods of Eternal Life who deliver boundless worlds, all ascend layered clouds and golden skies, riding the eight-scene chariots, jade carriages and feathered canopies, with flying wheels of white canopies. They harness nine-light divine tigers and dark-armored azure dragons, bearing stream-gold standards and summoning-spirit great banners. Before them stand the Supreme Mystery’s treasure weapons; behind follow the Three Heavens’ transforming soldiers. White phoenixes and qilin chant and sing in resonant harmony. The Seven Luminaries open the path; the Three Perfected flank the axle. Myriad chariots and ten thousand riders float through the void, their radiance cascading as they turn their carriages to summon spirits and deliver beings.

In the Western Kunlun’s upper void, the jade towers’ lofty immortals, the Nine Subtleties’ supreme wonders, the Yellow Radiance Primordial Lords, holding talismans and grasping registers, all arrive before the Celestial Emperor.

From the origin of life’s conception, since receiving the Dao, karmic consciousness and fleeting thoughts have entangled countless grievances, muddling the pristine realm. The radiant spirit’s true nature, obscured for kalpas, has grown dull and stubborn. The Primordial Beginning’s cavernous fire refines and forges purity, transforming the golden flower’s body to become a perfected being.

Coarse defilements and ruinous failures scatter with desire’s dispersal. According to what each must be delivered, the spirits are strictly examined. Universally proclaimed to the cavernous abysses, the boundless famous mountains, the peaks of rivers and sands, the Northern Palace’s cold courts, the Five Marchmounts of the Divine Continent, the twelve stream sources, the three rivers and four waterways, the vast seas and formed pools—swiftly erase the ledgers of sins, sever the roots of evil, and allow no lingering or negligence, nor indulgence of demonic hordes.

Since the Primordial Beginning’s transformative opening, following the cycles of ascent and descent, the yin officials of the Six Heavens have been uplifted from their sunken souls. The mysterious supervisors oversee and refine the Crimson Mound, as the Great Clarity descends its qi, transmuting immortals into perfection. Those born in the body receive deliverance, enduring kalpa after kalpa, revolving with the kalpas, their years equaling Heaven’s. Forever delivered from the Three Wretched Paths, the Five Sufferings, and Eight Difficulties, they transcend the Three Realms and roam freely in the Upper Clarity.

In the Heaven of Upper Clarity, the Celestial Emperor’s wondrous mystery resides in the formless realm of Brahman conduct.

The Brahman Qi’s Golden Chariot Heaven, where Emperor Yan of the Serene Mountain’s Stillness rules.

The Eight Heavens of the North:

The Dragon Light’s Myriad Void Heaven, where Emperor Yao of the Golden Flame’s Rigidity presides.
The Cloud Camp’s Surrounding Flower Heaven, where Emperor Wei of the Subtle Mystery’s Ministry governs.

The Capital Terrace’s Sea Cavern Heaven, where Emperor Yao of the Upper Compassionate Perfection rules.

The Thirty-Two Heavens, the Thirty-Two Emperors—each heaven’s hidden taboos, each heaven’s concealed names. Within the heavens’ empty caverns, the natural numinous verses, each heaven’s hidden rhymes, the heavens’ inner sounds. The heavens’ inner honor, the heavens’ inner spirits, the great transformative true demons, the harmonizing transformative spirits. Nine returns to one; ten reverts to nine. Nine unites with ten and ascends; the pristine radiance is born. Gold without obstruction merges with the spirit; the spirit without decay, when refined, shines anew. Radiant light becomes brilliance, collectively named the Fire Palace. The spirit and gold are smelted, uniting with the Great Clarity. The boundless mysteries are profound and unfathomable, scattering the Three Flowers to universally refine the divine beings.

Today, joyfully encountering the transformative deliverance, having undergone trials across the heavens, we request the descent of the most wondrous, the great auspicious karmic connection. Treading the Five Celestial Bodies, names inscribed in the Lofty Mystery, the True Kings supervise and restrain the primordial passes. The Eastern Dipper bestows spirit; the Western Dipper transforms form. The Northern Dipper inscribes the register; the Southern Dipper opens life. The Central Dipper’s Yellow Flower merges with the radiant spirit. The Three Perfected’s qi blossoms into golden splendor.

The Azure Emperor wields the compass; the White Emperor commands the soldiers. The Crimson Emperor guards; the Black Emperor congeals. The Yellow Emperor evolves transformations—myriad Dao are thus accomplished. The Azure Flower Heavenly King gathers qi and uplifts immortals. The Cinnabar Empyrean Heavenly King ascends flaming smoke. The Primordial Light Heavenly King opens heaven and summons mountains. The Mysterious Radiance Heavenly King guides the hundred rivers. The Primal Ultimate Heavenly King sits enthroned upon Kunlun. The Five Heavenly True Kings are the myriad spirits’ ancestors. Flying through the Six Directions, they feast in the heavenly palaces, gathering qi and radiating spirit, dispersing through the Great Void.

Radiant in self-proclaimed glory, all heavens unite in merit, ascending to refine perfection and assemble in the Hall of Companions. The Divine Kings shake their might, sweeping away inauspicious omens; azure mists spread across the sky while lightning and fire deploy. Cinnabar spirits fan the whirlwinds, gathering and extinguishing wandering lights. The Great Marshals of the Realm hurl swords into the fierce winds, their brilliance soaring ten thousand leagues, their ringing bells traversing the eight directions. Should any dare to challenge, defying the Three Officials, the Mystic Halberd strikes first, the Divine Metal executes thereafter. Demonic specters are butchered and severed, wind and fire ceaseless. Thousands upon thousands are slain, myriads upon myriads annihilated in form. Evil cannot encroach, and the people are safeguarded.

The Six Heavens and Nine Palaces scrutinize demonic encampments with clarity, permitting no negligence; golden steeds cross in presentation. A universal decree is proclaimed to Mount Luofeng, to the boundless depths of the Nether Abyss. The great demons of the Three Realms submit memorials to the Jade Capital. The Primordial Cavern’s Jade Registers merge the Five Qi into chaos: metal qi forms the bones, wood qi the sinews, water qi the blood, fire qi the spirit, and earth qi the intent—thus do beings transform into form.

The Mysterious August’s wondrous Dao completes the Three Images; the Primordial Origin is established, and spirits array in ranks. Illuminating to reveal all things, blazing to discern the true, in motion they fulfill ritual, in stillness they veil warmth. Divine light transmutes, ever returning to metal; the metal body remains unchanging, revolving and wheeling through flight. The radiant orb flashes and gleams, wind fans its brilliance, thus forming the Great Image—august and supremely pure.

The Primordial Subtle and Vast Plain manifests as the enduring Metal Star; purple fusion irrigates the void, white patterns permeate the boundless heavens. Flowing and coalescing into the Five Qi, they engender the Seven Mysteries. The Great Cavern dispels demons, the Jade Wisdom’s sacred scriptures together unfold the supreme transformation, the Heavenly Crystal’s wondrous light. The Nine Dragons’ Great Kalpa reaches its term, extending peace. Through countless eons, chaotic transformation hardens into firmness; the Five Qi become color, the Five Essences become abysses. Wind and water envelop one another, the Supreme Ultimate knows no bounds. The Yellow Terrace recedes into the distant, the Crimson Gates sink into obscurity.

Without form, without shadow, without limit, without end, the primordial chaos of vast simplicity unfolds life in boundless expanse. Radiant blooms stream with color, revolving and traversing naturally. The Mysterious August safeguards the kalpa, the primordial elements inscribe jade verses. Cinnabar scenes crystallize into luster, spreading the Azure Chamber far and wide; the crimson brilliance of supreme numina evolves qi in the ten directions. Revolving the Dipper and traversing the Winnowing Basket, cycling through the Five Constants, the Three Enclosures transform into palaces, clearly arraying the primordial principles.

The Eight Scenes’ crimson script gathers qi in the High Mystery; within the Mystery dwells the Great Perfected—God ascends as a flying immortal. The Pristine Scene’s golden mists chant and intone the Cavernous Void; luminous spirits and green silk resound with cloud chariots. Jade tones ripple through the empyrean; the Yellow Flower wields talismans. The Purple Clarity’s fragrant peaks wheel their wings to the Primordial Abode. Metal becomes divine nectar, flowing through the azure charts, harmonizing a thousandfold, uniting ten thousandfold—naturally attaining perfection.

Within perfection dwells the supreme spirit, the Supreme Numinous of Southern Prosperity, the Celestial Ranks of Primordial Elders, the Peaceful Treasure Emperor Honored. The Mysterious One’s Nine Assistants, the True Lords Who Govern Life, review the registers of the living, transforming and flying through roots. Ascending the Pure Registers, entering and exiting the Flourishing Source, within the Eight Nether Realms and the subtlest of subtleties, descending to the Ninefold Abyss of the Yellow Springs, the Nine Enclosures’ deep palaces, they govern the people at the center, all things merging as one.

Ten revolutions return the spirit, uniting with qi to become immortal. The immortal Dao treasures life, endlessly delivering beings. Above, the Eight Gates open, illuminating the celestial passages. Transgressions, prohibitions, and karmic retributions are examined and assessed. Universally receiving deliverance, the dead souls gain new bodies, their rebirths ascending to be heard by all heavens. Above the heavens, each has its Gate of Life.

Within lies the manifest and radiant scripture of ascension, the Yellow Plain’s sacred scrolls, verses that join the High Perfected. The first: *The Pristine Scene’s Manifest and Wondrous Flying Void Chant*

The Great Void engenders the Supreme Perfected,
The Great Emptiness forms tangible shapes.
Revolving without bounds or shores,
Nurturing all divine spirits.
The Mysterious Clarity transforms the Round Net,
The Chaotic Yellow sinks into obscurity.
Errors scatter into things,
The Harmonious Void constructs human relations.
Bright and clear are the realms of all heavens,
Holding fast to the root of the Dao of life.
Vast and boundless is the foundation of the Great Transformation,
The Eight Nether Realms return to the Jade Capital.
The Primordial Beginning reveals true wonders,
The Pristine Scene fuses divine metal.
Having awakened to the profound mystery’s purport,
Body and spirit unite in luminous clarity.
Seven ancestors ascend to the heavenly halls,
Southern Prosperity pays homage to the Emperor Honored.
The Five Sufferings are forever dissolved,
Heavenly demons chant hymns of joy.
In harmony with the True Kings’ transformation,
All beings attain long life.

The second: *The Luminous Spirit’s Eternal Illumination True King’s Chant*

In the Dragon Han, the kalpa is established,
Cinnabar light founds the primordial chart.
The Great Sage, the Primordial One Emperor,
Unfurls the flying celestial scriptures.
High immortals receive the heavenly mandate,
The true Dao is concealed in the Pure Capital.
Cavernous scriptures descend to the Jade Capital,
Divine light illumines the eight directions.
The Primordial Honored reveals divine transformations,
Myriad heavens conceal the pistil pearls.
Thus with the ever-bright metal,
Refining and tempering the followers of greed and attachment.
Divine metal truly transforms qi,
Pouring into and delivering mortal frames.
Bright and clear, without defilement,
The Mysterious Essence shall never wither.
The Luminous Spirit’s Jade Scene Source,
Eternally illumines the attainment of emptiness.
Majestic is the Great Compassionate Honored,
Proclaiming and unfolding the talismans of life.
The wondrous and subtle purport of the High Clarity,
Truly awakened, unites with the Mysterious Void.
Refining qi, ascending the seed people,
The Jade Scriptures henceforth spread.

The third: *The Song of Attaining the Dao and Transforming*

A hundred demons delight in sinking and drowning,
Flying immortals only cherish life.
Divine qi remains firm and complete,
The Three Realms know no death or birth.
Having awakened to the High Clarity’s Dao,
Harmonizing with transformation in accord.
Feasting in the Eternal Yang Palace,
The Eastern Well moistens the celestial ford.
Carefree, traversing the fierce winds,
The Three Enclosures pay homage to the Emperor Honored.
Beneath the vast turning wheel,
How the world below toils and strives!
A moment becomes the void,
How can the vast kalpa have measure?
Hand in hand, chanting the Great Model,
The Pristine Scene forever pure and clear.
Revolving the Dharma Wheel’s principles,
Transforming and communicating with divine spirits.
Gazing at the Eastern Mulberry’s washing net,
Glancing at the Western Kunlun’s enduring Metal Star.
Let you witness the true teaching,
The spirit’s abode forever empty and bright.
Inscribe names on the Jade Perfected’s register,
Striking off names from the Feng Springs.
Shaking robes, ascending the Grand Empyrean,
Bowing heads in the Mysterious August’s court.

Above these Three Realms, within the flying void, the flying immortals’ songs resound, their verses joining the cavernous scriptures. Reciting them a hundred times, names are delivered to the Southern Palace.

Reciting it a thousand times, the True Kings safeguard and welcome.
Ten thousand recitations complete the Dao, ascending to the Great Void,
Passing beyond the Three Realms,
Attaining the rank of Immortal Duke.
Hearing the numinous sounds,
Even demon kings show reverence,
Commanding earth spirits to serve as escorts,
Lifting from the earthly prison,
Freeing from the Five Sufferings and Eight Hardships.
Seven generations of ancestors ascend,
Forever departing the gates of darkness.
Souls cross the Vermilion Mound,
Refined and reborn anew.
This is called boundless,
Universally delivering the infinite.

There exists a secret celestial scripture,
Revered by all heavens.
Those who leak it arrogantly fall into hell,
Bringing calamity to seven generations of ancestors.
The Dao states: These two chapters are the hidden sounds of the Celestial Emperors and Numinous True Kings,
Revealing the wondrous origin of the primordial Great Spirit.
Though born of the Primordial Beginning’s Ninefold Refinement of Yang—crimson qi and the true fire of the Mysterious Void—
As the enlightened essence of awareness,
Yet it knows not the indestructible, unchanging,
Eternal and constant, serene and steadfast in contemplation.
It wholly relies on the supreme, pure, unshakable, vast, and firm true gold as its essence,
Able to generate and activate.
Wood and wind assist,
Metal and wind radiate,
Forming a blazing brilliance,
Luminous and clear,
Called the pure and wondrous numinous qi,
The profound mystery of the Dao,
Establishing the primordial chaos,
Giving birth to the Three Powers—
All arises from this.
If you embody it,
It polishes your spiritual root,
Empowering you with divine might,
Pervading boundless realms.
Immortals, spirits, ghosts, and gods,
Humans, dragons, and the myriad beings,
All are molded by the self.
The ten directions’ heavens,
Nothing is obtained from without—
All are the words of the Great Brahma,
Not the common speech of the world.
Words lack ornate rhythm,
Melodies lack florid embellishment,
Thus it is called profound and mysterious,
Difficult to fathom in detail.
Cherished by the heavens,
It is secreted in the Jade Capital of the Divine Empyrean,
Within the Eastern Treasure Scripture Chamber of the Jade Pure Jade Treasury.
According to the canon, after thirty-seven thousand years,
It descends in accord with the cosmic cycle.
If a perfected one offers gold and treasures with a sincere heart,
Following the ancient rites to pledge allegiance to the Dao Lord,
Only then is it bestowed.

The Dao states: When the heavens and earth complete their cycle and decline,
When the sun, moon, and five stars wane and wax,
When the most sagely and divine suffer adversity,
And the unlearned meet with harm,
This is due to the inner depletion of spiritual qi,
The dulling of pure gold,
Thus their radiance depends on external conditions,
And misfortune and decay take hold.
For all such calamities,
Those of the same qi must unite in heart to perform the fast,
Burn incense in the six watches,
And recite the scripture ten times—
Blessings and virtue will descend at once,
Dispelling all inauspiciousness.
The boundless scripture
Universally delivers the infinite.

The Dao states: If the unlearned in the Dao are shallow in cultivation,
Or their immortal rank is incomplete,
And their destined end arrives,
Their body passes through the Great Yin,
At the moment of transition,
Fellow perfected ones should burn incense for them
And recite the scripture ten times,
To deliver their corporeal form according to the method.
The pristine scene returns,
Their luminous spirit shines brighter,
And their soul ascends directly to the Southern Palace.
According to their merit in study,
They are reborn by the day.
Revolving without cessation,
They attain immortality.

The Dao states: When the heavens and earth reach their end,
The constellations fall into disorder,
The sun and moon lose their dusk,
The four seasons lose their order,
Yin and yang fall out of harmony,
The land suffers calamities,
With disasters of water, fire, and wind,
Plagues and poisons spreading,
The people perish,
Masters, friends, and fellow students pass away—
All should perform the fast,
Burn incense, and recite the scripture.
The merit of fasting and reciting the scripture is profound.
Above, it dispels celestial disasters,
Protecting and stabilizing the emperor.
Below, it wards off poison and harm,
Delivering the people.
In life and death, all rely on it,
Its blessings are immeasurable.
Thus it is called boundless,
Universally delivering gods and humans.

The Dao states: Whoever possesses this scripture
And performs these meritorious deeds for the heavens, earth, emperors, and people,
On days of calamity,
If they resolve to perform the fast, burn incense,
And recite the scripture ten times,
All the heavens record their names,
Myriad spirits guard and escort them.
Those distinguished as perfected ones
Will become ministers of the Golden Gate of the Sage Lord.
The heavens record the merits and faults of people
With absolute precision.
The True Kings of the heavens
Will also safeguard and recommend them.
Those who attain the Dao will thoroughly understand these profound words.
The boundless hidden sounds of the Great Brahma in the heavens—
Composed by the Dao Lord,
The Primordial Beginning’s *Luminous Jade Chapters of the Pristine Scene*,
From the Eight Heavens of the East.

In the Kui constellation’s fields, transformations rise into Shen;
Rosy mists surge through the void, their radiance cascading into pools.
Ten thousand towering zhe trees cradle the stars,
While the jasper blooms of Qi drink in reverence.
Turning orchid hues gaze afar,
As morning essence seeks the canonical.
Luminous abundance fills the numinous workshops,
Yet divination stumbles, hesitant to ascend.
Holding dew-laden branches aloft,
Dragons and flood-dragons relinquish their depths.
In stillness, they swiftly aid the Dao,
Their earnest devotion flowing like Liu Bin’s legacy.
Weeds and chaff are swept low,
While village paths gleam brighter than gold.

**Southern Eight Heavens**
The Peng’s might is unmatched, its strength beyond measure;
Fiery trials forge wills beyond the ordinary.
Yin’s adornments spark with keen delight,
As Yan Xu’s jade glows with profit.
Carved splendor pierces all directions,
While propriety races toward Fen’s domain.
Wise frontiers teem with rare immortals,
Precious marvels truly advance.
Scorching shoals dissolve illusions,
Colors part, aiding responses.
The distant Kun’s array stirs awe,
Secret wilds settle in constancy.
Angles and Ni are chastised and slain,
While Yang Mountain bears witness.
Winds unfold Kong’s valor,
Filling the emperor’s realm to its brim.

**Western Eight Heavens**
The Pristine Scene establishes life,
As Jiudu nurtures fine sprouts.
Vigorous acceptance of armor and script,
Vows to attack the root spirits.
Ze’s eastern tribute displays might,
While the consort seeks revered honor.
Reverence concludes the tasks,
As slave armies gather like clouds.
Auspicious halls circle in fellowship,
Their halberds and tripods aglow.
Ten thousand mirrors held alone,
Transforming masters in ninefold perfection.
Favorable days open anew,
As the Dipper moves toward Gang’s birth.
Waves of shame follow in pursuit,
While Gui Mountain deploys its forces.

**Northern Eight Heavens**
The Huicheng’s blades stretch afar,
As scenes arise, binding the Lang.
Dark jade advances in purple splendor,
Tossed into distant, radiant pursuits.
Dong’s true essence anchors the numinous,
Stars matching the Ji and Qiang.
Treading the path of Great Obscurity,
The Northern Kun’s chambers lie deep.
Sheltering night armies with advantage,
The Shi’s zithers harmonize the realm.
Crossing hidden depths with rosy hues,
Command banners scatter and conceal.
Mulberry’s azure coils at the dragon’s head,
While the Cavernous Mystery’s words address the Sovereign.
Rituals ascend, dispelling demonic ugliness,
As terraces halt to welcome auspicious guests.

The Dao speaks: These are the Great Brahma’s hidden sounds within the heavens, the boundless tones. The ancient script was inscribed upon the Jade Terrace of the Western True Pristine Scene’s hall, to unfold the radiance of the Three Luminaries. The Supreme One’s canonical scripture, the Purple Numinous incense offering, the Primordial Emperor’s command to the spirits—myriad numina compose its verses. Seen with the eyes, spoken with the mouth, its divine metal flows with hardness. The heavens lift, the earth bears, enlightening the multitudes to wisdom. It grasps the mechanisms of the unseen, preserving presence and absence in the indistinct. Spirits enter, gods emerge, transformations without limit. The Emperor’s treasure scripture—how could the world have heard it? Each character spans a full *zhang*.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign of Old inscribed its text, establishing the correct intonation. Those who know its sounds and fast while reciting it will have the Pristine Scene’s divine kings descend to observe their forms, record their merits and diligence, and report to the heavens. Myriad spirits will pay homage, earthly deities guard their gates, and the Great Merit Demon Kings will safeguard and recommend them as perfected ones. With the Dao complete, they will roam the Three Realms, ascend through the Golden Gate, for these sounds repel all, exorcise all, deliver all, and accomplish all—these are the Heavenly Perfected’s natural tones.

Thus, reciting them summons the Pristine Scene’s descent, the Supreme Emperor’s distant chant, myriad spirits’ homage, the Three Realms’ attendance at the chariot, demonic hordes bowing their heads, ghostly essences vanishing of themselves. Jade chimes resound, the ten directions grow solemn and clear, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks swallow their mists. Myriad numina tremble and submit, gathering immortals from all quarters. The heavens are free of filth, the earth devoid of demonic dust. Profound wisdom illumines the unseen, the vast and mysterious reaches the ultimate mystery.

*The Marvelous Scripture of the Upper Chapters on the Limitless Salvation of Lives, Volume Eighteen, Concludes*
*Volume Nineteen*

**The Chapter on the Ten Directions’ Sacred Realms**

The Dao spoke: Long ago in the Radiant Flower Heaven, within the Luminous Brilliance’s Revolving Wind and the Great Round Transformed Land, the Primordial Beginning received the *Limitless Upper Scripture on the Salvation of Lives* for the ten directions’ sacred realms.

When the Primordial Heavenly Worthy was to expound this scripture, he circumambulated ten times to summon the ten directions. Only then did he ascend his seat. The Heavenly Perfected, the Most High and Venerable, the Wondrous-Practiced Realized Ones, the Immortal Lords and Immortal Kings of the ten directions’ sacred realms and transformed lands—innumerable multitudes—rode the void to arrive. Dark clouds and flying auroras, phoenix chariots and vermilion wheels, interlacing canopies of jade and emerald radiance pierced the eight darknesses and illuminated the vast heavens. For nine days and nine nights, the sun and moon of the various heavens, the palaces and starry enclosures, the imperial towers and jeweled observatories, the vermilion towers and divine peaks, the jasper mountains and jade terraces—from the kalpas’ heights down to the Azure-Cinnabar Realm and the Dark-Pristine Land, the Nine Pure Abysses, the Six Circuits and Ten Poles—all shone with luminous clarity, unimpeded and boundless. The land, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees of the entire realm were leveled as one, no longer high or low, and the earth became yellow jade. The Central Heaven’s true qi interpenetrated the earthen mounds; divine transformation made all even, without distinction of hue.

The assembled Perfected surrounded and attended the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, who was seated upon the Nine-Rayed Crimson-Glyph Fire-Jade Throne of the Great Void. When he had expounded the scripture once, the Great Sages of the various heavens simultaneously praised its excellence. At that time, all the men and women of the realm, gazing upward to hear the mysterious tones, fully awakened to the wondrous Dao.

When he had expounded it twice, their eyes beheld divine transformations, penetrating the myriad verdant depths.

When he had expounded it thrice, they merged with the true qi and all could expound the Dharma.

When he had expounded it four times, the obstructions of kalpas’ accumulation dissolved at the thought.

When he had expounded it five times, golden perfection dispersed knots, and the hundred passages flowed freely.

When he had expounded it six times, the earth bore precious blossoms, and the heavens spread jade patterns.

When he had expounded it seven times, the boundless multitudes preserved their wholeness and firmness.

When he had expounded it eight times, the ghostly officials ceased their accusations, and the hidden souls ascended.

When he had expounded it nine times, the wondrous light of the Celestial August One illuminated the ten directions, and the Limitless Primordial Palaces manifested in responsive transformation. All the gods and humans of every region reverently gazed upward.

When he had expounded it ten times, jade talismans descended to pacify and secure the divine mountains. Salvation and ascension brought eternal peace, and the kalpic destinies ceased forever. At that time, all the men and women of the realm, without exception, turned their hearts in devotion, received liberation and deliverance, and all attained longevity.

The Dao spoke: When the Primordial Heavenly Worthy had expounded the scripture once, the Great Spirits of the Boundless and Limitless East, the Multitudes of Benevolent Glory, arrived floating through the void.

When he had expounded it twice, the Great Spirits of the Boundless and Limitless South, the Multitudes of Conjoined Brilliance, arrived floating through the void.

When he had expounded it thrice, the Great Spirits of the Boundless and Limitless West, the Multitudes of Luminous Primordiality, arrived floating through the void.

When he had expounded it four times, the Great Spirits of the Boundless and Limitless North, the Multitudes of Mysterious Radiance, arrived floating through the void.

When he had expounded it five times, the Great Spirits of the Boundless and Limitless Northeast, the Multitudes of Preserving Peace, arrived floating through the void.

When he had expounded it six times, the Great Spirits of the Boundless and Limitless Southeast, the Multitudes of Flowing Fortune, arrived floating through the void.

When he had expounded it seven times, the Great Spirits of the Boundless and Limitless Southwest, the Multitudes of Stabilizing Order, arrived floating through the void.

When he had expounded it eight times, the Great Spirits of the Boundless and Limitless Northwest, the Multitudes of Upholding the Net, arrived floating through the void.

When he had expounded it nine times, the Great Spirits of the Boundless and Limitless Above, the Multitudes of Generating Regions, arrived floating through the void.

When he had expounded it ten times, the Great Spirits of the Primordial Limitless Below, the Multitudes of Extending Prosperity, arrived floating through the void.

When the ten circumambulations were complete, the Great Spirits of the ten directions’ sacred realms arrived as one. All the men and women of the realm turned their hearts in devotion. Those who came were as numerous as light dust or heavy mist, with a hundred million chariots and ten thousand riders. Dark clouds gathered on all sides; celestial blessings enveloped all. Pristine mists layered in the distance, beyond any restraint.

Thereupon, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy extended his hand to emit wondrous light, transforming it into a circular image that coalesced into a cloud of precious radiance, lustrous as the bright moon, suspended a hundred *zhang* above the earth in the dark void. The Primordial Heavenly Worthy ascended and led the Heavenly Perfected, the Most High and Venerable, the Wondrous-Practiced Realized Ones, and the Great Spirits of the ten directions’ boundless heavens—innumerable multitudes—all into the Wheel of Jewels. The gods and humans gazed upward, seeing only the retinue enter the shadowy radiance. Once within the shadowy radiance, they knew not where they had gone. The people of the realm dispersed, and the land remained perpetually pure and moist, never changing again.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy then completed the full exposition of the scripture within the Wheel of Jewels. The assembled Perfected oversaw the deliverance and transmitted it to me. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words. When the Dharma rites were fully accomplished, the multitudes of spirits returned to their positions. In an instant, all traces vanished without a sound.

At that time, the people of heaven who encountered this great model universally received its beneficent deliverance, preserving their heavenly years without premature death. The entire realm turned in reverence, all awakening to the karmic conditions of the Dao. Unwearied and unrelenting, uncorrupted and unchanging, without deceit or flattery, without partiality or bias, without artifice or faction, without transgression or error—they spoke the ultimate principle, preserved their lives for long extension, harmonized in compassion and wisdom, and their hearts resonated with the profound mystery. The realm flourished in abundance; the imperial destiny endured without end. The Dharma’s inception spread throughout the land, and all who held sincere devotion—even those who did not serve in reverent protection—were delivered and ascended.

The Dao spoke: The words spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy in his exposition of the scripture are all the tones of the Three Heavens’ transforming qi and the great model of their hymns, as well as the hidden names of the true immortals of the ten directions’ sacred realms. They are not the common words of this world. When the Upper Prime inaugurates its fortune, the Realized Ones penetrate the subtle and awaken to the mysterious. Those who fully grasp its verses and recite them ten times will cause the Nine Heavens to rejoice, the multitudes of spirits to array their words, the Three Offices to hold their registers and memorialize the Jade Capital. The sun and moon will surge in brilliance; the stellar net will move in harmony. The great demons will prostrate in submission; the myriad malevolent spirits will constrain their forms. The living will be delivered; the dead will be saved. Withered bones will become human again, and the Supreme Ultimate will soar as immortals.

Reciting it ten times, the ten directions’ realms, the boundless numinous lands—down to the divine continents, grotto springs, seas, and mountains—will know peace and prosperity, each attaining carefree ease. The reason for this is that the loftiest sages and perfected immortals, born of nature’s finest essence, nurtured in the azure vault, inherently grasp the Dao. Thus, they move the Jade Purity to respond, delivering all without exception. Flying immortals and middle perfected ones, through accumulated study and refinement, align with the mysterious. Though their attainment equals that of the sages, they are not comparable to those of the Upper Prime, for they merely deliver the world’s realms and cannot govern the celestial administration.

To recite this chapter lightly brings misfortune upon oneself. Revering and guarding its secrecy, one establishes primordial merit, ensuring flourishing prosperity across generations, the thriving of good roots, the repelling of all malevolent forces, and the protection of celestial spirits at one’s gate. This scripture is profoundly mysterious, revered by all realms, delivering beings without limit, serving as the foundation of the Dao of life. Its august and upright model is beyond measure.

The Dao declares: Whenever this scripture is recited ten times, its cavernous verses and numinous sounds ascend to the Jade Purity, moving the Void Sovereign to respond. The descending qi of the Three Heavens’ true and upright Nine Yangs, accumulated subtleties, and Supreme Mystery opens the Eight Gates, pouring forth to irrigate the dark tones of Mount Fengdu’s nether springs, the hidden passes of the Yellow Springs. It delivers your countless ancestors and suffering souls, enabling their refinement and ascent to the Vermilion Court, where they meet the appointed time of the perfected. With the numinous talismans gathering life, they become perfected beings. Those who diligently study the supreme scriptures, their merit complete, all attain flying immortality, ascending to the Jade Towers and roaming the Nine Heavens.

Scholars of vast learning who cultivate and recite this scripture are immediately delivered, feasting in the Southern Palace. Those of the world who receive and recite it will live to the full span of the Three Primes, later attaining the Dao of refining the form in the Great Yin, concealing their essence in the Nine Abysses, entrusting their bodies to the earth. Their souls will not drift in emptiness, nor their spirits sink into stagnation. Through kalpas and cycles, they will attain rebirth, and all celestial and human beings will protect and deliver them. Boundless luminous blessings will grace both the hidden and manifest, for what the Supreme Mystery forbids is not transmitted to the world. Only the most devoted scholars, treasuring it with utmost sincerity, transmit it under oath. To recklessly reveal its jade-like verses brings calamity upon seven generations, condemning them to long servitude under the Earth Bureau.

Forty-eight jade lads and forty-eight jade maidens from the scripture’s sacred realm guard its divine writ and protect the bodies of those who receive it.

The Dao declares: During the long fast of the first month, reciting and chanting this scripture causes true light to descend, universally releasing the dark yin of past-world souls, severing their karmic entanglements, and ascending them to the Vermilion Palace. During the long fast of the seventh month, reciting and chanting this scripture allows the qi of the true and upright to flow and irrigate the heart’s field, inscribing one’s name in the Golden Register and attaining high immortality. During the long fast of the tenth month, reciting and chanting this scripture opens inner communication with the sacred realm, its dharma radiance illuminating externally. For kings and emperors, it preserves and extends their reign, pacifying the myriad states, bringing joyous peace, boundless great fortune, the harmony of the Three Luminaries, and eternal celestial longevity.

On the eight seasonal nodes, reciting and chanting this scripture allows one to become a Flowing Pearl, a Vermilion Tower’s Guardian of Life Perfected One. On one’s life-destiny day, reciting and chanting this scripture summons the great sages of the ten directions, the exalted ones of transformed realms, who ride clouds and drive dragons to witness the covenant. Their names are inscribed in the Primordial Dipper, listed in memorials to the Dark Mystery. A hundred spirits gather in assembly, merit recorded in the Nine Heavens. The great demons act as guarantors, and one’s form ascends among the immortals.

The Dao declares: On days of practicing the Dao, one should bathe in fragrant waters, enter the chamber in purification, face east, and knock the teeth thirty-two times to ascend to the Thirty-Two Heavens. Bow thirty-two times in the heart, close the eyes, and silently envision oneself seated amidst clouds of azure, crimson, and purple qi, inwardly and outwardly shrouded in mist. A green dragon, white tiger, vermilion bird, dark warrior, lion, and white crane array themselves to left and right. The sacred realms of the ten directions appear simultaneously, the sun and moon illuminating the chamber with radiance. A circular image arises from the crown, its light shining in all directions—all clearly visible.

The secret incantation states: Supreme Mystery Prime, Supreme Dao Lord. Summon forth from within my body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the attendants of the left and right, the jade lads bearing incense, the jade maidens transmitting words, the Five Emperors’ direct talismans, and the incense officials of the day—thirty-two each—to open and convey these words. Today is an auspicious occasion, a long fast in the pure hall, cultivating the supreme scripture to deliver beings without limit. May what is declared ascend directly to the presence of the Supreme Lord of the Thirty-Two Heavens, the Primordial Thearch.

Afterward, draw qi thirty-two times and recite the scripture facing east.

*The Supreme Primordial’s Limitless Deliverance, Uppermost Wondrous Scripture*

The Primordial Cavernous Mystery, Numinous Treasure’s Original Chapter, the sacred realms of the ten directions, the uppermost divine empyrean. Its numinous transformations deliver beings, the red talismans conceal its rhymes, soaring in natural radiance, merging the vast and dark. The Jade Perfected of Emptiness and Nothingness inaugurates the primordial model, uniting the divine and numinous, the Void Sovereign’s singular qi. It establishes the myriad heavens, constructs the ten directions. Through five kalpas it evolves, seven transformations shape the divine continents. Ten revolutions of the celestial gate, the mysterious and sacred realms. Immortal perfected ones and imperial ministers open the Three Paths. Dispersing and transforming the five forms, the myriad images stand in unison. The root of the numinous in utmost emptiness, circling above to return to the radiance. Alone it moves as the body, the crystalline response of the flower’s essence. The great uncarved numinous writ, the soaring resonance of the Nine Heavens. Wind stirs the flying mist, the swift net of the celestial wheel. Interlacing jade in the deep abyss, the vast and bright Sovereign spreads forth. The primordial motion enfolds and binds—this is creation. As the ten poles prepare to divide, the fragrant peaks and jade terraces arise. Towering and distant, the capital of the empyrean, reaching the limits of the circular image. The jade towers soar in azure, the distant imperial qi. The towering kalpa city, the Jade Banquet of the Three Numinous Ones. The Supreme Mystery’s dark courtyard, the golden pavilions and flowery chambers, arrayed with flowing essence, vast mists nurturing qi, transforming a thousand spirits. Within are the gods of the Ten Heavens’ records, the lords of the Square Reservoirs’ upper paths, the perfected ones of the Vast Sage’s wondrous origin, the Elders who open and guide the united realms. Within are the Eastern Florescence and Southern Culmen, the Western Numinous and Northern Dark, the four corners and above and below. The exalted perfected ones of the arrayed sages together unfold the great model, opening and transforming celestial and human beings.

Upholding the celestial ordinances, immeasurably delivering beings, today’s assembly convenes, summoning them to approach the imperial terrace.

The Divine Kings of the Ten Directions and the Boundless Transformations, the Great Gods who Fly through the Void, Deliver the World, and Open Transformations—all ride upon crimson clouds, green chariots, and azure carriages, with feathered canopies and jade wheels, drawn by dark phoenixes, white tigers, and striped dragons. They bear the Yuanhui Jade Standards and the Seven Luminaries’ numinous banners. Before them march the Great Marshals of the Ten Heavens; behind follow the transformative soldiers of the Yellow Watchtower, fierce steeds, azure unicorns, leaping and dispelling evil. The celestial officials open the paths, the perfected ones of the Mysterious Realms flank the axle-trees. Myriad chariots and ten thousand riders float through the void, their radiance turning back as they arrive. The sagely realms deliver beings.

The Jade Assistants of the Supreme Tenuity, the primordial essence and highest numina, the divine scriptures and vast transformations, the exalted ones of the Great Grotto—governing the heavens and upholding the law, they assemble before the Celestial Emperor. Responding to each direction, they manifest and issue decrees to the various heavens, universally proclaiming to the eight extremities, the numinous passes and grotto spirits, the Northern Water of the Left Bureau, the Nine Abysses and the Supreme. The Six Grottoes of Mount Luo, the winding pools of the Three Palaces, the great kalpas of the Dragon Stables, the majestic radiance of the River Sources, the nine-ren-long labors, the wind courts and fire mountains, the icy mirrors of myriad fragments.

By the talismanic command of the Great Lady of Azure Youth, the moments fly upward, severing evil destinies and extinguishing the roots of transgression. The yang radiance descends to aid, pardoning the souls of the dark depths. The Vermilion Palace receives refinement; immortals transform and become human. The living body harmonizes with qi, enduring with the turning of the cycles, sharing the same years as Heaven. Forever delivered from the ninety-six calamities of the yang cycle, the perils of wind blades and water fires, they transcend the Three Realms and roam freely in the Nine Purities.

In the heavens of the Nine Purities, the Celestial Emperor peers into darkness, the formless realms of pure conduct.

The thirty-two heavens, the thirty-two emperors—hidden are the heavens’ taboos, hidden the heavens’ names. Within the heavens is emptiness, the natural numinous scriptures; hidden are the heavens’ rhymes, the sounds within the heavens, the honored ones within the heavens, the gods within the heavens, the great demons within the heavens, the numina within the heavens.

The nine openings and ten unfoldings merge with the Highest Purity. The great canon of the Mysterious Pass is profound and unfathomable. Establishing the heavens and founding the ultimate, they spread throughout the ten directions.

Today, in joyous celebration of this encounter, the heavens are examined. Worldly burdens are extinguished, evil roots severed. Flying past the five perils, riding the radiance in lofty flight, the Perfected Kings oversee and inspect, unrestrained by the Mysterious Gate.

The Eastern Dipper inscribes life, the Western Dipper administers punishment, the Northern Dipper holds the tally, the Southern Dipper fixes destiny, the Central Dipper is the Celestial Emperor’s chamber, proclaiming the flow of sagely grace.

The Azure Emperor deploys the loom, the White Emperor holds the reckoning, the Red Emperor governs qi, the Black Emperor interweaves, the Yellow Emperor resides at the center—great transformations are apportioned.

The Perfected King of the Azure Heaven unites blessings and separations.
The Perfected King of the Red Heaven rectifies wrongs with the Mysterious Perfected.
The Perfected King of the White Heaven moves with the Great Simplicity’s seasons.
The Perfected King of the Black Heaven transforms with the dawn’s radiance.
The Perfected King of the Yellow Heaven is where the numinous qi returns.
The Five Perfected Kings of the Heavens are the honored ones of the myriad realms.

Flying through the Three Realms, they command the mighty soldiers.

Holding banners and staffs of authority, they roam the Great Clarity,
Their ranks and titles resplendent, coeval with Heaven.
The Supreme Mystery transforms the people, sternly governing the hidden gates;
The Purple Tenuity receives decrees, sweeping away inauspicious omens.

The Heavenly Peng bears the seal, the Divine Tiger spreads its might,
Streaming fire rushes ahead, the Vermilion Phoenix soars behind.
The Six Heavens’ Great Uglies seize and deliver the demonic stars—
Who dares offend or resist the Perfected of Heaven?
Divine soldiers strike to the left, the Mighty Slayer executes to the right,
Slaughtering, severing, and annihilating—wind and fire never cease.
Thousands upon thousands beheaded, myriads upon myriads destroyed in form,
Demons dare not test their might, ghosts dare not oppose or encroach.

The Three Officials of the Northern Feng scrutinize the ghostly camps—
Who dares harbor negligence or indulgence? Reports take flight to the throne.
Universally proclaimed to the ten directions, the boundless divine spirits,
The Emperors of the Eight Darknesses, all declare before the Purple Chamber.

The Primordial Nameless, neither turbid nor pure,
Divides into two halves—pristine mystery begins its leveling.
Accumulated subtleties form a fathom; great transformations give birth to regions.
Once the kalpa’s name is fixed, the dark shifts to Dragon Prosperity.

Vast and distant, the ancestral source,
Merges with the flourishing of celestial patterns.
Above, no radiant hues; below, no transformative abyss.
Wind courses through the Great Void, empty and boundless—
The sacred realm of spontaneity, the mystery of the Supreme Dao.

Azure skies descend to earth, metal and water form the heavens;
Between heaven above and heaven below, the great abode sinks into obscurity.
No brilliance, no shadow, no image, no form—
The primordial qi of the vast darkness, twin luminosities intertwined.

The Vermilion Clarity and Jade Emptiness revolve by nature;
Heaven’s Unity flows and transforms, inscribed on golden tablets and jade scrolls.
The supreme essence of the Vermilion Yang, the mysterious script of the Eight Enclosures,
Preserves and governs Kunlun, enduring through eternal kalpas.

The Brahmā qi pervades the net of Indra; the myriad dharmas unfold.
The primordial net interweaves, spanning the Nine Earths and Nine Heavens.
Revolving through emptiness, giving rise to billions upon billions,
Circling Mount Xiao, traversing the celestial paths.

Thirty-nine Emperors govern the Upper Prime,
The sacred realms of the ten directions rule the cinnabar mystery.
Within the mystery, the Supreme Perfected—
The Lofty Emperor of the Upper Radiance,
Floating in jade-hued mist, chanting in the Pure Cavern.
Golden light extends and flourishes, gazing upon the cloudy encampments;
Heavenly tones ring clear, divine radiance scatters like smoke.

The Great Xiao and Yu Luo, the luminous transformation of the Golden Canon,
A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—spontaneously perfected.
Within the Perfected dwells the spirit, the Great Lord of Longevity:
Azure Florescence crouches to the left, the Jade Consort squats to the right.
The Great Unity and the Controller of Destiny, Peach Prosperity in harmonious purity,
Hold talismans and grasp registers, preserving and delivering the numinous root.

Roaming the Purple Clarity, entering and exiting the Mysterious Cinnabar,
Within the Three Regions, amid the Six Poles.
Below, they guard the human body, the Hall of Light and the Crimson Palace,
Governing the five spirits, uniting the hundred bones.

Ten revolutions of wind, myriad qi ascend as immortals;
Flying spirits summon numina, transformations boundless.
The immortal path values life, boundlessly delivering beings—
The ten directions’ mysterious extremity opens the Eight Gates.
Soaring through the Three Realms, receiving scriptures in the Jade Chamber,
Sins and blessings, prohibitions and precepts, karmic causes and conditions.
All receive salvation and deliverance, Heaven rectifies their incarnations.
Having attained rebirth, they ascend to the various heavens.

Above the various heavens, each has its gate of life;
Within lies the Heavenly Prime’s chapter of union and transformation,
The Supreme Numinous Canon, its verses matching the Lofty Perfected.

**First: The Hymn of the Sacred Realm of the Ten Directions’ Soaring Void**
Mysterious light and vermilion motion, the Great Brahmā is nameless.
Soaring realms drift ethereally, transforming the nine gates of the celestial palace.
Jade cities spiral, the azure expanse unfolds in brightness.
Rotating terraces span ten thousand kalpas, their sounds and splendor resplendent.

Within stands the Great Sage,
Clad in dragon robes and tiger garments.
Atop his head, the Purple Chamber; at his waist, golden pendants.
Holding and grasping the four realms, transforming the central region.

If you can maintain long fasts, refining and delivering the flourishing of celestial patterns,
Sweeping away defilement from the purple portals, admitting the Perfected into the Crimson Chamber—
Two spirits hurl fire, the Primordial Unity radiates light.
Behold my true form, emerging to serve, rising and falling.

Resplendent in your cultivation, radiant at my side,
Riding the spirit to wander the verdant chambers and vermilion windows.
My Dao is profound and recondite, your heart aligns with the numinous homeland.

**Second: The Chapter of the Sacred Realm of the Ten Directions**
One qi transforms all, myriad realms become limpid.
The mysterious peaks rise jagged, the immortal capital is the Jade Metropolis.
Endless forests flourish in lush beauty, the great precincts of jade.
Crimson-robed, dragon-patterned, opening and transforming the roots of life.

The sagely destiny follows Heaven’s motion, the true Dao spreads forth.
Qi pierces the flying mist, knotting flowers inconstant.
Lofty towers reach a thousand feet, the mighty watchtower is the Hall of Light.
Dragons roam, tigers gallop, vermilion banners are the cloudy nets.

Hidden like the Great Void, manifest like the constellations spread.
Wherever they appear, they reveal the directions of good and evil.
Jade Perfected ride striped dragons, divine winds soar aloft.

**Third: The Hymn of the Sacred Realm of the Ten Directions**
In the Dragon Han’s great kalpa, the myriad forms are mysterious emptiness.
The Primordial Beginning opened Heaven, first creating emptiness.
The Great Cavern’s Upper Prime, the Pure Subtlety and Yu Remnant,
The numinous scripture’s nine instructions, the mysterious Perfected’s seven unfoldings.

The vast Eight Enclosures rise to the four corners.
The Vermilion Clarity inaugurates the kalpa, the sagely host governs the charts.
Five mountains rise jagged, the Vermilion Writ unfolds.
The vast celestial gates, the towering imperial abode—
Divine radiance descends to aid, ceasing the labors of the Three Paths.
Proclaiming amnesties at the river’s source, the true wind spreads widely.

Sing this hymn, and it accords with the sagely.
Above the Three Realms, amid the soaring void,
The Perfected Kings’ hymns, their verses matching the cavernous canons.
Recite it a hundred times, your name enters the Southern Palace.
Recite it a thousand times, the Perfected Kings protect and welcome.
Ten thousand recitations complete the Dao, soaring into the Great Void,
Transcending the Three Realms, attaining the rank of Immortal Duke.

Those who hear the numinous hymn, even demon kings show reverence.
They restrain earthly deities, escorting and welcoming.
Drawn from the earthly prisons, freed from the Five Sufferings and Eight Difficulties,
Seven generations of ancestors ascend, forever departing the dark gates.
Souls cross the Vermilion Mound, receiving refinement and rebirth—
This is called boundless deliverance, universal salvation without end.

There are secret celestial texts, revered by all heavens.
Those who reveal them carelessly fall into hell, bringing calamity to seven generations of ancestors.

The Dao declares: These two chapters are the hidden hymns of the Heavenly Emperors
and the Perfected Numinous Kings.
Profoundly revealing the supreme mystery, elucidating the great transformations,
They enable the celestial people to enter the sacred realms—
All are the words of the Great Brahmā, not the common speech of the world.

Words lack ornate cadence, melodies lack florid grace—
Thus they are called profound and obscure, difficult to trace in full.
Treasured by the heavens above, concealed within the Highest Divine Empyrean’s Jade Clarity Jade Repository.
When the Great Lord enacts the teachings, they spread in accordance with the flow of qi.
Should a perfected one offer gold and precious treasures with a sincere heart,
and follow the ancient rites to pledge allegiance to the Ten Heavens,
only then shall they be bestowed.

The Dao declares:
When the cycles of heaven and earth reach their end,
when the sun, moon, and five planets wane and wax,
when the most sagely and divine beings prosper or decline,
the ignorant and shallow suffer harm.
Whenever such calamities arise, all who share this qi must unite in heart,
perform purification rites, burn incense through the six watches,
and recite the scriptures ten times over—
blessings and virtue will descend at once, dispelling all misfortune.
These boundless texts deliver without end.

The Dao declares:
When those of shallow cultivation face the destined end of their immortal rank,
when their bodies pass through the Great Yin,
at the moment of transition, their fellow perfected ones shall burn incense on their behalf
and recite the scriptures ten times to deliver the corporeal form according to the rites.
Then the good deeds they performed in life, the hidden virtues they cultivated,
at the hour of their passing, the sacred realms of the ten directions shall manifest.
The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning shall sit in tranquil exposition,
or extend a hand to guide them, or send canopies to welcome them.
Their souls shall ascend directly to the Southern Palace,
and in accordance with their cultivation, they shall be reborn after a calculated span.
No longer bewildered by the turning of the wheel, they shall attain immortality.

The Dao declares:
When the cycles of heaven and earth reach their end,
when the constellations drift out of alignment,
when the sun and moon lose their light,
when the four seasons fall out of order,
when yin and yang fall into discord,
when nations suffer calamities,
when pestilence spreads and the people perish,
when masters, companions, and pure friends meet their end or face disaster—
all must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures.
The merit of purification rites and scripture recitation is immense:
above, it dispels heavenly disasters and safeguards the emperor;
below, it wards off poison and harm, delivering the multitudes.
From life to death, such blessings are beyond measure.
Thus it is said: boundless, universally delivering heaven and humanity.

The Dao declares:
Whoever possesses these scriptures and performs such meritorious deeds
for the lords of heaven and earth and the multitudes,
on days of calamity, if they resolve to perform purification rites, burn incense,
and recite the scriptures ten times,
all the heavens shall record their names,
ten thousand spirits shall attend and guard them,
and those who distinguish themselves as perfected ones
shall become ministers of the Golden Towers of the Sacred Lords.
The heavens record the merits and transgressions of all, not missing even a hair’s breadth.
The True Kings of Heaven shall also protect and recommend them,
and those who attain the Dao shall fully comprehend these profound words.

The boundless hidden speech of the Great Brahmā in the heavens,
composed by the Lord of the Dao—
*The Primordial Numinous Writ of the Ten Directions’ Sacred Realms: Secret Chapters of the Eight Heavens of the East.*

Amidst the thronging *tanyin* and *suo*, the mirror of the abyssal depths is summoned forth.
The numinous steed leaps beyond the net, its appointed brilliance veiled in obscurity.
The distant barriers stretch with jade-like vastness, where ordered capitals stand in tranquil harmony.
Shrouded in rocky fastnesses, the swift return to the encompassing vessel.
The crow’s sun unfurls in crimson, while the pale malevolence desiccates its edge.
In recompense for beauty, the *Bing* mountains, where jade-like purity and tainted essence intermingle.
Prayers prolong the seasons, and the verdant true ones emerge as radiant immortals.
Profound and serene, they gaze upon the still—only the most excellent perceive the subtle.
**The Eight Heavens of the South**

The *Dou* and *Xia* span vast strategies, the whale’s pool and the purple *Chan*.
The lame *Jiu* ponders, the southern *Xiao* teeters on the brink.
Precious standards advance, secret pacts inscribed in mystery.
Joyous melodies ascend, unbroken threads of progress.
They hasten toward the *Taiyi*, parting from the salty to wield authority.
Indigo clings in order, ascending heights in measured proclamation.
Numinous rites soar in splendor, towers and cities surveyed.
The *Ji* faction aids the drive, the cavern’s flute resounds through the deep.
**The Eight Heavens of the West**

The *Ku* peaks stand in harmonious array, hills of compassion bear first sorrow.
The *Geng* well and dragon’s net, cypress chambers where incense lingers.
Pouring from the *Xie* cliffs, the currents surge; the screen of hemp bids farewell to truth.
Cloud-borne karma defines form, the worn and many sink into spirit.
Piercing emptiness with *lang* and *qu*, the swallow’s capital gleams in stillness.
Kindred stir the rustic, wisdom transmits the *Qi* counsels.
The mixed awakening probes the numinous, severing coarse roots.
Bright reeds shed their sheaths, the city’s ruins stretch boundless.
**The Eight Heavens of the North**

The *Hou* and *Wang* trace origins, unfolding radiance to seize the numinous.
Garments thicken with covenants, the *Guo* multiply the people’s paths.
Refining the deep in frigid caverns, summoning immortals with the *Ben* wheel.
The undulating realms of leisure vie in luminous forms.
Early *qi* smelts the east, the overseer of sprouts adjudicates alike.
Wisdom soars in circling brilliance, the *Gui* and *Lin* press toward equilibrium.
The cavern nurtures distant realms, the *Ying* and *Kui* pay homage to abundance.
Myriad immortals unite in perfection, the empty and numinous achieve their work.

The Dao speaks: These are the boundless hidden speeches of the Great Brahmā within the ten directions’ sacred realms, the sounds of the infinite. The ancient text inscribed them above the Jade Capitals of the Ten Directions’ Terrace-Heavens, where divine transformations manifest across the ten directions, the numinous responds as it emerges, and the empty converges with the subtle Dao. Those who awaken to their meaning shall perceive the divine lands and sacred realms in their entirety.

Each character spans a *zhang* in breadth. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign of Old inscribed these words to establish the correct intonation. Those who know their sounds and recite them with purificatory devotion shall have the divine kings of the ten directions’ sacred realms descend to observe their persons, record their meritorious diligence, and memorialize the heavens above. Myriad spirits shall pay homage, earthly deities attend at their gates, and the great perfected kings of virtue shall recommend them as transcendent beings. With the Dao complete, they shall attain the ability to wander the Three Realms and ascend through the Golden Gate.

This sound repels all, expiates all, delivers all, and accomplishes all—it is the spontaneous sound of the Heavenly Perfected. Thus, reciting it summons the flying heavens of the ten directions to descend in observation. The Supreme Emperor chants from afar, myriad spirits pay homage, the Three Realms attend in reverence, and all malevolent forces bow their heads. Ghostly essences vanish of themselves, the resonance of jade and jasper shakes the ten directions into solemn clarity. Rivers and seas grow still, mountains and peaks swallow their mists, and the myriad spirits tremble in submission. Immortals are gathered, the heavens are purged of impurity, the earth is cleansed of demonic dust, and profound wisdom illumines the depths. Vast and mysterious, the infinite unfolds.

*The Marvelous Scripture of the Upper Chapters on the Limitless Salvation of Humanity, Scroll the Nineteenth—Concluded*
*Scroll the Twentieth*

**The Chapter on the Azure Vault’s Empty Song**

The Dao spoke: Long ago, in the Primordial Azure Heaven, within the Great Floating Li Land of the Azure Vault’s Empty Song, the Original Beginning received the spontaneous sounds of the Limitless Salvation’s Cavernous Numinous Chapters. The Azure Vault coiled through the void, celestial rosy clouds flowed in ripples, divine winds stirred and surged, and myriad tones harmonized in resonance. Rising and sinking, clear and turbid, swelling and fading, intertwining to form a song—its voice pierced through all, and the heavens joined in chorus. At that moment, all things in heaven and earth, even the voiceless, spoke as one, expounding the Dao and establishing the teachings. The Mysterious was revealed, the School founded, and all living beings came to understand the principles and illumine the Dharma.

When the Most High Heavenly Worthy expounded this scripture, he circled ten times to summon the Azure Vault worlds of the ten directions. Flying rosy clouds wove into strands, wondrous as jeweled nets, and all heavenly beings—dragon chariots and phoenix canopies—flashed to and fro. Passing through dark caverns, the azure void blazed with radiance, utterly unbounded, its luminous glow streaming like shadows. Illuminating one to penetrate ten thousand, a divine wind arose within, its pace swift or slow as all attained deliverance, their songs and chants attuned to rhythm. The empty zither’s Dharma-sounds filled all without limit; pearl towers and jeweled palaces all emitted numinous melodies. They praised the Dao, praised the Dharma, praised the Immortals, exhorting all heavenly beings to cultivate meritorious deeds and deeply awaken to the Supreme Dao.

Heavenly Perfected, Great Spirits, Lofty and Venerable Transcendents, Perfected Ones of Wondrous Practice, Azure Vault’s Utmost Perfected, spontaneous singers of the Empty Song, Jade Lads and Jade Maidens—an innumerable host—rode the void to arrive. The azure emptiness congealed in stillness, the cold azure shone with cavernous clarity. Jade steeds and whirlwind wheels, jeweled parasols unfurled their shade; celestial tones and wondrous chants arose in hidden interplay. Ninefold lights coiled and circled, fivefold brilliances suffused and gleamed. For seven days and seven nights, the inner Perfected of all heavens ascended their terraced towers, striking celestial drums in unison. Dragons and tigers roared, the stellar loom swayed in the east, and within the twenty-four heavens’ jeweled palaces, all merged into azure hue. Peaks rose like waves stilled, the seven luminaries gleamed with luster, clouds drifted and winds hushed. The vast expanse stretched bright and clear, forming a single realm. Lands, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees—all lay level and equal, without height or depth. Heaven and sea embraced in a ring, the earth’s jade glowed with verdant splendor. The cavernous song flowed purely, without distinction of hue.

The assembled Perfected attended in their seats as the Most High Heavenly Worthy sat in profound stillness upon the Ninefold Azure Jade Terrace, the divine dragon’s myriad-pearl throne. When the scripture was expounded once, the Azure Void’s Empty Song resounded, and all voices joined in praise. Then, every man and woman in the realm, hearing through windows and gates, perceived even the most secluded sounds.

When expounded a second time, flower lads scattered radiance, illuminating without limit.

When expounded a third time, the Azure Vault formed its tones, divine winds played gently, and words rang clear and resonant.

When expounded a fourth time, great wisdom encompassed all, and the Dharma-body became universally identical.

When expounded a fifth time, those who heard the song awakened to the Dharma, returning to their origin and restoring their mandate.

When expounded a sixth time, they beheld their bodies and surroundings, pure as precious pearls, manifesting colors according to direction, while the Dao and emptiness remained unchanging.

When expounded a seventh time, they realized this Empty Song arose neither from inception nor cessation; rosy clouds spread and winds arrived, tones tuned themselves, and entering the Dao to ascend as Perfected, the principle was attained thereby.

When expounded an eighth time, they wandered through floating palaces and towers, drifting through the azure void, where inner tones and pure songs flowed, now hidden, now revealed.

When expounded a ninth time, the empty cavern gave birth to flowers, surging to form a thousand realms. Heavenly beings, men and women, entered and exited the Yellow Chamber, sinking into azure to return to the void, revealing the Dao’s essence.

When expounded a tenth time, rosy clouds spread across the ten directions, and the song formed ninefold harmonies. Above, it reached the Great Illumination; below, it opened the darkest night. Heavenly beings rejoiced greatly, and the Numinous Treasure manifested auspicious signs. Then, every man and woman in the realm, without exception, joined their hands in celestial knots, set their feet upon cloud-lattices, and soared in bodily form to the Upper Clarity, all receiving protection and deliverance, attaining longevity without end.

The Dao spoke: At that time, when the Most High Heavenly Worthy expounded the scripture once, the Azure Vault’s Empty Song Utmost Perfected Great Spirits of the eastern direction—an innumerable host—floated through the void to arrive.

When expounded a second time, the Azure Vault’s Empty Song Utmost Perfected Great Spirits of the southern direction—an innumerable host—floated through the void to arrive.

When expounded a third time, the Azure Vault’s Empty Song Utmost Perfected Great Spirits of the western direction—an innumerable host—floated through the void to arrive.

When expounded a fourth time, the Azure Vault’s Empty Song Utmost Perfected Great Spirits of the northern direction—an innumerable host—floated through the void to arrive.

When expounded a fifth time, the Azure Vault’s Empty Song Utmost Perfected Great Spirits of the northeastern direction—an innumerable host—floated through the void to arrive.

When expounded a sixth time, the Azure Vault’s Empty Song Utmost Perfected Great Spirits of the southeastern direction—an innumerable host—floated through the void to arrive.

When expounded a seventh time, the Azure Vault’s Empty Song Utmost Perfected Great Spirits of the southwestern direction—an innumerable host—floated through the void to arrive.

When expounded an eighth time, the Azure Vault’s Empty Song Utmost Perfected Great Spirits of the northwestern direction—an innumerable host—floated through the void to arrive.

When expounded a ninth time, the Azure Vault’s Empty Song Utmost Perfected Great Spirits of the upper direction—an innumerable host—floated through the void to arrive.

When expounded a tenth time, the Azure Vault’s Empty Song Utmost Perfected Great Spirits of the lower direction—an innumerable host—floated through the void to arrive.

When the tenfold circling was complete, the ten directions were without limit. The Azure Vault’s Empty Song Utmost Perfected Great Spirits arrived all at once. Every man and woman in the realm, hearing and awakening to the Dharma-sounds, turned their hearts in reverence. Those who came produced a sound like boundless winds and clouds, a vast and unparalleled resonance—before their forms were seen, this sound was heard first. Scenes like songs and ballads, laughter and praise, sorrowful weeping and jade pendants’ chime, footsteps without end—myriad tones surged forth, filling the realm’s bounds, unstoppable.

Then the Most High extended his hand to grasp the Azure Vault’s long strands of rosy clouds, curling his jeweled palm into a circle like an azure pearl. Its luminous brilliance pierced through the ten-directional worlds, revealing the Azure Vault’s Empty Song as a matter without bounds, as near as one’s brows and lashes. Gazing down or glancing aside, all appeared as pure beryl. First, he displayed the Dharma assembly; next, the great multitude. Before their gazes lingered long, in an instant, he cast it into the void, nine kalpas above the earth, vast as a shooting star.

The Most High ascended, and the celestial perfected deities, the supreme sages and exalted venerables, the wondrous practitioners and upright ones—boundless across the ten directions—along with the Empty Song of the Azure Vault, the utmost true great deities, and the innumerable multitudes, all entered the wondrous radiance of the shooting star. Every celestial and human being ascended without exception. The divine light blazed resplendent: those outside saw within, those within saw without; those above seemed to cling, those below seemed to gaze upward. Inner and outer were wholly illumined, their source unknown. All beheld one another, merged in the same luminous body, every point suffused with a single light. The Empty Song resounded of itself; the azure clouds thickened and swirled; the divine winds chimed and rang. The jade cities of the ten directions shone with equal splendor, while the boundless celestial beings knew not where they stood.

Then, within the wondrous radiance of the jeweled light, the Most High expounded this Empty Song of the Azure Vault as the Dao of transcendence, the Dharma of longevity, the source of great transformation, the profound and wondrous origin. All beings of the ten directions, possessing this sacred mind, could comprehend with eyes, ears, mouth, and nose. Every realm of the Dao had not arisen but from the Azure Vault’s emptiness, where the Empty Song resounded, the Dharma-sound of the utmost Dao pervading all living kinds. In response to their words, the sound answered—thus the Dao was born.

When the discourse on the Dharma was complete, the assembled perfected observed and transmitted it to me. At that moment, joy and celebration defied expression. The Dharma rites concluded in rough outline, and the myriad heavens returned to their stations. In an instant, all fell silent, without lingering echo.

At that time, the celestial and human beings who encountered this scripture universally awakened, thoroughly discerning their original true nature. They knew this azure cloud to be the primordial essence of the Most High. When heaven and earth first opened, the cloud’s essence scattered afar, weaving and unfolding like warp and weft, threads and strands. The wind stirred within, and the five tones arose together—not crafted by heaven, not born of conditions. Thus they knew the Dao’s mystery naturally produced sound. Hearing this numinous tone, the eyes and mind opened to discernment; distinctions arose, and the true Dao was awakened. Within soundlessness, distant chanting was heard. The Dao knows no end; with hearts inclined, all turned in reverence, cultivating the great mind—without action, without desire, without intent, without thought, without love, without attachment, without attainment, without emptiness, without reality, without diminution, without birth.

Words held no deceit; speech bore no harsh sound. Equal in compassion and love, even strangers became kin. The land was at peace, the people prosperous, rejoicing in great harmony. From the scripture’s first teaching, the entire realm embraced the Dao, baring their utmost hearts, chanting and revering in homage. All attained deliverance from the world.

The Dao declared: All spoken in the scripture expounded by the Most High Celestial Worthy is the Empty Song of the Azure Vault, where azure clouds scatter in the four directions and divine winds murmur in secret, striking and strumming to produce sound. Within it unfolds the inner names of the Celestial Emperors of the various heavens, the hidden rhymes of sound—also the inner taboo names of the divine kings of the ten directions and the concealed names of the hundred spirits. These are no ordinary words of the world.

The exalted sages who have attained perfection and the perfected ones who fathom the profound and subtle can fully grasp its verses. Reciting them ten times, the Empty Cavern becomes song. The divine sound resonates afar; ten thousand emperors bow their heads, a thousand perfected stand in awe. The seas calm, weapons lay down; the celestial valleys conceal their mists. The Three Luminaries halt their wheels; scales and balances cease their motion. The Eight Mighties stir their qi; the myriad demons lose their sight. Green bones flourish anew; numinous skeletons return to life.

For the most devoted scholars who recite it ten times, the Three Origins will attend their carriage, the Five Emperors ride alongside. They can seal mountains and summon clouds, command demonic camps, heal illness and deliver from calamity, sever fate and restore life. This is because the scholar’s body penetrates the utmost straightness, their qi harmonizes with the Azure Mystery. The scripture of the Azure Vault is engraved upon their heart and bones. They can summon and command the Three Realms, govern the celestial bureaus, admonish the earthly officials, swiftly dispatch demonic ugliness, enjoy endless years, restore form, and deliver beings.

To recite this scripture lightly brings seven generations of misfortune. To uphold it with reverence and devotion ensures the flourishing of the Dao, prosperity through the ages, and favorable karmic connections. Ten thousand trials cannot disturb it; numinous beings descend to one’s chamber. This scripture is supremely wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital, delivering countless beings. Illuminating the sound of the Azure Vault, it is the august and peerless origin of the Dao.

The Dao declared: Whoever recites this scripture ten times will summon all the heavens. A hundred million ancestors and suffering souls in the dark realms will all receive deliverance, ascending to the Eastern Flowery Azure Palace. The Empty Song calls the souls; the souls recognize its sound and return to attach to the body. The souls refine the true qi, returning to life as humans. They can consume the mysterious radiance of the azure clouds and bathe their spirits in the divine winds to open their robes.

Those who diligently study this scripture, fulfilling their merit and perfecting their virtue, all attain divine transcendence, ascending to the Jade Palaces to wander and feast in the azure void. The most devoted scholars who cultivate and recite this scripture will all receive deliverance, ascending to the Azure Palace. Worldly beings who recite it will prolong their lives and attain longevity, later achieving the Dao of liberation through apparent death. Their souls and spirits briefly vanish, yet they hear the Empty Song and do not stray into delusion. Like one removing a garment, their spirits rest in peace, their qi settled. They become sacred beings, spared from the hells.

Using obscurity to attain clarity, the heart unites with the Dao. Universally delivering celestial and human beings, none fail to receive blessings. Boundless merit extends to life and death. Treasured by heaven, it is not transmitted to the lower world. The most devoted offer gold and treasures, pledging to heaven in transmission. To treat it lightly or with disdain brings calamity upon nine generations, condemning them to long servitude under demonic officials.

The Azure Emperor of the Empty Song of the Azure Vault, along with twenty-four Jade Lads and twenty-four Jade Maidens, guards the scripture’s divine text, protecting and sheltering those who receive it.

The Dao declared: During the long fast of the first month, recite and chant this scripture to open the qi of the Azure Cloud’s first arising, delivering the souls of past generations from the long night’s toil in the Cold Pool, reviving their souls and spirits to ascend to the Azure Palace. During the long fast of the seventh month, recite and chant this scripture to descend the numinous sound of the Azure Vault and moisten the adamantine qi of the Golden Perfected. Thus the Three Fields are purified, the body attains divine transcendence, the Azure Vault forms its scripture, and immortal names are inscribed. On the azure jade tablets, death is erased and life is recorded.

During the long fast of the tenth month, recite and chant this scripture so that the Azure Cloud forms its talismanic seals, the Empty Cavern manifests its text, and the numinous sound of the Mysterious Artisan offers felicitations to the Imperial Divine. On the azure jade tablets, the tally is held; from the Eastern Culmen, the scripture is conferred. Ruler and minister, father and son—all enjoy virtue for ten thousand years. The Four Seas know great peace, and from generation to generation, it never ceases. As lord of the realm under Heaven, one securely stabilizes the ten directions, enduring through kalpas without end.

On the days of the Eight Nodal Festivals, recite and chant this scripture so that the Eight Winds carry their resounding tones and the Azure Vault suspends its text. Consuming the swallow’s azure sprout, one attains the rank of Upper Perfected.

On the day of one’s life-destiny, recite and chant this scripture so that the hun-souls become true, the po-souls numinous, and jade blossoms grow within the bones. The body attains longevity, harmonizing with the Dao, and suffers no worldly calamities. The radiance of the embryonic landscape shines brightly; the Three Elders bestow destiny, and the Five Emperors govern the capital. The divine administrators present their morning obeisance, and one’s name is inscribed in the heavens above. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, one ascends in flight to the Upper Clarity.

The Dao declared: On the days of performing the Dao, one must bathe in fragrant waters, enter the chamber in purification, face east, and knock the teeth twenty-four times to be heard by the Twenty-Four Heavens. Bow in reverence twenty-four times, then close the eyes. In stillness, visualize the body seated amidst clouds of azure, yellow, and white qi. After a long while, they transform into Azure Cloud, and within and without, all becomes dimly luminous. A Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Lion, and White Crane array themselves to left and right, while sun and moon illuminate the chamber with their brilliance. A circular image appears above the neck, its light suffusing the ten directions. When this vision becomes distinct, recite the secret incantation in silence:

Supreme Mystery and Primordial, the Most High Dao Lord. Summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Attendants of the Left and Right, the Jade Lads who tend incense, the Jade Maidens who transmit words, the Twenty-Four Direct Attendants of the Five Thearchs, the Incense Officials of the Day—each in their twenty-four ranks—to receive and convey these words. Today is an auspicious and joyous day. The hall is pure, the fast unbroken. The scripture of cultivation is recited, its boundless power to deliver beings. May these words ascend directly to the august presence of the Supreme Twenty-Four Heavens’ Primordial Thearch before his throne.

This done, draw in qi twenty-four times. Facing east, recite the scripture:

*The Supreme Scripture of Boundless Deliverance, the Wondrous Sutra of Primordial Limitless Salvation*
Primordial Cavern-Mystery, Numinous Treasure’s original text,
Azure Empyrean’s empty hymn, nine transformations to deliver beings.
Divine tones conceal their rhymes, parting and uniting by nature.
Chaos and the Great Void—
Void beyond void, void as vast emptiness,
emptiness conjoined with the Dao, emptiness reaching its limit and becoming luminous.
Luminosity is yang essence, yang essence is fire,
fire is the Primordial, the Cavern-Yang’s crimson qi.
Within crimson qi, a yellow halo takes form;
the yellow halo is earth, the fire’s child.
The qi of fire and earth, refined ninefold, grows firm—
firmness is the nature of metal, metal subdued becomes lead.
Lead transforms into water, water gives rise to wood’s abode,
called Azure, Yellow, White—the Mysterious Primordial.
The Three Qi plant their root; fire’s power refines them.
After ninety thousand years, their color congeals as azure,
its jade-like radiance shimmering.
The crystal gleams, now soaring, now leaping,
now crouching, now flying, now emerging, now vanishing,
now pacing, now racing.
Yin fire becomes wind, yang light becomes fire.
Wind and fire unite their powers; azure crystal fuses and disperses,
now cloud, now mist, now east, now west.
Divine wind stirs it; azure mist branches forth,
its limbs bending and twisting, now upright, now aslant.
Round as a ring, sharp as a ritual tablet,
its movements ever-changing, beyond mortal sight.
The azure void stretches boundless, its light embracing the four directions,
mist unfurling to the eight poles, wondrous in its transformations.
The Heavenly Elder Thearch takes up his brush to bestow it,
modeling it into celestial script. The Cavern’s tones run deep and subtle,
the cloud-mist’s writing—Three Origins, Eight Mighties,
Sixty-Four Sections—each form fitting its purpose.
Dragons ascend their heavens, phoenixes soar to the imperial chariot,
unicorns repose on jeweled thoroughfares, tortoises tread marshlands’ edges.
Three, nine, five, seven—constellations linked in sequence,
Straddler, Chamber, Net, and Purple Tenuity govern the Ten Heavens.
Azure mist spreads and arrays, weaving its mechanism,
falling like a net, binding without end.
Its center hollow, embracing emptiness, wind hums within.
Divine tones arise naturally, now hidden, now revealed, circling and soaring.
The Cavern’s hymn, jade script, the Numinous Treasure’s secret chapters,
the inner illumination of the Supreme Perfected, words of transcendence and ascent.
At the first hearing of the empty hymn, the palace of the brain emits smoke,
purple qi fills the chamber, the Six Dings draw near.
Without the hymn, no light; without the hymn, no clarity;
without the hymn, no establishment; without the hymn, no completion;
without the hymn, no deliverance; without the hymn, no life—
this is the Great Brahma, the Azure Empyrean’s empty hymn, the Shangqing’s divine tones.
To shed the bonds of death and life, the heaven within heaven,
the verdant terraces of Yu Luo, the jade mountain’s upper capital.
Supreme beyond the supreme, the Great Canopy’s Jade Clarity,
fathomless kalpas, now gone, now present.
All possess the Azure Empyrean, the natural empty hymn.
Singing praises to the Supreme Perfected, the Cavern unseals celestial numina.
The myriad spirits of heaven and earth gain their names through the hymn;
the Azure Void’s divine tones—call, and they are heard.
Thus are born the divine and numinous, and all the Supreme Perfected.
The secret taboos hold it in reverence; through the hymn, its light is revealed.
Within the Azure Empyrean, vast and indistinct,
a Jade Perfected breathes forth misty qi.
Azure mist and Brahma qi encircle the ten directions,
within them, the divine power to deliver beings from death.
In the Eastern Ultimate’s palace, the Lord of Azure Florescence,
within it, the divine of the empty hymn’s natural tones,
within it, the Azure Thearch of Life’s Favor, the Nine Numinous and Most Wondrous Power of Life.
The Azure Void’s True Elder, the Heaven-Transforming Venerable,
within it, the Shangqing’s *Azure Mist’s Empty Ultimate Jade Chant*, the Cavern’s script of the Supreme Perfected,
the Lord of Heavenly Unity, who delivers life and refines the spirit.

Today, the reckoning is recorded; all heavens descend in state.
The Eastern Ultimate’s Azure Empyrean Empty Hymn Jade-Toned Divine King,
Great Sage of Boundless Deliverance and Eternal Life.
The Southern Ultimate’s Azure Empyrean Empty Hymn Jade-Toned Divine King,
Great Sage of Boundless Deliverance and Eternal Life.
The Western Ultimate’s Azure Empyrean Empty Hymn Jade-Toned Divine King,
Great Sage of Boundless Deliverance and Eternal Life.
The Northern Ultimate’s Azure Empyrean Empty Hymn Jade-Toned Divine King,
Great Sage of Boundless Deliverance and Eternal Life.
The Northeastern Ultimate’s Azure Empyrean Empty Hymn Jade-Toned Divine King,
Great Sage of Boundless Deliverance and Eternal Life.
The Southeastern Ultimate’s Azure Empyrean Empty Hymn Jade-Toned Divine King,
Great Sage of Boundless Deliverance and Eternal Life.
The Southwestern Ultimate’s Azure Empyrean Empty Hymn Jade-Toned Divine King,
Great Sage of Boundless Deliverance and Eternal Life.
The Northwestern Ultimate’s Azure Empyrean Empty Hymn Jade-Toned Divine King,
Great Sage of Boundless Deliverance and Eternal Life.
The Upper Ultimate’s Azure Empyrean Empty Hymn Jade-Toned Divine King,
Great Sage of Boundless Deliverance and Eternal Life.
The Lower Ultimate’s Azure Empyrean Empty Hymn Jade-Toned Divine King,
Great Sage of Boundless Deliverance and Eternal Life.
The Ten Directions’ Supreme Perfected Azure Empyrean Empty Hymn Jade-Toned Divine Kings,
Great Divinities of Boundless Deliverance and Eternal Life—
all ride azure-green chariots with wheel-patterned wheels,
drawn by green phoenixes and dark-armored black dragons,
bearing banners of azure mist, ten sacred pennants,
flutes of jade sounding in unison before, flutes of jasper harmonizing behind,
divine birds and dark cranes joining their voices in resonant song,
their melodies blending with the empty hymn, flowing in perfect accord.
Heavenly ministers hold their tablets, marshals steady the chariot poles,
myriad chariots and ten thousand riders surge forth on azure waves,
their hymns shaking seas and mountains, their voices piercing metal and stone.
Their radiant light turns back; their procession oversees the deliverance of the true and the living.
The heavens’ chancellors, the Shangqing’s dukes and ministers,
the numinous palaces of the Empyrean’s heights, the Azure Void’s Great Sages,
the cloud encampments’ four bureaus, the nine paths of the firm winds,
the inspecting immortals’ great divinities—
all, bearing registers and celestial charts, assemble before the Thearch,
to review and verify the immortals’ names, to rigorously examine the Six Heavens.

Those who comprehend the empty hymns of the Azure Vault’s cavern-chapters, whose divine embrace spans the Great Void and whose qi abides in the vast abyss, transcend worldly calamities and fulfill their karmic destiny as immortals. A universal proclamation resounds through the Three Realms, the boundless divine lands, and the subterranean courts of the Yellow Springs—save only those realms barred by Heaven’s pivots, the nine solar boundaries of the Azure Mist’s towering ramparts, whose registers lie with the Three Bureaus, whose ranks extend through the Nine Treasuries and the Twelve River Sources.

They absolve their ancestors and progenitors across kalpas, their kin bound by countless ties, resolving hidden grievances and ancestral lawsuits, erasing the records of transgressions, swiftly severing evil roots to prevent confinement, delivering souls to immortality. By the Primordial Beginning’s decree, their ascent is timed to the hour: the Night River’s accumulated corpses, the polluted streams of the Cold Springs, the concealed torments of sin—all are examined to govern form and soul. They are graded in the Azure Palace, their bones enveloped in azure mist, their divine tones entering the Mystery, summoning the hundred spirits to restore the Nine Palaces.

Those whose bodies receive deliverance endure kalpa after kalpa, forever freed from the wheel of rebirth, aging in harmony with the Dao. They eternally transcend the pillars of suffering, the radiance of life opening as death’s terrors dissolve through the Eight Passes, ascending to everlasting life, surmounting lingering tribulations, and roaming freely in the Shangqing. The heavens of the Shangqing, the qi of the Azure Vault—these are the practices of the Brahmanic path.

**The Six Heavens of the East**
The qi of the Azure Vault arises at Horn Mansion, one *du* per instant, one *xu* per breath, gradually advancing northward.
- Azure Brahmanic Profound Void Heaven: The Thearch deeply awakens to the assembly of heroes.

The Twenty-Four Heavens, the Twenty-Four Thearchs, the Azure Vault’s hidden texts, the Azure Vault’s hidden names—within the Azure Vault’s heavens, the empty cavern is naturally so. The empty hymns and numinous tones are the hidden rhythms of all heavens. The tones within heaven, the honor within heaven, the spirits within heaven, the jade texts within heaven, the numina within heaven. The Nine Transformations and Six Harmonies transform into the Shangqing, the mysteries of the Azure Vault too profound to fathom.

The dissemination of the utmost truth universally delivers gods and humans. Cloudy chapters and rosy scriptures curve and bend into sound. Metal is clear, earth is turbid; wood floats, fire is light; the Great One becomes water—its tones are wholly blended. The five qi assume their positions, the five palaces are thus formed, azure mist weaves through the void, divine winds stir and chant. Flowing *shang*, restrained *zhi*, containing *gong*, nurturing *yu*—the empty hymns harmonize in concert, and the myriad heavens rise in dance. Today is the great celebration: receiving deliverance in the Azure Heavens. Proclaiming through the Three Origins, beseeching the severance of the Five *You*, the karmic enmities of seven generations are erased, the roots of death are excised, life’s origin is renewed, and souls depart the Great Yin. Mounting azure dragons, they bow to jade maidens and sit upright in the Hall of Light.

Descending to wander the Nine Palaces, subduing the celestial prisons, concealing themselves in the Eight Earths, appearing and vanishing without fixed abode. The Azure Vault’s utmost truth, the jade tones of the divine king, gather mists and gather qi, sealing the gates of ghosts. The Eastern Dipper’s jade light, the Western Dipper’s luminous splendor, the Northern Dipper’s supreme wonder, the Southern Dipper’s brilliance, the Central Dipper’s yellow clouds—covering the realm of our lives, the five qi interweave with rosy mist, composing the Azure Vault’s chapters.

The Azure Thearch wields the staff, the White Thearch shakes the bronze chime, the Red Thearch strikes the drum, the Black Thearch casts the bell, the Yellow Thearch offers the jade vessel. Breaths are exhaled to raise the tones, harmonizing the empty hymns in the Azure Vault’s immortal capital. Within it resides the Great August One, clad in flying azure, leftward summoning the Earl of Hua, rightward summoning the Lord of Cheng.

The Azure Heaven’s jade tones form jade texts of their own. The Red Heaven’s jade tones manifest divine traces in the celestial scriptures. The White Heaven’s jade tones strike stone and knock on jade. The Black Heaven’s jade tones flourish with myriad feathers. The Yellow Heaven’s jade tones chant the divine hymns of the Great Clarity. The five heavens’ jade tones ascend together in the Azure Vault. The empty hymns and Brahmanic echoes sing of the nameless Dao.

The boundless divine king rides a tiger and mounts a whale, spewing fire for ten thousand *li*, commanding flying thunder to garrison the troops. Floating through the azure void’s radiance, descending to the utmost depths of darkness, he slaughters, beheads, and dismembers, annihilating the ghostly encampments. The great demons of all heavens, the stern guards of the fire troops, the qi of the Six Heavens, the foremost names of the hundred spirits—all purge the demonic capitals, utterly extinguishing the cavern’s gloom. Brandishing spears and waving banners, arrows fly and drums boil over. Cries resound through the northern mountains, leaving no ghost to escape form. The Five Thearchs receive their mandates, the Four Lords audit the registers. Those with merit are recorded; those with faults are suspended. The ghost lords have six eyes, the lightning masters have *yun*-bodies. Flowing fire and surging poison swiftly converge on all eight paths. Should any dare to resist or obstruct the perfected ones, the Azure Vault’s divine tones, the natural scriptures, the Jade Thearch’s decrees, the Shangqing’s talismans, fire bells and wind chimes—all lead the myriad spirits forward.

A universal proclamation resounds without end—let the Six Heavens all hearken, the Three Realms and Five Thearchs array their words before the Azure Void.

The primordial Jade Essence of the Origin, its radiance stored in azure vaults, suffuses the boundless dark, and the divine Dao unfolds. The Great Void stretches vast, the myriad perfected ones open the charts; above they float, below they sink, east they coil, west they unfurl. Streaming hues fill the Nine Gates, resplendent light adorns the Three Paths. The Most High Divine Lords wield authority over being and non-being. Jade axes and golden thunderbolts—ten thousand heavens raise their voices; the Cavernous Scriptures spread in four directions, the mottled Treasure Books gleam.

Azure auroras spew forth rays, dragons soar and phoenixes ascend; threads of immortal brocade drift, clouds coil around sacred tablets. The heroes of the Azure Void’s Dao transform without limit. In heaven above, on earth below—no emptiness, no darkness, no light, no sound, no color, no name. Vast and boundless, merged into oneness, neither formed nor completed.

Completion and the Dao take form, and that form is the Jade Capital. Azure peaks tower high, the Great Existence’s wondrous courts. Within resides the Origin’s Beginning, whose visage outshines the feminine infant. Clad in a blue-green robe, girded with a sash of moonlight, crowned with divine radiance, riding the Five Spirits. Azure auroras congeal in the void, divine winds surge through the eight directions; the Valley Spirit hums in the dark, the empty song bears sound.

This is the Numinous Treasure’s Red Script, the Nine Heavens’ True Writ, preserving and governing the kalpas’ fate—my Dao endures forever.

The Azure Empyrean spreads boundlessly, the ten thousand forms expand in full. Wondrous qi revolves and redeems the Twenty-Four Heavens. The wheel turns through Horn and Horn, Well and Ghost, Willow and Chamber; qi enters the Supreme Mystery, following the Dipper’s rise and fall. Where primordial qi flows, creation and the Great Yang arise. Qi is refined into script, script interweaves into sound. Sound, stirred by wind, becomes the aurora’s ninefold numen. Its chants shake demons, subduing the Dark River below.

Azure mists spiral rightward, gathering qi into the Supreme Origin. Void and azure merge with darkness, qi enters the Mystery of Mysteries. Within the Mystery, the Jade Honored One cradles the sun to shine, pacing the Dragon Marsh, inspecting and commanding the Crimson Host. Whoever dares oppose me shall be slain by the Heavenly Soldiers. Divine banners ripple in jade-green, waves surge through the Great Clarity. Purple clouds weave blossoms, green petals scatter through the courts. A thousand partings, ten thousand unions—qi is refined into the perfected.

Within the perfected dwells the divine: the Azure Perfected ascends as consort, auroral script and immortal branches, the Supreme Unity’s lofty perfected. The Celestial Throne’s Jade Aides, the Heavenly Elders as ministers, exhale yin and inhale yang, preserving life at the Crimson Ford. Above they wander the Supreme Clarity, entering and leaving the cinnabar chambers. Within the Three Caverns, below they connect to the Yellow Court. White clouds guard the dark gates, pristine frost layers the peaks; azure mists weave their welcome, descending to guard the human body.

The Orchid Terrace holds a palace, its walls of purple jade. Within resides a great spirit, named Non-Male. His body shines with blue-green light, his mouth swallows jade nectar. Transforming naturally, he merges with the formless void. He governs the Five Dippers, commands and restrains the hundred spirits. The Nine Paths return to brightness, the Three Origins respond to the immortals.

The immortal Dao values the true; immeasurable is the deliverance of beings. Above they enter the Mystery Gate, soaring through the Nine Celestial Palaces. Transgressions and blessings, prohibitions and precepts, karmic causes from past lives—ascending the Flowery Palace, they escape the dark underworld. Bones are refined, corpses destroyed; flying souls gain new bodies. Having attained rebirth, they ascend to report before the myriad heavens.

Above the myriad heavens, the vast and open immortal gates. Within resides a divine king, singing the Azure Empyrean’s empty song—the Dao’s mysterious verses, words that join the lofty perfected.

**First: The East’s Boundless Azure Empyrean’s Empty Song of the Jade-Sound Divine King**
Utterly non-divine, the Dao receives its numen.
Transforming without limit, its use is most divine.
The Dao does not display the divine—supreme transformation is dark.
Divine smoke billows in blue-green, carefree in the Jade Capital.

**Second: The South’s Boundless Azure Empyrean’s Empty Song of the Jade-Sound Divine King**
Faint and distant, the Terrace of Reaching;
flowery patterns, dragon-script.
This empty song is completed—
the Azure Palace’s crimson chariot.
Roaming the Nine Heavens, its command sounds like pipes and flutes.
Chanting this Dao-King, utterly true without remainder.

**Third: The West’s Boundless Azure Empyrean’s Empty Song of the Jade-Sound Divine King**
Straddling the western curtains, bright and scattered are the stars.
The azure void contains qi, qi equal to the void.
True qi has no form, the true Dao has no name.
Relying on this emptiness, the Jade Perfected forms naturally.

**Fourth: The North’s Boundless Azure Empyrean’s Empty Song of the Jade-Sound Divine King**
The Great Ox and Dark Plow—
in Xu and Hai they drink.
The womb of yin is removed, the Celestial Dipper shines brilliantly.
Nurturing the ten thousand kinds, harmonizing the Six Principles.
Wailing in the night, the ghostly courts scatter.

**Fifth: The Northeast’s Boundless Azure Empyrean’s Empty Song of the Jade-Sound Divine King**
The Dark Phoenix is on the field, pure and most yang.
Azure auroras fan the void, singing the divine wind.
Its sound is mournful, its melody faint—
the Dao has the subtle and inaudible.
My realm is the Yellow Mound—
the ten thousand lives find their place.

**Sixth: The Southeast’s Boundless Azure Empyrean’s Empty Song of the Jade-Sound Divine King**
The Thearch rides the cinnabar chariot, issuing commands at the Heavenly Gate.
Azure script in golden caskets, summoning the underworld’s souls.
Refining qi into crimson brightness, green sprouts arise.
Singing the cavernous divine tones, the Great Matriarch mounts the carriage.

**Seventh: The Southwest’s Boundless Azure Empyrean’s Empty Song of the Jade-Sound Divine King**
The Bird Mother holds the banner, the Water King bears the staff.
The Jade Chime delivers beings, washing clean the Nine Darks.
Dragon immortals turn the mechanism, bathing the moon in the Eastern Well.
Today is a great celebration—ancestors and descendants are distinguished.

**Eighth: The Northwest’s Boundless Azure Empyrean’s Empty Song of the Jade-Sound Divine King**
The Heavenly Father with yellow hair, clad in brocade of ten thousand flowers.
His mouth exhales sunlight, his feet tread the divine toad.
Jade blades sever demons, bells and drums resound.
Severing the blood of the dark and yellow, the Azure Empyrean’s Dao prospers.

**Ninth: The Above’s Boundless Azure Empyrean’s Empty Song of the Jade-Sound Divine King**
Azure auroras vast and boundless, spreading through the Jade Clarity.
Sealing the void into script, the Eight Meetings’ Cavernous Writ.
Planting the root of the supreme Dao, transforming and birthing the multitudes.
Towering is the Heavenly Terrace—within resides the Celestial Lord.

**Tenth: The Below’s Boundless Azure Empyrean’s Empty Song of the Jade-Sound Divine King**
Layer upon layer of rigid marshes, wind and sea plunge into darkness.
The Dark Elder audits the registers, fire and smoke in the iron city.
Black vipers bare their fangs, venomous beasts devour forms.
When the heavenly light arrives, the ten thousand sufferings cease.

Here at the summit of the Azure Empyrean, within the ten directions, the Jade-Sound Divine King sings his spontaneous hymn. Recite it a hundred times, and your name ascends to the Azure Palace. Recite it a thousand times, and the Divine King himself safeguards and welcomes you. Ten thousand recitations perfect the Dao, allowing you to soar into the Great Void, traverse the Three Realms, and join the Perfected Lords of the Upper Clarity.

Those who hear the Jade Sound are shielded in form by the hundred spirits; the earthly deities are commanded to escort them in and out, bearing them beyond the earthly gates. The three disasters and nine calamities are left behind; the seven ancestors ascend in turn, forever freed from the gates of darkness. The soul rises to the Azure Palace, the very household of the Great One.

Azure is one of the Four Palaces, where one dons the imperial robes and mounts the dragon—unlike the black and red realms, where the Dipper’s steps reverse and misfortune reigns. The Azure Void’s utmost Perfected: those who know it achieve great penetration, their years of life boundless, their mysterious merits recorded.

This is the secret celestial sound, revered by all heavens. To leak or profane it is to plunge into hell, bringing calamity upon seven generations of ancestors. The Dao declares: these cavernous verses are the Jade Sound of the ten directions of the Azure Empyrean, the hidden and spontaneous hymns of the utmost Perfected Divine King—all in the language of the Great Brahma, not the common words of the world. They illuminate the Empty Song of the Azure Empyrean as the supreme Perfected Dao.

In great measure, they align with the mysterious transformations, moving through the ten thousand mechanisms, rightly guiding the mysterious deliverance, and unfolding the world to form heaven. In lesser measure, they enable the body to attain immortality and ascend to the Upper Clarity.

The blackness of the Azure Empyrean, for humans, corresponds to the ears and eyes, connecting below to the essence of liver and kidney, emerging from Kan and entering Li, employed day and night. Within the divine furnace of the brain’s chamber, there should be a mysterious elixir, large as a millet grain, emerging from your ears. If you obtain and ingest it, your bones are exchanged and your form renewed, elevating you as an imperial guest. Should this Dao be accomplished, your spirit roams the Azure Land, where you behold the Azure City’s jeweled towers and jade palaces, the towering dragon and tiger, the lion and white crane, the coiling flood-dragons—all within the Azure Empyrean’s world, a realm of ten thousand leagues surveyed in an instant. Yet this is no worldly learning; its depths are difficult to fathom.

This is what heaven treasures, concealed in the Mysterious Capital’s Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, transmitted but once every forty thousand kalpas according to the mysterious statutes. Only if a perfected one arrives bearing a ring of azure jade and a pledge of blue brocade, swearing an oath in accord with the Upper Clarity’s regulations, shall it then be bestowed.

The Dao declares: even in the revolutions of the lofty and profound, there are gradations and ranks.

The Three Luminaries and Nine Origins also have their concealments and withdrawals. The utmost sagely divine beings also have their hiddenness and manifestations. Even those of shallow learning may encounter calamities. Whenever such disasters arise, all of shared qi must unite in heart to perform purification rites, offer incense in the six watches, recite scriptures ten times through, and chant the celestial hymns of the Azure Empyrean. Blessings and felicity will then arise of themselves, the numinous perfected will descend in an instant, and all inauspiciousness will dissolve.

The boundless scripture universally delivers the limitless. The Dao declares: those of shallow learning, whose immortal rank remains unfulfilled, may face the turning of their destined dissolution. As their bodies pass through the Great Yin and the hour of passage draws near, fellow students and perfected ones shall offer incense and recite the scriptures ten times on their behalf, so that the celestial hymns of the Azure Empyrean may summon their ethereal souls. The qi of the Azure Empyrean will descend to bind with their bones and appearance, the six viscera will regain their brightness, and true qi will arise of itself. Thus, the corpse-form is delivered according to the method, and the ethereal soul ascends directly to the Azure Palace, where, by the measure of their cultivated merit, they may be reborn after a reckoning of days. Once the Wheel is turned without confusion, they shall attain divine transcendence.

The Dao declares: when the cycles of yin and yang falter in the hours of *yin* and *shen*, one must perform purification rites, offer incense, and recite scriptures. When the radiance of the constellations dims, one must perform purification rites, offer incense, and recite scriptures. When water and fire clash violently and the people’s qi is disordered, one must perform purification rites, offer incense, and recite scriptures. When the borders of the realm are threatened and warfare and banditry cease not, one must perform purification rites, offer incense, and recite scriptures. When strange qi brings disaster and the people suffer from pestilence, one must perform purification rites, offer incense, and recite scriptures. When masters or companions pass from this life, one must perform purification rites, offer incense, and recite scriptures.

For the merit of purification rites and scripture recitation is most weighty: above, it rectifies the movements of heaven; in the middle, it pacifies the emperor and king; below, it dispels poison and harm, delivering the multitudes of the people. In life and death, all rely upon it, and its blessings are beyond measure. Thus it is called boundless, universally delivering heaven and humanity.

The Dao declares: whoever possesses this scripture and performs these meritorious deeds for the lords of heaven and earth and the multitudes of the people—on the day of disaster, if they resolve in heart to perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture ten times—all the heavens shall record their names, the ten thousand spirits shall attend and guard them, and those of exceptional attainment shall be counted among the ministers of the Azure Empyrean’s Lord and the Azure Palace. The heavens record the merit and transgressions of people without the slightest error. The divine kings of heaven shall also protect and recommend them, and those who attain the Dao shall come to comprehend these most profound words.

The great Brahmā hymns of the Azure Empyrean, the boundless hidden verses of the celestial hymns—composed by the Dao Lord, the *Primordial Commencement’s Numinous Writ of Azure Radiance*, the *Numinous Chapters*:
**The Six Heavens of the East**
The Six Heavens of the East hold mirrors aloft in towering splendor, rosy mists filling the four directions of the void. Their luminous countenance is distant and unseen, yet the Dipper and *Wei* constellations assume their form. Their brightness thins the Nine Suns, circling to the utmost origin. Meeting at the *you* hour, they enter the eightfold thoroughfares. Hills and pits are cleansed like a tripod, the golden register and lunar spring. Embracing the bright jade wilds, the numinous chapters traverse the level void.

**The Six Heavens of the South**
The well arises from *Wei* and *Ji*, *Liu* and *Zhang* converge at the fork. The true bell sounds in the eastern glory, cloud-dragons partake of jasper nectar. A second mandate is given to the yellow network, encountering the corners of *Bi* and *Zhi*. Qi circulates universally, the forest streams and jade pupils. The Dao’s subtlety approaches the true diagram, the Five Yangs intersect in the palace. Wisteria maidens and purple radiance, the mysterious and the trustworthy scatter like lords.

**The Six Heavens of the West**
The Xiao Pool and Yu Wei, pearls gleam in the night’s haze. *Gui* and *Liu* mark the dark borders, running ledgers in the fire pool. The cavernous horse harmonizes, the jade consorts disperse the barbarians. *Mao* and *Zhang* gallop side by side, the woman’s chamber is fitting. The Yang rains curve in purity, the golden pivot and tiger maidens. The interwoven lords of *Yan* and *Chen*, the *Ao* heaven and grand ceremony.

**The Six Heavens of the North**
Kun and Tai stand beside You, the road is straight through the prison of jade. Jade repentance and swift bestowal, the fire lord and lightning marquis. The true laughter and true pool, the pure brightness and immortal schemes. Hooks join in numinous ease, the palace army and Earl Xiu. The boundless depths of the non-existent, the cavern gazes upon the inverted tower. The dragon’s mechanism and river inscription, the Purple Tenuity and Nine Mounds.

The Dao declares: these are the great Brahmā hidden verses of the Azure Empyrean’s celestial hymns, boundless in sound. The ancient script was all azure radiance, winding and turning, curving to form the text, its rays trailing in the eightfold convergence. The celestial perfected and august ones left their traces in lingering phrases, brush in hand to record them, establishing the true sounds.

Whoever knows these sounds and can perform purification rites while reciting them shall have the jade-voiced divine kings of all the heavens, the great spirits of the Azure Empyrean’s void, descend to observe their person. Their merit and diligence shall be inscribed, reported to the heavens above, and the ten thousand spirits shall come to pay homage. The earthly deities shall attend at their gates, the great merit-demons and kings shall protect and recommend them, enabling them to wander the Azure Empyrean and enter the Azure Gate in bodily form.

This sound averts all, dispels all, delivers all, and accomplishes all. It is the natural sound of the Azure Empyrean’s divine wind. Thus, reciting it summons the flying celestial spirits of the Azure Empyrean to descend and observe, the Supreme Emperor to chant from afar, the ten thousand spirits to pay homage, the Three Realms to attend in their chariots. The demonic hordes bow their heads, ghostly essences vanish of themselves, the divine wind resounds, the Azure Empyrean is cleansed and luminous. The ten directions reflect one another, seas and mountains are profound and clear, the void congeals in radiance, shining and merging in brightness. The host of immortals bow their heads, soaring to the Jade Capital. Heaven and earth stretch boundlessly, the celestial sounds ring clear and cold, dark wisdom knows no limit, the boundless profundity is most mysterious.

*The Wondrous Scripture of the Numinous Treasure, the Upper Chapter on Universally Delivering the Limitless*, Scroll Twenty—concluded.
Scroll Twenty-One.

**The Chapter on Generating Transformation and Severing the Root of the Womb to Eliminate Defilements**

The Dao spoke: In ancient times, within the Primordial Azure Heaven, amidst the Purple Empyrean’s empty hymns of the Supreme Ultimate’s Mysterious Land, the *Original Beginning’s Scripture on Universally Delivering the Limitless, the Upper Chapter on Generating Transformation and Severing the Root of the Womb to Eliminate Defilements* was received.

When the Celestial Worthy of the Original Beginning was about to expound this scripture, he circumambulated ten times to summon the ten directions. Only then did he ascend his seat. Heavenly perfected ones, great spirits, lofty sages, and exalted worthies—along with a boundless host of wondrously accomplished perfected persons—came riding upon the void. Crimson mists bore incense, crystalline flowers adorned their chariots, cinnabar and azure hues floated in their carriages, cavernous radiance gleamed from their feathered wheels, fivefold brilliance shimmered in brocade hues, canopies reflected the fragrance of rosy clouds, and the ninefold qi merged in splendor, illuminating the Great Void. For seven days and seven nights, the palaces and towers of the myriad heavens opened from afar. Jade rays flickered in concealment and revelation, starry pearls wove their patterns, the sun’s brilliance stilled of itself, and the divine yin unfolded its radiance. Golden waves surged, the jade pivot and stellar balance turned in harmony, infusing the empty seas with spiritual concord. The divine wind revolved and merged, emerald peaks coiled in repose. The heavens were free of drifting veils, the four qi shone in clarity, and throughout the land—its mountains, rivers, forests, and groves—all was leveled as one, no longer high or low. The earth transformed into azure jade, uniform in hue.

The assembled perfected ones attended the seat as the Celestial Worthy of the Original Beginning sat in profound stillness upon the Seven Celestial Thrones and Ninefold Radiant Luminous Jeweled Seat suspended in the void. After he expounded the scripture once, the great sages of the myriad heavens simultaneously proclaimed its excellence. At that moment, the men and women of the land congealed their wondrous qi into wombs, their roots of birth transcending and flourishing. After the second recitation, defilements were severed, and knots dissolved. After the third, spirits dwelled in the cavernous void, and the brahmic qi pervaded the unseen. After the fourth, their bones bore jadelike blossoms, and their countenances shone with golden hue. After the fifth, enmities from seven lifetimes scattered, and blessings filled their halls with rejoicing. After the sixth, purple mists bathed their bodies, and the hundred spirits rejoiced in harmony. After the seventh, male and female merged in transformation, and the Three Ones ascended in wandering. After the eighth, divine light reflected within, revealing the hundred passages. After the ninth, their minds awakened to the cavernous spirit, and they attained the realization of the Imperial Terrace. After the tenth, their names were inscribed in the Jade Clarity, and they attended the Golden Gates of the Celestial Thrones.

At that time, none among the men and women of the land failed to turn their hearts in devotion. All received protection and deliverance, attaining longevity without end.

The Dao spoke: When the Celestial Worthy of the Original Beginning had expounded the scripture once, the Azure Emperor of the Eastern Limitless and Boundless Realm, Liang Xu Sheng, the Great Spirit of Transforming the Womb and Perfected Truth, arrived with his boundless host, floating upon the void. After the second recitation, the Vermilion Emperor of the Southern Limitless and Boundless Realm, Zhong Ming Bin, the Great Spirit of Eliminating Defilements and Perfected Truth, arrived with his boundless host, floating upon the void. After the third, the White Emperor of the Western Limitless and Boundless Realm, Ling Cheng Yu, the Great Spirit of Transforming the Womb and Perfected Truth, arrived with his boundless host, floating upon the void. After the fourth, the Black Emperor of the Northern Limitless and Boundless Realm, Yuan Dao Ming, the Great Spirit of Eliminating Defilements and Perfected Truth, arrived with his boundless host, floating upon the void. After the fifth, the Lord of the Eight Radiant Luminous Microcosm of the Northeastern Limitless Heavenly Realm, arrived with his boundless host, floating upon the void. After the sixth, the Lord of the Eight Radiant Mysterious Numinous of the Southeastern Limitless and Boundless Realm, the Great Spirit of Eliminating Defilements and Perfected Truth, arrived with his boundless host, floating upon the void. After the seventh, the Lord of the Eight Radiant True Florescence of the Southwestern Limitless and Boundless Realm, the Great Spirit of Transforming the Womb and Perfected Truth, arrived with his boundless host, floating upon the void. After the eighth, the Lord of the Eight Radiant Numinous Radiance of the Northwestern Limitless and Boundless Realm, the Great Spirit of Eliminating Defilements and Perfected Truth, arrived with his boundless host, floating upon the void. After the ninth, the Lord of the Eight Radiant Singing Cavern of the Upper Limitless and Boundless Realm, the Great Spirit of Transforming the Womb and Perfected Truth, arrived with his boundless host, floating upon the void. After the tenth, the Lord of the Eight Radiant Secret Form of the Lower Limitless and Boundless Realm, the Great Spirit of Eliminating Defilements and Perfected Truth, arrived with his boundless host, floating upon the void.

When the ten recitations were complete, the great perfected spirits of the ten directions and limitless heavens arrived as one. The men and women of the land turned their hearts in reverence. Those who came spoke to one another, saying: "The Celestial Worthy of the Original Beginning, within the Primordial Azure Heaven, expounds the method of generating transformation and severing the root of the womb to eliminate defilements. We, since entering the cycle of rebirth, have not escaped birth and death. Greed, anger, and delusion have cast us into the various states of existence. Though by fortunate karma we have been born in the heavens, the heavenly beings remain entangled in love and attachment. Even after relinquishing worldly dust, they still dwell in subtle defilements. Habitual tendencies remain unsevered, and their actions entangle them in knots. The womb’s root of transformation is not thoroughly purified, and the root of birth becomes firm, clinging to impermanence, taking abiding as its foundation. Not knowing the mysterious subtlety of the Dao’s essence—which embraces and nurtures the Great Void, where the Nine Sages and Ten Perfected Ones are fundamentally without birth or extinction—they remain bound by the unsevered womb-root, leading to this strife and contention. They transform into one another, alternating as species, their corpses and blood flowing, their bones decaying, and their forms crumbling. Though we are heavenly beings, we have not transcended the Three Realms. Our forms have not attained independent transformation, and we remain separated from the Dao. Even if we manifest transformed bodies, we still dwell in the realm of form. Thus, in gazing upon one another, in clasping hands, in speech and sound, we do not accord with the Great Cavern. This allows the Three Corpses to surge and flow, impure blood to generate tumors, and demonic forces to seize the opportunity, turning us far from the true Dao. Today, we must incline our ears to the Dharma-sound, as the rain encircles the celestial seat. The assembly of beings from kalpas beyond count gathers as one—this cannot be restrained."

Thereupon, the Celestial Worthy lowered his robes and gazed straight ahead. He commanded the Primordial Lord of the Yellow Simplicity to take up the compass and square’s mirror, upon which the true forms of heaven and earth took shape, their configurations forming characters. The Primordial Lord of the White Simplicity struck the Cavernous Yang Bell, and the ten directions resounded in harmony, the myriad heavens joining in chant. The Primordial Lord of the Purple Simplicity suspended the Vast Radiance Pearl, as large as a millet grain, within the mysterious void, nine *zhang* above the earth. The Celestial Worthy led the way as the heavenly perfected ones, great spirits, lofty sages, exalted worthies, wondrously accomplished perfected persons, the limitless great spirits of the ten directions, and the boundless host all entered the jeweled pearl.

The heavenly beings gazed upward, seeing only a surging radiance entering through the mouth of the pearl. Once within, its whereabouts became unknown; the assembled multitudes dispersed, and the celestial light shone brilliantly, the myriad *qi* purified and serene.

Within the jeweled pearl, the Celestial Worthy expounded the sutra in full. The perfected ones oversaw the deliverance, bestowing it upon me. At that moment, joy and celebration defied description. When the Dharma rites were roughly complete, the hosts of heaven returned to their stations, and in an instant, all fell silent without a trace of sound.

At that time, the heavenly beings who encountered the sutra’s teachings were universally delivered, their karmic knots untied, their evil roots severed. The entire land turned in reverence, all practicing with utmost sincerity. They forgot burdens, forgot existence, forgot transformation, forgot attainment, forgot thoughts, forgot emotions, forgot perception, forgot movement, forgot breath, forgot form. Words held no doctrinal essence; mouths uttered no desires. Compassion and love became uniform, bones of strangers turned kin. Nations were at peace, people prospered, and all rejoiced in great harmony. From the sutra’s first proclamation, the land was guided by the Dao. Those who held sincere devotion, revered and honored it, all attained deliverance across the ages.

The Dao declares: The words spoken by the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning within the sutra are the inner names of the heavenly Emperors, the hidden rhymes of sound, also the secret taboos of demon kings and the concealed names of the hundred spirits. They are not the common speech of the world but the essential words of the generative Dao-embryo, the refining of the womb’s roots, the severing of evil *qi*, the annihilation of the blood-corpse, and the cultivation of the profoundest truths of the perfected and the ultimate. The lofty sages who have already attained perfection, who comprehend the mysterious and fathom the subtle, can fully grasp its chapters. Reciting it ten times, the hosts of heaven chant from afar, the ten thousand Emperors render homage, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks conceal their clouds, the sun and moon halt their radiance, the celestial pivots cease turning. All demons bind their forms, ghostly spirits lose their vitality, the dead rise from their corpses, and white bones become living beings.

For the most devoted scholars who recite it ten times, the womb’s roots generate transformation, free from worldly entanglements. Evil impurities wither away, the hundred spirits unite in form, the Five Emperors stand guard, the Three Realms bow in reverence, demonic spirits lose their sight, ghostly malevolence vanishes, and those on the verge of death are delivered, cut off from demise yet restored to life. The reason for this is that while the scholar’s impurities gradually dissipate, their minds have not yet penetrated the profound mystery. They can restrain the ten directions but have not yet governed the celestial administration. Their virtue can subdue earthly deities and bind demonic spirits, yet they only attain deliverance for themselves and cannot universally save all beings. To recite these chapters lightly brings misfortune upon oneself.

Those who honor and revere it will see their households flourish, their generations prosper, bound to good karmic causes, untouched by the ten thousand calamities, with divine luminaries guarding their gates. This sutra is supremely sacred, unmatched in the Jade Capital, delivering countless beings and serving as the foundation of the ten thousand Daoist paths. Its majestic model of virtue is beyond measure.

The Dao declares: Whoever recites this sutra ten times will have all the heavens assemble. The Venerable Elder of the Mysterious Above will dissolve the accumulated blood-stasis and impurities from the adept’s womb since the beginning of their karmic gestation. The Lord of Western Clarity will dissolve the amassed turbid waters and foulness within the womb, the drowned corpses and ghostly filth, the afflictions of the winding springs and frigid pools. If disputes linger in the Water Bureau, with unceasing investigations and annotations, extending to the living, the roots of life and death, the sprouts of disaster and misfortune will never flourish.

The womb’s roots will generate transformation into jade-like nectar, the wondrous countenance of an immortal, naturally attaining the Dao. The seven *po* spirits wander astray, demonic *peng* spirits lie in ambush, external evil ghosts invade, defiling the womb-palace, indulging in nocturnal dreams and revelry with ghosts. The Jade Emperor of the Great Loftiness dispatches the Ninefold Numinous Talismans of Purple Light to the Venerable Elder Han of the Southern Palace, within the Celestial Mechanism Bureau, to oversee the ledgers, examine merits, and verify the generation of the womb’s roots. Evil impurities are severed, and the suffering souls of countless generations of ancestors are all delivered, ascending to the Vermilion Palace. After nine years of refinement, they receive transformation and rebirth, becoming noble persons.

Those who diligently study the supreme sutra, their merits fulfilled and virtues perfected, all attain divine transcendence, ascending to the Golden Gates and roaming the Jade Capital. Scholars of the highest learning who cultivate and recite this sutra are immediately delivered, ascending to the Southern Palace. Worldly adepts who recite it refine the foul impurities of their womb’s roots, transforming their old *qi*, swiftly severing and annihilating them, generating the immortal perfected. Evil souls and impure *po* spirits are cleansed and purified, extending their years and prolonging their lives. Thereafter, they all attain the Dao of corpse-liberation: their ethereal souls temporarily perish, bypassing hell, immediately regaining their forms and roaming the great void. This sutra is subtly wondrous, universally delivering boundless beings. All heavenly beings receive its blessings, its immeasurable fortune bestowing grace upon life and death. Treasured by heaven, it is not transmitted to the lower world. Only the most devoted scholars, offering gold and treasures with sincerity, may swear celestial oaths to transmit it. To leak or slight it lightly brings calamity upon nine generations, consigning them to long servitude under the ghostly officials.

The Five Emperors attend the sutra, with twenty-four Jade Lads and twenty-four Jade Maidens each, safeguarding the sacred texts and protecting the bodies of those who receive the sutra.

The Dao declares: During the long fast of the first month, reciting this sutra, the Azure Emperor Luo Wenying of the Upper Nine Palaces, wielding the talisman of the Azure Palace, opens the adept’s hundred passages, unties karmic knots, and delights the Inner Unity. Purple mist bathes the body, divine light penetrates and illuminates, feathered radiance reflects the mysterious, delivering the souls of past generations from earthly servitude to ascend to the Celestial Mechanism Bureau of the Southern Palace.

During the long fast of the seventh month, reciting this sutra, the White Emperor □ Wen Sheng of the Middle Nine Palaces, wielding the talisman of the Numinous White, generates the transformation of the adept’s womb’s roots, severing worldly causes, halting the cycle of rebirth, swiftly distinguishing the pure from the impure. Filth and grime are cleansed, the body gleams with solar radiance, the Great Simplicity generates the five viscera, the seven clouds enter the mud-pill, and the body attains divine transcendence. The heavens inscribe their names on the Yellow Register and White Slips, erasing death and inscribing life.

During the long fast of the tenth month, reciting this sutra, the Black Emperor Zheng Wentong of the Lower Nine Palaces, wielding the talisman of the Black Emperor, enters the adept’s bladder, annihilating the womb’s corpse, cutting off the hundred impurities, and extinguishing demonic malevolence. The adept’s body radiates the jade-like splendor of the Five Emperors, their face adorned with the luminous countenance of flowing gold. They constantly sleep with the Great Unity, embracing the bright moon, becoming kings, emperors, lords, ministers, fathers, and sons, securing the nation’s destiny, preserving heaven’s longevity, and ensuring their lineage endures unbroken. They will forever be sovereigns, stabilizing their domains, with the people proclaiming great peace.

On the days of the eight solar terms, reciting this sutra, one becomes a Perfected of the Nine Palaces, the Three Origins and Three Palaces, the Twenty-Seven Perfected, the Male Unity and Non-Male, the Female Unity and White Origin. The Five Palaces’ odd and even align, their transformations profound and mysterious, generating and transforming the root of the embryo. Sweeping away and executing the source of evil, conceiving essence and streaming light, a jade infant blooms from the lotus. The Primordial Unity sits upon the altar, with the myriad spirits yielding precedence.

On one’s natal day, reciting this sutra, the twelve great knots, the three hundred and sixty bone joints, the eight barriers and nine palaces, the divine canopy youth, and the inner spirits of the central pool are moved to refinement and transformation, generating and transforming the root of the embryo. Cutting off evil impurities, the body remains uninclined, the hun-soul and spirit purified and upright, the myriad qi enduring forever. Unafflicted by suffering, the body radiates light, attended by the Three Realms, received by the Five Emperors, with the myriad spirits paying homage. One’s name is inscribed in the heavens above, and upon the completion of merit and virtue, one ascends to the Highest Clarity.

The Dao states: On the day of practicing the Dao, one must bathe in fragrant waters, enter the chamber in purification, face east, and knock the teeth thirty-two times, ascending to the thirty-two heavens. Bowing thirty-two times in the heart, close the eyes and silently envision the body seated amidst clouds of azure, yellow, and white qi, both within and without shrouded in mist. Green Dragons, White Tigers, Vermilion Birds, Dark Warriors, lions, and white cranes array to the left and right. The sun and moon illuminate brilliantly, suffusing the chamber with radiance. The Three Divisions and Eight Effulgences, the Twenty-Four Perfected, encircle and guard with solemnity. A circular image arises from the crown, its light illuminating the ten directions—all vividly manifest.

The secret incantation says:
Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Dao Lord.
Summon forth from within my body the Three and Five Merit Officials, the left and right attending messengers, the jade lads of incense, the jade maidens of transmission, the Five Emperors’ direct talismans, and the incense officials of the day—thirty-two each—to open and convey my words.
Today is auspicious, a long fast in the pure hall, practicing the supreme sutra to deliver boundless beings.
May what is petitioned ascend directly to the presence of the Most High Primordial Sovereign of the Thirty-Two Heavens.
Conclude, then draw qi thirty-two times and recite the sutra facing east.

They bear the nine-stepped talismanic banners for summoning spirits and the seven-jointed frost-silk pennants. Ahead, nine phoenixes cry in unison; behind, eight simurghs sing in harmony. Numinous Perfected lead the way, chanting cavernous scriptures. The assembled immortals follow in radiant procession, their whistles and songs resounding. Myriad chariots and ten thousand riders float through the void, their luminous return journey transforming and fixing life.
The Heavenly Mechanism Chancellor, the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, Han the Controller of Records, the Great Spirit overseeing life—for the adept’s embryo root, generating and transforming the mysterious numen, the Purple Chamber of the Womb Gate.

Within it stands a great spirit, striking jade chimes and ringing bells, casting fiery streaming bells. All defilements and impurities are cleansed, the blood-corpses and Peng specters banished. The twenty-four passes of crimson and black knots are bound, infusing the adept’s life-breath, dispelling all demonic entanglements. Holding registers and grasping ledgers, they assemble before the Celestial Emperor, where each is measured for ascension and the heavens are strictly examined.

A universal proclamation is issued to the Three Realms, the boundless divine lands, the Yellow Springs’ winding courts, the Northern Capital of Fengdu, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the Twelve River Sources. Above, ancestors and progenitors of countless kalpas, all karmic kin, are swiftly absolved of their transgressions; their evil roots are severed and destroyed. They shall not be detained or forced into the throngs of ghosts. By the primordial Mandate of Yuanshi, at the appointed hour they ascend, the embryo root generating transformation, returning from dust to truth. Demonic filth is severed, impurities purged, the hundred spirits summoned and pacified. The seven generations of ancestors disperse their enmities, the Five Emperors oversee the covenant. In the Northern Capital’s icy pools, their forms are reshaped, bones refined into immortality. They pass through no gates, subdue demons, and receive promotion, their ranks recorded in the Southern Palace. The dead souls receive talismans and transform into immortals; those born in the flesh attain liberation and endure through kalpas. Drifting with the eons, they share the heavens’ longevity. Forever delivered from the Three Wretched Paths, the Five Sufferings, and Eight Hardships, they transcend the Three Realms and roam freely in the Shangqing.

In the heavens of Shangqing, the Celestial Emperor Kui Ling presides over the Formless Realm of Brahman conduct.

The Thirty-Two Heavens, the Thirty-Two Emperors—each heaven’s hidden taboos, each heaven’s concealed names, the empty void within the heavens, the spontaneous numinous verses, each heaven’s hidden rhythms, the sounds of the Cavernous Truth. The Venerable of the Cavernous Void, the Spirits of the Cavernous Vision, they subdue great demons and transform divine spirits. The stinking lungs devour thieves, sharing heaven’s life; drinking blood and shaking essence, they lurk in the embryo root, obstructing the Gate of Heavenly Destiny so the immortal path cannot be achieved. Corpse-ghosts alter forms, flying into the Mud Pill. Concealing the womb’s stem, yin constructs external demons, entering the Mysterious Window to disrupt the Celestial Radiance. The Celestial Emperor severs and destroys, the divine swallows the Jade Hall. Nine harmonies and ten unions transform the empty and constant. The profound mysteries of the boundless are too deep to fathom; the divine perfected are scattered to universally deliver heaven and humanity.

Today, rejoicing in receiving deliverance, passing through the heavens’ passes, the knots are untied, the embryo root severed. Flying through the Five Portals, names are recorded in the Supreme Mystery. The Demon Kings oversee and promote, unrestrained at the Heavenly Gates. The Eastern Dipper extends life, the Western Dipper refines the embryo, the Northern Dipper purges impurities, the Southern Dipper transforms the fetus, the Central Dipper blends the Cavernous—one union generates the spirit.

The Azure Emperor commands the returning winds, the White Emperor commands the numinous, the Vermilion Emperor protects the root, the Black Emperor bathes the form, the Yellow Emperor guards the center—no fetal impurities arise.

The Azure Heaven Demon King, Yu Zhu Dong Luo.
The Vermilion Heaven Demon King, Yan Guang Mie Jing.
The White Heaven Demon King, Duan Bao Jiao Zhen.
The Black Heaven Demon King, Fa Xie Ming Shen.
The Yellow Heaven Demon King, Dong Guan Tai Ying.

The Five Emperors’ Great Demons, lords of the myriad spirits. Flying through the Three Realms, they govern the true embryo, expel demons, command the numinous, and open the seven passes. The wondrous transformations flow forth, ascending through the Nine Revolutions. Impurities and stagnations are swept away, bones and flesh fly together. The celestial perfected receive the mandate, summoning blessings and auspices. True merit fills within, divine might expands without. Malevolent omens perish, demonic essences hide. Vast qi entwines and binds the Three Elixirs and Jade Chambers. Together they assist the Celestial Emperor’s transformation, repelling and extinguishing misfortune and decay. The Six Heavens’ great ugliness is shattered and destroyed. Golden light scatters radiance, the jade path intertwines. Seven generations of ancestors are delivered, a hundred wrongs are cast aside. The Three Offices’ black records forever fall from the roots of calamity, no longer concealed—clarity rectifies the primordial mechanism.

A universal proclamation is issued without end; the myriad spirits all return. They roam and feast in the Jade Palace, their ranks arrayed in the Supreme Subtlety. The empty and cavernous Nine Mysteries, the Jade Emperor’s mysterious numen, summon rosy clouds and scatter radiance, embracing the void’s purple mist. Divine maidens descend, dancing as embryonic immortals. The Dao’s root generates transformation, the numinous root knows no bounds. Loftily transcending the Supreme Non-Being, ascending through the heavens above and below—no darkness, no obscurity, no form, no shadow, no limit, no end.

The vast primordial chaos, boundless and lightless, opens with the Crimson Clarity’s chart—its revolutions and deliverances arise naturally. The Primordial Beginning stabilizes and settles, unfolding the Five Scriptures. Crimson writings on jade, the Eight Might’s dragon scripts. They safeguard the kalpas’ course, ensuring heaven’s eternal endurance. The Brahma-qi pervades the cosmos, myriad patterns unfurl. The primal net flows and evolves, the thirty-two heavens, descending to unify all, blending and transforming the Five Spirits. True destiny responds to immortals, the Mystic Record interweaves all. The Nine Bureaus and Six Ministers array themselves upon lotus embryos. The Mystic Unity pervades the soul, straddling the Dipper and the Chief Star. To the left, it supports the Fire King; to the right, it establishes Bo Ying. Sweeping away filth and expelling evil, the Jade Numen opens in four directions. Attaining the Golden Throne’s position, it governs the myriad spirits. The Wheel turns without color, circling the ten directions. Mounting the flying steps, it revolves the Seven Origins. Driving out evil and defilement, it clarifies and expands the celestial net. Filling the seven gates, it irrigates and nourishes the green sprouts. The twenty-four charts wholly gather the true methods. The Eight Radiant Sceneries darkly merge, ascending and descending in the Yellow’s blend. Within lies the Mystic Unity, the Highest Perfected of the Supreme Emperor. Floating upon the great rosy clouds, they chant and intone the cavernous hymns. Golden perfection shines resplendently, its echoes flowing through the cloud camps. Jade tones gather qi, numinous winds assemble mist. The Purple Void flourishes in elegance, aiding and sheltering the myriad immortals. A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—naturally they become true. Within the true lies the spirit, the Great Lord of Longevity. The Purple Chamber and Azure House, the great gods of flowing bells. Seated and guarding the Hall of Light, they protect the Mystic True, wielding talismans and grasping registers, generating and transforming the embryonic root, severing and removing evil defilement. Entering and exiting the Nine Palaces, within the Eight Sceneries, amid the subtlest realms, they cleanse the Stomach Pool, unblock and regulate the hundred passages, swiftly summoning the myriad spirits. Blending and merging with the Mud-Pill Palace, ten revolutions return the numinous—equal to qi, they ascend as immortals. The immortal Dao values life, immeasurably delivering beings. Above, the eight gates open, the Wheel of Flying Heaven. Sins and blessings, prohibitions and precepts, karmic causes from past lives—universally they receive deliverance. The dead souls gain bodies, their bodies receive life, ascending to be heard by the various heavens. Above the various heavens, each has its gate of life. Within lies the cavernous hymn of chanting, the demon kings’ numinous scriptures, their verses matching the Highest Perfected.

**First: The Desire Realm’s Flying Void’s Sound**
The human path is distant and faint, the immortal Dao vast and boundless.
Ghosts lurk in the embryonic root, where the human gate of life lies.
Causing you, foolish mortals, to not delight in the immortal true.
The empty palace is assailed by evil, foul decay comes to attack.
The lofty and pure numinous clarity, cavernously subtle, aligns with the Great Void.
The precious embryonic root of generation and transformation—may your immortal Dao be accomplished.
Thus, qi fades with the sun, the divine wind rises from Kunlun.
Gazing upon the Jade Perfected in the Great Cavern, purple clouds encircle the Crimson Court.
The Noble Son bestows the numinous talisman, the Supreme Unity bows and attends.
Renouncing this imperial path of defilement, the eight ways naturally part.
Feathered canopies flutter distinctively, the feathered carriage journeys to the Nine Purities.
Bestowing and proclaiming to the flowery heaven’s heroes, the jade writings gleam with numinous scriptures.

**Second: The Form Realm’s Demon King’s Hymn**
Faint and distant, the lofty void, jade towers towering.
The Primordial Beginning’s numinous scriptures universally teach the immortal worthies.
Below, reaching the net’s guiding threads; above, reaching the various heavens.
The immeasurable mysteries all align with my body.
How can evil defilement disturb my embryonic root?
Blood corpses and sunken bones, yin spirits detain souls.
The precious mountain transforms and dissolves—how can it endure alone?
Receiving the numinous talisman in mystery, presenting oneself before the Emperor.
At this moment, joyous—facing and returning to the Jade Infant.
Though the Crimson Clarity has passed, one can still distinguish the true.
My realm lightly tainted, thus I bestow the precious writings.
Dispelling and sweeping away the burdens of vapors, summoning and assembling the hundred spirits.
Refining the embryo and flying as an immortal, receiving the mandate from the Jade Throne.
Purifying defilement and ascending through the void, above becoming the Emperor’s guest.

**Third: The Formless Realm’s Demon King’s Song**
Bones hold the great void, within coils the ancient corpse.
Thus, qi scatters in profusion, withering your numinous fungus.
The womb’s gate is veiled and blocked, the flower of desire spreads in four directions.
Blood sinks into strange patterns, defilement severs the primal mechanism.
I, the Upper King, govern and command the host of spirits.
Holding the jade talisman in my left hand, summoning the heavenly soldiers with my right.
The embryonic root’s accumulated poisons—I cast the flowing bells.
Extending the mandate forever, the myriad evils are destroyed.
The thirty-nine perfected, the Crimson Writings open their radiance.
The Dao’s wondrous mystery—serve this celestial hymn.
Tested without precedent, my Dao flourishes.
Cavernously empty, cavernously non-being, cavernously true, cavernously immortal.
Flying spirits upon jade rosy clouds, ascending chariots through azure mists.

Above these three realms, within the flying void, the demon kings’ songs and sounds match the cavernous hymns. Reciting them a hundred times purifies the embryonic root, and one’s name is recorded in the Southern Palace. Reciting them a thousand times forever severs evil defilement, and the demon kings protect and welcome. Ten thousand recitations complete the Dao, ascending to fly through the great void, transcending the three realms, attaining the rank of Immortal Duke. Hearing the numinous sounds, the demon kings show reverence, commanding and restraining the earthly deities to serve, escort, and welcome. They extract one from the earth’s gates, the five sufferings and eight difficulties. The seven ancestors ascend and migrate, forever departing the ghostly bureaus, refining and delivering in the Vermilion Mound, receiving refinement and rebirth. This is called immeasurable, universally delivering without end.

There are secret celestial writings, revered by all heavens. Revealing and slighting them casts one into hell, bringing calamity upon the seven ancestral grandfathers.

The Dao states: These two hymns are the hidden sounds of the various heavens’ Supreme Emperors and the numinous demon kings. They are all the great Brahma’s words, not the common speech of the world. Their words lack ornate beauty, their melodies lack flowery grace—thus they are called profound and obscure, difficult to fathom in detail. Treasured by heaven, they are secreted in the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace of the Mystic Capital. According to the Mystic Regulations, they are transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas. If there is a perfected one bearing gold and treasures with a sincere heart, following the old statutes and pledging allegiance to the Ten Heavens, only then are they conferred.

The Dao states: The people of the world, lacking the utmost karmic affinity from past lives, their consciousness lodged in karmic transformations, their embryonic lives coarse and mortal, their life roots impure—rotting, eroding, and decaying. Through the Dao’s transformation and refinement, wondrously resonating and communicating with the divine, evil demons and foul impurities harm and bore into the joints, forming knots that do not open. This causes the numinous clarity to come and dwell, the Three Perfected to retreat. Those who study together in shared qi must all unite their hearts to cultivate the fast, burn incense in the six periods, and recite the scriptures ten times. Blessings and virtue will descend immediately, dissolving all inauspiciousness.

The scriptures of boundless measure universally deliver the limitless.

The Dao states: Those of shallow learning in the Dao, whose immortal rank remains unfulfilled, when their destined time of passing arrives and their bodies enter the Great Yin, at the moment of their departure, fellow students and perfected ones shall burn incense and recite the scriptures ten times to deliver their corporeal forms according to the proper method. With the embryonic root purified and firm, the soul’s terrace illumined on all four sides, and evil impurities severed, they shall dwell beside immortals and sages. The soul and spirit shall ascend directly to the Southern Palace, and according to the merit of their studies, they shall be reborn after a calculated number of days. Free from confusion in karmic transfer, they shall attain the state of divine immortality.

The Dao states: When the body’s foundation is unstable, illness and injury often arise; embryonic impurities corrode and erode, the face withers, the hair turns white, conception fails, descendants perish young, daily life is beset by misfortune, the Dao’s qi is cut off, the Three Corpses stir, and signs of death and harm appear—all should then undertake the fast, burn incense, and recite the scriptures. The merit of fasting, maintaining precepts, and reciting scriptures is profound: above, it transforms and stabilizes the embryonic root, preserving the body to attain the Dao; below, it eliminates evil impurities to deliver the multitudes. The blessings of life and death thus bestowed are immeasurable, and so it is said to be of boundless measure, universally delivering gods and humans.

The Dao states: Whoever possesses these scriptures and performs these meritorious deeds for teachers, friends, and all beings—on days of calamity, if they resolve to undertake the fast, burn incense, and recite the scriptures ten times—shall all transform and stabilize the embryonic root, sever evil impurities, and, as distinguished perfected ones, be deemed worthy to become ministers of the Golden Gates of the Sage Lord. The gods of the heavens record human merits and transgressions with flawless precision, down to the finest detail. The demon kings of heaven shall also protect and elevate such persons, and those who attain the Dao shall thereby fully comprehend the most profound teachings.

*The Immeasurable Sounds of the Great Brahma’s Hidden Speech in the Heavens*
*Composed by the Dao Lord*
*Central Chapter of the Numinous Writ of the Primordial Beginning*
*Eastern Eight Heavens*

Within the True Court, offerings of solemnity are made, where undifferentiated jade scrolls enfold constancy.
The moon parts from the gemstone’s radiance, as leaves upon the cavernous beams unfold.
The carriage’s bells and the alms-bowl rest, their lingering presence forgotten in reverent embrace.
Where the horse stands beneath the Hu banner, the thunderous rectitude is just and perfect.
The Dao’s secrecy weaves intent in continuity, the mysterious chart unfolds in boundless constancy.
The omen lies still in profound seclusion, its distant echoes faint yet discernible.
The essence resides in hexagrammic resonance, paired and threaded through cycles of response.
The flowing river is warm and tranquil, the empty contemplation knows no return.

**Southern Eight Heavens**
The pure qi lingers in harmonious ease, its flourishing traces deeply nourished.
Extending through the harsh and scorching, brilliance illumines the abyssal depths.
Exhausting the imperial mysteries of the distant capital, the jade granaries gleam with sacred grain.
Rosy boughs and cloud-borne offerings ascend, cinnabar and vermilion clouds advance in procession.
Luminous pearls and lush blossoms adorn the southern lands in paired abundance.
The steward listens to the profound and noble, the celestial mechanism oversees the primordial.
The warp of the great darkness reaches its extremity, the solitary yang seizes the mist.
The dragon’s movement bears secret signs, the silent gaze returns to the origin.

**Western Eight Heavens**
Inclined sorrow brushes the sprouting grass, benevolent moisture flows in gentle streams.
Withered stalks gleam with clarity, numinous transformations are subtly transmitted.
The vast and boundless expanse merges with the capital, the radiant steed soars in flight.
Through the ages, the revolving terrace turns, its motion swift and firm.
The convenient cavern holds the liquid essence, the deep pools cradle dragons and leviathans.
Reclining in divine emptiness, they preside as lords of the Eight Passes.
The flowing currents follow the strong, the ordered spheres revolve in harmony.
The embryonic dwelling dissolves into crystalline clarity, the jade nectar shines with subtle brilliance.

**Northern Eight Heavens**
Ghosts wander, consuming raw herbs, their bitterness and confinement bound in fetters.
The Nine Heavens are commanded and reviewed, the records of Han’s annotations are examined.
Elusive and indistinct, perception transcends the dragon’s intent.
Ascending and dispelling, soaring in circuits, the divine tiger guards myriad mounds.
The Luo songs resound in winding melodies, their echoes harmonize with the valleys.
Inquiries cease as overflowing responses are met, the pivot of transformation is fully discerned.
The immortal floats in silent vastness, the distant forests and counties ripple.
The treasure bends its radiant form, the Brahma-spread refines through alchemy.

The Dao declares: These hidden speeches of the Great Brahma within the heavens, these immeasurable sounds, were of old written in characters a full *zhang* in length. Should one desire to transform and stabilize the embryonic root, sever evil impurities, then inscribe the cinnabar script upon stone, sit and recite the cavernous text—thus shall corpse-demons cower in hiding, sparrows and shadows flee in terror, the haughty *ju* lose their sight, the *gu* and *yu* scatter and conceal. The celestial purity girds the body, a hundred spirits pay homage, and the summons commands the myriad gods.

Of old, the Heavenly Perfected and August One transcribed these words, establishing them as the true sound. Those who know this sound and purify themselves to recite it shall have the heavens dispatch flying celestial kings to descend and observe their form, record their merits, and ascend to report to the heavens. The myriad gods shall pay reverence, earthly deities attend at the gates, and the great merit of the demon kings shall protect and elevate the perfected. With the Dao complete, they shall thereby traverse the Three Realms and ascend through the Golden Gates.

This sound repels all, expiates all, delivers all, and accomplishes all—it is the spontaneous sound of the Heavenly Perfected. Thus, reciting it summons the flying celestials to descend in observation, the Supreme Emperor chants from afar, the myriad gods pay reverence, the Three Realms attend in reverence, the host of malevolent spirits bow their heads, ghostly essences vanish of themselves, the jade-like tones resound, the ten directions grow solemn and clear, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks swallow their mists, the myriad spirits tremble in submission, and the host of immortals is gathered. The heavens are free of defilement, the earth devoid of demonic dust, profound wisdom pervades purity, and the great measure is profoundly mysterious.

*The Marvelous Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for the Immeasurable Salvation of All, Upper Grade, Chapter Twenty-One Concludes*
*Chapter Twenty-Two*

**The Chapter on Flying Spirits Summoning Numinous Beings**

The Dao spoke: Long ago, in the Primordial Azure Heavens, within the Ninefold Radiance that illumines the Luminous and Upholds the Palace, the Primordial Beginning transmitted the *Immeasurable Upper Scripture on Flying Spirits Summoning Numinous Beings*. When the Celestial Worthy of the Primordial Beginning expounded this sutra, he circumambulated ten times to summon the ten directions, and only then ascended his throne.

From the Purple Clarity Immortal Realm, the Brahma-qi and numinous tones arose. The Lords of the Three Heavens, the Sagely Lords of the Jade Capital, the Divine Emperors of the Myriad Heavens, the Lofty Perfected of the Golden Towers, and an innumerable host descended through the void. Crimson clouds soared in the cinnabar firmament, jade wheels rolled in emerald chariots, feathered canopies cast their shade, and flowing essence and jade light suffused the five colors in luxuriant splendor, illuminating the Great Void.

For three days and three nights, the sun, moon, and stellar lodges of the myriad heavens—along with the jade celestial pivots—halted their revolutions. Divine winds stilled, mountains and seas concealed their clouds, harmonious qi spread boundlessly, and purple mists billowed in dense profusion. The heavens were free of drifting haze, the four qi shone in lucid clarity, and throughout the land, mountains, rivers, forests, and groves were leveled as one, no longer distinguished by height or depth. The earth transformed into azure jade, uniform in hue. The host of perfected beings attended the throne, as the Celestial Worthy of the Primordial Beginning sat in profound stillness upon his revolving, light-diffusing, azure-jade treasure seat in the Verdant Empyrean.

When the sutra was expounded once, the Divine Emperors of the Myriad Heavens bowed their heads in praise, declaring it excellent. As the Dharma first emerged into the world, all people beheld its wondrous principle.

When expounded twice, the ten thousand heavens of the Three Realms turned in reverent admiration and acclaim, and people attained longevity.

When expounded thrice, the reckonings of the Five Agents were revealed, free from birth and extinction.

When expounded four times, the outer realm became profoundly still, and the inner realm awakened to clarity.

When expounded five times, the path of life opened, and the gate of death was instantly sealed.

When expounded six times, the sequence of qi harmonized, and the four seasons merged as one.

When expounded seven times, birth and death became joyous, without end.

When expounded eight times, those who awakened to the wondrous Dharma ascended to the immortal realms.

When expounded nine times, birds, beasts, grasses, and trees all attained their full span, spared from premature harm.

When expounded ten times, the lingering souls and stagnant spirits long sunk in hell were all liberated.

At that time, every man and woman in the land turned their hearts in devotion, received protection and deliverance, and all attained longevity.

The Dao spoke: At that moment, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded the sutra once. The Ten Heavenly Lords of Luminous Brilliance from the Eastern Direction, accompanied by their divine officials and soldiers—an immeasurable host—floated through the void to arrive.

When expounded twice, the Ten Heavenly Lords of Crimson Clarity from the Southern Direction, accompanied by their divine officials and soldiers—an immeasurable host—floated through the void to arrive.

When expounded thrice, the Ten Heavenly Lords of Pristine Clarity from the Western Direction, accompanied by their divine officials and soldiers—an immeasurable host—floated through the void to arrive.

When expounded four times, the Ten Heavenly Lords of Mystic Clarity from the Northern Direction, accompanied by their divine officials and soldiers—an immeasurable host—floated through the void to arrive.

When expounded five times, the Ten Heavenly Lords of Cavernous Clarity from the Northeast, accompanied by their divine officials and soldiers—an immeasurable host—floated through the void to arrive.

When expounded six times, the Ten Heavenly Lords of Radiant Clarity from the Southeast, accompanied by their divine officials and soldiers—an immeasurable host—floated through the void to arrive.

When expounded seven times, the Ten Heavenly Lords of Detached Clarity from the Southwest, accompanied by their divine officials and soldiers—an immeasurable host—floated through the void to arrive.

When expounded eight times, the Ten Heavenly Lords of Numinous Clarity from the Northwest, accompanied by their divine officials and soldiers—an immeasurable host—floated through the void to arrive.

When expounded nine times, the Ten Thousand Heavenly Lords of Pervasive Clarity from the Upper Direction, accompanied by their divine officials and soldiers—an immeasurable host—floated through the void to arrive.

When expounded ten times, the sovereigns of the cavern-heavens and layered mountain-valleys from the Lower Direction, along with their divine soldiers and ghostly officials—an incalculable multitude—ascended through the void to arrive.

When the tenth recitation was complete, the great Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions and Boundless Heavens arrived all at once. The living beings of the land bowed in reverence, their devotion surging like ocean waves or gushing springs. The immeasurable host pressed so densely that half the land sank beneath their weight, an irresistible force.

Then the Primordial One transformed into radiance, emanating from between his brows, illuminating the ten directions. His divided forms entered the light, each bearing the sacred image of the Primordial One. The radiance then returned to coalesce between his brows into a perfect pearl, vast as heaven and earth, suffusing the cosmos. His form dissolved into boundlessness, his transformations arising spontaneously. The heavens and the void were wholly contained within the pearl.

Gazing upward, the heavenly beings saw only the myriad forms of the Primordial One and the myriad Heavenly Lords, teeming as they entered the pearl’s mouth. Once within, their whereabouts became unknown. The people dispersed, and the land returned to levelness, the unevenness gone.

Upon the luminous pearl, the Primordial One completed the sutra’s recitation. The Perfected Ones oversaw the transmission, bestowing it upon me. At that moment, joy and celebration defied expression. The Dharma rites concluded, and the hosts of heaven returned to their stations. In an instant, all fell silent, leaving no trace.

At that time, the heavenly beings and mortals who encountered the sutra universally received celestial grace, all attaining deliverance. Their allotted years were preserved, free from premature harm. The entire land turned in devotion, their hearts inclined toward goodness. Endless kalpas passed without decay or ruin, loss or departure, separation or dispersal, death or injury. Their words bore no ornate embellishment, their speech no ill will. With unified compassion, even those of different lineages became kin. The land knew peace, the people prosperity, and all rejoiced in great harmony.

From the sutra’s first revelation, the land embraced the Dao. Those who had cultivated utmost sincerity, reverence, and devotion all attained transcendence.

The Dao spoke: The words uttered by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy during the sutra’s recitation are the secret and profound texts of the Three Luminaries’ Lord, the hidden names by which the Jade Emperor of the Northern Culmen transforms and summons the Perfected. These are no ordinary worldly phrases.

The loftiest sages, having attained Perfection, soar in spirit and summon the numinous, penetrating the profound and subtle. Those who master its verses and recite them ten times command the reverence of the Ten Thousand Heavens, the Three Realms heed the Dharma, rivers and seas grow still, mountains and peaks conceal their clouds, sun and moon pause in their course, the celestial spheres halt their turning, yin and yang harmonize, day and night become equally bright, demonic hordes bind their forms, ghostly spirits lose their essence, the dead rise from their corpses, and white bones become living beings.

For the most devoted scholars who recite it ten times, the Five Emperors stand guard, the Three Realms bow in homage, ghostly officials bind their forms, demonic spirits submit to the Dharma, and those on the brink of death are delivered, cut off from demise yet restored to life.

Yet for beginning Daoists whose impurities of blood remain unrefined, whose spirits are not yet clear and unimpeded, whose bodies lack purity and tranquility, whose forms have not attained profound Perfection—those who cannot restrain the ten directions, whose power does not govern the celestial administrations, whose virtue cannot subdue the earthly deities, who bind demonic spirits but treat the text as mere ornament, failing to fathom its subtleties—reciting these verses lightly brings calamity upon themselves and misfortune upon their nine generations.

Those who honor and revere it with devotion bring prosperity to their households, flourishing through the ages, attaining Perfection as immortals, untouched by the ten thousand disasters, with divine protectors guarding their gates.

This sutra is supremely sacred, unmatched in the Jade Capital. It delivers countless beings, serving as the root of all Daoist teachings. Its majestic standard and virtue are beyond measure.

The Dao spoke: Whoever recites this sutra ten times summons the assembled heavens. Their ancestors across ten thousand generations, along with all their kin and dependents, are instantly delivered, ascending to the Vermilion Palace. After nine years of refinement, they are transformed and reborn as Perfected Ones.

Those who diligently study this sutra, fulfilling their merit and virtue, all attain immortality, ascending to the Golden Gates and roaming the Jade Capital.

Advanced scholars who cultivate and recite this sutra, their spirits complete and qi perfected, ascend to the Southern Palace.

Intermediate scholars who receive and recite this sutra are instantly delivered, attaining immortality.

Beginning scholars who awaken to this sutra’s meaning immediately perfect the Five Phases, their comings and goings at will, no longer subject to the ghostly officials. Should they be reborn, receiving this sutra again, they swiftly ascend, roaming the great void.

This sutra is wondrous and subtle, delivering boundless beings. All heavenly and mortal beings receive its blessings. It gathers the immeasurable Dao, bestowing grace upon life and death. Treasured by the heavens, it is not transmitted to the lower worlds, forever sealed within the Jade Treasury. Once every thirty-six thousand years, when the kalpa’s destiny stirs, it is transmitted under celestial oath.

Reckless disclosure or negligence brings calamity upon nine generations, inviting misfortune upon one’s lineage, and condemning the offender to eternal servitude under the spirit-officials. Divine soldiers and generals, along with the five Emperors’ attendants—thirty-six Crimson Numinous Gold Lads and thirty-six Azure-Waisted Jade Maidens—guard the sacred text, shielding the body of the sutra’s recipient.

The Dao declares: During the long fast of the first month, recite and chant this sutra, and the spirit flies to summon the numinous; the soul ascends to the Nine Heavens, merging with the Dao in truth. During the long fast of the seventh month, recite and chant this sutra, and the spirit remains undimmed, moving freely through the unseen; penetrating the subtle and obscure, one forever preserves long life. During the long fast of the tenth month, recite and chant this sutra, and inner and outer clarity become complete; qi departs and returns, the spirit follows one’s will, gathering and dispersing, transforming at will—all attain liberation, the nature awakens to true emptiness, and peace is established in its realm, earning the title of Great Peace. On the eight seasonal nodes, recite and chant this sutra, and one becomes a ranked immortal of the Southern Palace. On one’s life-destiny day, recite and chant this sutra, transcending the Three Realms, ascending through the Golden Gate, free from suffering and affliction; the body radiates light, attended by the Three Realms’ guardians, welcomed by the Five Emperors, with myriad spirits paying homage. One’s name is inscribed in the heavens; when merit is fulfilled and virtue perfected, one ascends to the Upper Clarity.

The Dao declares: On the day of practicing the Dao, one must bathe in fragrant water, enter the chamber in purity, face east, and knock the teeth thirty-two times, reaching the Thirty-Two Heavens. Bow thirty-two times in the heart, close the eyes, and silently envision the body seated amidst the pure yang five-colored Brahma-qi of the Nine Empyreans. Within and without, all is shrouded in mist, with the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Lion, and White Crane arrayed to the left and right. The radiance of sun and moon illuminates heaven and earth; the body transforms myriad times, traversing the ten directions—all made vividly manifest.

The secret incantation states:
Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Dao Lord.
Summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the left and right attendants, the Jade Lads bearing incense, the Jade Maidens transmitting words, the Five Emperors’ direct talismans, and the incense officials of the day—thirty-six each—opening and conveying these words.
Today is auspicious; the long fast purifies the hall, and the supreme sutra is practiced to deliver boundless beings. May these words ascend directly to the presence of the Most High Primordial Sovereign of the Thirty-Two Heavens.
Conclude by drawing qi thirty-two times, then face east and recite the sutra.

*The Primordial Beginning’s Wondrous Sutra of Boundless Salvation*
*The Primordial Beginning’s Cavern-Mysterious Flying Spirit Summons the Numinous, Supreme Wondrous Chapter*
Transforming myriad beings, a thousand changes conceal its rhymes; separation and union arise naturally, emerging from emptiness and entering the formless. The Crimson Text of Chaos penetrates the formless, the supreme truth; the Primordial Beginning’s ancestral kalpa gives birth to gods and spirits, illuminating the ten thousand kinds—this is the root of the Dao. Above, it has no further ancestor; only the Dao is its body. It penetrates heaven and earth, dividing spirits to transform the numinous. Without script, there is no illumination; without script, there is no clarity; without script, there is no establishment; without script, there is no completion; without script, there is no deliverance; without script, there is no birth—this is called the Heaven of Great Brahma within the heavens. The Purple Jade Floating Terrace, the Azure Empyrean Brahma Capital, the Supreme Ultimate without peer, the Great Veil of Jade Clarity. All-embracing, it shifts the qi of the myriad spirits; in the vastness of kalpas, it seems to vanish yet remains. The Three Radiant Realms, the Six Celestial Courts’ vast halls, the Flowering Chambers and Infant Quarters, the Purple Tenuity’s divine radiance, the Nine-Flowered Brahma-qi pervading the ten directions. Within it resides the Lord of Longevity of the Southern Culmen; within it resides the Lord of Flying Spirit Summoning the Numinous; within it resides the Great Spirit of Natural Transformation; within it resides the Spirit Lord Penetrating Heaven and Earth; within it resides the Spirit of Qi Transforming Myriad Forms. Roaming the great void, the wondrous and venerable spirits revive the dead, delivering boundless beings. Today, the celestial audit is recorded, and all heavens descend in attendance.

From the boundless east, the Flying Spirit Summons the Numinous, the Great Sage of Longevity, delivering boundless beings.
From the boundless south, the Flying Spirit Summons the Numinous, the Great Sage of Longevity, delivering boundless beings.
From the boundless west, the Flying Spirit Summons the Numinous, the Great Sage of Longevity, delivering boundless beings.

From the boundless below, the Flying Spirit Summons the Numinous, the Great Sage of Longevity, delivering boundless beings.
The perfected flying spirits of the ten directions, the great gods of summoning the numinous, longevity, and delivering the world, all ride upon cloud chariots with five-colored kingfisher-feather canopies, crimson-petaled pearl palanquins with dragon-heads, drawn by numinous phoenixes and flanked by jade simurghs. They bear the thousand-spirit-transforming numinous standards and the myriad-qi-gathering-and-dispersing spirit banners. Ahead, divine tigers roar in echo; behind, azure dragons unfurl their might. Heavenly deer ward off evil, thunderous beasts resound; their calls alternate in harmony, their radiance intermingles in support. The Seven Luminaries open the gates; a thousand perfected surround the chariot; countless immortals float in the void, reverently welcoming the Dharma-chariot, humbly bearing the tokens of faith. With single-minded devotion, they bow in reverence, gazing up to the numinous sound. The chief minister of the supreme court, the Fire Official of Southern Mound, the immortal elder overseeing the sutra, the great spirit in charge of the registers—holding the sutra and grasping the ledgers—all arrive before the Emperor. According to those to be delivered, they strictly audit the heavens. Universally proclaimed to the Three Realms and the boundless spirit-lands, the Luminous Jade Pavilion, the Jasper Chamber and Flowering Hall, the Spirit Treasury of the Great One, the Nine Qi Brahma Heaven—ancestral forebears and kin of kalpas past have their sin-records in the dark mystery obliterated and dissolved, no longer bound or detained. Spirit and Dao unite in accord. The Primordial Beginning issues the decree: at this very moment, ascend and be promoted. The audit is recorded in the Vermilion Palace; body and soul are refined and tempered. Numinous demons vouch in protection; one is ranked and delivered to the Southern Palace.

Souls of the dead undergo refinement, transformed into immortals and reborn as humans; the living receive deliverance, enduring through kalpas unending, revolving with the cycles of time, their years equaling heaven’s own. Forever delivered from the Three Paths, the Five Sufferings, and the Eight Adversities, they transcend the Three Realms, roaming freely in the Supreme Purity.

Thirty-two Heavens, thirty-two Emperors—the esoteric secrets of the Jade Purity, the hidden mysteries of the Supreme Purity. The Brahma-voices of the Nine Empyreans, the wondrous principles of spontaneity, the jade texts of the myriad heavens, the dragon-script of the celestial realm. Jade talismans and sacred seals, the divine mechanisms of heaven, the numinous demons of the Nine Heavens, the hidden names of the Grand Purity. Ten thousand harmonies and a thousand unions, transforming and soaring as spirits, boundless treasures beyond measure. The Perfected and the divine descend in manifestation, universally delivering heaven and humanity.

Today, in joyous celebration of receiving deliverance, passing through the barriers of all heavens, one petitions to extinguish the Three Evils, sever the roots of earthly bondage, ascend beyond the Five Gates, and inscribe one’s name in the Great Mystery. The Demon Kings oversee and vouch, unhindered at the gates of heaven.

The Eastern Dipper engenders life, the Western Dipper dispels calamity, the Northern Dipper extends one’s years, the Southern Dipper bestows prosperity, the Central Dipper transforms form, governing all spirits in repose. The Azure Emperor commands the flight of spirits, the White Emperor gathers the hun-souls, the Red Emperor streams forth light, the Black Emperor summons the ling-souls, the Yellow Emperor ascends within—ten thousand spirits unite in luminous clarity.

The Black Heaven Demon King wields mighty power to enforce his will.

The Five Great Demon Emperors, lords of all spirits, soar through the Three Realms, commanding divine legions. Brandishing banners and holding staffs of authority, they traverse the vastness of the cosmos, styling themselves as divine might, acclaimed by all heavens for their merit.

Heaven delivers humanity, bestowing the numinous texts; the Most Perfected receive the mandate, descending the Dharma to summon spirits. The Eight Mighties establish the foundation, the myriad qi unfold in splendor. Brocade standards lead the vanguard, azure-armored warriors bear the pennants. Fire is cast a thousand miles, ringing bells resound in eight directions. Should any dare to obstruct or resist the Supreme Perfected, golden axes strike first, massive halberds punish after. Evil and filth are swept away, wind and fire never cease. Thousands upon thousands are beheaded, myriads upon myriads are dismembered—demons dare not trespass, ghosts harbor no malevolent spirits.

The Three Officials audit the records, the spirit-officers examine the souls; none may conceal or hide, all is presented at the Golden Horse Post. Universally proclaimed without end, all spirits heed the decree. The Five Emperors of the Three Realms declare before the Supreme Purity.

The Cavernous Origin traverses the kalpas, the Jade Imperial Court inaugurates the aeon. The Two Modes strike the image, the primordial chaos first divides. Above, no realm of form; below, no root of form. The Dao abides in mysterious quiescence, the numinous wind arises spontaneously. Between heaven and earth, no forgetting, no thought. No origin, no source, no substance, no encumbrance. All-embracing, illuminating the ten directions, from the first kalpa of the Dragon Han, transmission unfolds and life begins. In the *ren-chen* year, deliverance is inaugurated, transforming and nurturing the multitude of primal beings. The gates of death are sealed, the roots of rebirth extinguished. Qi and spirit commune in clarity, gathering in the divine court. Above, they surge into the Great Void; below, they penetrate the hidden barriers. The hundred parts unite as one, within and without unharmed. Spirit follows the movement of qi, transforming without cease. One body, ten thousand forms; breath is not light. Spirit roams the Three Realms, qi pervades the ten directions. Gathering and dispersing as one, all proceeds from my own body. At the center, the Spirit King; the mind is the master of spirit. When mind and spirit unite, flying spirits are summoned, and the immortal Dao may be entered. One gazes levelly upon the lofty Perfected.

The Supreme Ultimate in primordial chaos, the golden casket and jade texts, penetrating the profound and subtle, seated in communion with the Eight Luminaries. Flying illumination spans billions, nature settles and spirit stills, returning wind and purple mist. The Dao encompasses all phenomena, the Dharma subdues a thousand demons. United with the Dao, one naturally becomes Perfected. The Perfected within the Perfected, the Great Lord of Eternal Life, the Jade Numinous Noble, the Flying Transcendent Deity. Roaming the void as sovereign, inwardly governing the Perfected form, qi gathers and spirit is complete, preserving life and rooting existence. The numinous spirit is eternally secure, entering and exiting the Supreme Purity, within the Eight Directions, amid the Three Realms.

Transforming the myriad spirits, mastering the Three Palaces, responding to the summons of the Nine Springs, merging with the hosts of spirits. Ten revolutions return one to transcendence, the numinous qi is fully generated, the immortal Dao concealed and mysterious, its workings delivering humanity. Above, the Gate of Heaven opens, the flying spirit summons the numinous, ascending beyond the Jade Towers, through kalpas without cease. Universally receiving transformation, the body attains the rank of Perfected, refining form in the Great Void, forever severed from mundane ties. Above, traversing the Nine Heavens, journeying through the Three Terraces, refining the corpse in the Yellow Court, ascending to the Great Clarity. Above the Great Clarity lies this immortal gate.

Within it, the flying spirit and the summons of the numinous, the Perfected King’s numinous verses intermingle with the lofty Perfected.

**First: The Flying Spirit Chapter of the Jade Treasury of the Divine Empyrean**
The spirit’s transformations are profound and boundless. Qi and spirit unite, truly entering the immortal gate. The spirit governs the body, qi rules the spirit. When spirit and qi are both wondrous, they join in guiding the lofty Perfected. The flying numen spans the Eight Extremities, summoning the myriad spirits. Only the Dao may accompany, penetrating the dark and obscure. Returning wind fans the luminaries, heaven and earth nurture life. Recitation dispels calamity, awakening leads to Perfection. Within Perfection lies wondrous principle, returning to the root and securing the origin. The Great One’s Perfected Demons, the Prime Minister of the Original Lords. Concealed and unseen, enduring through billions of kalpas.

**Second: The Washing Perfection Summons the Numinous Song of the Jade Treasury of the Purple Tenuity**
The Spirit Court conceals the Great Veil, the Brahma-qi serves as its sovereign. Stillness is its constant state; movement brings awakening. Hidden within the Purple Prime Metropolis, its flourishing fortune spreads like flowing talismans. The Flower Chamber billows with purple mist, the Numinous Terrace releases long verses. The Dharma of opening and establishing the myriad existences encompasses the Six Voids to completion. The Great Dao is quiescent and formless; attaining the Dao returns it to your body. Sever the root, extinguish the gate of death, the flying spirit enters the Great Clarity. Transcending billions of kalpas’ paths, forever departing the Northern Demon Palace.

Crossing the Three Realms, the Dao steers through the vast sky.
Ascending to Non-Action, merging with the immortal Perfected.
Having attained True Emptiness, the bonds of past lives open.
The flying numen spans the Eight Directions, through billions of kalpas without end.
Wondrous principle penetrates Perfection, the Void’s profundity vast and boundless.
Investigating the origin and returning to the source, entering and exiting upon the numinous wind.

**Third: The Hidden Taboo Song of the Heavenly Worthy of the Luminous Empyrean**
The Jade Celestial conceals the subtle, the Great Dao is hidden within. The Utmost Perfected is formless, taking the Dao as its body. Moving the spirit to summon the numinous, embracing and encompassing the cosmos. Within, replete; without, void—yang’s radiance and yin’s essence. The Floating Black’s profound stillness, the body enters the distant and obscure. Transformations arise naturally, roaming and observing the Great Void. Above the Great Void, merging with the Nine Completions. The five constituents are fully generated, the hundred spirits all at peace. Exiting and entering, the shadow follows; following the shadow, the Perfected is revealed. The Perfected within the Perfected is this True Emptiness. Awakening and attaining the Dao, preserving it for eternal existence.

If you do not awaken to the true Dao, you will forever sink in the Northern Feng of Luo. The root of the turning wheel of life and death, the Six Destinies lack an immortal gate. Above this Ninefold Empyrean, within the Jade Numen, the Spirit King’s song resounds, its tones harmonizing with the Jade Pitchpipes, its numen intermingling with the Golden Scriptures. Recite it a hundred times to transcend the Southern Palace. Recite it a thousand times to be ranked among the lofty Perfected. Ten thousand recitations complete the Dao, ascending to the Jade Clarity, transcending the Three Realms, and registering in the immortal ledgers.

Those who hear the numinous sound command the reverence of demon kings, who dispatch earthly deities to escort and receive, extricating from the earthly gate, the Five Sufferings and Eight Tribulations. Seven generations of ancestors ascend, forever departing the Northern Palace, the soul crossing the Vermilion Mound to undergo refinement and rebirth. This is called the Immeasurable, universally delivering the boundless.

There are secret celestial texts, revered by all heavens. To leak or profane them is to cast them down to earthly peaks, bringing calamity upon seven generations of ancestors.

The Dao states: These two chapters are the hidden numinous sounds of the Jade Celestial Emperor and the Ninefold Empyrean Spirit King, all in the language of the Great Brahma, not the common speech of the world. Their words lack ornate beauty, their melodies lack florid grace—thus they are called abstruse and profound, difficult to fathom in detail. Treasured by the heavens, they are concealed within the Jade Treasury of the Divine Empyrean’s forbidden Jeweled Palace and Flowery Hall’s scripture chambers, to be transmitted according to the mysterious statutes every thirty-six thousand kalpas. If there is a perfected one whose inner treasure-nature is luminous, who follows the ancient protocols to pledge alliance with the Three Heavens, only then shall they be bestowed.

The Dao states: The revolutions of heaven and earth also have their ends. The sun, moon, and five planets also wax and wane. The utmost sagely and numinous ones also have their periods of rest and decline. Those of shallow learning also suffer afflictions. When such disasters befall, fellow practitioners should all move the spirit and refine qi, receiving transformation and deliverance. Reciting the scripture ten times to summon the numinous spirits, they may regain rebirth.

The Immeasurable Text universally delivers the boundless.

The Dao states: Those of shallow learning in the Dao, whose immortal rank is not yet fulfilled, whose spirit and qi are not yet complete, unable to fly and summon, whose workings face extinction—when their bodies pass through the Great Yin and the time of transition arrives, fellow perfected practitioners should burn incense, recite scriptures, transmit the Dharma, and awaken their numinous spirits to deliver their corporeal forms according to the method. Their ethereal souls shall ascend directly to the Southern Palace, and according to their accumulated merit, they shall attain rebirth after a calculated number of days. No longer deluded by the turning wheel, they shall attain immortality.

The Dao states: When the revolutions of heaven and earth reach their end, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When the constellations err in their courses and the sun and moon lose their proper times, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When the four seasons lose their order and yin and yang fall out of harmony, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When the sovereign faces calamity and warfare arises on all sides, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When fellow practitioners pass away, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When pestilence spreads and the multitudes suffer death and injury, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures.

The merit of purification rites and scripture recitation is profoundly weighty. Above, it dispels heavenly disasters and safeguards the emperor; below, it wards off poisonous harm and delivers the multitudes. In life and death, they receive its blessings—its fortune is immeasurable. Thus it is called the Immeasurable, universally delivering heaven and humanity.

The Dao states: Whoever possesses this scripture and performs these meritorious deeds for the sovereign of heaven and earth, the emperor, and the multitudes shall cause the flying spirit to ascend to the Jade Towers and summon the numinous to the immortal capital.

When days of calamity arrive, one must wholeheartedly perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures ten times. All these deeds are recorded by the celestial hosts, guarded by myriad spirits, and the adept attains the rank of a Right Separate Sage, thus becoming a minister of the saintly emperor in the Golden Palaces.

The celestial hosts record the deeds and transgressions of mortals without the slightest omission. Even the demon kings of the heavens will recommend your name, and those who attain the Dao shall comprehend these profound truths.

The flying spirits of the celestial realms summon the hidden numinous voices of the Immeasurable Sound. The Dao Lord composed the *Elemental Scriptures of Primordial Mystery*, the *Middle Chapter of the Eastern Eight Heavens*—the *Exalted and Marvelous Original*—revealing the floating and effulgent.

The gate of the void opens, and the empty branches bloom. The lands of Hua and Lu resplendently align. Reverence is extended to the sagacious, and their brilliance illuminates the boundless void. The joyous forests flourish, nurturing the myriad mystic pearls, which, once formed, emit a fragrant mist. Their scent unfurls, and the radiant light spreads with the wings of a dipper star, enveloping the northern pivot.

The Primordial One’s numinous chamber gazes upon the azure abode, bowing and rising in reverence. The transgressor returns to the divine expanse, their essence revolving with the numinous body.

---
**The Southern Eight Heavens**
The light stirs the crimson mists, and the Azure Mound trembles with fire. The shadow of the sun reddened, as dragons and tigers ascend and descend. The radiant display unfurls, and the emerald brilliance blazes forth. The sun travels with the clouds, and the luminous radiance spreads uniformly. The fragrant vapors disperse, and the patterned stars are revealed. The qi stirs the foundation, returning to the boundless clarity. The boundless void is established, and the marvelous transformations unfold. The augury supports and builds, and the celestial palace steadies the spirits.

---
**The Western Eight Heavens**
The golden light branches into six rays, void yet vast as the Great Di. The pure brilliance shines, and the empty flowers bloom with hidden splendor. Grace bestows the true essence, and the harmonious song spreads at dusk. The luminous clarity distinguishes evil, and the lineage holds fast. The teachings spread across the cosmos, and the square mirror reflects the shadow. The radiant guardians uphold the firm reeds, and the divine garments congeal with victory. Suddenly, the auspicious strategies converge, and the ranks align in brilliance. The mighty and vast authority unites, and the符车 [auspicious vehicles] harmonize in separation.

---
**The Northern Eight Heavens**
The abyss is pure, and the floating lotus does not depart from the profound coolness. The Lu wheels round in its lofty carriage, and the dark mists are trained to expand. The vermilion banners bend with the mounted, and the displayed banners stretch long. The retreating summons the demonic souls, and the统复 [celestial registers] are restored. The submerged breathes within the floral pouch, and the curved paths gather wounds. The universal transformation descends, and the luminous capital attains enduring prosperity. The level follows the secluded protection, and the pursuit of the hidden returns the light. The merit is boundless, and the myriad transformations become celestial immortals.

The Dao states: These are the hidden utterances of the Jade Dawn Heaven, the Immeasurable Sound of the Great Brahman, all inscribed in jade script and vermilion seals, dragon patterns, and cloud-like seals. Concealed within the inner palace’s flowered hall, they rest in a golden treasure chest, radiating a hundred zhang of light, amidst the five-colored divine qi and spiritual inscriptions. The True King of the Celestial Tower, the Lord of the Azure and Verdant Peach, all know this sound and transmit its text.

Those who perform purification rites and recite it shall have the flying celestial kings dispatched by all the heavens to observe their bodies, recording their merits and labors, and report them to the celestial hosts. The myriad spirits shall pay homage, the earthly deities guard the gates, the Jade Purity dispels demons, the divine kings recommend them, and the upper immortals bestow the Dao. Thus, one attains the flying spirits of the Three Realms and summons the thousand true ones.

This sound transforms all, penetrates all, delivers all, and accomplishes all—it is the natural sound of the Heavenly True. Therefore, reciting it draws the flying celestials to observe below, the Supreme Deity to sing afar, the celestial hosts to pay homage, the Three Realms to attend the hall, the myriad demons to bow their heads, and the ten thousand spirits to gather in protection. The harmonious qi follows the flow, and the auspicious mists rise thickly. The divine and numinous descend in stillness, and the jade and agate resound. The ten directions grow solemn and pure, the rivers and seas fall silent, the mountains and hills swallow the smoke, and all spirits tremble in submission. The gathering of the celestial assembly, the heavens free of impurities, the earth without dust, the dark wisdom illuminated—this is the boundless, profound, and profoundest virtue.

**The Supreme Treasure of Immeasurable Deliverance, Chapter Twenty-Two of the Marvelous Scripture, concludes. Chapter Twenty-Three begins.**

**The Supreme Treasure of Immeasurable Deliverance, Chapter Twenty-Three**

**The Chapter on Summoning True Beings and Spirits**

The Dao speaks: *"In days of yore, within the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate, the Purple Radiance soared in song, and the Great Communing God of the Earth received the transmission from the Primordial Origin to summon true beings and spirits in immeasurable ranks. When the Primordial Heavenly Venerable was to expound this scripture, circling ten times to call forth the ten directions, the True Beings of the Heavenly Primordial would then arrive at the seat.*

*The Heavenly True Great God, the Supreme Sage of High Venerability, the True Person of Wondrous Conduct, with countless hosts beyond reckoning, rode the void and came. Purple mists ascended to the heavens, feathered cavalry in cloud-chariots, rainbow banners and crimson canopies, casting a radiant glow upon the morning light. Five-colored silks enshrouded the skies, their brilliance illuminating the nine heavens. For seven days and seven nights, all the celestial and terrestrial realms, the sun, moon, and stars, the seas and mountain caverns—all opened and brightened at once. Sacred light shone through, the vital qi purified, and within a single realm, earth and mountains, rivers and forests, all flattened into equal plainness, with no high or low. The soil transformed into seven treasures of rare wonders, tenfold hues of marvelous colors.

*The True Ones attended the seat, while the Primordial Heavenly Venerable ascended the floating void-seat of the Heavenly Cavern, the divine golden seat of ever-shifting transformations. When the scripture was expounded once, the Heavenly True Great Sage simultaneously praised its excellence. At that time, all men and women within the realm revered virtue and Dao, awakening to their true nature. When expounded twice, divine transformations became manifest. When expounded thrice, the obscured understanding reached profound clarity. When expounded four times, the celestial void resounded with wondrous tones, and refined melodies took form. When expounded five times, the void echoed with sacred script, its brilliance illuminating the eight directions. When expounded six times, the High True Ones and Supreme Sages descended to teach humanity. When expounded seven times, the Three Caverns’ teachings were universally proclaimed. When expounded eight times, hidden and revealed spirits responded in kind, their thoughts aligning with benevolence, blessings descending with virtue. When expounded nine times, demonic trials ceased, and the Five Emperors raised sages. When expounded ten times, the hundred spirits coalesced, and the ten thousand *qi* forces ascended in harmony. At that time, all men and women within the realm—without exception—turned their hearts in devotion, all receiving protection and attaining longevity.*

*The Dao speaks: At that time, when the Primordial Heavenly Venerable expounded the scripture once, the Great God of the Boundless Primordial and Limitless of the Eastern Direction, with countless hosts beyond reckoning, floated through the void and arrived. When expounded twice, the Great God of the Boundless Primordial and Limitless of the Southern Direction, with countless hosts beyond reckoning, floated through the void and arrived. When expounded thrice, the Great God of the Boundless Primordial and Limitless of the Western Direction, with countless hosts beyond reckoning, floated through the void and arrived. When expounded four times, the Great God of the Boundless Primordial and Limitless of the Northern Direction, with countless hosts beyond reckoning, floated through the void and arrived. When expounded five times, the Great God of the Boundless Primordial and Limitless of the Northeast Direction, with countless hosts beyond reckoning, floated through the void and arrived. When expounded six times, the Great God of the Boundless Primordial and Limitless of the Southeast Direction, with countless hosts beyond reckoning, floated through the void and arrived. When expounded seven times, the Great God of the Boundless Primordial and Limitless of the Southwest Direction, with countless hosts beyond reckoning, floated through the void and arrived. When expounded eight times, the Great God of the Boundless Primordial and Limitless of the Northwest Direction, with countless hosts beyond reckoning, floated through the void and arrived. When expounded nine times, the Great God of the Boundless Primordial and Limitless of the Upper Direction, with countless hosts beyond reckoning, floated through the void and arrived. When expounded ten times, the Great God of the Boundless Primordial and Limitless of the Lower Direction, with countless hosts beyond reckoning, floated through the void and arrived. Upon completing the tenfold circuit, the Heavenly True Great Gods of the ten directions arrived together at once. All men and women within the realm turned their hearts in reverence, and those who came were as countless as clouds and mist converging. Countless hosts filled half the land, causing it to sink unevenly—an occurrence beyond restraint.*

*Thus, the Primordial Origin transformed a treasure mountain, resembling Kunlun, within which lay a cavern with four jade doors, suspended in the void above the earth by a thousand *zhang*. The Primordial Origin ascended and led the Heavenly True Great Gods, the Supreme Sages of High Venerability, the True Persons of Wondrous Conduct, and the Boundless Primordial True Gods of the ten directions—countless hosts beyond reckoning—all entering the treasure mountain. The celestial and human beings gazed upward and saw only a surging radiance entering the jade doors. Once inside, their whereabouts became unknown. The people of the realm dispersed, and the land returned to its even plainness, with no further sinking.*

*The Primordial Origin then completed the expounding of the scripture within the treasure mountain. The True Ones oversaw the transmission, entrusting it to me. At that moment, the joy and celebration were beyond words. The sacred rites were fully observed, the celestial hosts returned to their stations, and in an instant, all traces of sound vanished. At that time, those who encountered the scripture’s teachings were universally delivered, granted longevity, and freed from sickness. All who turned their hearts in devotion awakened to true understanding—untainted by deceit or falsehood, unclouded by ignorance or folly, unwayward or reckless, without craving or desire, without thought or deliberation. Their nature harmonized with the Dao, their essence merging with the Supreme Truth. Benevolence and kindness became their foundation, and customs flourished in purity. The realm was secure, its people prosperous, all rejoicing in great peace. The teaching of the scripture began, and the realm was governed by the Dao. Those with sincere devotion, who revered and honored it with proper rites, all attained deliverance for the world.*

*The Dao speaks: The names spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Venerable within the scripture are the inner designations of the Celestial Sovereigns, hidden and resonant sounds, also the taboo names within the Divine Summit and the secret names of the Jade Cavern—not the common words of the world. Those who have already become True Persons through Supreme Sagehood, mastering the profound and fathoming the subtle, can fully comprehend these passages. If one recites them ten times, the celestial hosts will respond from afar, the myriad emperors will offer rites, the rivers and seas will fall silent, the Heavenly True Ones will descend to the court, summoning the spirits by decree. The Three Heavens will halt their processions, the celestial officials will assemble in ranks, bearing the jade maps of the Red Emperor and holding the hidden scrolls of the Black Sovereign. They will restore the living from death, summon the True Ones to life, transform white bones into flesh, and elevate mortals to high sages. The most learned scholars, if they recite it ten times, will have the Five Emperors inspect them, the Three Officials pardon their transgressions, the earthly roots be severed, demonic trials cease to intrude, and the dying be delivered from death, the perished restored to life."*

Thus it is: the scholar’s impure *qi* has yet to be dispelled, his body has not yet pierced to the True, and so he cannot yet govern the Ten Directions. His power has not yet subdued the Heavenly *Zhi* (官), nor can he bind and restrain the demonic spirits. He can only avert death, not restore life.

If one recites this chapter lightly, calamity will befall his body. If he honors and nourishes it with reverence, his household will flourish in prosperity generation after generation, linking with virtuous causes, and all misfortunes will not touch him, while divine spirits guard his gate.

This scripture is most revered and sublime, unmatched in the Jade Capital (玉京), its salvation limitless, the root of all *Dao*s. The august *Dafan* (大梵), its virtue surpassing measure.

The *Dao* says: For those who recite this scripture ten times, summoning the True Ones and calling forth spirits, all the heavens will gather in concert, the gods of the seas and mountains will attend, the sovereigns of *yin* and *yang*, and the masters of the Five Agents will come together to protect and guide. They will present petitions to the High Celestial (高宸), and the *Dao* will attain longevity, receiving the Jade Book, ascending to rank among the imperial ministers. When virtue is fulfilled and merit is complete, none will fail to ascend, to attend the Golden Gate (金阙) and feast in the Jade Capital (玉京).

The most learned scholars, practicing and reciting this scripture, will summon the True Ones and call forth spirits, blending and transforming the myriad gods, piercing to the hidden subtleties, and refining themselves to ascend.

Even ordinary folk, though they may not grasp the profound essence, if their devotion and concentration are earnest, can also invoke the True Ones and spirits, prolonging the reception of wondrous *qi*, nourishing their form, escaping sickness, preserving life and years, and later attaining the *Shijie* (尸解) *Dao*—where the soul and spirit temporarily vanish, avoiding the underworld, and swiftly returning to their form, wandering the Great Void (太空).

This scripture is subtle and all-encompassing, its blessings boundless for all beings of heaven and earth. Its benefits transcend life and death, treasured by the heavens, yet not passed down to the mortal world. Only the worthy, bearing golden treasures and offering their sincerity, swear by heaven to transmit it. If one reveals or treats it carelessly, the nine ancestral teachers will suffer retribution, and he will be enslaved to the ghostly officials.

Five Imperial ministers—Jade Boys and Jade Girls, thirty-two each—attend as guardians of this scripture, protecting those who receive it.

The *Dao* says: On the first month’s long fast, recite and chant this scripture, summoning the Supreme True One Above (太上之上真) and calling the spirits of the Three Realms (三界). For the upper worlds down to one’s own body, it will dispel accumulated ill-fortune and dissolve evil transgressions, ascending to the Jade Palace (玉宫) and attending the imperial court at dawn.

On the seventh month’s long fast, recite and chant this scripture, summoning the Middle True One of the Supreme One (太一之中真) and calling the spirits of the Nine Palaces (九宫), protecting and guiding one’s body. It will present petitions of the hidden name, recording merits on green tablets.

On the tenth month’s long fast, recite and chant this scripture, summoning the Supreme True One Below (太上之下真) and calling the spirits of the Great Void (洞台). It will serve as the boundary-sealing for the land and its people, harmonizing the seasons, making winds and rains comply, ensuring bountiful harvests and eternal peace.

On the eight festivals, recite and chant this scripture, summoning the Eight Directions’ hidden and ethereal spirits, as well as the luminous True Ones of the day and month. It will dispel calamities and invoke blessings.

On one’s birth-day, recite and chant this scripture, summoning the True Spirits of heaven, earth, *yin*, *yang*, and the Five Agents. They will blend with one’s form, guard all passages, and with the Nine Palaces’ mud pellets, fortify bones and flesh with jade-like brilliance, and with golden radiance, ensuring one’s eternal preservation and attendance before the emperor.

The *Dao* says: On days of practice, one must first bathe in fragrant water, fast and enter the chamber, facing east. He should knock his teeth thirty-two times, offering homage to the Thirty-two Heavens, and bow his heart thirty-two times. With eyes closed, he should meditate quietly on the *qi* of the three-colored clouds—blue, yellow, white—surrounding his body, both within and without, in deep stillness. There will appear a Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Tortoise, Lion, and White Crane arrayed on either side, the sun and moon shining brightly, illuminating the chamber with radiant splendor. A circular halo will form at the neck, casting light in all directions, so clear and distinct.

Then, the secret incantation is recited:

*"Supreme Primordial Dao, Supreme Celestial Lord.
Summon forth the ministers of my body’s Three Five *Gongcao* (功曹), the left and right officials and messengers, the Jade Boys bearing fragrant incense, the Jade Girls transmitting words, the Five Emperors’ direct talismans, and the officials of the direct day, thirty-six each—open the gates as spoken.*

*Today is a day of auspicious joy, with long fasting and a pure hall, practicing this most sublime scripture, limitless in salvation.*

*May my petition ascend directly to the Supreme Lord of the Thirty-two Heavens, the Primordial Emperor of the Beginning.*

*Finished, draw in the *qi* thirty-two times, facing east to recite the scripture.*

*Primordial Scripture of Limitless Salvation, the Supreme Mysterious Dao’s Original Chapter, Summoning the True Ones to Salvation, the Tenfold Return for Mankind, the Hundred Demons Concealing Their Tracks, Invoking the Natural Response, the Divine Essence and Spiritual Chapter, Uniting the Mysterious Passages.*

*The Void and Purity of Great *Fan* (梵), the scriptures weaving all the heavens, encompassing the Three *Dao*s, and penetrating the hidden pivot. It aligns with the *Huiji* (会极), harmonizing with the *Dao*’s embrace of the Void, unfolding sincere devotion, and distinguishing the spiritual paths.

*Without resolve, it cannot be attained; without virtue, it cannot be revealed. The divine texts gather the *qi*, in silent accord, resonating as one.*

*It ascends to the Jade Gate (玉阙), encompassing the Void on all sides. The *Miluo* (弥罗) realm of *Fan* (梵), in the depths of seclusion. The Purple Palace of the Azure Net (紫微琼馆), the Tortoise Terrace and the *Langfeng* (阆风) winds, where the celestial mechanisms are mastered, the eternal threads of the ages.*

*The mingled and boundless essence, the hidden and profound light. It radiates all phenomena, its splendor flourishing in five hues. The Great *Luo* (罗) Law Wheel governs the Ten Directions, bearing the imperial *qi*, summoning the True Ones and calling forth spirits.*

*Within it are gods who dispel transgressions and scatter calamities, sovereigns who grant longevity and extend life, the Great Gods of the Three Mysterious who stabilize fate, the Five Elders and august spirits, the masters of *yin*, *yang*, and the primordial roots of the Five Agents, and the Supreme Lord of the Great One (太一尊神).*

**The Daoist Path to Liberation and Salvation**

To study the Dao and attain *Degree*[1],
to rescue and enlighten living beings,
to sever and extinguish demonic trials,
all may gain ascent and transcendence.

To elevate the Seven Ancestors,
forever free from dark confinement,
no lingering delay shall be permitted—
they undergo refining in *Zhuling*[2].

Proclaiming to the Northern *Ting*[3],
all spirits heed the call,
the Three Officials and Nine Ministries
present petitions to the Jade Capital.

The Heavenly Great Talisman,
transforming and shifting in mystery,
entwines and flows through all,
ascending and descending, sinking and rising.

Below, it plunges into stagnation and cessation,
above, it clears the boundless expanse,
the Soulwind fans the heavens,
opening the gates to command the celestial.

Heaven above and heaven below,
dark and profound in all directions,
the Flowing Light vast and boundless,
the Great Calamity[4] without form.

Primordial Chaos’s *Qi*[5],
the twin symbols ascending in harmony,
the Mixed Void suspended upright,
preserving the natural flow of transformation.

Bearing mountains to summon dragons,
through countless ages, stretch and unbroken,
circuiting in separation and union,
enveloping all the heavens.

The Jade Chamber’s tranquil command,
five directions marked with crimson script,
wondrous transformations giving birth,
thirty-nine chapters of divine instruction.

Established by the Heavenly Emperor,
ruled by the Dao Lord,
flowing through yin and yang,
governing all spirits.

Seizing and leading all demons,
holding and refining the *Qi*[5],
the Great Range proclaims—
eight *Yuan*[6] fields pour forth essence.

Clarifying the Heavenly Radiance,
faint and profound in mystery,
the Mysterious Light’s Supreme Sovereign,
*Qi*[5] merging with true essence.

Flying Light of the Purple Void,
radiant in the Azure Sky,
spreading luminous clouds through space,
the Heavenly True One dances in opening.

The Jade Chapter refines and purifies,
ninefold spiraling Soulsmoke,
the Mysterious Capital receives the true,
assisting in transforming the Three Realms.

All prepared, all complete,
the Dao merges into the True,
the True within the Most Divine,
the Most Exalted of all Emperors.

Feasting in the Round Hall,
my manifestation in form,
through Dragon and Han ages,
established beyond measure.

The Vermilion Light blazes forth,
all things born and formed,
ascending to the Purple Void,
the calamity’s peak[7]—the Tower of *Xiao Tai*[8].

Within the Luminous Palace,
among the Flowery Gates,
summoning the True Spirits,
universally liberating all beings.

Cleansing filth and stagnation,
unlocking the logic of all barriers,
sevenfold revolving winds,
ascending with *Qi*[5] to the Dao.

The Dao of Immortality endures,
limitless salvation for all,
opening the Eight Gates,
governing the wheel of Heavenly Transformation.

Examining deeds and merits,
guilt and karmic bonds,
universally liberating the Seven Ancestors,
all lost souls,
wandering freely through the ten extremes,
ascending to the Nine Heavens.

Above the Nine Heavens,
each has its sound of life,
with chapters of Mysterious Void and responsive sensation,
the List of Sacred Spirits,
words to the Highest True Ones.

**First Chapter: The Sound of Heavenly Sensation**
The Mysterious Transformation surges boundless,
flowing and coalescing with True Essence.

Founding all the heavens,
giving birth to divine spirits,
vast and vague the Three Realms,
limitless the Heavenly People.

Wicked thoughts sink into evil destinies,
sensation ascends to the highest purity.
Filth and turbidity drown in ruin,
so that your Dao may never be fulfilled.

Not receiving the Chapter of the *Dong Yuan*[9],
how can you cross the Mysterious Ford?
Desires follow their own delight,
pursuing immortality brings much toil.

Entanglements vanish in an instant,
karma exhausted, dissolved to dust.
One enlightenment brings eternal freedom,
through countless ages, eternal preservation.

Devotion pierces the Purple Sky,
far-reaching thoughts reach the Jade Capital.
Divine spirits fly and merge with the Great Void,
harmonizing with the Mysterious in all directions.

**Second Chapter: The True King’s Summoning**
The Jade Script arrayed in the Azure Sky,
the True King descends from the Mysterious Peak.
Swallowing the radiance of sun and moon,
he soars aloft to the Jade Emperor’s Palace.
Wandering freely past the Three Realms,
instantly riding the Soulwind’s swift course.
Within, nurturing the infant Dao in safety,
dwelling in the Origin of the *Boshi*[10].

Clad in gold, adorned with green feathers,
ascending brilliance on purple smoke.
He commissions all the celestial officials,
uniting in reverence for the Emperor’s singular glory.
Below, he surveys the limitless land,
how dusty and chaotic its realms appear.
The Vermilion Seal seizes the Great Demon,
the Yellow Banner inspects the Cloud Camp.
The solemn scriptures hide in the Azure Vault,
universally liberating those who study the True.

The Mysterious Talisman descends through the Three Realms,
all *Qi*[5] harmonized, ascending to immortality.
The Primordial Beginning gathers the hundred spirits,
returning light to my hall.
The Seven Ancestors escape eternal night,
lost souls pass the Five Gates.
With me, they shall forever meet again,
transcending the bonds of the mortal world.

**Third Chapter: The Primordial Emperor’s Summoning of Spirits**
Above the Three Heavens,
the Spirit’s Void is pure and bright.
The Mysterious Vision soars in grandeur,
the calamity’s peak[7]—the Palace of *Ling Gong*[11].
Within dwells the Most Exalted,
refining the Primordial Mechanism.
Commanding all beings,
all *Qi*[5] converges in totality.

Majestic Great *Fan*[12],
the Supreme Spirit of the Great Substance.
The Vermilion Light shines eternally,
the twin symbols split and reveal.
The *Yuce*[13] receive instruction,
divine stages arranged in order.
Ascending to Heaven, flowing through transformation,
enveloping the Springs of the *Quan Tai*[14].

The Eight Powers of the Jade Script,
calming the Five Mountains.
Forever preserved through ages,
so that *Qi*[5] may never falter.
Humans can sense the Mysterious—
enlightened to the Dao, spirits respond.
Cultivating True Virtue, advancing in Immortal Deeds,
all Saints come naturally.

Worldly desires obscure the True Path,
why not dwell in mountain forests?
Here, above the Three Realms,
within the flying void,
the True Immortal’s resonant sound,
harmonizing with the Mysterious Chapters.

Recite it a hundred times,
sensation responds beyond measure.
Recite it a thousand times,
True Spirits descend in answer.
Ten thousand recitations complete the Dao,
Mysterious Saints arrive.
Passing beyond the Three Realms,
ascending to the ranks of the Immortals.

Hearing the Spirit’s sound,
all demons bow in reverence,
commanding the Earth Spirits,
guarding and escorting,
freeing those trapped in the Earth’s womb,
from the Five Sufferings and Eight Difficulties,
the Seven Ancestors ascend in rank,
forever parted from the Ghostly Offices,
lost souls pass *Zhuling*[2],
refined and reborn anew.

This is called the Limitless,
universal salvation without end.
There are secret writings of the Upper Heaven,
all heavens hold them in reverence.
Revealing them carelessly leads to hell’s fall,
bringing calamity to the Seven Ancestors.

The Dao says: These two chapters are the hidden words
of the Heavenly Emperor and the Most True Immortal King,
all spoken by the Great *Fan*[12].
They are not the ordinary language of the world.
Without melodious grace,
without ornate curves,
they are called Mysterious and Profound,
difficult to trace in detail.
Treasure of the Upper Heaven,
hidden in the Godly Sky’s Jade-Pure Palace,
in the Eastern Treasure House of *Xuanke*[15].
According to the Mysterious Art, it is transmitted below.

If there is a Perfect One,
carrying gold and precious offerings in sincerity,
following the text to pledge allegiance to the Jade-Pure,
then it shall be bestowed upon them.

The Dao says:
To summon the True is to cease calamities,
to call the Spirits is to remove misfortunes.
Peace for the nation, tranquility for the home,
all arise from Mysterious Sensation.

If the age’s calamity nears its end,
the Three Lights[16] wane and wax,
divine humans rest in peace,
the unlearned suffer greatly,
then all who share the same breath
must unite in heart to observe fasts,
offer incense at the six times,
turn the scriptures tenfold,
and the High Saints shall descend,
dispelling all inauspiciousness.

Infinite are the scriptures, boundless the deliverance.

The Dao speaks: The shallow in learning, their Dao yet unfulfilled,
or those whose celestial rank is not yet complete,
when their fate nears its end,
and their body passes through the Great Darkness,
at the hour of departure,
all who share the same breath—both learned and Perfect Ones—
must for them offer incense,
recite the scriptures tenfold,
and invoke the Five Spirits as children,
with the vitality of the newborn,
refining their mortal form according to the method,
so that their soul and spirit ascend to the Southern Palace,
and, in accordance with their merit,
they shall be reborn on the appointed day.

The turning wheel of doubt shall cease,
and they shall attain the Dao of Immortality.

The Dao speaks: When the celestial cycle of Heaven and Earth draws to its close,
the stars and constellations stray from their courses,
the sun and moon lose their radiance,
and yin and yang fall out of harmony,
when calamities befall the realm,
the populace suffers death and injury,
and when teachers and friends pass away,
all must observe fasts,
offer incense and recite scriptures.

Then the Eight Celestial Lords shall command,
each dispatching a flying immortal,
to dispel and extinguish the malevolent *qi*,
bringing peace to the land and well-being to its people,
and those already transformed shall ascend beyond.

The fasts and recitations of scriptures,
their virtue and power are profound indeed.
Above, they avert celestial calamities,
and safeguard the Emperor.
Below, they ward off poisonous harm,
and deliver the populace.

In proportion to their deeds,
they move the True Spirits with their sincerity,
thus it is said: Infinite,
and boundless deliverance for Heaven and humankind.

The Dao speaks: All who possess this scripture,
may for Heaven and Earth, the Imperial Sovereigns, and the populace,
perform these deeds of virtue.
On the day of invocation and descent,
when they take the vow to observe fasts and burn incense,
and recite the scriptures tenfold,
all True Spirits shall record their names,
and the Ten Thousand Saints shall come in person.
They shall distinguish the Perfect Ones,
and surely attain the rank of minister in the Jade-Pure Palace of the Imperial Sovereigns.

The celestial bureaucracy shall record their merits and demerits,
without the slightest loss,
and the officials of the Southern Palace
shall also recommend their worth,
so that those who attain the Dao
shall come to understand the profound truths.

In the midst of the Eight Celestial Realms,
the Great Brahman[17] utters the Infinite Sound—
The Dao-Lord composed,
The Primordial One descended the True,
The Mysterious Art invokes the Spirits—
The Central Chapter of the Eastern Treasure.

The battle arrays of the Linfight Lodge,
the mournful horns echo through the void.
The Emperor’s bright edicts are solemnly proclaimed,
His august light shines in the realm of the *Huatu*.

In the *Bingchun* shrine of refined texts,
the rites are regulated, their blessings self-fulfilled.
The *Miezhu* ceases, the Universal is stilled,

The *Changji* flourishes, the *Chu* neighbors align,

The *Zhanyi* expands in the *Mòyǐ*,
The *Huizhang* extends to the *Yánmián*.
The *Weitou* casts its pattern into the *Xuéhù*,
The *Bihu* flees with lightness.

The **Dao** speaks: Within these Celestial Realms, the **Great Brahman**’s hidden discourse,
With boundless sounds—
The ancient texts engraved at **Qingcheng Palace’s** Jade Terrace Hall,
Commanding the descent of the **High True** of heaven and earth,
The **profound and manifest** **Dao**’s spirit,
Aiding the **Great Transformation**,
To proclaim the **Sangha** of the Three Realms*—
Each character vast and long, a span of ten feet.

The **Celestial True Person** once inscribed these words,
As the **orthodox sound**.
Those who know this sound and can fast while reciting it—
All the heavens command the **Qi-Transforming Immortal Kings**,
To descend and observe their form,
To record their meritorious deeds,
And ascend to report to the heavens,
Where ten thousand spirits pay homage,
The **Earthly Deities** attend the gates,
The **Great Punishment** **Mara Kings**,
Protect and recommend them to ascend in flight,
The **Dao**’s blessings fully obtained,
Roaming the Three Realms,
Ascending to the **Golden Gate**.

This sound cleaves through all obstacles,
Dispels all calamities,
Transcends all barriers,
Accomplishes all undertakings—
The **natural sound** of the **Celestial True Person**.
Thus, reciting it brings the **flight of the heavens** beneath observation,
The **Supreme Deity**’s distant chant,
Ten thousand spirits in homage,
The Three Realms attending the **veranda**,
The **multitude of deities** bowing in reverence,
The **ghostly spirits** vanishing of their own accord,
The **pearls and jades** resounding,
The **Ten Directions** purified in solemnity,
The **rivers and seas** in tranquil silence,
The **mountains and peaks** swallowing mist,
All **sentient beings** subdued in awe,
Summoning the **host of immortals**,
Heaven without **malleable vapors***,
Earth without **deity-dust**,
The **dark wisdom** piercingly clear,
The **boundless virtue** of the **profound Dao**.

The **High Supreme** **Immortal Kings** descend the **True Person’s** talisman.

**Scroll Twenty-Four: The Chapter of Divine Transformations and Qi Manifestations**

The **Dao** speaks: In days of yore, within the **Taisu Heaven**, the radiant **Huaojing** soared through the lofty void, its brilliance illuminating the earth, as it received from the **Primordial Origin** the **Supreme Transformation of Divine Manifestations and Qi Changes** in its boundless, highest grade.

When the **Primordial Origin Celestial Venerable** was to expound this **Sutra**, He circled ten times, summoning the **Ten Directions**, and then took His seat. The **Heavenly True Gods**, the **Supreme Saints**, the **Mystic Conduct Immortals**, and the countless **unfathomable multitudes** arrived, riding the void.

With **Azure Emptiness** fanning clouds, **Phoenix Chariots** and **Jade Wheels**, **Green Canopies** and **Flowery Palanquins**, they descended in cascading hues, their eight luminous glories converging in splendor, piercingly illuminating the **Great Void**. For three days and three nights, the **Celestial Jade Talismans** and **Treasure Lights** of all the **Heavens** shone upon the **Celestial Capital’s** palaces and gates, the **Forest of Spirits’** grand platforms and observatories, revealing their towering majesty with unobstructed clarity. The **Effulgent Wheels** blazed forth, and the entire land—its earth, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees—lay flattened in equal splendor, all transformed into **auspicious jade**, devoid of distinction.

The **Multitude of True Ones** attended at His seat, while the **Primordial Origin Celestial Venerable** ascended in **Void-Floating Divine Transformation**, His **Qi-Essence** forming a **Treasure Hall** above the **Ten Thousand Spirits**.

When the **Sutra** was expounded once, the **Great Saints of the Heavens** simultaneously proclaimed its excellence. At that time, all men and women within the realm came to know that **transformation and change** stemmed from **Divine Qi**, even unto the **Purple Palaces of the Celestial City**, the **Jade Pavilions and Yellow Halls**, where the **Ten Thousand Saints and True Ones** were all **Divine Manifestations in True Form**, **Qi-Transformed Realms**.

When the **Sutra** was expounded twice, **Golden Dragons** exhaled clouds, and **Treasure Platforms** rose with a thousand pillars.
When the **Sutra** was expounded thrice, **Imperial Mists** dispersed into threads, forming characters in the void.
When the **Sutra** was expounded four times, a **Great Sound** trembled softly, and **Sweet Dew** spread in harmony.
When the **Sutra** was expounded five times, the earth bore **Treasure Lotuses**, their ten thousand leaves congealing into light.
When the **Sutra** was expounded six times, the **Jade Capital and Golden Gates** shone with **Divine Radiance**, piercing the void.
When the **Sutra** was expounded seven times, the **Ten Thousand Spirits** merged as one, emerging from and dissolving into nothingness.
When the **Sutra** was expounded eight times, **Divine Qi** subtly transformed, its essence unified as fine as an **autumn hair**.
When the **Sutra** was expounded nine times, the **Underworlds** were annihilated, and **dead souls** received rebirth.
When the **Sutra** was expounded ten times, **Divine Transformations and Qi Manifestations** penetrated the **Great Darkness**, and at that moment, all men and women within the realm—whether male or female—were moved to devotion, all receiving protection and attaining **Longevity**.

The **Dao** speaks: When the **Sutra** was expounded once, the **Supreme Yang Great God of the Boundless Extremes** from the **East**, with His **unfathomable multitudes**, floated through the void and arrived.
When the **Sutra** was expounded twice, the **Flame Radiance Great God of the Boundless Extremes** from the **South**, with His **unfathomable multitudes**, floated through the void and arrived.
When the **Sutra** was expounded thrice, the **Lesser Yin Great God of the Boundless Extremes** from the **West**, with His **unfathomable multitudes**, floated through the void and arrived.
When the **Sutra** was expounded four times, the **Taiyi Great God of the Boundless Extremes** from the **North**, with His **unfathomable multitudes**, floated through the void and arrived.
When the **Sutra** was expounded five times, the **Preserver-Guardian Great God of the Boundless Extremes** from the **Northeast**, with His **unfathomable multitudes**, floated through the void and arrived.
When the **Sutra** was expounded six times, the **Nurturing-Life Great God of the Boundless Extremes** from the **Southeast**, with His **unfathomable multitudes**, floated through the void and arrived.
When the **Sutra** was expounded seven times, the **Penetrating-Thickness Great God of the Boundless Extremes** from the **Southwest**, with His **unfathomable multitudes**, floated through the void and arrived.
When the **Sutra** was expounded eight times, the **Circulating-Pass Great God of the Boundless Extremes** from the **Northwest**, with His **unfathomable multitudes**, floated through the void and arrived.
When the **Sutra** was expounded nine times, the **Master-of-Transformation Great God of the Boundless Extremes** from **Above**, with His **unfathomable multitudes**, floated through the void and arrived.
When the **Sutra** was expounded ten times, the **Bearer-of-Transformation Great God of the Boundless Extremes** from **Beneath**, with His **unfathomable multitudes**, floated through the void and arrived.

When the tenfold circuit was complete, the **Ten-Directional Boundless Transformation Great Gods** all arrived simultaneously. All men and women within the realm were moved to devotion and reverence, though they had not yet heard the **Law**, each intuiting the **High True Ones of the Three Realms and Ten Directions**, even unto the **palaces and observatories**, not a single name that did not arise from **Divine Transformation and Qi Manifestation**.

Now, beholding the **Celestial Venerable True Kings** proclaiming the **True Dao** and performing its transformations, their **Sage Forms** radiant, their light piercing through the **Boundless Heavens and Worlds**, each realm within them contains a **Celestial Venerable True King** expounding the **Great Law**.

Thus it is known that **Divine Transformations are boundless**, and **Qi Manifestations are without limit**. Our present forms—**color, appearance, roots, dust, motion, sound, and shadow**—are all products of **Divine Transformation and Qi Manifestation**.

The arriving multitudes, numbering in the **hundreds of millions**, with their **unfathomable crowds**, caused half the land to sink unevenly, a phenomenon beyond restraint.

Thus, the **Primordial Origin** manifested the **Way of Divine Qi Transformations**, rising from His **Void-Seated Meditation**, leaping into the void, ascending to heights surpassing **Eon-Peaks**, above the **Floating Clouds and Soaring Scenery**, a thousand *zhang* from the earth.

The **Primordial Origin** ascended, and the **Heavenly True Gods**, the **Supreme Saints**, the **Mystic Conduct Immortals**, and the **Ten-Directional Boundless Transformation Great Gods**, with their **unfathomable multitudes**, all entered the **Floating Scenery**.

The **Heavenly Folk** gazed upward and saw only a **booming surge** descending from the void. Once they entered the void, their whereabouts became unknown. The **People of the Realm** dispersed, and the land returned to its even, unbroken state, no longer tilted or sunken.

The **Primordial Origin** then, from above the **Floating Clouds and Scenery**, completed the expounding of the **Sutra**. The **Multitude of True Ones** oversaw the **Deliverance**, transmitting it to us. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words.

The **Law’s rites** were now fully known. The **Heavens’ multitudes** returned to their stations, and in a flash, all traces of sound vanished.

At that time, those who encountered the **Sutra’s Law** were universally delivered, their **original nature** preserved, none suffering harm. The land’s people, their hearts inclined in reverence, all extinguished their **deluded minds**.

It was **utterly wondrous, utterly profound**, **utterly penetrating, utterly true**, **utterly transformative, utterly functional**, **utterly variable, utterly comprehensive**, **utterly divine, utterly spiritual**.

With hearts awakened to the **Supreme Dao**, they harmonized with **Void-Clarity**, aligned with **Compassionate Love**, and though their **bones differed**, they became **kin in essence**. The realm was **secure and prosperous**, its people **joyful and at peace**, the **Sutra’s teachings** spreading throughout the land.

Those who harbored **sincere aspiration**, who **revered and worshipped**, all attained **deliverance for the world**.

The **Dao** speaks: All that the **Primordial Origin Celestial Venerable** spoke within the **Sutra** were the **inner names** of the **Heavens’ Divine Manifestations and Qi Transformations**, the **hidden, resonant sounds**, also the **True Kings’ inner taboos**, the **concealed names** of the **hundred spirits’ transformations**—not the common speech of the world.

「The **Supreme Sage** having already become a **True Person**, their **Divine Qi** harmonized with **Void-Clarity**.

They could fully grasp its **chapter**, and when reciting it ten times, the **Heavens’ Divine Manifestations** would respond from afar, their **Divine Qi** resonating in accord. **Qi Transformations** would emerge swiftly—rivers, seas, mountains, and valleys would vanish or endure in an instant.

The **Sutra of the Celestial Sphere** (璇玑) would circulate in **hidden and revealed** ways, and when the **Divine Manifestations** transformed, all **True Kings** would gather in attendance. Then, **group demons** would be bound in form, and **ghostly essences** would perish utterly. Where the **Qi** transformed, **corpses** would rise from the dead, and **white bones** would become living beings.

Those who mastered this **Supreme Learning**, reciting it ten times, would manifest the **Five Celestial Emperors** through **Divine Qi**, transform the **Three Realms** through **Qi Transformations**, cause **demonic essences** to lose their sight, and **ghostly spirits** to perish utterly. They would rescue the dying, severing death to grant rebirth.

This is why: **Daoists** with **impure qi** yet to be refined, whose **essence** has not yet pierced **Void-Clarity**, when they summoned and controlled the **Ten Directions**, their **power** had not yet subdued the **Heavens’ governance**. Though they could **subdue and bind** the **Earthly Deities** (地祇) and **demonic spirits**, they could only **ward off death**, not truly **revive the dead**.

To **lightly recite** this **chapter**, one’s body would suffer **misfortune**.

To **offer reverence and nourishment** with **supreme devotion**, their **doorways** would flourish, their **prosperity** enduring through generations, their **affinity with goodness** unbroken, and **ten thousand calamities** would not touch them. The **Divine Manifestations** would guard their gates.

This **Sutra** is **most noble and wondrous**, unmatched in the **Celestial Capital** (玉京), its capacity to **deliver beings** boundless. It stands as the **source of all Dao**.

The **Venerable Great Brahman** (大梵) is **mighty**, their **virtue** surpassing measure.

The **Dao** speaks: For those who recite this **Sutra** ten times, all the **Heavens’ Divine Manifestations** will gather, **Divine Qi** will resonate, and **Qi Transformations** will unfold naturally—**unlike the intentions of worldly beings**, they will conjure myriad **phantasmal illusions**. When **Divine Qi** and **Qi Transformations** merge, **no Dao** will fail to arise. **Ten thousand generations** of **ancestral spirits** and **suffering souls**, all will receive **deliverance**, ascending to the **Palace of Darkness** (昧宫), enduring **nine celestial years** of **transformation**, reborn to become **noble beings**. Those who love this **Supreme Sutra**, their **merits fulfilled**, their **virtue/power** aligned with **Qi Transformations**, will all attain **Divine Immortality**, ascending to the **Golden Gate** (金阙) and feasting in the **Celestial Capital** (玉京).

**Daoists** who study and recite this **Sutra** will refine and transform their **Divine Qi**. All will receive **deliverance**, ascending to the **Southern Palace** (南宫).

Worldly beings who recite it will not have the **Divine Qi** depart their bodies. If the **True Qi** is **nurtured internally**, they will **extend their lifespan**, ultimately attaining the **Dao of Corporeal Dissolution** (尸解), where their **soul-essence** temporarily vanishes, bypassing the **Earthly Realms**, and they will **return to their original form**, roaming the **Great Void**.

This **Sutra** is **subtle yet profound**, its **deliverance** limitless. All **Heavenly and Human Beings** will rejoice in its blessings.

**Infinite blessings** bestow upon **life and death**, granted by the **Heavens**. It is a treasure **not transmitted to the mortal world**.

Only **Supreme Adepts**, bearing **golden treasures** and **sincere devotion**, who **pledge to the Heavens** and pass it on, may do so. If one **carelessly leaks** or **disrespects** this **Sutra**, **misfortune** will descend upon **nine generations of ancestors**, and they will be **endlessly enslaved** by **Ghostly Officials**.

The **Five Emperors** and their **attendants of jade** (玉童) and **maiden of jade** (玉女), twenty-four each, will **guard and shield** the **Divine Texts**, protecting those who receive the **Sutra**.

The **Dao** speaks: On the **first month’s long fast**, reciting and singing this **Sutra**, the **Divine Manifestations** will arise, **Qi Transformations** will flourish, **inner visions** will radiate in splendor. **Jade clouds** will form a **palace**, benefiting the **departed souls of past ages**. They will **sever Earthly bonds**, **deliver to the Southern Palace**.

On the **seventh month’s long fast**, reciting and singing this **Sutra**, the **Divine Manifestations** will manifest the **Dao-body**, **inner visions** will grow clear and pure. The **Divine Child** will take its **rightful place**, and one’s body will attain **Divine Immortality**. The **Heavens’ records** will be inscribed upon **yellow talismans** and **white tablets**, **severing death** to grant **rebirth**.

On the **tenth month’s long fast**, reciting and singing this **Sutra**, the **Divine Manifestations** will become **deep and secret**, **Qi Transformations** will bring **tranquility**. **Inner visions** will align with **Divine Immortality**, feasting in the **Jade Flower Palace** (玉华). As the **Emperor of the Realm**, they will **secure and pacify** the **nation’s destiny**, **preserve the Heavens’ longevity**, ensuring it **never ceases**, and **always rule as sovereign**. Their people will **proclaim the Great Peace**.

On the **eight festivals**, reciting and singing this **Sutra**, the **Divine Manifestations** will follow **natural order**, **Qi Transformations** will adhere to the **Sutra’s path**, and **inner visions** will harmonize. **Golden pools** and **jade mist** will be attained, becoming a **True Person of the Nine Palaces** (九宫真人).

On their **birthday**, reciting and singing this **Sutra**, the **Divine Manifestations** will manifest the **Nine Palaces**, **Qi Transformations** will align with the **Nine Truths** (九真), merging with **natural unity** and **allying with the Celestial Emperors**. Their **soul-essence** will become **serene and upright**, their **Qi** enduring eternally, **free from suffering**. The **Three Realms** will serve as **guardians**, the **Five Emperors** will **escort them**, and **ten thousand spirits** will **pay homage**. Their names will be **recorded in Heaven**, their **merits fulfilled**, their **virtue/power** attained—**ascending to the Upper Purity** (上清).

The **Dao** speaks: On the **day of practice**, one must **bathe in fragrant water**, **fast and purify** within the **chamber**, facing **east**, **striking their teeth** thirty-two times to **hear the Thirty-two Heavens**, and **bowing their heart** thirty-two times for the **Thirty-two Offenses**. With **eyes closed**, they must **quietly contemplate** their body seated amid **three-colored clouds** of **green, purple, and white**—**inner and outer darkness** enveloping them. There will appear **Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Azure Tortoise, Lion, and White Crane**, arrayed to the left and right, with **sun and moon** illuminating the scene. The **chamber** will be **pierced by radiant light**, a **circular halo** forming at their neck, its glow reaching **all directions**.

Next, they should contemplate the **Great Void**, where **True Qi** and **Divine Manifestations** reside, as **purple light clouds** slowly drift to cover their head. The **clouds** will fill the **chamber**, and within, **ten thousand spirits** will stand solemnly, like the **pupils in one’s eyes**, facing them.

Next, they should contemplate the **nine orifices** of their body, where **white smoke-clouds** spiral outward, **right-turning** to encircle their **body’s form** within a **boundless expanse**. **Purple clouds** and **white smoke**, stretching across **Heaven and Earth**.

After a long while, they will perceive their **liver** containing a **palace of jade**, where a **Divine Person** sits, clad in **garments of Green Dragon embroidered with flowered feathers**, blowing **wind from their mouth** to stir the **clouds**. The **clouds** will spiral **leftward**, completing **eighty-one cycles**.

Then, they will see the **ten thousand spirits** that came from the **Void**, along with the **hundred spirits** within their own body, **united as one**, resembling a **child**. Dressed in **embroidered silk and brocade**, they will sit before them, listening as they recite the **Sutra**.

When finished, the **spirits** will return into their **mouth**, ascending to the **upper dan** (泥丸), facing **outward by day** and **inward by night**. This is the **Dao of Divine Manifestations and Qi Transformations**, so **distinct and clear**.

The **Secret Incantation** reads:

*"**Supreme Mysterious Origin**, **Most High Dao Lord**,
Summon forth from my **body** the **Thirty-five Functionaries** (功曹), **attendants** and **messengers** of both left and right, **serving with jade incense**, **transmitting words through jade maidens**, **Five Emperors’ direct talismans**, **directing the sun’s officials** (香官), each **thirty-six in number**, to **open the gates** for what is spoken.

Today is a **day of auspicious joy**,
A **long fast** in a **pure hall**,
Practicing the **Supreme Sutra**,
With **infinite capacity** to **deliver beings.**"*

I pray that what is summoned may ascend directly to the **Supreme Mysterious Origin** (无上玄元), the **Most High Dao Lord** (太上道君), the **Most Venerable Supreme Emperor of Yuan Shi** (元始上帝至尊几) before me.

Upon completion, I **draw forth the Thirty-two Qi Passages** (炁三十二过), facing east to recite the **Sutra**.

**The True King’s sacred verses,**
**Words harmonizing with the Highest Truth.**

**First Dao: The Mysterious God’s Transformation—The Sound of Flying Through the Void**
Formless, nameless,
Standing alone in the Great Emptiness.
Merging with the myriad spirits,
Transformations endless.
All things rely upon it,
The divine movement ever fluid.
Giving birth to Heaven and Earth,
Seizing the primordial chaos.
Boundless dispersion,
Visible yet leaving no trace.
Spontaneously responsive—
This is called the **Supreme Spirit**.

In the Three Realms, the Celestial Worthies,
In the Cloud Palaces of the Heavens,
Divine transformations flow through all—
All arise from the Dao-body.
This Dao is profound and secret;
To attain it is to be true.
Singing this peerless hymn,
The Heaven within the Mysterious.
Within it, the Creative Force,
The cataclysmic Supreme Spirit.
Converging at the cosmic pivot,
Turning the Sovereign’s ultimate wheel.
The eternal *qi* endures—
Guard it and let it never cease.

---

**Second Dao: The Mysterious Qi Transforms—The True King’s Sacred Verse**
The void is true *qi*;
True *qi* is like the void.
I distinguish it—
With the Dao, they are the same.
Things obtain it and live;
Abandon it and perish.
What gives life?
The *qi* and the Spirit.
All the Heavens, the gods and immortals,
Even the Six Paths, the malevolent ghosts and spirits—
The palaces of Heaven and Earth,
Breathing, bending, stretching—
All are transformations of *qi*,
None escape this wheel.
If the Spirit guards the *qi*,
For ten thousand kalpas it shall not falter.
When the Three Realms crumble,
I alone endure.
The Nine Heavens halt their course,
The Spirit ascends to **Taiwei**.
Clasping the **Yin** at the peak of **Yujing**,
Reflecting the golden radiance in the west.
I wish to join the void’s sacred song,
Riding the dragon to till the jade sprig.

---

**Third Dao: The Spirit’s Transformation—The True King’s Hymn of Qi**
Bowing at the eastern mulberry grove,
Gazing upward to the lofty terrace.
Below, the towering halls,
The **Effulgent Sea** and the **Cruel Ghosts**.
A hundred million *li* away—
Soaring, the mirror opens.
Ah, this Great Dao’s realm,
Compressed into the palm’s measure.
The Spirit transforms, the *qi* materializes—
Mystery and form hover in interplay.
Reining the jade dragon’s chariot,
Dashing through the **Supreme Clarity** below.
No embroidered robes of the world’s delusion,
Not like the common illusions of men.
The Spirit transforms, the *qi* materializes—
A thousand kalpas pass without decay.
Laugh at you, O Valley Immortals,
Your petty distinctions of blue and yellow.
Hoary-haired yet achieving nothing,
Blame the Dao for being ill-omened.
You obscure the essence of Spirit and *qi*,
Not knowing the Dao’s true method.
Singing this **Supreme Scripture**,
Serene and reverent before the True King.
This, above the Three Realms,
In the flying void’s midst,
The True King’s sacred hymn—
Its sound harmonizes with the hollow verses.
Recite it a hundred times—
Your name is inscribed in the **Southern Palace**.
Recite it a thousand times—
The True King himself comes to welcome you.
Ten thousand recitations complete the Dao,
Ascending to the void, surpassing the Three Realms,
Ranked among the **Xian Gong**.
Hearing the sacred sound,
The True King’s form appears in reverence,
Commanding the earthly deities,
Guarding and escorting,
Drawing you forth from the earthly gate,
Freeing you from the Five Sufferings and Eight Hardships,
The Seven Ancestors ascending,
Forever parted from the earthly officials,
The soul crossing **Zhu Ling**,
Receiving refinement and rebirth.
This is called **Limitless Transmission**,
Universally liberating the boundless.

There is a secret celestial text,
Revered by all the Heavens.
To reveal or slight it leads to the **Hell of Falling**,
Bringing calamity to the Seven Ancestral Worthies.
The Dao says:
These two chapters are the hidden sounds of the Heavenly Sovereigns
And the Most Sacred True King,
Divine transformations, the *qi* materializing—
Fathomless, beyond naming.
They are the words of **Mahāvairocana**,
Not the common speech of the world.
Without melodic grace,
Without ornate tunes,
Thus called **Profound and Mysterious**,
Difficult to trace.
Treasured by the Heavens,
Secreted in the **Eastern Scripture Hall of the Jade Clarity Sovereign of the Divine Vastness**,
Destined to be revealed in the **Year of the Dragon Horse**.
If a perfected one brings gold and jade with a sincere heart,
Following the ancient format to pledge at the **Jade Bureau**,
Then it shall be granted.

The Dao says:
If the Spirit does not transform,
If the *qi* does not materialize,
Then Heaven and Earth’s revolutions will falter,
The sun and moon, the Five Stars will wane and wax erratically,
The most sacred gods and worthies will decline,
And the shallow scholars will fall ill.
When such calamities arise,
All who share the same *qi* must unite in fasting,
Burning incense at the six times,
Turning the sutra ten times.
Blessings and virtues will descend,
Dissolving all ill omens.
Limitless scriptures,
Universally liberating the boundless.

The Dao says:
The shallow scholars, their Dao still shallow,
Their immortal rank not yet complete,
Their fate approaching extinction,
Their bodies passing through **Taiyin**,
At the critical moment,
The perfected among them shall perform the rites for them—
Burning incense, reciting the sutra ten times,
So that their Spirit may transform into an immortal,
Their *qi* materialize into the True,
And their corpse be liberated according to the method,
Their soul and Spirit ascending directly to the **Southern Palace**,
Their rebirth determined by their merit,
Day by day they shall attain new life.
The wheel turns without confusion—
Thus one attains godhood.

The Dao says:
The Spirit’s transformation, the *qi*’s materialization—
The Spirit and *qi* can transform and materialize things,
But it is not the Spirit and *qi* themselves that transform.
The Spirit and *qi* are mighty and unyielding;
They do not transform of their own accord.
When they are made to transform,
It is the Spirit and *qi* that act—
Not the transformation of the Spirit and *qi* itself.
When the Spirit and *qi* are discordant,
They cannot transform,
Bringing disaster to all things.
Thus it is said:
When Heaven and Earth’s revolutions end,
When stars and constellations err,
When the sun and moon lose their light,
When the four seasons falter,
When yin and yang are unbalanced,
When droughts and floods, wars, and plagues spread,
When the people perish in masses,
When teachers and friends meet untimely ends—
All must fast, burn incense, and recite the sutras.
Fasting and recitation are of great merit.
Above, they dispel celestial calamities,
Protecting and stabilizing the imperial land;
Below, they avert poison and harm,
Liberating the people.
Life and death depend upon it—
Their blessings are boundless.
Thus it is called **Limitless Transmission**,
Universally liberating gods and humans.

The Dao says:
All who possess this scripture
Can, for the Heavenly Sovereign and the people,
Perform these meritorious deeds.
On days of calamity,
With a sincere heart, fast and burn incense,
Recite the sutra ten times.
The Spirit and *qi* shall transform,
Turning misfortune into blessing.
The Heavens shall record your name,
Ten thousand spirits shall attend you.
The perfected on the right shall acknowledge you,
And you shall be worthy to serve as a minister of the **True King’s Jade Bureau**.
The **Jade Clarity True King** shall also recommend you,
And those who attain the Dao shall truly comprehend these profound words.

Composed by the **Dao Lord**

**The Eastern Eight Heavens**

**The Limitless Sounds of the Hidden Speech of the Great Brahman of the Eight Heavens**
**Composed by the Dao Lord**

**The Eastern Eight Heavens**
On the bright day of the **Rooming Ox**,
The resonant notes of the **Wan** and **Zao** harmonize.
The **Alou** Brahman’s seed awakens,
Awakening comprehension beyond mere words.
The **Luoqiu** subtleties unfold,
Evenly applied to all realms.
The **Jianna** holds warmth in hand,
The **Pidi** virtue aids the mechanism.

Piercing the **Longlu**,
Unveiling the **Zici** lineage,
The **Chengang** and **Guansha** gates stand firm,
Counting only the years.
The **Dangzhuo** and **Yiqian** gather,
Bestowed with blessings ever more.
Swiftly riding to **Binda**, the *qi* does not turn aside,
Though the path is long and winding.

**The Southern Eight Heavens**
The **Xiuzhi** peaks rise majestic,
Ascending to **Qiu Dun**.
Into the **Yanjing** well, the **Mei** is cast,
The Eight Dao’s brilliance stands bold.
Boundless fields, roads in pairs,
The **Cuici** and **Liangbin** soar high.
The **Taiji**’s primal essence,
Most difficult to discern and correct.
The **Mangsi** gallops with swiftness,
The **Biaoshi** surveys the **Lan**’s depths.
The **Kangda** seals it right,
The **Biyuan** ripples beyond.

The **Quxian** reveres the **Tongtu**,
The **Zhenchang** shines with clarity.
The **Zhenghua** is bound with jade,
The Dao’s gate holds secrets.

**The Western Eight Heavens**
The **Shenwei** invests the **Mian**,
The **Yiluo** spans the **Dazhian**.
The **Miaoyi** and **Bingzu**,
The **Qian Ding** harmonizes with **Lou Xian**.
The **Shuyan** dispels the **Motang**,
The **Yibian** transforms into **Kun Xuan**.
The **Wending** aligns with **Liu Qi**,
The **Shanggang** contemplates the **Shiyuan**.
The **Tuling** conceals the **Mijing**,
The **Budan** condenses the **Yingxuan**.
Briefly recording what must be shown,
The **Shang**’s order is complete.
Boundless **Kui**, the **Langdu** reaches the edge,
Transmitting widely through all lands.
The **Langma** stores eternally,
The **Xitian** leans on the **Zhuan**.
The **Yingxi** and **Fangxue**,
The **Zhenji** traces the **Jixiong**.
The **Ruiguang** spreads its sacred resonance,
The **Zhuangdi** stands firm in ten thousand peaks.
The **Chunze** steadfastly upholds the virtuous,
The **Bikai** opens the **Cekong** path.

**The Northern Eight Heavens**
The **Longquan** and **Yan Gong**,
The **Dongting** [□] **Chong**.
The **Gejing** stillness reaches its peak,
The **Liebin**’s compassion flows vast.
Riding the **Sheng** beyond the **Ji**,
Summoning the **Lun** to attack the **Kai**.
The **Dazang**’s secrets are profound,
The **Liquan**’s course already curved.
The Dao’s passage pierces the **Mingguan**,
The **Liding**’s grace shines like **Xiarong**.
The **Jiyi** and **Fangxue**,
The **Zhenji** traces the **Jixiong**.
The **Ruiguang** spreads its sacred resonance,
The **Zhuangdi** stands firm in ten thousand peaks.
The **Chunze** steadfastly upholds the virtuous,
The **Bikai** opens the **Cekong** path.

**The Dao’s Words:**
These hidden sounds of the Great Brahman within the Eight Heavens—
Limitless in their resonance—
Were once inscribed on the **Xiaotai**’s **Tian Shou** and **Yu Heng** above.
Through the transformation of Spirit and materialization of *qi*,
They rectify the boundless, limitless worlds of all Heavens,
The Three Primordials and True Emperors,
None escaping their Dao.

Knowing them and refining them,
The Spirit and *qi* remain forever.
When great calamities arise and small ones bring death,
They dissolve all with a smile of contempt.

The characters are each a yard in breadth.
The **Tian Zhen Huang Ren** of old inscribed their forms,
Setting them as the true sounds.
Those who know these sounds
And fast while reciting them,
Shall have the Spirit’s Treasury dispatch celestial immortals and heavenly beings
To descend and observe their bodies,
Record their meritorious deeds,
And ascend to report to the Eight Heavens,
Where ten thousand spirits bow in homage,
The Earthly spirits attend at the gate,
The True Kings of Great Merit
Recommend them to the **Shen Xiao**,
Their Dao is complete, and they attain,
Wandering the Three Realms,
Ascending to the **Golden Gate**.

These sounds break all barriers,
Ward off all calamities,
Cross all thresholds,
Accomplish all things—
The natural sounds of the **Tian Zhen**.

Thus, when recited,
Celestial immortals descend to observe,
The **Supreme Deities** sing from afar,
Ten thousand spirits bow in homage,
The Three Realms attend at the hall,
All spirits prostrate in submission,
Ghostly essences perish in self-destruction,
Pearls and jade resound,
The Ten Directions are purified,
Rivers and seas fall silent,
Mountains and valleys swallow the smoke,
All living souls tremble in awe,
Summoning the assembly of immortals,
The Heavens are free of impurities,
The Earth of demonic dust,
The **Minghui** is illuminated,
The **Great Compassion** is profound.

**The *Zhifu Dan Guang* Scroll**

The **Dao** speaks: In days past, within the **Zhi Xiao** Heaven, the **Dan Jing** revealed the **Pure and True Great Primordial Radiance** soil. There, the **Primordial Beginning** received the **Limitless Degree *Zhifu Dan Guang*** Scripture and bestowed upon the **Supreme Primordial Deities** the **Red Talisman of Primordial Radiance**.

When the **Primordial Beginning** Heavenly Venerable was to proclaim this **Sutra**, He circled ten times, summoning the **Ten Directions**, and then ascended to His seat. The **Heavenly True Great Deities**—the **Red Spirit Sage**, the **Three Qi Heavenly Lords**, the **Nine Immortals of Primordial Radiance**, the **Supreme High Venerables**, the **True Persons of Marvelous Practice**—along with countless **unrestricted** spirits, arrived riding the void.

With **jewel-embroidered wheels** flying and **feathered canopies** interweaving, the **Great Azure** ascended in crystalline splendor, while **Eight Pure** lights streamed forth. The **Polar Axis** and the **Pearl’s Position** shone radiant, illuminating the **Primordial Radiance**. For five days and five nights, across the **Three Pure** and **Four Boundaries**, the **Primordial Beginning** traversed all heavens, reaching the **Upper Great Luo** and descending to the **Yellow Gate**. At each stop, the **Red Talisman of Primordial Radiance** opened the **Eon of Flying Azure**, scattering **Dan Xia** light to purify the **Eight Gates**. All lands, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees within a realm became level, with no high or low—all soil transformed into **veined jade**, its luster solid and translucent, its hue unchanging.

The **Heavenly True Deities** gathered in attendance, while the **Primordial Beginning** Heavenly Venerable paused His carriage atop the **Nine Dragons of Solar Emulation**, the **Golden Chariot of Ten Thousand Transformations**. When He proclaimed the **Sutra** once, the **Great Saints of All Heavens** simultaneously praised its excellence. At that time, all men and women of the realm gazed upward, listening to the **Holy Teachings** and silently contemplating the **Deep Mysteries**.

When He proclaimed the **Sutra** twice, celestial light emanated internally, illuminating the dark and obscure. When He proclaimed it thrice, **divine qi** merged with the **Primordial Radiance**, and all phenomena generated **dew**. When He proclaimed it four times, **emptiness and clarity** expanded boundlessly, revealing the **Ten Directions**. When He proclaimed it five times, the **Red Talisman of Primordial Radiance** manifested within His body. When He proclaimed it six times, **Dao and Life** converged, and all sickness and calamity were dispelled. When He proclaimed it seven times, the **Northern Tang** dark domain answered in submission, its disturbances ceasing. When He proclaimed it eight times, **Golden Tablets** recorded His merits, **Jade Talismans** sealed His deeds, the **Three Officials** announced His command, and His form ascended as a **flying immortal**. When He proclaimed it nine times, **Law’s Dew** and **Jewel-like Essence** nourished all things. When He proclaimed it ten times, the **Ten Directions and Three Realms**, the **Limitless Mysteries**, and all **Limitless Beings** wandered free from suffering.

At that time, all men and women of the realm were moved to devotion, receiving His protection and attaining eternal life. The **Dao** speaks: When the **Primordial Beginning** Heavenly Venerable proclaimed the **Sutra** once, the **Great Deity of Limitless Birth** from the **East of the Limitless** arrived with countless **unrestricted** spirits, floating through the void. When He proclaimed it twice, the **Great Deity of Limitless Depth** from the **South of the Limitless** arrived with countless **unrestricted** spirits, floating through the void. When He proclaimed it thrice, the **Great Deity of Limitless Luster** from the **West of the Limitless** arrived with countless **unrestricted** spirits, floating through the void. When He proclaimed it four times, the **Great Deity of Limitless Unity** from the **North of the Limitless** arrived with countless **unrestricted** spirits, floating through the void. When He proclaimed it five times, the **Great Deity of Limitless Protection** from the **Northeast of the Limitless** arrived with countless **unrestricted** spirits, floating through the void. When He proclaimed it six times, the **Great Deity of Limitless Transformation** from the **Southeast of the Limitless** arrived with countless **unrestricted** spirits, floating through the void. When He proclaimed it seven times, the **Great Deity of Limitless Jade Spirit** from the **Southwest of the Limitless** arrived with countless **unrestricted** spirits, floating through the void. When He proclaimed it eight times, the **Great Deity of Limitless Flying Azure** from the **Northwest of the Limitless** arrived with countless **unrestricted** spirits, floating through the void. When He proclaimed it nine times, the **Great Deity of Limitless Great Transformation** from the **Upper Limitless** arrived with countless **unrestricted** spirits, floating through the void. When He proclaimed it ten times, the **Great Deity of Limitless Purity** from the **Lower Limitless** arrived with countless **unrestricted** spirits, floating through the void.

After ten full proclamations, the **Great Deities of the Red Talisman and Primordial Radiance** from the **Ten Directions** all arrived at once. All men and women of the realm bowed in reverence. They all saw **great crimson script**, filling the void. The **Primordial Radiance** illuminated all **Ten Directions**, equally bright. Within themselves, they saw their own bodies, their minds attuned to all **Dao**. Externally, they harmonized with the **Law**—this is called the **Red Talisman**. Observing all differences, their forms varied yet their light remained unified—this is called the **Primordial Radiance**. Both internal and external **Dao** were the **Primordial Beginning**; externally, it gave birth to **Heaven and Earth**. Internally, it transformed the single body—all were in accord with this **Way**. Without the **listed saints** opening the **teachings**, none could be perfected.

It is like the **Hun Dun** at the dawn of creation, through the **Nine Eons** to their end—without the **Red Clarity**, none could have unfolded the **diagram**. When a body first emerges, its hair, limbs, and orifices are complete, yet without the **divine light** externally manifesting and the **heart-light** internally illuminating, no **sage or saint** could have attained fulfillment.

Thus, we all silently comprehend the **Primordial Beginning’s** great **Law**, employing **divine transformations** to guide **Heaven and Man**. Those who come, like **fine rain and dense mist**, are countless **unrestricted** spirits, half the realm’s land sinking into **oblique collapse**—none can forbid them. Then, the **Primordial Beginning** suspended a **treasure-pearl**, as large as a **millet grain**, within the **void and emptiness**, five **zhang** above the earth.

The **Primordial Beginning** ascended, and the **Heavenly True Great Deities**, the **Supreme High Venerables**, the **True Persons of Marvelous Practice**, and the **Great Deities of the Limitless Red Talisman and Primordial Radiance** from the **Ten Directions**, along with countless **unrestricted** spirits, all entered the **treasure-pearl**. The **Heavenly Man** looked on, seeing only a **radiant glow** emerging from the pearl’s mouth. Once inside, they vanished from sight. The people of the realm dispersed, and the land returned to its level, no longer **oblique or collapsed**.

The **Primordial Beginning** then proclaimed the **Sutra** to completion within the **treasure-pearl**, and the **Heavenly True Deities** supervised the **transmission**, bestowing it upon us. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words. The **Law’s affairs** were roughly understood, and the **Heavens** resumed their positions. In an instant, all sound ceased.

At that time, those who encountered the **Sutra’s Law** universally attained salvation, their **original nature** preserved without injury. All lands bowed in reverence, and all cultivated the **Dao-heart**. They penetrated **deeply**, comprehended **fully**, were **mysteriously insightful**, and **clearly discerned**. They **silently resonated** with **profound mechanisms**, their **minds aligned** with **boundless compassion**, their **forms varied yet their kinship remained**. The realm was secure, its people flourished, and all rejoiced in **Great Peace**. The **Sutra’s origin** emerged from the **teachings**, and the realm was governed by the **Dao**.

With utmost sincerity, they revered and followed the rites, all attaining the power to save the world.

The **Dao** speaks: All names mentioned in the **Elemental Lord’s** discourse on the **Sutra** are the hidden names of the **Heavens and Celestial Sovereigns**, the secret sounds of the **Hidden Runes**, and the inner taboos of the **True Kings**—the concealed names of the **Hundred Spirits**.

The **Great Law** was revealed, and the **Heavens and Earth** were established. Within, **humanity** was born; without, **Chaos** was formed.
The **Crimson Talismans** aligned, the **Cinnabar Light** intertwined, the **Primordial Qi** was simmered, and the **True Fire** refined—thus were the **Three Realms** created, and the **Ten Thousand Heavens** constructed. If one embodies this, naturally attaining the **Dao**, it is not the common speech of the world.

The **Supreme Sage**, having already become a **True Person**, penetrates the **Mysterious** and fathoms the **Subtle**.

Those who fully comprehend its verses, reciting them **ten times**, will have the **Heavens** sing in response from afar, the **Ten Thousand Emperors** arrange rites, the **Rivers and Seas** fall silent, the **Mountains and Hills** conceal their clouds, the **Vermilion Mists** disperse, the **Celestial Light** stretches across the **Mysterious**, the **heart resonates internally**, the **Cinnabar Treasure** responds externally, **demons** are bound in form, **ghostly essences** perish utterly, the **dead are revived**, and **white bones** become human.

For scholars of the **highest learning**, reciting them **ten times**, the **Five Emperors** will attend as guards, the **Three Realms** will prostrate in homage, the **Purple Radiance** will shine from afar, the **Divine Luster** will fill the space, the **Mysterious Origin** will open, the **Divine** will dwell therein, **demonic spirits** will lose their sight, **ghostly deities** will perish utterly, the **dying** will be saved, and the **severed** will live again.

Thus it is: scholars, their **impure qi** not yet dissipated, the **Crimson Talismans** hidden in darkness, the **Cinnabar Light** concealed within, their bodies not yet penetrating the **True**, cannot yet govern the **Ten Directions**, their might not yet subduing the **Celestial Laws**, their **virtue** able only to subdue the **Earthly Spirits**, binding and restraining **demonic essences**—yet they can only repel death, not restore life.

To recite this chapter lightly brings calamity upon oneself.

To venerate and honor with offerings, one’s **gate and household** will flourish, prospering through generations, free from all calamities, with **Divine Beings** guarding the door.

This **Sutra** is most exalted and wondrous, unmatched in the **Jade Capital**, saving countless beings, as the **Root of Ten Thousand Teachings**.

Its grandeur is vast, its **virtue** beyond measure.

The **Dao** speaks: Those who recite this **Sutra** **ten times**, the **Heavens** will gather in unison, the **Crimson Talismans** will save the living, the **Cinnabar Light** will illuminate the **Obscure**, and the **hundreds of millions of ancestors**, their **tormented souls** suffering in the **Nine Realms**, will all immediately be saved, ascending to the **Vermilion Palace**, their **fate** reaching the **Nine Years**, receiving transformation and rebirth, becoming **Noble Ones**, loving the **Sutra** of the **Highest Learning**, their **merits fulfilled** and **virtue complete**, all attaining **Divine Immortality**, ascending to the **Golden Gate**, feasting in the **Jade Capital**.

Scholars of the **highest learning**, practicing and reciting this **Sutra**, will resonate with the **Crimson Talismans**, their **Dao** merging with the **Cinnabar Light**, immediately receiving salvation and ascending to the **Southern Palace**.

Mortal beings who recite it will prolong their lifespan, the **Crimson and Cinnabar** essences nourishing their **corpse-rotting** bodies, their **bones hardening** and **qi** becoming **True**, all later attaining the **Method of Corpse Dissolution**, their **souls and spirits** temporarily extinguished, avoiding the **Underworld**, immediately returning to form, wandering the **Great Void**.

This **Sutra** is supremely subtle, universally saving without end, all **Heavenly and Human** beings receiving its blessings.

Its **infinite blessings** benefit **life and death**, treasured by **Heaven** and not transmitted to the **lower worlds**.

Scholars bearing **gold and jewels** with sincere devotion, swearing by **Heaven** to transmit it—if they **leak or neglect** it lightly, calamity will fall upon their **Nine Ancestors**, and they will serve long in **Ghostly Offices**.

Attending the **Sutra** are the **Five Emperors**, along with **Twenty-Four Jade Boys and Jade Girls** each, guarding and protecting the **Divine Texts**, safeguarding those who receive the **Sutra**.

The **Dao** speaks: In the **first month**, during **long fasting**, recite and chant this **Sutra**, the **Crimson Talismans** calling for harmony, the **Cinnabar Light** circulating brightly, the **Three Primordial Cycles** bestowing contracts, the **Ten Thousand Phenomena** emerging—this benefits the **souls of the former age**, severing their **Underworld bonds** and **servitude**, saving them to the **Southern Palace**.

In the **seventh month**, during **long fasting**, recite and chant this **Sutra**, the **Crimson Talismans** calling the **Obscure**, the **Cinnabar Light** nurturing the **Essence**, the **Four Celestial Lights** reporting merit, the **Five Elders** presenting the **Sutra**—one’s body attains **Divine Immortality**, the **Heavens** recording their names, the **Yellow Talismans** and **White Tablets** erasing death for rebirth.

In the **tenth month**, during **long fasting**, recite and chant this **Sutra**, the **Crimson Talismans** calling the **Yang**, the **Cinnabar Light** applying its **Chapter**, the **Nine Palaces** merging **Qi**, the **Jade Girls** offering **elixir**—this benefits **kings and imperial rulers**, their **lords and subjects, fathers and sons**, securing the **national fate**, preserving **Heaven’s longevity**, ensuring their lineage never ends, always ruling as **sovereigns**, pacifying their lands, their people rejoicing in **Great Peace**.

On the **Eight Festivals**, recite and chant this **Sutra**, the **Crimson Talismans** establishing the **circuit**, the **Cinnabar Light** flowing, the **Eight Sceneries** uniting, the **Six Celestial Ministers** manifesting truly—one attains the **True Persons of the Nine Palaces**.

On one’s **birthday**, recite and chant this **Sutra**, the **Crimson Talismans** calling the **Spirits**, the **Cinnabar Light** encircling the body, the **soul and spirit** clarified and pure, the **Ten Thousand Qi** enduring, avoiding all **suffering**, the body radiant, the **Three Realms** attending as guards, the **Five Emperors** overseeing their welcome, the **Ten Thousand Spirits** paying homage, their names recorded in **Heaven**, their **merits fulfilled** and **virtue complete**, ascending to the **Upper Purity**.

The **Dao** speaks: On days of **practicing the Dao**, one must bathe in **fragrant water**, fast in purity within the chamber, facing **east**, striking the teeth **thirty-two times**, ascending to hear the **Thirty-Two Heavens**, bowing in the heart **thirty-two times**, closing the eyes, quietly contemplating oneself seated amid **three-colored clouds**—**blue, yellow, and white**—internally and externally **dark and profound**, with the **Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Tortoise, Lion, and White Crane** arrayed to the left and right, the **Sun and Moon** illuminating, the chamber **radiantly clear**, a **circular emblem** forming at the neck, its light reflecting the **Ten Directions**, thus distinctly manifest.

The **Secret Incantation** is as follows:

*"Supreme Mysterious Origin,
Greatest Dao Lord.*

Summon forth from within my body the **Three Five Officials**, the **left and right attendants and messengers**, the **Jade Boys attending incense**, the **Jade Girls transmitting words**, the **Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans**, the **Direct-Day Incense Officials**—each **thirty-six**—opening and closing as spoken.

Today is a day of **auspicious joy**, a **long fast** in the **pure hall**, practicing this **Sutra of Supreme Salvation**, saving countless beings.

May what is invoked ascend directly to the **Supreme Thirty-Two Heavens**, before the **Elemental Lord, Celestial Sovereign, Most Exalted Emperor’s** throne.

*Completed.* Draw the **qi thirty-two times**, facing east to recite the **Sutra**.

Universally receiving **refinement and salvation**, the **dead soul** gains a **living body**; the **body** attains rebirth, ascending to hear the **Heavens**.

Above the **Heavens**, each has a **Gate of Life**; within lies the **Mixed Heaven Opening-Eon Diagram**, the **Spiritual Saints’ Scriptures**, words aligning with the **High Perfected**.

**First: The Mixed Extremes Flying Immortal Red Talisman’s Chapter**
The **Great Void Primordial Beginning** generates **Heaven and Earth**. The **Void Extremes** are **Dark and Obscure**, originating from **One Qi**. Boundless and limitless, it **transforms** into the **True Emperor**. Above, residing in **Jade Capital**, governing the **Three Realms**. **Awe-inspiring and spiritual**, not distinguishing great or small. **Circulating and transforming**, completing this **Great Instrument**. The **Red Scripture** unfolds; **Divine Immortals** converge. The **Five Mountains** are settled, the **Mysterious Peaks** tower. **Kunlun and Lang** govern; the **Yellow and Lao** rule. The **Void Sovereign** pities all beings, opening the **Mysterious Profound Meaning**. The **Perfected Chapter** subdues the **Demon Hosts**; **Ten Thousand Heavens** are sheltered under the **Great Canopy**.

**Second: The Mysterious Transformation True Lord Vermilion Light’s Chapter**
The **Solemn Great Possessing Palace**, all **Spirits** pay homage to the **Upper Sovereign**. The **Three Qi** envelop the **Great Void**; flying **Constellations** weave the **Primordial Threads**. Above, opening the **Broad Jade Chamber**; below, arranging the **Flowing Scene Rooms**. The **Three Enclosures** suspend the **Imperial Seat**; **Red Texts** array the **Five Directions**. Within, displaying the **Jade Extremes True**, preserving this **Great Constant**. The **Void** generates the **Earthly Knot**; **Darkly**, it measures the **Dragon-Kang**. The **True King** rides the **Heavenly Steed**; the **Treasure Gate** emits the **Vermilion Light**.

**First: The Dao/Way Unfolds the Mysterious Pattern**
The **Heavenly Steed** ascends the **Primordial Qi**,
Divine transformations boundless, ineffable.

Gazing down upon the **Domain Sovereigns**,
The **Ocean of Desires** vast and empty.
Unveiling the **Mysterious Transformation True Lord’s** scriptures,
Ascending to the **Hall of Supreme Blessing**.

**Third: The Vermilion Light True King’s Hymn of the Crimson Talisman**
Lofty lofty, the **Golden Gate’s** splendor—
Beneath, the **Supreme Clarity** descends.
Emerald vapors gather thickly,
Transforming this **Golden Citadel**.

Majestic, the **Void Form**—
Ascending to the **Jade Capital’s** heights.
Nine **Dragons** stir the **Great Calamity**,
Nurturing **Divine Spirits**.

Wondrous **Qi** intertwines,
Shifting the **Celestial Roots**.
Crimson **Texts** rank the **Sages**,
Vermilion **Light** ascends to **True Dao/Way**.

Thirty-nine **Imperial Sovereigns**,
Born with the **Dao/Way** in harmony.
Clutching the **Heavenly Constitution**,
The **Void Sovereign** holds dominion.
Refining the **Flying Celestial**,
Yoking the **Dragon-Scaled Steed**.
Circumnavigating the **Three Realms**,
Illuminating the **Right Dao/Way**.

Radiant **Power** descends to aid,
Piercing the **Deep Obscurity**.
Cleansing the **Northern Tartarus**,
Universal pardon for the **Gloomy Souls**.
All beings roam free,
Ten **Directions** bathed in grace.

Here, above the **Three Realms**,
Within the **Flying Void**,
The **True King’s** hymn resounds—
Its **Sound** harmonizes with the **Mysterious Transformation**.

Chant it **one hundred times**,
Your name recorded in the **Southern Palace**.
Chant it **one thousand times**,
The **True King** welcomes you.
**Ten thousand times** complete the **Dao/Way**,
Ascend to the **Supreme Void**,
Transcend the **Three Realms**,
Rank among the **Immortal Lords**.

Hear the **Sacred Sound**,
The **Demon Kings** bow in reverence,
Command the **Earthly Deities**,
Guards attend and escort.
Plucked from the **Earthly Prison**,
Free from the **Five Sufferings** and **Eight Hardships**,
The **Seven Ancestors** rise in station,
Forever banished from the **Ghostly Offices**,
Souls cross the **Crimson Peak**,
Refined yet reborn.
This is the **Limitless**,
Universal salvation without end.

There is the **Hidden Celestial Scripture**,
All **Heavens** venerate it in common.
Revealed in carelessness, one falls to the **Underworld**,
Bringing ruin to the **Seven Ancestors’** quest.
The **Dao/Way** speaks:
These two chapters are the **Hidden Words** of the **Supreme Sovereigns** of all **Heavens**,
And the **True Lord** of **Spirits**, concealed and profound.
All are the **Great Brahman’s** utterances,
Not the common speech of mortals.
Words without melodious grace,
Tunes without ornamental beauty—
Thus called **Mysterious and Profound**,
Hard to trace and explain.

The **Heavens** treasure it,
Hidden in the **Divine Cloud’s** **Jade Treasury’s** Eastern **Scripture Chamber**,
To be revealed in **37,000 years** as fate decrees.
If a **Perfected One** brings a **golden treasure** with a sincere heart,
Following the ancient method to pledge with the **True King**,
Then it shall be entrusted.

The **Dao/Way** speaks:
The **Crimson Talisman’s Dao/Way** is **inverted**,
The **Vermilion Light** **internally concealed**—
Then the **Two Principles** lose order,
The **Five Phases** fall into discord.
Thus, the **Heavens and Earth** fail in their cycles,
The **Sun, Moon, Five Stars** wane and wax erratically,
The **Sages and Divine Ones** rest in decline,
The **unlearned** suffer sickness and harm.
All who meet such calamities,
**Kindred in Qi**, must unite in heart to observe fasts,
Burn incense at **six times**,
Turn the **sutra** ten times.
**Virtue/Power** shall swiftly descend,
Dispelling all **inauspicious omens**.

The **Limitless** scriptures,
Universal salvation without end.
The **Dao/Way** speaks:
The **unlearned**, shallow in **Dao/Way**,
Or **Immortal Rank** yet unfilled,
When their fate is extinguished,
Their bodies pass through the **Great Darkness**,
At the moment of crossing—
The **Perfected Ones** must burn incense for them,
Chant the **sutra** ten times,
To guide their **corporeal forms** as **Law** dictates.
Then the **Crimson Talisman** illuminates their hearts,
The **Vermilion Light** restores their forms,
Not mingling with **material transformations**,
**Qi** condensed, **Spirits** pure—
Souls and **Divine Essences** ascend to the **Southern Palace**,
Following their **learned merit**, reborn by the day.

The **Wheel of Rebirth** turns without doubt,
And they attain **Divine Immortality**.

The **Dao/Way** speaks:
When the **Heavens and Earth** reach their final cycle,
The **Stars and Constellations** stray in their courses,
The **Sun and Moon** lose their radiance,
The **Four Seasons** falter in their rhythms,
**Yin and Yang** fall out of harmony,
The **lands** suffer calamity—
Wars rise in four directions,
Pestilences spread,
The **myriad folk** perish in injury,
**Masters and friends** meet untimely ends,
The **virtuous** face misfortune.
All must observe fasts,
Burn incense and chant **sutras**.
For **fasts and incense-chanting**,
The **virtue/power** is profound.
Above, it dispels **Heavenly Calamities**,
Protects and steadies the **Imperial Sovereigns**,
Below, it wards off **poisonous harm**,
To guide the **myriad folk**.
Life and death rely upon it,
Its blessings boundless—

the **Heavens** send **Divine Kings** of **scarlet seals** and **red light**,

entering the **Golden Gate**.

This **sound** **cleaves** all obstacles,
**dispels** all calamities,
**transcends** all barriers,
**fulfills** all desires—
the **natural sound** of **Primal Truth**.
Thus, when recited,
it **summons scarlet seals** to **alert the spirits**,
a single **call** evokes **ten thousand responses**,
**red light** returns in **radiance**,
**hundreds of principles** and **thousands of paths** open.
**Secretly transmitted** in **purple scriptures**,
it becomes the **Highest Sovereign**.

**Divine Kings** descend to **inspect**,
**Supreme Deities** chant from afar,
**ten thousand spirits** pay homage in **courtly reverence**,

**all deities** bow in **reverent submission**,

**Scripture of the Spirit’s Treasure**—
**Limitless Transformation**—**Supreme Chapter**,
**Mystic Marvel**—**Volume twenty-five** concludes.
**Volume twenty-six** begins.

**Chapter on Illuminating the Body and Penetrating the Qi**

**The Dao speaks thus:**

In days of yore, within the **Great Cinnabar Heaven** (*Taidan Tian*), the **Crimson Clouds** congealed upon the **Vermilion Expanse**, casting radiance in the **Red Light World** (*Zixiang Jihui Shijie*), I received the **Limitless Transformation**—the **Supreme Illumination of the Body and Penetration of the Qi**—from the **Original Beginning** (*Yuan Shi*) **Heavenly Sovereign**.

When the **Original Beginning** **Heavenly Sovereign** was to expound this **Scripture**, he declared:

*"I am the progenitor of Heaven and Earth,
the precursor of all **Qi**,
the origin of the Three Treasures’ **Heavenly Lords** after the **Great Transformation**.
The Dao’s essence divides into three:
Within the **Great Void**, the **Mixed Yellow**, **Pure and Empty**, and **Cinnabar Radiance**,
I broadened the **Great Eon’s Transformation** (*Daojie Duhua*)—
giving birth to the **Third Primordial Elder**, known as the **Most High Lord Lao** (*Taishang Laojun*).
He governs the **Mystic Qi** (*Xuanqi*),
nurtures the people,
and is the **Divine Manifestation** of my Dao—
transmitting the **Great Pattern** (*Dafan*), having already perfected **nine hundred ninety-nine billion nine hundred ninety-nine million nine thousand nine hundred nine** wondrous breaths of **Qi** (*Miaoxi*).
The **Qi** divides across three eons,
transforming limitless beings.

I, of old, had already illuminated this Dao.
Now I command the **Most High Lord Lao**,
within the **Great Cinnabar Heaven**,
to reveal the **Hidden Secrets** for all beings,
and enlighten **Heavenly and Human** alike.
I have already unfolded the **Eons of All Heavens**,
illuminating the **Essentials of the Dao**,
the **Three Talents and Five Phases** (*San Cai Wuxing*),
and the **Mystic Extremes of Yin and Yang** (*Yinyang Xuanji*),
to achieve **Illumination of the Body and Penetration of the Qi**.
Finally, I decree that the **Most High Lord Lao** should proclaim the **Hidden Marvels**,
so that all beings may awaken to the Dao and attain **Comprehensive Understanding**.

Having formed this resolve,
the **Most High Lord Lao** dwells in the **Great Illumination Hall** (*Daguangming Dian*) of the **Supreme Purity Supreme Extremity Palace** (*Ta Qing Tai Ji Gong*).
With reverence, he hears the teachings,
and proceeds directly to the **Heavenly Sovereign’s Seat** (*Zuoqian*), prostrating himself twice,
long kneeling, and in silence reciting the **Precious Titles** of the **Great Holy, Vast Sovereign, Original Beginning Heavenly Sovereign** (*Baohao*) three times,
before presenting them to the **Heavenly Sovereign**.

*"Your servant obeys the secret decree,
ascending to the **Law Seat** (*Fazuo*)—
to expound the **Wondrous Scripture of Illuminating the Body and Penetrating the Qi** for the ten directions’ **Heavenly and Human** beings."*

In accordance with the decree,
he attentively delivers the proclamation,
adjusts his robes after the rites,
and prepares to expound this **Scripture**.
He circles the **Ten Directions** (*Shifang*) ten times,
to summon the ten directions,
before returning to his seat.

The **Heavenly True Great Deities** (*Zhenxian Dashen*),
the **Assembled Saints and High Lords** (*Lie Sheng Gaozun*),
the **Supreme Purity True Persons** (*Shang Qing Zhenren*),
and countless **Without Measure** (*Wuxiang*) beings—
all ride the void and arrive.

**Nine Clouds** (*Jiuxia*) spread across the sky,
**Mystic Light** (*Xuanguan*) radiates inward,
**Jade Canopies** (*Huagai*) ascend in flight,
**Azure Abyss** (*Biluo*) ascends in splendor,
**Flowing Clouds** (*Liuyun*) form **Cinnabar Landscapes** (*Dan Jing*),
casting shade upon the **Great Void** (*Tai Xu*).
For seven days and seven nights,
the **Pure and Limitless** (*Qingwei*), **Yuxu**, and **Great Red** (*Da Chi*) **Three Realms** (*San Jing*) of **Endless Beings** (*Chunmin*),
the **Three Realms’ Limitless** (*Wujie*) **Heavens**,
the **Palaces of the Sun and Moon** (*Yue Rong Gongfu*),
the **Imperial Enclosure of Jade** (*Yuzhen Dizu*),
the **Great Azure and Luminous** (*Ta Wei Liaoyang*),
the **Mountain of Obscurity and Mystic Capital** (*Yushan Xuanjing*),
the **Cinnabar Platform and Purple Pavilion** (*Dantai Zige*),
the **Palace of Jade Barriers and Pearl Towers** (*Yaoke Qiong Lou*),
the **Supreme Polarity’s Ascending Banners** (*Huangji Fei Gang*),
the **Abyssal Depths of the Eon** (*Dongyuan Jie Ren*),
all appear vividly before the eyes—
no obstruction exists.

The **Heavenly True Ones** (*Zhunzhen*) attend the seat,
while the **Most High Lord Lao** sits in **Void-Floating Yang Light** upon the **Jade Barrier’s Precious Platform** (*Yueque Baotai*).
After expounding the **Scripture** once,
the **Great Saints of All Heavens** (*Zhutian Dasheng*) simultaneously acclaim its virtue—
at that time, all men and women of the realm
awaken to the **Roots of Transformation and Birth** (*Shenghua Zigen*).

After expounding the **Scripture** twice,
all evils vanish.

After expounding the **Scripture** three times,
all virtues gather in the body.

After expounding the **Scripture** four times,
**True Qi** descends,
irrigating the **Field of the Heart** (*Xintian*).

After expounding the **Scripture** five times,
all before him are **True**,
**Mystic Symbols** and **Rectified Patterns** (*Xuanfu Zhengfan*) align.

After expounding the **Scripture** six times,
**Divine Marvels** are fully manifest—
one attains **Flying Immortality** (*Feixian*).

After expounding the **Scripture** seven times,
**Illuminated Body’s Marvelous Essence** (*Mingti Miaoyuan*)
**penetrates the Qi** and **reaches its function** (*Dagong*).

After expounding the **Scripture** eight times,
the **Nine Mystic Seven Ancestors** (*Jiu Xuan Qizu*),
the **Lost Souls of Past Eons** (*Shangshi Wanghun*),
and their **Affiliated Kin and Relatives** (*Juan Shu Qinmin*)
**roam freely** (*Xiaoyao*) and escape suffering.

After expounding the **Scripture** nine times,
**Jade Chapters** shatter darkness,
**Spirit Light** illuminates the abyss.

After expounding the **Scripture** ten times,
all beings **forever sever** **evil destinies** (*Yuan Duan Echu*),
**grievances and feuds** dissolve,
**retribution and response** cease—
at that time, all men and women of the realm
tilt their hearts in devotion,
all receive **protection and guidance** (*Hudu*),
and attain **eternal life** (*Changsheng*).

**The Dao speaks thus:**
After expounding the **Scripture** once,
the **Eight Scenic Great Deities** (*Bajing Dashen*) of the **Limitless Transformation**—**East Direction’s Limitless Realm** (*Wujie Wuxiang Pin*)—
and countless **Without Measure** beings
float through the void and arrive.

After expounding the **Scripture** twice,
the **Great Deities of Illuminated Light** (*Mingguang Dashen*) of the **Limitless Transformation**—**South Direction’s Limitless Realm**—
and countless **Without Measure** beings
float through the void and arrive.

After expounding the **Scripture** three times,
the **Great Deities of Subduing Demons** (*Zhimo Dashen*) of the **Limitless Transformation**—**West Direction’s Limitless Realm**—
and countless **Without Measure** beings
float through the void and arrive.

After expounding the **Scripture** four times,
the **Great Deities of the Medicine Pearl** (*Yaozhu Dashen*) of the **Limitless Transformation**—**North Direction’s Limitless Realm**—
and countless **Without Measure** beings
float through the void and arrive.

After expounding the **Scripture** five times,
the **Great Deities of the Cloud Palace** (*Yun Gong Dashen*) of the **Limitless Transformation**—**Northeast Direction’s Limitless Realm**—
and countless **Without Measure** beings
float through the void and arrive.

After expounding the **Scripture** six times,
the **Great Deities of Transformation and Change** (*Bianhua Dashen*) of the **Limitless Transformation**—**Southeast Direction’s Limitless Realm**—
and countless **Without Measure** beings
float through the void and arrive.

After expounding the **Scripture** seven times,
the **Great Deities of Spirit Flight** (*Lingfei Dashen*) of the **Limitless Transformation**—**Southwest Direction’s Limitless Realm**—
and countless **Without Measure** beings
float through the void and arrive.

After expounding the **Scripture** eight times,
the **Great Deities of the Three Substances** (*Sansu Dashen*) of the **Limitless Transformation**—**Northwest Direction’s Limitless Realm**—
and countless **Without Measure** beings
float through the void and arrive.

After expounding the **Scripture** nine times,
the **Great Deities of Jade Void** (*Yuxu Dashen*) of the **Limitless Transformation**—**Upper Direction’s Limitless Realm**—
and countless **Without Measure** beings
float through the void and arrive.

After expounding the **Scripture** ten times,
the **Great Deities of Separation and Union** (*Lihe Dashen*) of the **Limitless Transformation**—**Lower Direction’s Limitless Realm**—
and countless **Without Measure** beings
float through the void and arrive.

When the ten expoundings conclude,
the **Great Deities of Illuminating the Body and Penetrating the Qi** (*Mingti Guangqi Dashen*) from the **Ten Directions’ Limitless Realms** all gather simultaneously—
all men and women of the realm
tilt their hearts in reverence and devotion,
the arriving beings thronging in dense clusters,
numberless as the sands of the **Ten Directions**,
beyond reckoning—
**pervading all Heavenly Realms** (*Pian Zhi Tianjing*).

Thus, the **Most High Lord Lao**,
witnessing the **Four Assemblies** (*Sizhong*) and **Ten Directions** encircling him,
faces north and pays homage to the **Great Holy Jade Capital Sovereign** (*Yujing Dasheng Yuan Shi Tian Zun*),
the **Supreme Purity Purple Cloud Most High Jade Throne Great Dao Sovereign** (*Shang Qing Zixia Taishang Yucheng Daodao Jun*).

Having completed the rites and returned to his seat,
he turns east and surveys the multitude,
employing the **Dao’s Divine Power** (*Daosheng Shili*),
to transport the **Heavenly and Human** beings of the **Ten Directions**—
near and far—
all arriving ones **pervading the Heavens** (*Pian Zhi Tian*),
the **companions of observation and listening** (*Guanting Liu*),
all ascending into the **Void Space** (*Xukong*), a height of **a hundred zhang** (*Bai Zhang*).

He then takes the **Azure Rainbow and Flowing Clouds** (*Bingni Liuyun*) with **Yellow Threads and Ten Thousand Flowers** (*Huanglu Wan Hua*) **mantle** (*Zhe*),
welcomes the **Heavenly and Human** beings,
and places them beneath his seat.
The **Great Hall** opens in four directions—
countless **Without Measure** beings
assemble like piled grain,
praising and bowing in reverence,
their voices shaking the **Eight Extremes** (*Baji*).

The **Most High Lord Lao**’s **Heavenly Countenance** (*Tianyan*) smiles gently,
lifts the **Five Illuminations Precious Fan** (*Wuming Baoshan*),
and strokes the **Vermilion Expanse’s Golden Illumination Hall** (*Hongxiao Jin Guang Ming Ji*).

The Most High Lord Lao again addressed the assembly:

*"The Dao emerges as Spirit, and Spirit transforms as qi.
This qi—before Heaven and Earth, before yin and yang—is the true primordial source of all transformations, the subtle manifestation of the Dao.
It is neither form nor color, neither being nor non-being, not bound by yin and yang, nor confined to the Five Phases.
It can generate and transform, form and solidify—this is the divine function of the Dao.

Thus, it is as firm as metal and stone,
as pure as ice and jade,
as vast as the Void Space,
as enduring as the ancient past.
Within, it condenses into the utmost essence,
forming the chaotic unity of the undifferentiated.
Below, it extends to all living things—
this is the origin of qi, what is called the *yīnyūn huǎnghū*—
the subtle, indistinct breath.

When qi manifests in form,
its substance is molded by the Great Primordial.
It becomes the wondrous foundation of Heaven and Earth,
and is named *One Qi*.
Thus there is the True One, the Mysterious One, and the Supreme One—
also called the Three Primordial Qi.

From the establishment of the Jade Capital
down to the Gate of the Springs,
all celestial beings, ghosts, gods, and humans
are all born from it,
all generated by the Dao without distinction.
High and low, good and evil,
strong and weak, firm and brittle—
all receive their nature spontaneously,
without contrivance.

When the Three Realms are complete,
and divine spirits take their posts,
with rulers exalted and ministers lowly,
then they govern the transformations,
determine life and death,
raise the wise and humble the foolish,
establish high and low—
then the Dao has its most sacred Spirit,
Heaven its impartial Emperor.
The Three Enclosures and starry hosts,
the Eight Divine Officials,
enact their decrees,
recording human deeds and omissions without fail.
Even the slightest transgression—
no blade of grass or grain of millet escapes.

Thus, first clarify the body to penetrate the qi.
For the Dao is without form,
virtue has form,
illumination is the luminous body,
the Mysterious is the dark body,
yang is the moving body,
yin is the still body,
the True is the celestial body,
the perverse is the ghostly body.
Once the bodies are distinguished,
then the qi is penetrated to receive life.

Without form, it is penetrated by boundless qi;
with form, by primordial qi;
luminous body, by pure qi;
dark body, by turbid qi;
moving body, by dragon qi;
still body, by constant qi;
celestial body, by numinous qi;
ghostly body, by anomalous qi.
When the luminous body penetrates the qi,
the divisions are clear and fixed,
and the great transformations are established.
The governance of the Three Powers is fulfilled,
and the work of the Dao is complete—
transcending the Three Realms,
the deeds of the Highly True are accomplished.

One may observe the records of good and evil,
the principles of reward and retribution,
the great illumination of Heaven, humans, ghosts, and gods,
the countless billions in the Ten Directions,
spreading far and teaching widely,
freeing beings from the wheel of existence,
achieving the Dao of the Celestial Way,
effortless longevity—
all in harmony with the Great Void.

The Most High Lord Lao’s teaching is now complete.
The assembled True Ones, overseeing the transmission,
entrust it to me.
At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words.

The ritual observances were fully attended,
the celestial hosts returned to their stations,
and in an instant, all sound ceased.

At that time, all Heavenly and Human beings
encountered the sacred teaching,
universally receiving salvation,
completing their natural years without harm.
The land was tilted in reverence,
all cultivating benevolent hearts.

They understood the correspondence of cause and effect,
the connection of karma and retribution,
the response of sensation and fruit,
the law and its teaching,
the precepts and the body.

Their words aligned with the Supreme Dao,
their actions harmonized with Heaven’s intent,
their minds unified in compassion,
and those of differing natures became kin.

The nation was secure, the people prosperous,
rejoicing in great peace.
The teaching began to spread,
and the entire land was governed by the Dao.

Those with sincere aspiration,
who revered and followed with ritual,
all attained liberation in this world.

The Dao proclaims:
All the names spoken in this scripture by the Most High Lord Lao
are the inner names of the Celestial Emperors,
hidden and resonant sounds,
also the taboo names of the demon kings,
the secret names of all spirits—
not the common words of the world.

The Most High Sage has already become a True Person,
penetrating the Mysterious Body,
with true qi permeating the form.
Those who fully comprehend its chapters,
reciting them ten times,
will have divine light radiant within,
demons and ghosts blinded,
their adornments and talismans withering,
their celestial globes dimmed,
plagues and calamities cut off,
ghosts and spirits subdued,
the dead revived, bones made flesh.

Scholars who recite it ten times
will be remotely observed by the Most High,
their names recorded in the Three Registries.
Demonic forces will perish,
the stagnant and dim will ascend,
the dying will be saved,
the severed will live again.
This is because scholars have not yet penetrated the Great Mysterious,
still laboring to clarify the body’s principles,
their impure qi not yet exhausted,
still bound by human constraints.
They summon the authority of the Ten Directions,
but their might does not yet govern Heaven’s decrees.
Their virtue can subdue earthly spirits,
bind demonic forces—
yet they can only repel death,
not restore life.

Lightly reciting this chapter brings misfortune upon oneself.

To venerate and honor it,
to establish it at the gate—
generations will flourish,
all calamities averted,
divine spirits guarding the door.

This scripture is most exalted,
unmatched in the Jade Capital,
its salvation beyond measure.
It is the source of all Daoist paths,
a towering and vast framework,
its virtue beyond measure.

The Dao proclaims:
For those who recite this scripture ten times,
all the Celestial Worthies will gather,
their bodies pure, their minds clear,
their obscuring veils dissolved,
their qi and spirit unified,
their inner light bright and flowing.
Countless ancestral spirits,
suffering in darkness,
will all receive salvation,
ascending to the Vermilion Palace,
their term fixed at nine years,
transformed and reborn,
becoming noble beings.
Those who love this scripture and fulfill its practice,
their merits complete, their virtue fulfilled,
will all become Celestial Worthies,
ascending to the Golden Gate,
feasting in the Jade Capital.

Scholars who study and recite this scripture
will immediately receive salvation,
ascending to the Southern Palace,
their sincere recitation resonating with the numinous,
their luminous body unobscured,
their spiritual qi permeating the form—
naturally refined,
attaining the Hall of Flowing Fire,
their faces radiating jade brilliance,
their inner chambers filled with vermilion script.

Mortals who recite it
will accumulate life-giving qi,
their corpses dissolving of their own accord,
their blood flowing as pure essence,
their marrow filling with white fluid—
thus extending their years and strengthening their vitality.
All will attain the Dao of the Emptied Corpse,
their spirits temporarily extinguished,
avoiding the torments of the underworld,
and immediately returning to their forms,
wandering the Great Void.

This scripture is supremely subtle,
its salvation boundless."*

All beings of heaven and earth,
none but receive blessings.
Limitless virtues bestowed,
mercy granted through life and death,
treasured by the Celestial,
never passed to the lower worlds.

The worthy bear the golden treasure with sincere hearts,
pledging to the Celestial and transmitting it.
Lightly revealing or carelessly neglecting it
brings calamity upon the Nine Ancestors,
endless service to the ghostly officials.

Attended by the Five Emperors,
with twenty-four jade boys and girls each,
guarding the divine scriptures,
protecting those who receive the scripture in their forms.

The Dao speaks:
In the first month, observe prolonged fasting,
recite and chant this scripture,
to illuminate the form of all beings as they receive life,
the transformations of Daoist immortals, spirits, and ghosts,
all originating from the boundless void.

Establish form according to the Dao,
draw upon qi for practical use,
employ spirit to awaken wisdom,
use clarity for insight—
refining yin and yang, water and fire,
to transmute and achieve authenticity.

The forms of all beings,
Daoist immortals, spirits, and ghosts,
though similar in transformation,
vary in the qi they channel.
Their divine communications are subtle and profound,
each distinct in their ways,
manifesting or concealing themselves,
revealing the Dao through mysterious insight.
For the departed souls of past ages,
they sever the underworld’s grasp,
ascending to the Southern Palace.

In the seventh month, observe prolonged fasting,
recite and chant this scripture,
to illuminate the form of all beings as they complete their transformations,
the methods of Daoist immortals, spirits, and ghosts to extinguish their yin—
all originating from qi permeating the essence,
refining with the fire of darkness,
establishing firmness through constancy,
relying on spirit for change,
using purity for wisdom,
embracing dryness in their nature,
moonlight cleansing and purifying,
to transmute and achieve authenticity.
The forms of all beings,
Daoist immortals, spirits, and ghosts,
though similar in transformation,
vary in the qi they channel.
Their divine communications run in hidden cycles,
each distinct in their ways,
severing ties and transcending the mundane,
the path of seclusion and vastness,
revealing through secret insight.
The body attains Daoist immortality,
recorded in the heavenly registers,
with yellow talismans and white tablets,
erasing death and ascending to rebirth.

In the tenth month, observe prolonged fasting,
recite and chant this scripture,
to illuminate the form of all beings as they renew their vital breath,
the methods of Daoist immortals, spirits, and ghosts to return to the origin—
all originating from the unity of the primal void,
establishing form through vital breath,
darkness permeating the qi,
success achieved through dual refinement,
sensing life through fluids,
nourishing with pure essence,
concealing to generate clarity,
using stillness for transformation.
With frost and dew of the void,
refining to achieve authenticity.
The forms of all beings,
Daoist immortals, spirits, and ghosts,
though similar in transformation,
vary in the qi they channel.
Their spirits move in silent observation,
each distinct in their ways,
the path of liberation and lofty ascent,
revealing through hidden insight.
For kings and emperors,
their ministers and families,
they bring stability to the realm,
preserve the Celestial’s longevity,
ensuring unbroken succession,
always ruling as sovereigns,
bringing peace to their lands,
where the people praise the Great Harmony.

On the eight seasonal days,
chant this scripture,
as the eight winds conceal the body,
qi channels through the eight directions,
the eight scenes gather in truth,
the mud pellet clears its brilliance,
and one becomes a True Person of the Nine Palaces.

On the day of one’s birth,
chant this scripture,
as omens reveal the body,
qi enters the form.

The virtuous become sages,
mortal bones achieve authenticity,
spirits purified and upright,
vital qi everlasting,
free from suffering,
the body radiant with light,
three realms attending and guarding,
the Five Emperors overseeing their welcome,
ten thousand spirits paying homage,
their names recorded in heaven,
their merits fulfilled and virtues complete,
ascending to the Upper Clarity.

The Dao speaks:
On days of practice,
all must bathe in fragrant water,
fast and enter the chamber,
facing east,
knocking teeth thirty-two times,
ascending to hear the Thirty-two Heavens,
mentally bowing thirty-two times,
eyes closed,
quietly contemplating oneself seated amid the three-colored clouds of blue, yellow, and white,
inner and outer vast and dark.
To the east is the Wooden Primordial True Person,
to the south is the Flame-Elephant True Person,
to the west is the Golden Elixir True Person,
to the north is the Water-Elephant True Person,
above is the Mysterious Primordial True Person,
attended and observed by lions and white cranes,
arrayed on either side,
sun and moon casting radiant light,
illuminating the chamber,
a round symbol forming on the neck,
its glow reflecting in all ten directions—
thus clearly revealed.

The secret incantation states:
*Supreme Primal Dao,*
*Highest Celestial Sovereign,*
*summon forth from my body the Thirty-five Officers of the Five Stars,*
*left and right officials and messengers,*
*attended by fragrant jade boys,*
*transmitted by jade girls,*
*the Five Emperors’ direct talismans,*
*the direct day’s fragrant officials,*
*each thirty-two in number,*
*opening the gates to their words.*

Today is a day of auspicious joy,
of prolonged fasting and pure halls,
of practicing this supreme scripture,
granting limitless salvation to beings.

May those summoned ascend directly,
attending the Supreme Thirty-two Heavens,
before the august throne of the Primordial Emperor,
the Most Venerable and Highest.

Finished,
draw in the breath thirty-two times,
facing east to chant the scripture.

The Heavenly True Person says:
This scripture was spoken by the Divine Treasure Sovereign
in place of the Celestial Emperor of the Void,
thus also reaching the Primordial Emperor of the Beginning.
The Preserver of Life from the Great Polarity’s Original Transformation
composed the preface.

The True Person is a minister of the Highest Celestial Sovereign of the Remnant Heaven,

---
**Third Chapter: The Great Mixture, the Song of Piercing Qi**
The Primordial Origin establishes ten thousand heavens,
the Pure Qi of blue, yellow, and white.

The light transforms into the High Clarity,
the heavy settles as turbid.

Within the Central Harmony, right and wrong exist,
for humans, life and death are reborn.

Desires corrupt the True Essence,
the River of Love constantly drowns.

Entering the Dao, you become a spirit,
perfecting your merit at the Imperial Gate.

Creating karma, you fall into the Wheel,
following desires, sinking into dark prisons.

Who knows within the Great Void,
the Three Officials wield the Transformation Brush?

Holding my great authority,
the Nine Palaces marking the sacred laws.

The Heavenly Court’s myriad folk,
in Nanchang, ever joyous.

Having attained the Mysterious Enlightenment,
how could you again sink?

Receive my Heavenly Treasure’s words,
quickly advance in the Longevity Practice.

This, above the Three Realms,
within the flying void,
the Song of the Immortal King’s sound,
its words attuned to the Cavernous Chapters.

Recite it a hundred times,
your name registered in the Southern Palace.

Recite it a thousand times,
the Demon King welcomes you.

Ten thousand times, the Dao is complete,
ascending to the Supreme Void,
crossing the Three Realms,
ranked among the Immortal Lords.

Hearing the sacred sound,
the Demon King reveres your form,
commands the earthly deities,
to attend and escort.

Escaping the earthly gate,
free from the Five Sufferings and Eight Hardships,
the Seven Ancestors ascend,
forever parted from the Ghostly Officials,
the soul crosses the Vermilion Mists,
refined and reborn.

This is called the Limitless,
universally saving the boundless.

There are secret Heavenly Texts,
all heavens hold them in reverence.

Revealing arrogance, you fall into Hell,
disaster befalls the Seven Ancestral Uncles.

The Dao says: These two chapters are the hidden sounds
of all Heavenly Emperors and the Most Holy Demon Kings,
all the words of the Great Brahman,
not the common speech of the world.

Clarifying the origin of life,
piercing Qi adapts to the material.
Heaven’s governance extends to the people,
unerringly just and without bias.

Heaven’s utmost fairness,
judged by the Emperors.

The Law of the Dao adapts and transforms,
applied according to the times,
penetrating the hidden mysteries of the Saints,
not measurable by the vulgar.

Thus it is called Profound and Mysterious,
difficult to fully explore.

The Heavenly Treasure is guarded
in the Eastern Treasure Hall of the Jade Clarity’s Supreme Sovereign.
According to the ritual, after thirty-seven thousand years,
it will descend in response to the age.

If a perfected one brings gold and jade with a sincere heart,
and according to the old ritual petitions the Ten Heavens,
then it shall be bestowed.

The Dao speaks:

*"To chant and recite this scripture,
the mortal form becomes true,
defiled qi clears and disperses,
heavenly light enters the heart,
bone marrow flows with jade essence,
and one attains the perfected immortals,
forever free from death’s cause—
all paths open, all deeds succeed.

Above, harmonizing with Heaven’s order,
aligning with sun, moon, and five stars.
Within, balancing human qi,
free from sickness and pain.
Below, subduing malevolent spirits,
a hundred deities guard the form.

All must unite in heart to observe fasts,
offer incense at the six times,
recite the sutra tenfold in all directions—
merit and virtue descend,
dissolving all ill omens.

Its boundless words
universally liberate the endless.

The Dao speaks:

Those of shallow learning, or whose immortal grade is incomplete,
when their fate of extinction arrives and the body enters the Great Yin,
at the moment of passing,
let fellow students of the Way perform incense offerings
and recite the scripture ten times,
to guide the corpse according to the ritual.

The Most High illuminates the form—
the form transforms into supple gold,
the Life Officer channels qi—
qi molds jade essence,
the soul refines the corpse to dissolution,
the Nine Palaces restore spirit,
the spirit ascends directly to the Southern Palace,
and by one’s merit, rebirth follows in due days.

The Wheel of Rebirth turns without hesitation—
thus one attains the immortals.

The Dao speaks:

When Heaven and Earth reach their cycle’s end,
when stars and constellations shift their courses,
when sun and moon lose their eclipses,
when the four seasons fall out of order,
when yin and yang fail to harmonize,
when the realm suffers calamity,
when martial qi manifests,
when pestilence spreads,
when the populace perishes in masses,
when teachers and friends pass away—

All such disasters arise from karmic completion,
from the body’s transformation by virtue,
from the attraction of qi by merit—
each has its origin.
This is the natural Way,
Heaven’s governance.

All must observe fasts,
offer incense and recite scripture.

For fasting and chanting bear great merit—
above, they dispel celestial calamities,
protect and uphold the Emperor,
below, they avert poison and harm,
saving the myriad people.
Life and death depend upon them—
their blessings are immeasurable,
hence it is said: boundless,
universally liberating Heaven and humankind.

The Dao speaks:

Whoever possesses this scripture
may act on behalf of Heaven, Earth, the Sovereign, and the people,
performing these deeds of merit.

On days of disaster, with sincere intent,
observe fasts, burn incense,
recite the scripture ten times—
all the heavens record their names,
ten thousand deities attend as guardians,
and the perfected ones of the Right Path
shall attain the rank of saintly ministers beneath the Golden Gate.

The heavens record each person’s merits and transgressions,
without the slightest omission.

Even the Heavenly Magical Kings will advocate for your life,
and those who attain the Dao shall truly comprehend these profound words.

*The Great Deities of Boundless Limitless, Purple Radiance and Elusive Spirit,*
*from the Ten Directions,*
*all arrived together at once.*
*All men and women of the land,*
*turning their hearts in reverence,*
*spoke to one another:*
*'When I first heard the Scripture,*
*I immediately awakened to the Spirit-Dan,*
*the True Qi refining my body,*
*unity with the luminous form,*
*the subtle patterns of the Mysterious Dao,*
*and sought verification of the Immortal True.'*

*The arriving hosts were as dense as stars in mist,*
*as clouds in fine dust—*
*countless hosts without number,*
*half the land’s soil sank,*
*unable to be restrained.*

*Then, the Primordial Origin suspended a precious pearl,*
*as large as a millet grain,*
*within the Void’s expanse,*
*five zhang above the earth.*

*With His celestial pull,*
*The Great Celestial Deity, the Highest Sage,*
*The Wondrous Conduct Immortal,*
*and the Great Deities of Boundless Limitless, Purple Radiance and Elusive Spirit,*
*countless hosts without number,*
*all entered the pearl’s mouth.*

*Heavenly beings gazed upward,*
*seeing only a radiant surge descending from the pearl.*
*Once they entered,*
*their whereabouts became unknown.*

*The people dispersed,*
*and the earth returned to its evenness,*
*no longer tilted or sunken.*

*The Primordial Origin, within the pearl,*
*completed the recitation of the Scripture,*
*while the assembled immortals observed and delivered it to me.*
*At that moment,*
*joy and celebration were beyond words.*

*The ritual’s coarse details were exhausted,*
*all heavenly beings resumed their stations,*
*and in an instant,*
*the hall fell silent, leaving no trace.*

*At that time,*
*all heavenly beings who encountered the Scripture’s law*
*universally received deliverance,*
*preserving their original years,*
*no injury or harm,*
*all revering the land,*
*all attaining the Supreme True.*

*Nurturing Qi, nurturing Spirit,*
*nurturing the Origin, nurturing Essence,*
*nurturing Will, nurturing Marvel,*
*nurturing Wisdom, nurturing Form,*
*nurturing Life, nurturing Nature.*

*Radiance and splendor enveloped the body,*
*the Elusive Spirit-Dan was perfected,*
*all aligned in boundless compassion,*
*differing bones became kindred,*
*the land secure, its people flourishing,*
*rejoicing in Great Peace.*
*The Scripture first emerged,*
*and the land was governed by the Dao.*

*Those with resolute hearts,*
*who revered with sincerity,*
*all attained the power to deliver the world.*

*The Dao speaks:*
*All the names mentioned in the Primordial Origin’s recitation*
*are the hidden titles of the heavens’ Supreme Deities,*
*the concealed sounds of the Dao,*
*also the tabooed names of the Highest True Ones,*
*and the veiled names of the listed Saints.*

*Those who chant and recite this*
*will have the Purple Radiance reflected within,*
*the Elusive Spirit aiding their souls,*
*the Jade Dan nourishing their bodies,*
*the Supreme One descending in truth—*
*these are not the common words of the world.*

*Those who have already attained the Highest True Ones,*
*mastered the Mysterious Dao,*
*and penetrated its subtleties,*
*can fully comprehend its chapters."*

「When recited ten times,
the heavens resound in distant chant,
all the Supreme Deities of the ten thousand realms arrange their rites,
the luminous scene ascends to the Mysterious,
the Danling Spirit cradles the clouds,
the inner essence transforms into sun and moon,
the celestial hosts attend as marshals,
the host of demons is bound in form,
the ghostly vitalities are extinguished,
the dead are revived, and the white bones become flesh.*

*Those of utmost learning,*
*when they recite it ten times,*
*shall have the Five Emperors as their guardians,*
*all Three Realms bow in homage,*
*demonic essences lose their sight,*
*ghostly spirits are extinguished,*
*they rescue the dying and bring the lifeless to rebirth.*

*This is why:*
*scholars still bear unclean qi, their bodies not yet perfected in truth,*
*and though they can subdue the ten directions,*
*their power does not yet govern the heavenly laws.*
*Yet they can subdue the earthly spirits,*
*bind the demonic essences,*
*and merely feel the Dan’s light delivering their forms—*
*but cannot yet grant rebirth.*

*To recite this chapter lightly brings calamity upon oneself.*
*Yet to venerate and supply it,*
*one’s gates shall flourish,*
*prosperity endure through generations,*
*all afflictions shall not touch,*
*and the divine luminaries shall guard the door.*

*This scripture is most august and refined,*
*unmatched in the Jade Capital,*
*its deliverance without measure,*
*a foundation for all the Dao.*

*Its vast and sublime scope,*
*virtue beyond reckoning.*

*The Dao speaks:*
*"For those who recite this scripture ten times,*
*all the heavens gather,*
*the Heart Dan becomes luminous,*
*the Purple Radiance shields the body,*
*countless generations of ancestors,*
*their suffering souls relieved,*
*all shall immediately receive deliverance,*
*ascend to the Vermilion Palace,*
*and be granted nine years of rebirth,*
*retransformed and reborn as noble ones.*

*And those who love this scripture to its utmost,*
*fulfilling their merit and attaining virtue,*
*shall all become Immortals.*

*The Supreme One’s Jade Dan,*
*bestows longevity without bound,*
*ascending to the Golden Gate,*
*feasting in the Jade Capital.*

*Those of highest learning,*
*who practice and recite this scripture,*
*shall gain clarity of perception,*
*return to their original fate,*
*the Jade Dan conceal its mark,*
*the Purple Radiance surge upward,*
*and all shall immediately receive deliverance,*
*ascending to the Southern Palace.*

*Mortals who merely recite it*
*shall generate the Dan’s essence,*
*which flows into their fetal spirits,*
*prolonging life and years.*
*Later, they shall all attain the way of corpse dissolution,*
*their souls extinguished temporarily,*
*not experiencing the torments of hell,*
*and immediately regaining form,*
*wandering through the Great Void.*

*This scripture is subtle and profound,*
*its deliverance boundless,*
*all heavenly and human beings*
*shall rejoice in its grace.*

*Its blessings are immeasurable,*
*extending mercy over life and death,*
*a treasure of the highest heavens,*
*not transmitted to the lower worlds.*

*Those of utmost virtue, bearing gold treasures in devotion,*
*pledge to the heavens to transmit it.*
*To leak or reveal it carelessly*
*brings ruin to the Nine Ancestors,*
*and endless servitude in the netherworld.*

*It is guarded by the Five Emperors.*
*The Jade Boys and Jade Girls,*
*thirty-two each,*
*attend to its divine text,*
*protecting those who receive the scripture.*

*The Dao speaks:*
*"In the first month, observe a long fast,*
*recite this scripture,*
*and the Purple Radiance and Danling Spirit shall manifest.*
*The Yang Virtue delivers the netherworld,*
*The Jade Dan revolves nine times,*
*and in seven generations, one attains truth,*
*becoming a departed soul of the upper realm,*
*cutting off the suffering of hellish imprisonment,*
*and ascending to the Southern Palace.*

*"In the seventh month, observe a long fast,*
*recite this scripture,*
*and the Purple Radiance and Danling Spirit shall manifest.*
*The True Dao returns to the body,*
*granting flexibility and resilience,*
*the body attains immortality,*
*the heavens record one’s name,*
*with yellow talismans and white tablets,*
*erasing death and granting rebirth.*

*"In the tenth month, observe a long fast,*
*recite this scripture,*
*and the Purple Radiance and Danling Spirit shall manifest.*
*The Supreme One bestows the scripture,*
*The Jade Dan guards the truth,*
*and one becomes a king or sovereign lord,*
*stabilizing the realm for their descendants,*
*preserving the heavenly mandate,*
*enduring through generations,*
*forever ruling as a noble,*
*stabilizing their domain,*
*and bringing peace to the people.*

*"On the eight festival days,*
*recite this scripture,*
*and the Purple Radiance and Danling Spirit shall manifest.*
*The furnace opens the eight gates,*
*The cauldron holds the nine palaces,*
*The Supreme One as the honored one,*
*and one becomes a True Person of the Nine Palaces.*

*"On one’s original fate day,*
*recite this scripture,*
*and the Purple Radiance and Danling Spirit shall manifest.*
*One awakens to the mark of their original fate,*
*becomes a True Person,*
*their soul refined and clear,*
*all qi enduring,*
*not experiencing suffering,*
*their body radiant,*
*the Three Realms as their attendants,*
*the Five Emperors welcoming them,*
*all spirits paying homage,*
*their name inscribed in heaven,*
*merit fulfilled and virtue attained,*
*and ascend to the Upper Pure."*

*The Dao speaks:*
*"On days of practice,*
*one must bathe in fragrant water,*
*fast and enter the chamber,*
*facing east,*
*knocking teeth thirty-two times,*
*to invoke the thirty-two heavens,*
*bowing in heart to the thirty-two recitations,*
*closing eyes,*
*and quietly contemplating oneself seated within clouds of purple, crimson, and yellow qi,*
*inner and outer darkness vast,*
*with Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Tortoise,*
*Lions, and White Cranes arrayed on either side,*
*above the head, the Purple Radiance,*
*within, the Supreme One’s Jade Dan,*
*the crimson light like the sun,*
*great as a pearl nine inches wide,*
*borne aloft in divine clouds,*
*illuminated by sun and moon,*
*the chamber’s interior brightly revealed,*
*a circular symbol forming at the neck,*
*its light reflecting the ten directions—*
*thus, it is manifest.*

*The secret incantation says:*
*"The peerless Primordial Origin,*
*The Supreme Dao Lord.*
*I summon Your ministers within my body—*
*the thirty-two officials of the Five Agents,*
*the attendants of fragrant jade,*
*the messengers of the Jade Girls,*
*the Five Emperors’ direct talismans,*
*the direct sun’s fragrant officials—*
*thirty-two each,*
*opening the gates as You command.*

*"Today is auspicious and joyous,*
*a long fast in the pure hall,*
*practicing this scripture,*
*delivering countless beings.*

*May my invocation reach above,*
*and directly govern the peerless thirty-two heavens,*
*the Primordial Origin’s Supreme Deity,*
*before the august seat.*

*Finished. Now summon the Qi Lord through twelve recitations,*
*facing east to recite the scripture.*

*The Primordial Origin’s Scripture of Immeasurable Deliverance,*
*The Supreme Chapter of the Mysterious Dao,*
*The Essence of the Heart Dan,*
*The Supreme Chapter of the Purple Radiance,*
*Nine transformations delivering beings.*

*The Supreme One’s hidden sounds,*
*The Jade Dan’s natural essence,*
*the mixed void of crimson brilliance,*
*The Primordial Origin’s uppermost true ones.*

*They give birth to heaven and earth,*
*shape the transformations of all beings,*
*possess the mysterious palace,*
*and radiance that pervades all.*

*They open and guide the nine abysses,*
*interconnect with the heavenly roots,*
*The Supreme One’s subtle essence,*
*and all beings born of spirit.*

*Glowing Dan’s radiance,*
*circularly illuminating,*
*outerly linking the four voids,*
*embracing the Jade Embryo.*

*The Primordial Origin’s great kalpa,*
*The five halos flowing in form,*
*This is the spiritual omen,*
*The Purple Extremity’s high purity.*

*Yushan’s verdant peaks,*
*Xiaoshan’s lofty heights,*
*The Supreme’s Primordial Capital,*
*above, the circular illumination,*
*The jade gate’s flying essence.*

*The divine feast’s vast expanse,*
*The pure jade’s flourishing brilliance,*
*now facing the imperial heights,*
*The original transformation opening life.*

The **Supreme Radiance’s Hall of Clarity**,
**Emerald Mists’ Azure City**,
calmly pacify the ten directions,
pierce the **qi** of the eight voids.

Beneath, they link the ordered constellations,
descend to guide the myriad stars.
Majestic, the **Supreme Deity**,
seated in the **Jade Enclosure**.

Within are:

bearing heaven and holding earth,
ranked saints open life.

Together proclaiming **Great Transformation**,
crossing kalpas to return to the source,
today descending to refine,
all spirits gather at the court.

The **Thirty-Two Heavens**, the **Thirty-Two Emperors**,
all hidden names of the **Heavens**,
all hidden titles of the **Heavens**.

The **Central Void’s** natural **Spiritual Manifestations**,

the **Crimson Spirit’s** essence,
the **Crimson Spirit’s** noble **Deity**,
the **Purple Radiance’s** divine **Spirit**,
the **Purple Radiance’s** **Jade Enclosure**,
the **True Essence of the Imperial Extremity**.

Six **cycles** and ten **flights**,
nine **Pure Transformations**,
boundless hidden mysteries,
spirits beyond measure.

Descending the **Threefold Splendor**,
universally guiding **Heavenly Beings and mortals**,
the **Supreme One’s** **Crimson Spirit**,
transforming and nurturing the **people**.

The **people** possess **Primordial Command**,
the **Sovereign’s** **Crimson Spirit’s** essence,
shimmering **Purple Radiance**,
entering the body to generate **Truth**.

The **Heavens** take the **eon** as their day,
where birth and death have no bounds.
They bestow scriptures upon the **Jade Terrace**,
and summon **True Command** and **Spiritual Deity**.

Today, we rejoice in receiving the **Way’s** guidance,
having traversed trials of the ten thousand **Heavens**.
We beseech the eradication of all evil seeds,
the severing of the **fetal roots**,
and the ascension of the **Five Phases**,
to ascend and rank among the **Supreme Darkness**.

The **Celestial Registry** records deeds,
and **Immortal Officials** memorialize **virtue**.
The **True King** oversees and inspects,
while **Heavenly Beings** cross the **Celestial Gates**.

The **Eastern Dipper** guards life,
the **Western Dipper** descends **Spirit**,
the **Southern Dipper** registers deeds,
the **Northern Dipper** refines **Essence**,
the **Central Dipper** blends harmoniously,
and the **Purple Radiance** manifests the **Crimson Spirit**.

The **Green Sovereign** governs **Wood** in order,
the **White Sovereign** oversees **Metal**,
the **Red Sovereign** blazes with **Fire**,

They hurl fire and let bells chime,
striking in all directions.

Any **demons** or **spirits** daring to disturb the **Yellow Palace**,
the **Dark Axe** shall decapitate and annihilate them,
and the **Heavenly Attendants** shall mete out punishment.

They slaughter and sever the **Ghostly Hosts**,
as **Wind-Fire** ascends in tumult.
Ten thousand **Heavenly Beings** bow in sincerity,
a hundred thousand **demons** are slain in form.

**Demons** without reckoning,
**Ghosts** without **Essential Spirit**,
the **Three Primordials** and **Nine Departments**,
strictly inspecting the **Cloud Camp**.

No indulgence is permitted—
**Spiritual Talismans** ascend in flight,
proclaiming to the **Three Realms**,
all **Earthly Realms** and **Eight Tartarus**,
the **Nine Palaces’ Mysterious Masters**,
recording **virtue** in the **Supreme Clarity**.

The **Sacred Talismans** and **Great Initiations**,
the **Supreme True Scriptures**,
the **Three Lights’ Wondrous Qi**,
emanating through boundless **eons**.

**Kunlun’s** **Mysterious Peak**,
the **Great Elixir’s** brilliance,
unfolds the **Mysterious Transformation**,

When **Red** and **White** manifest,
the **Primordial Spirit** concentrates,
the **Heavenly Vault** clears and rises,
enveloping the **Nine Tartarus**.

The **Supreme One’s** **Kingdom**,
becomes the **Crimson Spirit**,
connecting above and below,
neither **form** nor **void**.

**Wind** turns to the **Utmost Yin**,
**Void** stirs the **Spiritual Source**,
as **Source** and **Spirit** merge with the **Dao**,
and establish the **Ten Billions of Heavens**.

**Heaven above Heaven**,
floating visions rise and sink,
**Primordial Light** surges boundlessly,
while the **Jade Extremity** remains **formless**.

The **Supreme Darkness** and **Supreme One**,
**Mysterious Elixir** and **Crimson Brilliance**,
**Imperial Destiny** and **Golden Flower**,
encompassing all with **Luminous Crystals**.

They proclaim the **Great Capital**,

**Red Scriptures** and **Precious Talismans**,
where **qi** merges to become **Immortal**.

They establish the **Nine Directions**,
and extend the **Command** far.
**Sacred Breath** ascends in flight,
wrapping and intertwining.

The **Purple Radiance** disperses and weaves,
as **warp** and **weft**,
**Primordial Wind** flows and performs,
through the **Thirty-Six Gates**.

They revolve the **Great Emptiness**,
encircle and bind the **Roots of Life**,
turning the **Knots** through **Cosmic Principles**,
and ascending in the **Flying Wheels**.

The **Sixty-Nine Qi’s**,
all governed by the **Three Primordials**,
the **Two Visions** and **Tartarus Talismans**,
as **qi** descends into the **Mysterious Spring**.

The **Mysterious Spring** and **Supreme Truth**,
the **Imperial Dao’s** vast expanse,
the **Eight Wonders’** ten thousand **Flowers**,
settling and enduring without end.

The **Seven Passes** and **Four Boundaries**,
aligned with **Heaven** in unity,
the **Crimson Dawn** swirls in singularity,
radiantly mirrored without tilt.

The **Three Primordials** and **Three Sovereigns**,
the **Great Void’s** circling **Wind**,
the **Great Historian** nurtures the **Infant**,
through the **Ten Thousand Visions** and **Mysterious Child**,
a thousand mergings and ten thousand harmonies,
naturally forming **Truth**.

Within **Truth** lies **Spirit**,
and **Spirit** dwells in all **realms**.
The **Purple Radiance’s True Person**,
the **Crimson Heaven’s Supreme Spirit**.

The **Great Emperor of Longevity**,
the **Green Flower’s Jade Lord**,
the **Supreme One’s** **Mystic Endeavors**.

The **Commander of Life** is without **flaw**,
the **White Primordial** and **Red Child**,
restraining **Soul** and binding **Spirit**,
as **Peach** and **Kang** merge in extension,
and **qi** spreads to nourish **Essence**.

They hold the **Registers** and govern the **Passes**,
protecting and guiding the **Heavenly People**.
Ascending to the **Pure Microcosm**,
residing within the **Lined Array**.

The **Great Ultimate’s Precious Void**,
the **Grand Canon’s Bright Hall**,
settling below in the **human body**,
the **Six Palaces** and **Five Courts**.

The **Central Harmony** of the hundred **Spirits**,
blending and ascending in the void.
The **Ten Chants** reveal the **Mysteries**,
and **Truth** ascends with the **qi**.

The **Dao** esteems **True Elixir**,
and the **Purple Radiance** guides **Heavenly Beings**.
The **Divine Furnace’s Eight Gates**,
the **Three Wheels** of **Heaven’s** movement,
**Ancestral Arrangements** and **Taboos**,
**Karmic Causes** and **Conditions**.

All **demons** are pacified and opened,
and countless **Heavenly Beings** are born.
Their **forms** receive life,
and ascend into the **Jade Enclosure**.

Thus each responds to the **Crimson Spirit**,
and the **Great Merit** subdues the **hosts of demons**.
They chant and sing in **hymns**,
the **Nine Flowers’** hidden **scriptures**,
and their **words** align with the **Highest Truth**.

**First Hymn of the Ascending Crimson Spirit**:
The **Heavenly Valley’s Sacred Spring**,
where **True Light** swirls like **Crimson Smoke**.
The **Flying Mist** gathers **Luminous Rays**,
encircling the **Nine Abysses**.

At **Kunlun’s** edge,
the ten thousand **visions** merge in **transformation**.
Ascending into the **Purple Void**,
refining and intertwining.

**Wondrous Existence** and **Empty Non-existence**,
**qi** descends into the **Mysterious Elixir**.
The **Mysterious Elixir** generates **Truth**,
the **Ultimate Truth’s** **Mysterious Pass**.

The **Nine Dao’s** **Spiritual Radiance**,
illuminates the **Tartarus Mountains** below.
**True Function** is revealed,
and the **Way** is opened for the **Seven Mysteries**.

They gather **Radiance** at dawn,
and ascend in the **Jade Chariot**.
Their **Golden Flower** transforms in **body**,
roaming through the **Eight Extremes**.

with **Great Blessings** enduring without end.

The **Crimson Talismans** ascend the **Dao**,
and the **Imperial Pole** shines with **Pearls**.

The **Great Flower’s Precious Elixir**,
transforms into the **Jade Capital**.
The **Mysterious Primordial** sets the **foundation**,
as the **Purple Radiance** blazes in **clarity**.

Humans possess the **Primordial Symbol**,
with **Ultimate Essence** concealed within.
**Transformation** and **Mystery** surge together,
and ascend into the **Imperial Peace**.

**Primordial Beginnings’ True Qi**,
establishes the **Roots of Life**.
**Green Flower** and **Crimson Elixir**,
swirl in **water** and crystallize in **jade**.

They wash **silks** and bind **pearls**,
as the **Crimson Sky** races with **stars**.
They revolve through the **Three Visions**,
and fly with **Fire Bells**.

They sway the **Imperial Qi**,
and the **Towering Eon-City** stands firm.
The **Two Primordials** respond in unity,
and the **Great Simplicity** constructs **form**.

**Heaven** is universally settled,
and the **Ten Billions of Eons** remain unshaken.

**Third Hymn of the Crimson Spirit’s True Sovereign**:
The **Golden Threshold** opens the **Sacred Portal**,
where **True Light** pervades all **Heavens**.
The ten thousand **Immortals** gather in the **Imperial Palace**,
as **bells** chime and **fragrant smoke** ascends.

A single chant summons the ten thousand **Spirits**,
a second song brings the **crowds of Truth**.
Vastly transforming into the **Eight Circles**,
the **Pearl Towers** rise in the **Lined Array**.

They sing to awaken the ten thousand **Spirits**,
and again to summon the **Truths**.
Mysteriously transforming into the **Eight Circles**,
the **Pearl Towers** rise in the **Lined Array**.

The **Most High** gathers the myriad **precious essences**,
and **Primordial Origin** commands **Lord Bohua**.
He bids the **Morning Radiance** of **Purple** race forth,
and **Eternal Life** draws forth the **True Tooth**.

The **Mystic Pattern** conceals the **Hidden Peak**,
while **Azure Fall** swirls with **Clouds and Crimson Haze**.
Seated serenely in the **Nine Heavens’ midst**,
the **Celestial Wall** arrays its **Nine Gates**.

The **Sun and Moon** stand at its sides,
beneath which **layered clouds** mass.
**Purple Light** transforms into the **Danling Spirit**,
yoked to the **Dragon Palanquin**, dancing in flight.

The **Natural Jade-Purity Emperor** appears,
and the **Jade Prison** summons the **Primordial Lord**.
He proclaims the **Jade Elixir Dao**,
the **Great Heavenly Sovereign’s** sacred text.
He universally enlightens all **Heavenly Realms**,
awakening **mankind** to the **Mystic Seed**.

This **Great Law** is established as a beam,
its **right precepts** flowing eternally.
Above the **Three Realms**, within the **Flying Void**,
the **True King’s** song resounds—its tone harmonizes with the **Cavernous Chapter**.

Recite it **one hundred times**—your name ascends to the **Southern Palace**.
Recite it **one thousand times**—the **True King** himself welcomes you.
Recite it **ten thousand times**—the **Dao** is complete,
and you ascend to the **Supreme Void**, transcending the **Three Realms**,
ascending to the rank of **Immortal Lord**.

Those who hear the **Sacred Sound**,
the **True King’s** form manifests in reverence.
He commands the **Earthly Deities** to guard and escort,
drawing you forth from the **Earthly Gate**,
freeing you from **Five Torments and Eight Hardships**,
elevating the **Seven Ancestors**,
eternally departing the **Northern Darkness**,
your **Soul** crossing the **Vermilion Mound**,
refined and reborn.
This is called **Infinite Salvation**,
universally liberating the boundless.

There exists a **Secret Celestial Text**,
which all **Heavens** hold in reverence.
To reveal it carelessly is to fall into **Hell**,
bringing calamity to the **Seven Ancestral Lords**.

The **Dao** speaks:
These two chapters are the **hidden sounds** of the **Heavenly Sovereigns**
and the **Purple Light Danling Spirit**.
If one knows the **Great One’s Jade Elixir** as their **Primordial Fate**,
preserving it within,
and does not let **darkness, filth, or deceit** obscure their **True Source**,
returning to the **Heart’s Origin**,
with **Purple Light** illuminating and **Inverted Knowledge** awakened,
one’s **True Name** is revealed within the **Mind’s Form**—
neither **Mind** nor **Spirit**,
neither **Elixir** nor **Spirit-Power**.
The **Mystic Pass** is transcended—
awakening brings the **Dao**.

Once the **Dao** is attained,
**Mind** and **Spirit** are one,
**Elixir** and **Spirit-Power** are one.
Life and death, coming and going,
pose no obstruction.
In the **Heavenly Palace’s highest realm**,
one plays freely in **Nature’s essence**—
this is called the **True Person**, also the **Immortal Sage**.

The **Seven Ancestors** ascend in flight,
adrift in ease for **ten thousand eons**—
all this is the speech of **Great Brahman**,
not the common words of the world.
Its speech lacks **melodic grace**,
its tunes lack **ornate beauty**,
thus it is called **Profound and Mysterious**,
difficult to fathom in detail.

A treasure of the **Heavens Above**,
hidden within the **Eastern Chamber’s treasure vault**
of the **Highest Divine Xuanqing Jade-Purity King’s Palace**,
to be transmitted every **37,000 years** according to the **Science**.

If a **Perfected One** presents **gold and jewels** with a sincere heart,
and according to the ancient rites pledges allegiance to the **Ten Heavens**,
then it shall be granted.

The **Dao** speaks:
When the **Heavenly Rotation** reaches its end,
when the **Sun, Moon, and Five Stars** wane or wax,
when the **Most Holy Divine Ones** rest or decline,
the **shallow scholars** suffer harm.
Whenever such calamities arise,
all of **like qi** must unite in **fasting and purification**,
offering **incense at the six hours**,
reciting the **sutra ten times** in rotation.
**Blessings and merit** shall descend,
dissolving all **inauspicious omens**.

The **Infinite Text** universally liberates the boundless.

The **Dao** speaks:
If the **shallow scholars** are **Dao**-weak,
or their **Immortal Rank** is incomplete,
and their **destiny** is extinguished,
their **corpse** passing into the **Great Darkness**,
at the moment of crossing,
the **Perfected Ones** among their peers
must perform **incense offerings** and recite the **sutra ten times** in their behalf,
conducting the **corpse’s passage** according to the **Law**.
Then the **Taiyi in the Cinnabar Field**,
whose taboo name is **"Heavy Darkness of the Void"**, **"Profound Desolation Without Form"**,
shall emit the **Jade Elixir’s essence**,
returning the **Primordial Breath**,
and the **Soul and Spirit** shall ascend directly to the **Southern Palace**,
according to their **learned merit**, reborn on the appointed day.
With **no doubt in the Wheel of Rebirth**,
one attains **Divine Immortality**.

The **Dao** speaks:
When the **Heavenly Rotation** ends,
when the **Stars and Constellations** stray,
when the **Sun and Moon** lose their luster,
when the **Four Seasons** are disordered,
when **Yin and Yang** are unbalanced,
and **calamities** plague the **realm**,
when **plagues** spread,
and the **people** perish in masses,
when **teachers and friends** meet untimely ends,
and **kin** suffer misfortune—
all must **fast, offer incense, and recite the sutra**.

**Fasting and sutra-recitation** bear **great merit**.
Above, they **ward off Heavenly calamities** and **protect the Sovereign**.
Below, they **exorcise poisons and plagues** to **save the people**.
Life and death depend upon them—
their blessings are **immeasurable**.
Thus it is said: **Infinite Salvation**,
universally liberating **Heaven and Man**.

The **Dao** speaks:
All who possess this **sutra**,
and perform these **meritorious deeds** for the **Heavenly Sovereigns** and the **people**,
shall, on days of calamity,
**resolve to fast, burn incense, and recite the sutra ten times**.
All **Heavens** shall record their names,
and the **Ten Thousand Spirits** shall guard them.
The **Perfected Ones of the Right Path** shall ensure
they become **ministers of the Golden Threshold** beneath the **Holy Sovereign**.

The **Heavens** record all **deeds and transgressions**—
not a **hair’s breadth** is missed.
The **True Kings of Heaven** also **commend your essence**,
and those who attain the **Dao** must **fully comprehend** these **profound words**.

**The Infinite Hidden Speech of Great Brahman in the Heavens**,
an **exalted text** from the **Highest Celestial Palace of the Jade Sovereign**,
the **Primordial Purple Light Danling**’s **Golden Gate’s left panel**,
once inscribed by the **Dao Lord**,
to **pledge the Perfected Ones**.

It is also transmitted within the **Eastern Extremity Palace**,
to those who have already attained **perfection**,
so they may know the **wondrous Dao**.

Each character is a **broad length of one zhang**.
The **Dao Lord** of the **Heavenly Sovereigns** and **Perfected Ones** once wrote this text,
establishing it as the **correct sound**.

Those who know this **sound** and can **fast and recite** it,
all **Heavens** shall send **Flying Heavenly Sovereigns and Devas**,
to descend and observe their **form**,
to record their **virtue and diligence**,
and report them to the **Heavens**.
The **Ten Thousand Spirits** shall **pay homage and worship**,

the **Great Merit Devas** shall **commend and elevate them**,
and the **Dao** shall be **fulfilled and attained**,
allowing them to **roam the Three Realms**,
and **ascend into the Golden Gate**.

This **sound** **cleaves through all obstacles**,
**dispels all calamities**,
**saves all beings**,
and **fulfills all aspirations**.
It is the **natural sound of the Heavenly Sovereigns**.

Thus, when recited, it **subdues great demons** and **descends to observe**.
The **Supreme Sovereign** **distant sings**,
the **Ten Thousand Spirits** **pay homage and worship**,
the **Three Realms** **attend at the veranda**,
the **hosts of gods** **bind their heads** in reverence,
**ghostly essences** **perish of their own accord**,
**resounding gems** **vibrate with clarity**,
the **Ten Directions** **become serene and pure**,
**rivers and seas** **fall silent**,
**mountains and valleys** **swallow the mists**,
all **sentient beings** **tremble and submit**,
**gathering the multitudes of immortals**,
**Heaven** is **free of miasmic vapors**,
**Earth** is **free of demonic dust**,
**underworld wisdom** **penetrates and clears**,
a **vast and profound mystery** indeed.

**The *Lingbao Wuli Duren Shangping Miaojing* (Scripture of the Infinite Hidden Treasure for Saving Beings)**
**End of Volume 27**
**Start of Volume 28**

The **Three Celestial Lights Shining with Luster** (Preserving Life and Extending Existence)
**Dao speaks:** In ancient times, within the **Emerald Void** of the **Azure Sky**, the **Great Primordial Earth** sang the **Infinite Hidden Treasure Scripture for Saving Beings** and received the **Infinite Uppermost Brand of the Way’s Saving Beings**.

The **Primordial Origin Sovereign of Heaven** then proclaimed this **Scripture**, circling ten times around the **Ten Directions**, manifesting in all the **Heavens**. In delivering this **Scripture of Saving Beings**, six circuits of ten recitations were made, and the **Infinite Hosts of Spirits** all gathered and assembled to listen to the **Great Law**. The **multitudes of sentient beings** were universally saved and liberated.

Its **Scripture-Treasury** is stored in the **Highest Celestial Palace of the Jade Registry**, where the **Jade Resonance** is proclaimed and the **Great Dao** expounded.

The **Primordial Origin Sovereign of Heaven**, from the **Supreme Sovereign’s** foundation, dispersed **True Qi**, establishing the **Dao-Realm**. Again, during the **End of the Great Sovereign** and the **Beginning of the Middle Sovereign**, in the **Eastern Direction**, the **Celestial Palace of Communing with Spirits** was built in the **Uppermost Azure Cavern of the Primordial Origin’s Heaven**, opening the **Supreme Sovereign’s World of Ascending Flight**, spreading the **Wind of Immortal Transformation** and exhaling the **Qi of the Five-Petaled Cavern’s Divine Rope**.

In the **Southern Direction**, the **Cavern of Luminous Yang** was established, opening the **World of Yang Brilliance and Radiance**, spreading the **Wind of Crimson and Vermilion Fires** and exhaling the **Qi of the Three Heavens’ Refining Elixir Pool**.

In the **Western Direction**, the **Nine Immortals’ World of Daoic Conduct** was built, opening the **World of Vast Conduct and Yin Clouds**, spreading the **Wind of the Highest Sovereign’s Great Mist** and exhaling the **Qi of the Minor Yin’s Illuminating Flight and Immortal Transformation**.

In the **Northern Direction**, the **World of Darkly Generated Broad Spirits** was established, opening the **World of Mysterious Nurturing and Radiant Flight**, spreading the **Wind of the Uppermost Celestial Rope** and exhaling the **Qi of the True Cavern’s Radiant Flight**.

As for the **Northeast**, the **Primordial Origin’s Wood Sovereign’s Heaven**, it opened the **World of the Emerald Void and Great Song**, spreading the **Wind of the Nine Harmonized Qi** and exhaling the **Qi of the Primordial Yang’s Tremendous Birth**.

The **Pearls hung down**, the **Smoke was gathered**, and the **Law’s Outline** was perfected. The **Primordial Origin’s Dao-Body** manifested in **three hundred and sixty transformations**, radiating the **Nine-Colored Divine Light** and illuminating the **void of existence**.

From the **Primordial Origin’s One Qi**, the **Ten Thousands of Truths** were dispersed. In the **Qingyang Palace**, the **Sacred Jade Embryo** was formed. The **Three Qi** circulated, the **Wood Mother** gave birth to **Fire**, and from the **Eastern Town of Jade Clouds and Ten Thousands of Splendors**, the **World of Warm and Illuminating Clarity** emerged. The **Purple-Gold Towering Gate** appeared, resembling a **baby**, clad in **Yellow and Crimson Brocade**, with a **Golden Sash and Jade Belt**, seated in dominion over the **Three Enclosures**, as the **Lord of Ten Thousands of Phenomena**, bearing the title **Jade Sovereign of the Primordial Origin**. Its **Perfect Image** was displayed in the **Great Void**, with the **Sun, Moon, and Stars** standing in solemn attendance at its sides.

The **Scarlet Radiance of the Ultimate Yang** became the **Sun**, the **Yellow Splendor of the Pure Yin** became the **Moon**, and the **Eight Pure Essences** formed the **Stars and Celestial Hosts**, while the **Nine Primordial Chapters** became the **Divine Spirits**. It steadied the **Heaven’s Firm Axis**, dwelling above the **Three Celestial Lights**, within the **Great Primordial Heaven**, in the **Long-Lasting World of Azure Cavern and Yin Clouds**, receiving the **Primordial Origin’s Three Celestial Lights Shining with Luster** (Preserving Life and Extending Existence).

At that time, the **Heavenly True Great God**, the **Highest Sage of the Supreme**, the **True Person of Marvelous Conduct**, and the **Countless Hosts of the Unfettered** arrived, riding the **Void**.

The **Three Pure Clouds flew**, the **Eight Radiant Chariots** ascended, the **Splendid Banners and Emerald Flags** unfurled, the **Colors streamed and the Light shone forth**, the **Five Colors** flourished in abundance, the **High Void** was illuminated with brilliance, the **Spiritous Mists** dispersed into the **Void**, the **Three Celestial Lights** intermingled, the **Four Radiant Beams** shot forth, the **Marvelous Qi** formed shapes, spontaneously becoming **Dragons and Phénix**, the **Sweet Dew** drifted like **Pearls**, the **Divine Smoke** coiled like **Threads**, gentle and lingering, the **Celestial Ropes** spun in harmony, the **Sacred True Heart and Eye** shone with clarity, and the **Mountains, Rivers, Forests, and Trees** all entered in unobstructed harmony. The **Heavenly Canopy** floated in circles, the **Earth** resembled **Jade**, with no variation in hue.

The **Ranks of Immortals** surrounded and attended, while the **Primordial Origin Sovereign of Heaven** sat in **Mystic Splendor** upon the **Fire and Jade Seat of the Divine Rope’s Radiant Tiger**.

When the **Scripture** was recited **once**, the **Great Sages of All Heavens** simultaneously praised its excellence. At that time, the **Great Primordial Axis** was arrayed, the **Stars** shone in **double brilliance**, and the **Palaces and Gates** became luminous.

When the **Scripture** was recited **twice**, the **Radiant Star** ascended, illuminating the **Great Enclosure**.

When the **Scripture** was recited **three times**, the **Yellow Qi and Yang Essence** hovered in the **Heaven**, dancing in the **Void**.

When the **Scripture** was recited **four times**, the **Five Celestial Ropes** aligned with the **True Ones**, all gathering at the **Jade Gate**.

When the **Scripture** was recited **five times**, the **Sun’s Gate and Moon’s Palace** revealed **Auspicious Harmony**.

When the **Scripture** was recited **six times**, the **Spiritous Qi** descended in response, and the **people** were granted **extended years**.

When the **Scripture** was recited **seven times**, the **Scarlet Text** was seen, and all **aligned** to **refine the Supreme Model**.

When the **Scripture** was recited **eight times**, the **Recitation of the Piercing Chapter** was taken up, and the **Radiance** was **drawn to the Celestial Lights**.

When the **Scripture** was recited **nine times**, the **merit was complete and the fruit fulfilled**, and the **dark underworld** was **liberated**.

When the **Scripture** was recited **ten times**, the **Ten Thousands of Beings** were **transformed**, and the **Way of Everlasting Birth** was **forever opened**.

At that time, in the **entire realm**, whether male or female, none failed to **devote their hearts**, all receiving **protection and liberation**, and universally attaining **long life**.

**Dao speaks:** When the **Scripture** was recited **once**, the **Great God of the Infinite and Boundless Primordial Brand of the East** arrived, with the **Unfettered Hosts**, floating through the **Void**.

When the **Scripture** was recited **twice**, the **Great God of the Infinite and Boundless Primordial Brand of True Yang** arrived from the **South**, with the **Unfettered Hosts**, floating through the **Void**.

When the **Scripture** was recited **three times**, the **Great God of the Infinite and Boundless Primordial Brand of the Great Primordial** arrived from the **West**, with the **Unfettered Hosts**, floating through the **Void**.

When the **Scripture** was recited **four times**, the **Great God of the Infinite and Boundless Primordial Brand of Feathered Clarity** arrived from the **North**, with the **Unfettered Hosts**, floating through the **Void**.

When the **Scripture** was recited **five times**, the **Great God of the Infinite and Boundless Primordial Brand of the Emerald Void** arrived from the **Northeast**, with the **Unfettered Hosts**, floating through the **Void**.

When the **Scripture** was recited **six times**, the **Great God of the Infinite and Boundless Primordial Brand of the Cavern’s Portal** arrived from the **Southeast**, with the **Unfettered Hosts**, floating through the **Void**.

When the **Scripture** was recited **seven times**, the **Great God of the Infinite and Boundless Primordial Brand of Ascending Talismans** arrived from the **Southwest**, with the **Unfettered Hosts**, floating through the **Void**.

When the **Scripture** was recited **eight times**, the **Great God of the Infinite and Boundless Primordial Brand of Cleaving Falsehood** arrived from the **Northwest**, with the **Unfettered Hosts**, floating through the **Void**.

When the **Scripture** was recited **nine times**, the **Great God of the Infinite and Boundless Primordial Brand of Pure Metropolis** arrived from **Above**, with the **Unfettered Hosts**, floating through the **Void**.

When the **Scripture** was recited **ten times**, the **Great God of the Infinite and Boundless Primordial Brand of Distant Prosperity** arrived from **Below**, with the **Unfettered Hosts**, floating through the **Void**.

After the **ten recitations** were completed, the **Great Gods of the Infinite and Boundless Primordial Brand from the Ten Directions** all arrived simultaneously. The **entire realm’s men and women** devoted their hearts and bowed in reverence.

The **arriving ones** each rode upon the **Seven Radiant Clouds**, the **Three Celestial Lights’ Chariots**, and the **boundless accumulation of splendor**, beyond what could be **restrained**.

The **Way/Dao** of the **Primordial Sovereign** manifested its wondrous light, vast as the **Round Symbol** (圆象), and thus ascended.

The **Great Gods of the Infinite and Boundless Primordial Brand from the Ten Directions** (十方无极至真大神), the **Unfettered Hosts** (无鞅数众), and all **True Ones of the High Saints** (上圣高尊), **Mystic Conduct Immortals** (妙行真人), together entered the radiant light.

They expounded the **Supreme Law of the Three Celestial Lights** (三辰光辉保命延生大法), **preserving life and extending vitality**, teaching the most wondrous **dharma** first.

The **Way/Dao** is not a form or likeness; **mixed unity** (混成) gives rise to all things. **Gold and Water** congeal the **soul** (魂), the **soul** nourishes the **womb-palace** (胎宫), and light emanates from the **divine** (神). Thus, the **Supreme Sovereign of the Mystic Non-Existent** (妙无上帝) and the **Great Sovereign of the Mystic Existent** (妙有大帝), the **Great Sovereign of the Mixed Unity** (混元大帝), were established.

The **Three Sovereigns** (三帝) undergo **ten thousand transformations** (万变), spanning **nine hundred and seventy-six billion and ten thousand** (九七六亿万之数).

The **Upper Palace** (上宫) commanded the **Celestial Sovereign** (天皇大帝), the **Left Palace** (左宫) commanded the **Sun Sovereign** (太阳尊帝), the **Right Palace** (右宫) commanded the **Moon Primordial Lord** (太阴元君), and the **Central Palace** (中宫) commanded the **Purple Palace Northern Pole Great Sovereign** (紫微北极大帝).

They **oversee the Two Celestial Symbols** (二象), govern the **Five Qi** (五气), lead the **Three Celestial Lights** (三辰), and **direct the Primordial Dipper** (元斗).

With **three hundred and sixty-five degrees** (三百六十五度) and **one-fourth degree** (四分度之一), they cycle through the **sixty heavenly stems and branches** (六十甲子).

They **refine the essence of nine yang** (九阳之精) into the **Sun** (日), the **essence of ten yin** (十阴之精) into the **Moon** (月), and the **harmonized essence of the Sun and Moon** (日月之精) into the **stars and constellations** (星辰).

The **Sun** has **nine hues** (九色), the **Moon** has **ten radiant phases** (十华).
The **Sun** is called the **Round Symbol of Nine Hues** (九色圆象), the **Moon** the **Round Light of Ten Phases** (十华圆光).

They **embody the divine essence of the Great Way/Dao** (大道之神灵), hence the name **Great Unity** (太一).

The **celestial essence’s light** (天灵之光), the **Great Primordial Light of Endless Night** (太玄无夜之光), the **Great Azure Light of the Celestial Void** (太苍洞清之光), the **Green Jade and Crimson Glow’s Light** (绿璃赤景之光), the **Five-Colored Illuminating Radiance of Refined Silk** (五色濯罗耀明之光), the **White Purity and Yellow Brilliance’s Divine Radiance** (白素黄华神耀之光), the **Crimson Cloud and Vermilion Fire’s Light** (丹霞朱火之光), the **Great Purity and Jade Brilliance’s Light** (太素玉华之光), and the **Crimson Flame and Nine Mysteries’ Light** (绛炎九微之光) all shimmered within the radiance.

From the light emerged **resplendent scriptures of jade tablets and phoenix seals** (紫书琼简, 凤玺云霞), **true writings and dragon chapters** (真文龙章), with **fivefold seals** (五篇之篆) and the **eightfold qi** (八方之气) branching and curving, **hidden melodies** (隐韵) descending like a **pendant** (垂芒), forming the **Eight Trigrams** (八卦之状).

They universally **benefit all beings** (天人), **rescuing from suffering** (救脱众苦).

The **Sun’s circumference** (周径) is **one thousand li** (一千里), and it moves **one degree** (一度) daily.
The **Moon’s circumference** is also **one thousand li**, and it **evenly traverses thirteen degrees** (昼夜平行一十三度) in its cycle.

It **lags twelve degrees** (迟行十二度) and **speeds fourteen degrees** (速行十四度); when the **Sun and Moon align** (日月合), all things **generate and flourish** (万物生成).

The **stars’ sizes** range from **nine hundred li** (大九百里) to **one hundred li** (小及百里), each moving in its **proper order** (行各有次). Their **degrees of water and fire** (水火之度) cannot be **measured as a standard** (为准).

The **Three Celestial Lights’ luminous patterns** (三辰光辉) display **profound and wondrous designs** (文理垂形), while the **Eightfold Divine Scriptures** (灵书八会) and **Mystic Marvelous Chapters** (妙章玄图) reveal the **Great Primordial Void** (曲素大洞).

To **know the luminous Way/Dao** (光辉之道), one must **align with the wind, clouds, qi, and rain** (参於风云气雨), the **mysterious tides and jade nectar** (玄津玉液).

Then, **body and spirit merge in profound marvel** (形神洞妙).

To **chase the light and swallow the clouds** (奔光咽霞), to **draw the radiance and walk with the stars** (引景步星), is to become a **True Person of the Supreme Most High** (太上之真人).

The **Primordial Sovereign** (元始) manifested within the **wondrous light** (妙光).

When the **Scripture** was fully expounded, the **True Ones of the High Saints** (众真) **measured and transmitted** (监度) its teachings to me. At that moment, **joy and celebration were beyond words** (喜庆难言).

The **rituals of the Law** (法事) were **roughly complete** (粗悉).

The **hosts of all the heavens** (诸天) returned to their **proper stations** (复位), and in an instant, **silence remained without echo** (寂无遗响).

At that time, **all beings of heaven and earth** (天人) encountered the **Law of the Scripture** (经法).

They **universally received salvation and deliverance** (普得济度), **preserving their lives for the year** (全其本年) without **injury or harm** (中伤).

All **devoted their hearts and bowed in reverence** (倾土归仰), **awakening to the luminous truth** (咸悟光明).

The **divine merged with the light** (神合於光), the **qi merged with the radiance** (气合於明), **preserving life eternally** (保命不终) and **extending vitality endlessly** (延生无穷).

The **Three Celestial Lights** (三辰) reside in the heavens, while the **True Way/Dao** (真道) **penetrates the void** (冥冲).

When the **Three Celestial Lights enter the heart** (三辰入心), one **ascends in spirit** (飞举成真), and when they **illuminate the earth** (三辰照地), the **Seven Treasures** (七宝) **settle the world** (镇世).

To **weave the Way/Dao** (织其道) is to **form the bones with dragon patterns** (骨成龙文), and to **drink its light** (饮其光) is to **transform the flesh into golden hue** (肉化金色).

To **enter and exit existence and non-existence** (出入有无) is to **forever sever birth and decay** (永断生减).

To **align in compassionate love** (齐同慈爱) is to **unite in essence despite differing forms** (异骨成亲), bringing **peace and prosperity to the land** (国安民丰).

Thus, **great joy and harmony prevail** (欣乐太平).

The **Scripture’s teachings** (经始出教) spread across the land, and all who **devoted their hearts** (预有至心) to **reverence and worship** (宗奉礼敬) **obtained deliverance from the world** (皆得度世).

The **Way/Dao** states: The **Primordial Sovereign’s** (元始天尊) words in the **Scripture** are all the **inner names of the Heavenly Sovereigns** (诸天上帝内名), **hidden and veiled sounds** (隐讳之音), also the **inner taboos of the Sun and Moon** (日月内讳) and the **hidden names of the stars and constellations** (星宿之隐名), not the **common words of the world** (世之常辞).

The **Three Celestial Lights’ luminous patterns** (三辰光辉) are what **preserves life and extends vitality** (所以能保命延生者).

The **essence of the Three Lights** (三光之精) and the **divine of the True Ones** (天真之神) **descend to meet human qi** (下接人气), **merging with the divine and human essence** (神气混沦).

The **nature of light** (光性) is to **illuminate**; for humans, it is **cognition** (识).

When **cognition abides in the qi** (识在气存), the **divine does not leave its root** (神不离根), and this is called **life** (命).

**Life penetrates this essence** (命洞斯旨), and it **can be preserved and held** (可保而有).

**Life is the master of birth** (命为生主), and the **master resides in extending vitality** (主在生延).

To **extend vitality through the Way/Dao** (延生得道) is to **attain the Way’s natural marvel** (道妙自然).

The **High Saints** (上圣) thus become **True Persons** (成真人), **penetrating the Mysterious and exploring the subtle** (通玄究微).

**the group of saints crossing the Western Kunlun** (群聖度西昆).」

**The Great Compassionate Void Emperor,**
who transforms this Gate of Birth’s opening.
With the Yellow Banner summoning the Celestial Demon,
the Saints assemble in the Great Clarity.

The Six Qi intertwine and bind,
while the Ten Thousand Forms preserve life’s creation.
The Sovereign’s Pole established,
the Three Ways must flow in harmony.

The Eight Substances descend to Yu’s Remnant,
the Heavenly Folk hasten to the Five Celestial Stems.
In unison, they cultivate the True Dao of the Primordial,
ascending divine spirits to the Jade Capital.

Above the Three Celestial Stems,
within the flying void,
the Celestial True Ones chant—
their voices harmonize with the Piercing Hymns.
Recite them a hundred times,
and your name ascends to the Southern Palace.
Recite them a thousand times,
and the Celestial True Ones descend to welcome you.
Ten thousand recitations complete the Dao,
ascending to the Supreme Void,
transcending the Three Realms,
and attaining the rank of the Immortal Lord.

Those who hear the Sacred Sound—
the Demon King bows in reverence,
commanding the Earthly Spirits
to attend and escort.
He extracts the Five Torments and Eight Difficulties from the Earthly Gate,
elevates the Seven Ancestors,
forever removes them from the Ghostly Bureau,
guides their souls across the Vermilion Ridge,
and refines them into rebirth.
This is called the Boundless Salvation,
universally extending without end.

There are hidden Celestial Scriptures,
revered by all the Heavens.
To reveal them carelessly is to fall into the Hell of Arrogance,
bringing calamity upon the Seven Ancestral Uncles.
The Dao says:
These two chapters are the hidden voices of the Three Celestial Stems’ True Ones,
the words of the Great Brahman,
not the common speech of the world.
Drawing radiance and gathering brilliance,
they descend the Heavenly Light,
transmitting the Mysterious to attain Immortality—
thus called the Profound and Obscure,
difficult to trace in detail.

Treasure of the Highest Heaven,
hidden in the Eastern Vault of the Divine Xuan.
According to the ancient formula,
it must be transmitted every 37,000 years.
If a perfected adept brings gold and jade with a sincere heart,
and according to the old formula pledges to the Ten Heavens,
then it shall be bestowed.

The Dao says:
The Three Celestial Stems’ radiance is serene, unwaning.
The Heavenly Rotation completes its course—
how could it ever end?
When the Moon aligns with the Sun,
the Yin invades the Yang, obscuring its light.
When the Sun aligns with the Moon,
the Yang eclipses the Yin, dimming its brilliance.
Yet even when the Qi conceals them,
the Three Celestial Stems are never diminished—
they are the utmost essence of Heaven and Earth.
If you gather their light and brilliance,
you become a True One of the Upper Clarity,
holding the reins at the Mysterious Terrace.
Thus, the revolutions of waxing and waning,
the rise and fall of human fortunes,
even sickness and injury—
by preserving the True and absorbing the light,
massaging where the ailment lingers,
or contemplating grasping the Sun and Moon,
holding the Celestial Stems in hand,
sitting to attain the Divine,
you may preserve life and never age.

With a unified heart, observe the fasts,
offer incense at the Six Times,
turn the scriptures tenfold,
and the blessings of virtue descend,
dissipating all inauspicious omens.
The Boundless Texts universally extend salvation without end.

The Dao says:
The Three Celestial Stems’ radiance preserves life and prolongs existence.
The Nine-Colored Divine Light refines the bones and perfuses the heart.
The Yang Essence merges with the Qi,
and the Immortal Transformation unites with the Spirit.
Or, you may store the Three Manifestations in the Cinnabar Field,
illuminate the Six Palaces of the Universe,
shining through the Chamber of Perfection,
containing the brilliance and swallowing the essence,
thus ascending as a High True One.

But those of shallow Daoist practice,
whose Immortal rank is yet incomplete,
when the Yang declines and the Yin prevails,
lying in the Five Battles’ form,
their Dao should fade and depart—
at the moment of passing,
their fellow adepts shall offer incense and recite the scriptures ten times,
conducting their corpse according to the law,
so their soul and spirit may directly ascend to the Southern Palace,
and by their merit, be reborn on the appointed day.
Without hesitation in the Wheel of Rebirth,
they shall attain the Divine and Immortal.

The Dao says:
The Three Celestial Stems are the origin of the Supreme Dao,
upon which all phenomena depend for life,
and through which Saints and Immortals are perfected.
Revering their might,
one may subdue the Six Heavens,
and cause demons to vanish in form.
Drawing their light,
it pierces the remote passes,
cleansing the womb, the fetus, and the blood of the corpse,
dissolving the grudges of seven lifetimes.
Absorbing their brilliance,
your body glows with golden hue,
your face radiates jade light,
and you ascend to the Taiwei,
your spirit soaring to the Xuanxiao.
When radiance and brilliance bloom,
ten thousand blossoms condense into elixir,
the inch of space gathers treasures,
crystals fly to retrieve the soul,
controlling the Purple Court of the Celestial Stems,
floating in the Upper Clarity,
feasting in the Jade Capital.

When Heaven and Earth complete their cycle,
the stars shift their courses,
the Sun and Moon lose their eclipses,
the Four Seasons falter,
the lands suffer calamity,
martial omens appear,
plagues and poisons spread,
the common folk perish in droves,
and teachers and friends pass away—
all should observe the fasts,
offer incense, and recite the scriptures.

For fasting, abstinence, and scripture-recitation
carry immense merit.
Above, they dispel Heavenly calamities,
protecting and safeguarding the Emperor.
Below, they avert poison and harm,
salvaging the common folk.
Life and death depend upon them—
their blessings are boundless,
thus it is said: Boundless, universally salvaging Heaven and Man.

The Dao says:
All who hold this scripture with reverent faith—
the Three Celestial Stems’ radiance shall descend and illuminate your body.
It repels external misfortune,
binds your spirit within,
transports your subtle essence,
so you may behold the Celestial Spirits,
refines your soul while your corpse dissolves,
preserving life and prolonging existence.
Above, you serve as the Emperor of Heaven and Earth for the myriad folk,
performing these virtues.
On days of calamity,
with a sincere heart, observe the fasts, burn incense,
and recite the scriptures ten times—
all the Heavens shall record your name,
ten thousand spirits shall guard you,
and the Right Separate Adepts
shall make you a minister of the Golden Gate for the Holy Sovereign.

The Heavens record every deed and transgression without omission.
Even the Demon Kings of the Celestial Realm
shall recommend your name.
Only those who attain the Dao
shall truly comprehend these profound words.

**Southern Eight Heavens**
The luminous soul shines with radiant clarity,
Mountains of mud communicate with spirits.
Jade peaks of the Chou constellation glow,
The Master of Illusions reveals the Crimson Lotus.
The Southern Marsh veils in mist,
The boundless fields of the Dark River stretch endlessly.
The Evil Tooth Monastery stands firm,
The Circle of Heaven’s mechanisms is sealed by the Floating Lotus.
The Demon King’s power fades into the void,
As intent harmonizes with the heart.
No fall nor delay—
All things gather in the distant smoke.
The Brahman’s luminous origin,
The Dharma’s ease, the Path’s clarity.

**Western Eight Heavens**
The Jade Rock of Yama’s Realm,
Where the Preceptor and the Scholar oversee.
The Mirror of the Void reveals itself,
Plowing the evening’s fervent heat.
The Northern Mist clears the celestial pole,
The Great Dipper’s virtue is held in reverence.
The aged Hua returns to its roots,
The Departments of Discrimination drift upon the waves.
The Purple Peaks stand in solemn debate,
Their fragrance pure and distant.

The Pool’s performance as the waters surge.
In the silent grove, the treasures hide,
The Imperial Ancestors’ souls linger near.
The Foundry of Vision opens to the capital,
The Chen Clan’s lowly descendants rise.
**Northern Eight Heavens**
The Dark Grace’s schemes unfold,
The Pure Pearl’s brilliance cleanses the Pass.
The Zheng and the Xie, the Witch of the Marsh,

The Thin Goodness hastens its tribute,
The Wen River’s depths expand.
The Zhou Alliance’s革镠 shines,
The Peak of the Ridge is inscribed with fate.
Transformation’s praise echoes in the void,
The Dark Temple’s rites are refined.
The Spirit’s essence governs the capital,
The Seasons’ harmony blooms with peach blossoms.
The Treasure of the Wan is distinguished,
The distant Preta’s name is recorded.

**The Dao Speaks:**
These are the Great Brahman’s Hidden Words within the Heavens,
Sounds without measure, summoning the Three Celestial Stems’ radiance,
Drawing the True *qi* of the Nine Heavens.
With pure chanting and jade oblation,
The Celestial Worthies descend to welcome.

The ancient scriptures naturally emit Brahmanic *qi*,
Born within the Three Celestial Stems’ palaces,
To govern the great and small calamities of the Three Realms—
The shifts of water and fire.
The Celestial Worthies carve their names upon the Sun, Moon,
And the Great Stars of the Hosts.
Next, they avert disasters and blockings,
Severing misfortune and stagnation,
Enhancing life’s momentum and virtue.

Those who recognize this scripture
Command the ghosts and gods,
Enlist the Six Ding,
Preserve life and prolong existence,
Transmitting the spirit through the void.

The characters are square, a *zhang* in breadth,
With eight angles.
Worn as an amulet or inscribed on silk,
Bound with crimson cords and jade tablets for recording names.

Those who know its sound
And recite it with fasting devotion—
All the Heavens dispatch flying celestial kings
To observe their bodies,
Recording their merits and labor,
Reporting upward to the Heavens.
Ten thousand spirits pay homage,
The Earthly Deities guard the gates,
The Great Demon Kings recommend the Perfected Ones,
And those who attain the Dao
Shall wander the Three Realms,
Ascending to the Golden Gate.

This sound repels all,
Averts all,
Transcends all,
Accomplishes all—
The natural sound of the Celestial Worthies.

Thus, when recited,
The Three Celestial Stems descend with light,
The Nine Clouds gather the *qi*,
Refining mortal bones into the Dao.
Ancestors ascend as Immortals,
Golden flowers bloom upon the crown,
Jade-like complexions shine in unison,
Lifespans equal the radiant round.
Attaining the Dao naturally,
They fly below the Heavens,
The Sovereign of Heaven sings from afar,
Ten thousand spirits bow in reverence,
The Three Realms serve at the hall,
All deities prostrate in submission,
Ghostly spirits vanish in terror,
The chimes of the Linglang resound,
The Ten Directions stand in solemn stillness,
Rivers and seas fall silent,
Mountains swallow the smoke,
All living beings tremble in awe,
Summoning the gathered Immortals.

The Heavens know no filth,
The Earth no demonic dust,
The Dark and the Wise are perfectly clear—
The boundless, the boundless.

**The Supreme Scripture of the Soul’s Treasure for Transcending Mortality, Volume Twenty-Eight Complete**
**Volume Twenty-Nine**

**The Chapter on Descending Truth and Extending Lifespan**

The Dao speaks: *"In the beginning, within the Azure Sky, the vast floating land of the Spacious Void sang the Great Scripture of the Primordial One. The Primordial Venerable One, when expounding this scripture, circled ten times, summoning the Ten Directions, before taking His seat. The Heavenly True Gods, the Highest Saints, the Mystic True Persons—those who descend truth and extend lifespan—along with the Blessed Kings of Virtue, the Openers of Destiny, the Lords of Fixed Birth, the Protectors of Human Spirits, and the countless innumerable True Gods of the Ten Directions, all arrived, riding the void.*

*They controlled the Azure Purple of the Celestial Poles, soared upon the gusts of the Spacious Void, presented the Danxia wheels in crimson mists, and encircled their chariots with verdant scenery. Celestial canopies bore auspicious omens, divine parasols emitted fragrant incense, and divine light blazed in crimson hues. The Six Qi harmonized and accumulated, while the void and the Dharma-realm stood empty.*

*For seven days and seven nights, the Great Saints and High True Ones of the heavens manifested in their domains, their palaces and watchtowers gleaming with radiant brilliance. The Dharma drums and celestial melodies resounded naturally, their rhythms pure and clear, filling ten thousand caves and a thousand valleys. Divine winds swayed, the sun and moon ascended in splendor, their paired luminaries piercing the Nine Heavens. The Star Consorts climbed the celestial cords, their forms unrestrained, while the Jade Emperor established the eternal order, gathering the qi. The Ten Directions shone brightly, the Three Realms bathed in purity, and every mountain, river, forest, and tree within the land—every stream, gorge, cavern, and sea—glowed with golden radiance. Each had its True Immortals, standing in proper reverence, their caps and robes beneath them, gazing afar with distant awe, as if awaiting an appointed time.*

*The divine gateways and lofty towers rose majestically, their emerald peaks towering like dark brows. Heavenly flowers rained down, and brocade silk draped the surroundings. The gathered True Ones attended at His seat, while the Primordial Venerable One sat in seclusion atop the Jade Palace of Ten Treasures, where the Dragon of Pearls and the Soaring Dragon hovered.*

*When the scripture was expounded once, the Heavenly True Gods of the Ten Directions descended in joyous voices, simultaneously praising its virtue, declaring its worth for all who seek the Dao, and extending lifespans. At that time, all men and women within the land possessed the Six Perfections, their transformations natural.*

*When the scripture was expounded twice, the True Thoughts resonated, and the Heavenly Sovereign descended in grace.*

*When the scripture was expounded thrice, the boundless sea stilled its waves, and the Dragon Palaces shone forth in clarity.*

*When the scripture was expounded four times, celestial frost descended in indigo, and the earth bore purple mulberries, offering reverence to the descending truth.*

*When the scripture was expounded five times, all karmic illnesses and demonic afflictions within the Dao’s structures dissolved, and all attained mystical penetration, their divine wisdom awakening.*

*When the scripture was expounded six times, they permanently dwelled in the Dao and the Dharma-realm, no longer subject to retribution’s end before falling away.*

*When the scripture was expounded seven times, they could summon heart-incense across all Immortal Realms, welcoming the descent of the Ten-Direction Three-Realm Heavenly Sovereigns to extend lifespans and deliver beings.*

*When the scripture was expounded eight times, in still observation of the Three Realms, all myriad beings were seen as Heavenly Immortals and High True Ones, manifesting in transformed bodies to perform deeds and protect the land, descending to request the True Spirits, extending lifespans, and delivering beings.*

*When the scripture was expounded nine times, the wondrous altars of the Cloud Forests appeared, each inhabited by the Supreme True Ones, descending in person to teach and extend lifespans for all.*

*When the scripture was expounded ten times, the joyous praises and reverences were without precedent. The Primordial Heavenly Sovereign Himself proclaimed the essential Dharma-teachings, for the sake of all sentient beings, descending truth and extending lifespans.*

*At that time, all men and women within the land inclined their hearts in devotion, receiving protection and all attaining longevity.*

*The Dao speaks: When the scripture was expounded once, the Eastern True Gods of Supreme Truth—those who descend truth and extend lifespans—innumerable in their hosts, arrived floating upon the void. When the scripture was expounded twice, the Southern True Gods of Supreme Truth—those who descend truth and extend lifespans—innumerable in their hosts, arrived floating upon the void. When the scripture was expounded thrice, the Western True Gods of Supreme Truth—those who descend truth and extend lifespans—innumerable in their hosts, arrived floating upon the void. When the scripture was expounded four times, the Northern True Gods of Supreme Truth—those who descend truth and extend lifespans—innumerable in their hosts, arrived floating upon the void. When the scripture was expounded five times, the Northeast True Gods of Supreme Truth—those who descend truth and extend lifespans—innumerable in their hosts, arrived floating upon the void. When the scripture was expounded six times, the Southeast True Gods of Supreme Truth—those who descend truth and extend lifespans—innumerable in their hosts, arrived floating upon the void. When the scripture was expounded seven times, the Southwest True Gods of Supreme Truth—those who descend truth and extend lifespans—innumerable in their hosts, arrived floating upon the void. When the scripture was expounded eight times, the Northwest True Gods of Supreme Truth—those who descend truth and extend lifespans—innumerable in their hosts, arrived floating upon the void. When the scripture was expounded nine times, the Upper True Gods of Supreme Truth—those who descend truth and extend lifespans—innumerable in their hosts, arrived floating upon the void. When the scripture was expounded ten times, the Lower True Gods of Supreme Truth—those who descend truth and extend lifespans—innumerable in their hosts, arrived floating upon the void.*

*When the tenfold circuit was complete, the True Gods of Supreme Truth from the Ten Directions—those who descend truth and extend lifespans—all arrived together at once. All men and women within the land inclined their hearts in reverence.*

*Those who came each bore flower banners and treasured robes, rare fruits, fragrant groves, and wondrous offerings, chanting praises as they approached to pay homage to the Primordial Venerable One, wishing to hear the descending truth and the extension of lifespans for all.*

*The Upper Pure Ten-Direction Heavenly Beings, the Supreme True Gods, and all men and women within the land each reflected upon the Heavenly Sovereign’s great compassion, how He illuminated their darkness, revealed the essential Dharma-teachings, and proclaimed the Dao’s principles for the sake of lower beings, requesting the descent of the Supreme True Ones to prolong lifespans.*

*Though we heavenly beings have ascended through Daoic merit to our celestial ranks, even the Southern Palace’s Upper Realm is still bound by fate’s limits. Though our lifespans may endure for hundreds, thousands, or millions of years, we have not yet transcended the Three Realms, preserved our heavenly existence, or entered the formless—free from the cycle of birth and death.*

*Now we joyfully hear the Heavenly Sovereign, as the First of the Highest Dao-Lords, expounding the supreme teachings for delivering beings, descending to awaken the True Spirits, and extending human lifespans. We, who have attained the celestial ranks, should rejoice in believing this Dharma, practice according to its teachings, and ascend to the Sacred Way, never again turning in the wheel of existence.*

*Thus they praised and declared, their voices filling the Ten-Direction Realms, like hidden thunder and gusting rains, the clash of metal and stone shaking the Five Peaks, the Eight Seas, and the Twelve Divine Mountains. Mists congealed, waves surged, lions paced in solemn tread, phoenixes and cranes cried in song, dragon pools and misty marshes swirled in undulating clouds. The Spacious Void bore auspicious signs, and the Emerald Capital radiated light."*

Thus, the Primordial Beginning immediately rose from his seat, commanding the attendants—True Spirit Consort, Supreme Polarity Jade Consort, the Boundless Longevity Heavenly Lord of the Lanwei Thousandfold Harmony, and the fragrant incense of the Eightfold Auspicious Blossoms—to stir the sacred teachings with rhythmic sounds. The flutes and pipes played in harmony, the calabash and bamboo pipes were passed in turn, gazing upon the Ten-Direction Realms. He proclaimed to the Supreme Dao-Lord and all beings of the Ten Directions:

*"The Law of Descending Truth and Extending Lifespans has already been attained by those in the Sacred Rank—truly, the True contains the True. This True Master encompasses all Truths, serving as the Transformative Sovereign of the Three Realms. Now, I offer incense and prostrate myself to invite the Descending Truth."*

Once the Truth descended, it merged with the divine *qi* and True Spirit, the True Spirit returning to its form, and lifespans eternally extended. The extended lifespan is the harmonious manifestation of Heavenly Virtue. Dao-Longevity is boundless, Heavenly Lifespan has its limit, human lifespan is uncertain, and Earthly Lifespan has an end. Yet if one can invite the Descending Truth, the Truth communicates with the Dao, and lifespan becomes boundless—this is the so-called Eternal Life, Everlasting Vision, and Infinite Agelessness of ten thousand years!

With joyful laughter and eternal bliss, he spoke thus and bowed his head to the Ten Directions, his heart reverently worshipping the Dao-Source.

Suddenly, within the Spacious Void, radiance overflowed in every direction. Jade-like palaces drifted in the celestial halls, and the lofty, verdant platforms of the Divine Court resounded with the presence of myriad Saints and thousandfold Truths, moving amidst clouds and mists, riding dragons and tigers, their distant forms visible like brushstrokes, their brilliance surpassing the sun’s wheel. The golden *qi* of the adamantine essence encircled the sacred center, manifesting in twenty-four extraordinary, unparalleled hues—appearing and vanishing in splendor and obscurity, their emerald and azure hues dazzling, their clarity rivaling the moon’s pearls.

The Primordial Beginning then summoned the Great Heavenly Truths: the Supreme Sage and High Exalted One, the Marvelous Conducted True Person, and the Descending Truths of the Ten Directions, all entering the drifting palaces. The beings of the upper and lower heavens looked on in awe, seeing only a gentle breeze wafting from the Jade Terrace and the Celestial Gate, eightfold paths leading inward. Once inside the drifting palaces, their presence was unknown.

The land’s people scattered, the earthly clouds softening like a tread upon cotton. Heaven showered myriad flowers, their colors filling the measure, their petals burying wheels and shoes. Fragrant winds purified the void, crimson light flowing in motion. Within the Divine Hall, the Primordial Beginning expounded the scriptures to completion, and the gathered Truths supervised the transmission, bestowing it upon me. At that moment, my joy was indescribable.

The ritual rites were now fully known. The beings of the heavens returned to their ranks, and in an instant, silence remained without trace.

At that time, all heavenly beings encountered the scriptures and teachings, universally receiving deliverance and extending their lifespans without interruption. The land submitted in reverence, all acknowledging the Dao-Truth, extending life, spirit, *qi*, essence, teachings, and form—extending breath, transformation, blessings, and auspiciousness. Their words held no deceit, their voices no falsehood, their hearts united in compassion, their bones, though different, bound in kinship.

The realm was at peace, its people prosperous, with eternal tranquility throughout the *kalpas*. The scriptures first emerged with the teachings, and the nation was governed by the Dao. Those who earnestly sought the scriptures, inviting the Descending Truth and extending lifespans, all attained deliverance for the world.

The Dao-Speech declares: *"The names spoken in the scriptures by the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Lord are the hidden titles of the heavenly beings’ Descending Truths, the secret sounds of extending lifespans, and the concealed names of the hundred spirits. These are not the common words of the world. The Supreme Sage, having already become a True Person, penetrates the Mysterious and fathoms the subtle, comprehending all its chapters.*

*If one recites this chapter ten times, the Jade Purity descends its Truth, and the Divine Expanse commands its Spirits. The Heavenly Emperor recites it to extend the *kalpa*, the True Person recites it to extend the spirit, the Supreme Sage recites it to extend the Dao, and the Immortal recites it to extend their era. The heavens descend from afar, and the Ten Radiant Ones bow at the courtyard. The rivers and seas become clear and serene, the mountains and valleys solidified in stillness. The sun and moon align their brilliance, the Grand Harmony vanishes into purity. Demons bind their forms, and ghostly essences are extinguished. Corpses rise from decay, white bones reform as flesh. Those who study deeply, reciting it ten times, will have the Five Emperors halt their chariots, the Three Officials attend as guests. The Highest Truths will welcome their rites, and the Spirit-Persons will open their gates. Demon-essences will flee into hiding, and ghostly spirits will submit their forms. They will heal the sick and deliver the dead, severing death to attain rebirth.*

*Thus is the power of this chapter: for scholars, their earthly *qi* already dissipated, their spirits descending into Truth, commanding the Ten Directions, extending lifespans of a thousand years, governing the earthly officials, and ordering the watery spirits. They will cut away the dark and simple, the names of the past, extending their term and averting death. The Dao is complete for eternal life.*

*If one recites this lightly, calamity will befall them. Offering reverent worship, their households will flourish eternally, their blessings everlasting, no disasters approaching, and divine spirits guarding their gates.*

*This scripture is supremely noble and unique, surpassing all others in the Jade Capital, delivering countless beings, and serving as the core of Descending Truth and Longevity. Its vast and lofty scope, its virtue beyond measure.*

*The Dao-Speech declares: *‘For those who recite this scripture ten times, all the heavens will gather. The Lords of Fate and Record will extend their lifespans, and the Great God of the Southern Blossom will descend the Truth for them. The purple clouds will rise, the celestial canopy will lower, and their names will be inscribed, their lifespans recorded in the celestial registers, extending without end. The Five Great Ghosts, bringing calamity, will be bound in litigation by the Primordial Hour—none shall dare offend those who invite the Descending Truth.*

*Those who love and study this scripture deeply, their merits fulfilled and virtues attained, will all become Immortals, ascending to the golden gates and feasting in the Jade Capital. The scholars of the highest learning, who recite this scripture and invite the heavenly Truths, will immediately receive deliverance and ascend to the Nine Palaces.*

*Mortal beings who recite it will awaken the divine Spirits, extending their lifespans and years. Later, they will all attain the Way of Corporeal Dissolution, where spirit and *qi* transform their forms, entering and exiting the shadowy and dark realms, returning to the hidden treasures of heaven, and penetrating the formless void.*

*This scripture is subtle and profound, universally delivering without limit. All heavenly beings and mortals cannot but rejoice in receiving its blessings. Its boundless merit extends life and safeguards happiness—it is a treasure of the heavens, not transmitted to the lower world.*

*Only the virtuous scholar, bearing golden treasures and offering sincere devotion, can swear an oath to heaven and pass it down. If one reveals or belittles this lightly, calamity will fall upon the Nine Ancestors, eternal servitude in the Ghostly Offices. The Descending Truths—Longevity Youths and Jade Maidens, each twenty-eight in number—will guard the sacred texts, attending and protecting those who receive the scripture."*

The Dao speaks: In the first month, observe a long fast and recite this scripture to invoke the descent of the Eastern Nine-*qi* Green Emperor, who will sever the bonds of ghostly servitude and summons, granting longevity and entry into the Green Emperor’s Palace. In the seventh month, observe a long fast and recite this scripture to invoke the descent of the Western Seven-*qi* Great Primordial Sovereign, who will sever calamities and injuries, dispel lingering illnesses, and grant immortality—engrave the text on yellow talismans and white tablets, cutting off death and ensuring rebirth.

In the tenth month, observe a long fast and recite this scripture to invoke the descent of the Northern Five-*qi* Mystic Elder Sovereign, who will sever water taboos, tomb disputes, and penal judgments, dispel wind-dampness and malevolent influences, and summon ancestral souls. For kings, emperors, and their ministers and children, this grants longevity, eternal preservation, and unbroken rule, securing peace for their lands.

On the eight seasonal nodes, recite this scripture to invoke the descent of the Eight Scenic High Saints and the Supreme Elder, who will sever ghostly afflictions, poisons, and the thirty-six chronic ailments, allowing escape from wild paths and the Five-*you* calamities, granting longevity and the rank of Nine-Palace True Person.

On one’s birth day, recite this scripture to invoke the descent of the Six-*jia* Spirit Consorts and the Three Sovereigns of the Dao, who will sever the year’s fatal influences, malevolent deities, and all harm, ensuring the practitioner’s spirit remains pure and eternal. Free from suffering, the body radiates light, attended by the Three Realms’ guardians, the Five Emperors’ escorts, and the homage of ten thousand spirits. Their name ascends to heaven, merits fulfilled, and they ascend to the Upper Purity.

The Dao speaks: On days of practice, one must bathe in fragrant water, fast in seclusion, facing east, and strike the teeth twenty-eight times to awaken the Twenty-Eight Heavens. Bowing inwardly twenty-eight times, close the eyes and meditate upon sitting within the three-colored clouds—green, yellow, and white—while inner and outer darkness enfolds. There appear the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Tortoise, Lion, and White Crane arrayed on either side, with the sun and moon illuminating the chamber. A luminous halo forms at the nape, casting light in all directions, vivid and clear.

The secret incantation:
*"Supreme Mystic Origin, Supreme Dao Sovereign, summon forth from my body the Three Five Functionaries, left and right officials and messengers, the fragrant jade youths attending, the speaking jade maidens, the Five Emperors’ direct seals, and the direct-day incense officials—each thirty-six in number—to open the way for my words.*

*Today is a day of auspicious celebration, a long fast in the pure hall, practicing this wondrous scripture to deliver countless beings.*

*May my petition reach the heights, ascending directly before the Supreme Thirty-Two Heavens’ Elemental Emperor of the Most High.*

*Conclude by drawing the qi twenty-eight times, facing east and reciting the scripture.*

**The Supreme Origin’s Scripture of Boundless Deliverance, Supreme Purity**

**The Supreme Mystic’s Hidden Treasure Chapter, Descending Truths of Longevity and Subtle Spirit**

Tenfold deliverance of beings.

The hidden melodies of the heavens, merging and parting naturally, boundless and formless, void and obscure.

Before primordial *qi* arose, who could know its truth?

The truth dwells in the boundless void, the master of transformation, unchanging and immutable, neither destroyed nor formed—its body as indestructible as gold, its essence the true void.

The truth governs fate, recording all souls.
The truth is the Heavenly Venerable, propagating the teachings and preserving the scriptures.
The truth is the Precious Sovereign, bestowing fortune and prosperity upon the people.
The truth grants longevity, nurturing the world’s affections.
The truth refines destiny, arranging the patterns of life and death.

Thus, the Heavenly Truth is the god of the void, the essence of darkness, the true Dao.

As one calls upon it, pearl carriages and phoenix palanquins arise, their banners nine-hued, their bodies clad in golden green, riding the *qi* and clouds, with myriad officials and soldiers. They prolong life and record names for rebirth.

Above, there is no ancestral return—only the Dao as one’s body.

To invoke the Heavenly Truth is to see one’s lifespan extended daily.

Passing through the Nine Sixes, one’s *qi* and spirit become divine and responsive.

Without the truth, there is no light, no clarity, no establishment, no completion, no deliverance, no birth. This is the Great Brahman, the truth within truth.

In the Azure Void’s net, the Golden Gate’s jade city,
At the summit of divine winds, the layered purple court.

The truth’s origin is neither form nor absence—
As if it exists, as if it does not.

Within the Great Constellation’s jade palace lies the supreme truth.
The Great Dao’s *qi* circulates the ten directions,
Housing the god of undying deliverance,
The Southern Pole’s Eternal Sovereign,
The World-Delivering Marshal God,
The Benevolent Life-Nurturing Elder,
And the Southern Ascendant’s Fate-Recording, Longevity-Granting, Calamity-Averting Sovereign God.

Descending truths and boundless deliverance.

Today’s recording summons the heavens’ assembly.
The Eastern Boundless Descending Truths and Longevity Gods, the Eternal Saints of Boundless Deliverance.
The Southern Boundless Descending Truths and Longevity Gods, the Eternal Saints of Boundless Deliverance.
The Western Boundless Descending Truths and Longevity Gods, the Eternal Saints of Boundless Deliverance.
The Northern Boundless Descending Truths and Longevity Gods, the Eternal Saints of Boundless Deliverance.
The Northeast Boundless Descending Truths and Longevity Lords, the Eternal Saints of Boundless Deliverance.
The Southeast Boundless Descending Truths and Longevity Gods, the Eternal Saints of Boundless Deliverance.
The Southwest Boundless Descending Truths and Longevity Gods, the Eternal Saints of Boundless Deliverance.
The Northwest Boundless Descending Truths and Longevity Gods, the Eternal Saints of Boundless Deliverance.
The Upper Boundless Descending Truths and Longevity Gods, the Eternal Saints of Boundless Deliverance.
The Lower Boundless Descending Truths and Longevity Gods, the Eternal Saints of Boundless Deliverance.
The Ten-Directional Descending Truths and Longevity Virtue Gods, the Eternal World-Delivering Great Gods,

All riding the Azure Cloud’s jade palanquin, the pearl-canopied vermilion wheels, harnessed by divine tigers and crimson-scaled flying dragons, bearing the Nine-Light banners and the Eight Scenic holy flags. Before them, the Heavenly Keys resound in chorus; behind them, celestial melodies harmonize. The demon-banishing spotted *qiulong* roar in lament, while the Five Marshals clear the path, the Three Realms attend the chariot—myriad hosts and ten thousand cavalry descend from the void, responding to sincerity and descending in grace to grant longevity and deliver life.

The Celestial Chancellors, the Southern Palace of Nánchāng, Lord Hàn the Chief Registrar, the Supervising Birth Great Gods—holding sacred talismans and celestial registers, all assembled before the Sovereign.

As needed for deliverance, they solemnly inspect the ranks of the heavens.
They universally proclaim to the Three Realms the Boundless Divine Realm,
the Bureau of Fate, the Palace of Longevity and Augmented Destiny,
the Descending Truth Great Gods, the Twenty-Eight Constellations,
and the Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper.

They resolve ancestral debts, a billion-kāla kindred bonds,
swiftly removing sins and calamities, sowing and nurturing life’s roots.
The High True Ones descend in response, opening the gates of deliverance.
The Primordial Talismans and Mandates ascend in rank at the appointed hour.

The Great Lord of Longevity protects form and spirit,
subduing demons and safeguarding ascent, granting longevity in the Southern Palace.
Qi and bones receive the Dao; virtue and power manifest as the embodied Self.

The living body is delivered; through eon after eon, it endures.
With the eon-wheel turning, it aligns with Heaven’s years.
It eternally delivers the Three Officials, Five Peaks,
the Eight Hells, and Nine Abysses,
transcending the Three Realms, wandering freely in Upper Clarity.

**The Heaven of Upper Clarity**, the Heavenly Sovereign of Jade Purity,
the realm of formless *dharma* and ascetic practice.

**The Seven Eastern Heavens**
The *Língshū* of True Descent’s *qi* arises beneath the Azure Canopy and Dipper’s Pivot,
circling above the Twenty-Eight Constellations,
dwelling at the 27th degree left of the *Fáng* Constellation,
piercing the Four Kinds of Human-Heavens,
descending above the Sun and Moon,
dispersing into the heavens.
Having thus bound its course, it returns to its station in the northwest.

In the present age, it governs the Endless Gate’s left and right,
descending as fate decrees, interfacing with wind-*qi*,
thus enabling the True Ones to respond—
this is the mechanism by which omens manifest.

The Twenty-Eight Heavens, the Twenty-Eight Sovereigns.
The heavens’ hidden names, the heavens’ concealed titles.
The void within the heavens, the natural numinous diagrams.
The heavens’ hidden melodies, the sounds within the heavens.
The heavens’ supreme, the heavens’ gods, the heavens’ True Ones, the heavens’ spirits.

Divine essences descend, harmonizing in *yīnyún* mist.
The exalted True Gods descend to Upper Clarity.
The boundless mysteries are profound, beyond measure.
Those who know the descending Truths grant longevity and deliverance.

Today, rejoicing in reception of deliverance,
passing through the heavenly gates,
inscribing sincerity for passage,
piercing the depths of the arcane,
flying to the Nine True Ones,
soaring through the Great Mysteries,
the Three True Ones overseeing,
ascending into the Celestial Gate.

The Eastern Dipper records destiny,
the Western Dipper records names,
the Northern Dipper marks death,
the Southern Dipper marks birth,
the Central Dipper’s Great Arc—
the deliverance of the True Ones descending.

The Green Sovereign presents the decrees,
the White Sovereign breaks the contracts,
the Red Sovereign reveals the texts,
the Black Sovereign records the vows,
the Yellow Sovereign opens the way—
the Dao-True Ones merge in transformation.

The Green Heaven’s Command Gods traverse the Nine Mysteries.
The Red Heaven’s Fire Bells decapitate demonic souls.
The White Heaven wields spears, arrayed by imperial edict.
The Black Heaven commands ten thousand divine soldiers.
The Yellow Heaven disperses *qi*, the True Ones assembled in ranks.
The Five Heavenly True Ones, the ten thousand gods’ sovereigns,
soaring through the Three Realms, commanding thunder and lightning.
Brandishing banners, hurling fire—
the Nine Evils flee in terror.
The descending Truths grant longevity,
virtue and power ensure prosperity.
The demonic blades are crushed,
the heavens’ functions unified.
The Celestial Sovereign delivers beings,
sweeping away the Northern *Tíng*.
The Nether Officials’ ghostly courts—
killing *qi* fills the void.

Gazing upward, the High True Ones descend,
the Five Peaks lush and verdant.
The Eight Seas refine purity,
the Six Heavens merge in harmony.
The Heavenly Sovereign inspects the registers,
the Senior Ministers confer titles.
The Purple Emperor decrees longevity,
a billion kālas aligned in termination.
The rear ranks drive the Thunder Officials,
the vanguard urges the Dragon Couriers.
Dare any obstruct—
they block the ascent of the High True Ones.
Galloping through the Vermilion Chambers,
dancing wheels in the Northern Pure—
the True Ones descend with jade talismans,
transforming infantile substance.
Ascending with the Sovereign’s companions,
their ranks inscribed in cinnabar and jade.
Shaking luminous light, boundless azure paths,
central ranks of the Nine Palaces,
harmonizing with the Celestial Capital.
Nurturing life-*qi* anew,
spiritual mechanisms internally cultivated.
Flickering transformations,
personally interfacing with the Dao-True.

The Bureau of Fate holds the brush,
the Sovereign Lords impart the scriptures.
Longevity unbounded, all gods attend.
The Three Realms’ Five Sovereigns
proclaim the decrees of Upper Clarity.
The Great Light descends in silence,
a million kālas illuminated.
Vast yet intangible—
*mixed qi* resolves into void.
The void lacks form, the void lacks depth.
The void’s extreme births wind,
wind descends as dew.
Wind and dew permeate the emptiness—
the heaven within the heavens.
The heaven’s gods—
the gods are the heaven’s True Ones.
Descending *qi* activates the spirit,
heaven and earth thus perfected.
The Three Realms thereby established,
ten thousand phenomena contained.

The heavens above and below—
no depths, no darkness,
no form, no shadow,
no limit, no end.

The boundless Great Brahman,
vast and lightless.
Divine and True Ones spread their transformations,
moving by natural measure.

The Primordial Origin takes its seat,
lotus petals unfurling into scripture.
Nine-Heaven tiger seals,
Eight-Awe dragon scriptures.

Nurturing the enlightened ones,
descending the True Ones from above.
The True Dao flows abroad,
ten thousand patterns unfold.
True Light pierces through—
the Twenty-Eight Heavens.

The Celestial Wheel turns at its pivot,
revolving the Ten Directions.
The Southern Dipper circles the Enclosure,
returning to the Heaven’s apex.

Twenty-Eight Lodges,
gathering *qi* at the Northern Primordial.
Radiance merges in darkness,
True Scenes communicate with the Mysterious.
Within the Mysterious—
the Supreme Sovereign,
the Highest True One of Heaven.

The Celestial Vessel drifts through the sky,
arriving at the Imperial Court.
Stroking the *bi* and stirring sound,
resonating through the Cloud Camp.
Fluttering feathered banners,
the assembled saints and guests.

Recording fate’s decrees in jade calendars,
extending life and guiding birth.
*Qi* complete, spirit perfected—
naturally becoming True.
Within the True lies spirit,
the Eternal Great Lord.

The Left Divine Prince,
the Radiant Flower Venerable God.
The Emperor’s First Minister,
the Divine Mother, the Assistant Marshal.

Seated in solemn grandeur within the Three Palaces,
preserving life and rooting vitality.
True *qi* descends, connecting,
daily increasing lifespan.

Ascending to Upper Clarity,
resting in the Golden Chamber,
within the Nine Curves, the subtlest depths.
Descending to govern the human form,
the Vermilion Palace of the Cinnabar Field,
centralizing Dao-void,
mixed and boundless—spirit and True.

Nine orifices receive essence,
ten thousand *qi* harmonized with the Immortal.
The Immortal Dao values life,
endlessly guiding beings.

Entering and exiting the Heavenly Gate,
descending in the carriage with the girdle and headcloth.
Inspecting the mortal world,
judging guilt and virtue, prohibitions and precepts.
Past lives and karmic ties—
universally receiving enlightenment and liberation,
from ghostly substance to born form.

The form receives rebirth,
hearing the heavens above,
above the heavens—
the descent of the True Ones has its gate,
within which are verses of void and boundless song,
the Three True Sacred Scriptures,
words attuned to the Highest True.

---
**First: The Uppermost Pure Upper True Golden Illumination Great Emperor of the Three Flowers**
The Jade Capital vast and boundless,
the Mysterious Marsh—what lies beyond?
Cloud layers rise in grandeur,
stars concealed in the pestle-mortar.

Descending their gods,
the Pure and Harmonious spring.
Sprouts stretch forth naturally,
the True Dao thus revealed.

**Second: The Uppermost Clarity Upper True Divine Illumination Great Emperor of the Nine Flowers**
I ride the Eight Winds,
wings rustling—dragon in flight.
Descending to observe the mortal world,
my gaze green and clear.
Who dares approach my divine palace?
Wheeling past at night,
favor and blessings descend.

**Third: The Supreme Clarity Upper True Jade Illumination Spirit Great Emperor of the Ten Flowers**
Lifespan decreed by Heaven’s records,
I hold its measure.
Descending True Ones chant in mist,
the phoenix halts at the flowing pavilion.
Jade maidens pour fragrant offerings,
granting commands for ten thousand years.
You do not yet know the True—
the Dao departs from your body.

---
These are the songs of the Three True Ones above the Three Realms,
in the flying void,
their melodies attuned to the Sacred Verses.
Reciting them a hundred times
confers enlightenment in the Southern Palace.
A thousand recitations—
the Three True Ones preserve and welcome.
Ten thousand recitations—
the Dao is complete,
ascending to the Great Void,
transcending the Three Realms,
ranking as an Immortal Official.

Those who hear the Sacred Sounds
have their names recorded by the Heavenly True Ones.
By imperial decree, earthly spirits
attend as escorts and guides,
pulled from the earthly gate,
free from the Five Sufferings and Eight Hardships,
the Seven Ancestors ascending—
forever parted from the Ghostly Bureau.
The True Ones descend to the hall,
lifespan exhausted yet reborn anew.

This is called boundless—
endlessly guiding without end.

There are secret celestial texts,
revered by all the heavens.
Revealing arrogance sends one to hell,
disaster befalling the Seven Ancestral Uncles.

The Dao speaks:
These Sacred Verses are the words of the Heavenly Sovereigns,
the Hidden Kings of Spirits and True Ones,
all the speech of the Great Brahman.
Not the common phrases of the world.
Without melodic grace,
without ornate curves—
thus called profound and elusive,
difficult to trace or examine.

Treasured by the heavens above,
secreted in the Mysterious Capital’s Purple Micro Palace,
according to the Mysterious Science,
transmitted once every forty thousand *kalpas*.

If a perfected one brings gold and jewels with sincere devotion,
following the ancient rites and pledging to the Ten Heavens,
then it shall be granted.

The Dao speaks:
Water and fire clash and surge,
the two cycles of decline and termination.
The stars’ stations and transits
also wax and wane.
Even the most sacred gods and spirits
may have departures and retreats.
The unenlightened may fall ill or be injured.

For all who suffer such calamities,
those of like *qi* must likewise employ this method of降真 (descending the True Ones) and延寿 (prolonging life),
in sacred mountains and holy waters,
beside the eastern currents of great forests,
within pure halls and tranquil pavilions—
establishing altars and ritual grounds,
offering incense and flowers in reverent homage,
reciting the scriptures as taught,
and beseeching the exalted降真 (True Ones of the Three Realms),
the holy assemblies of the Ten Directions,
the celestial warriors of the Nine Heavens,
to ward off disasters and eliminate misfortunes,
to invoke the Great God of延寿 (prolonging life) and益算 (augmenting destiny).

For three days, five days, seven days,
and likewise at night.

When the True Ones descend from the heavens,
they must first show signs of response—
strange luminous lights, white cranes, celestial music,
and extraordinary omens.

Or one may dream of traversing the Heavenly Gates,
personally meeting divine beings,
with blessings felt ever more profound,
as disasters and calamities retreat and fade,
延寿 (prolonging life) and添年 (adding years) are granted,
and the Way of长生 (eternal life) is attained.

If worldly bonds are heavy and one lacks strength to erect grand altars,
yet all unite in heart to observe the斋 (fast) and recite the scriptures,
performing the六时行香 (six-period incense offerings)
and十遍转经 (ten recitations of the sutra),
then福德 (merit and virtue) shall descend in response,
dissolving all ill omens.

Its blessings are boundless,
its salvations endless.

The Dao speaks:
The unenlightened are shallow in the Way,
or their仙品 (celestial grade) may not yet be complete,
as fate’s cycle reaches its termination,
and their bodies pass through太阴 (Great Darkness).
At the hour of their passing,
降真缘感 (the descending True Ones’ blessings) may aid them,
yet if they have not fulfilled their worldly destiny,
their lives shall end as decreed by Heaven’s gift.

If延益 (prolongation) is not yet attained,
and prayers are exhausted without divine acceptance,
then one must perform the香 (incense offerings)
and诵经十遍 (recite the sutra ten times),
to guide the corpse as taught by the Dao,
as the魂神 (spirit-soul) ascends to the南宫 (Southern Palace),
following their accumulated merits,
to be reborn in days, restoring their former form.

And the延寿 (prolonged life) they receive
shall be absorbed into their bodies—
when the True *qi* descends,
nourishing their youthful complexion,
the轮转 (cycle) shall not falter,
and they shall attain divinity.

The Dao speaks:
Life is Heaven’s granted harmony,
its origin traced to the天官 (Celestial Bureau’s) decree,
which sets the算 (destiny’s measure).
阴福 (Yin blessings) are added,
阳过 (Yang misfortunes) are extinguished.
One measure’s duration
corresponds to three days.
A lifespan of a hundred and twenty years
exceeds a thousand two hundred days.

Yet Heaven, Earth, Sun, Moon,
and the Four Seasons’阴阳 (yin-yang forces)
all have their divisions and bounds.

If disasters or portents arise in fury,
降真 (descending the True Ones) shall prolong their算 (destiny),
securing Heaven’s boundless blessings.

If calamities or military *qi* clash in battle,
pestilence spreads, and countless people perish young,
or if teachers and disciples meet untimely ends,
their fates exhausted by fate’s cycle—
all must pray to降真灵 (the descending True Ones),
求延寿命 (beg for prolonged life),
炼度尸魂 (refine and guide the corpse-spirit),
and回殃转福 (reverse misfortune into blessing).

For fasting and reciting the scriptures
hold great merit and virtue.
Above, they dispel Heaven’s disasters,
protecting and safeguarding the Emperor.
Below, they avert pestilence and harm,
delivering countless souls.
Life and death depend upon them,
their blessings surpassing measure—
thus called boundless,
universally benefiting all beings.

The Dao speaks:
For all who possess this sutra,
capable of performing such deeds for the Emperor of Heaven and Earth,
and for countless souls—
on days of calamity,
when they dedicate their hearts to fasting and burning incense,
reciting the sutra ten times,
the降真 (True Ones of the heavens) shall descend,
ten thousand gods shall attend in vigil,
延寿度人 (prolonging life and guiding souls),
and they shall surely attain the rank of a saintly minister beneath the golden gates of Heaven.

The heavens record all human deeds and transgressions,
without the slightest loss.
Celestial降真 (True Ones) shall also recommend their merits,
and those who attain the Way
shall comprehend profound truths.

Within the heavens, the Great Brahman’s hidden words resound in boundless tones—
**Dao Lord’s Composition, the *Yusheng* Scripture of the Mysterious Capital’s降真 (Descending True Ones) for Prolonging Life,**
**the Sacred Eastern Seven Heavens.**

「The *Yusheng* Scripture of the Mysterious Capital’s Descending True Ones for Prolonging Life»

**The Seven Heavens of the East:**

while *jingyi* jewels and *bianhē* patterns gleam in splendor.

as the *yuanji* depths flow in harmony and balance.
The *jingfan* True Ones extend their radiance,
while *qingyān* celebratory mists disperse *sànnà*.
The *Ziqian* True Ones mirror the clouds,
as the *zhōngyōu* Sage dreams in peace.

Grasping the Pool’s misty offerings,
leaving the *lǐjī* Dipper to scatter its blade.
The *wǎn yán* jade True Ones descend,
as the *Dìcí* Lord bestows great *mó* blessings.
The *lǒudū* void is pure and vast,
while the *zhèngzhěn* True Ones align with *xián’ā* mysteries.

The *chìwén* scriptures pierce through the clouds,
as the *lǜyīng* green mists rise without peak.
**The Seven Heavens of the South:**

The *qiūfēng* peaks stretch their schemes,
while the *yuèjǐn* True Ones restrain their solemnity.
The *xiān còu* True Ones gather beneath the *huángyǎn* Emperor,
as the *pílán* True Ones establish their foundations.
The *qíyuán* True Ones stand alone in heaven,
through *zǐyān* purple mists, they wander in confusion.

The *pǔjiǔ* Nine Stars encamp in *yíngshì*,
as the *jǐngguǐ* Well Ghosts and *míngyí* Dark Demons shine.
The *zhǎnlù* True Ones slaughter in *qīngyǒu*,
while the *tàikōng* vast expanse fades into obscurity.

The *luòyuán* True Ones cry resoundingly,
as the *shénfù* Spirit Fathers open their gates.
The *dòngshuǎng* True Ones gleam in the *zhéhé* marshes,
while the *gǔqiàn* ancient seals unite in harmony.
The *lòubǐng* True Ones perform their rites,
as the *qīnjī* True Ones bow in reverence to the seasons.

**The Seven Heavens of the West:**
The *zhāomóu* True Ones ponder their plans,
as the *jiàoliú* True Ones wield authority.
The *fǎyán* True Ones extend their halls,
while the *bēiméi* True Ones’ inscriptions lack propriety.

The *jìnzhí* True Ones align with the *nánfù* Southern Mounds,
as the *huīdiān* True Ones illuminate the *niúkuí* Ox and Dipper constellations.
The *záoluò* True Ones pierce the heavens,
while the *fǔguī* True Ones assist in *huányī* governance.

The *gōngyóu* True Ones respond with *yīngyìng*,
as the *wēidiàn* True Ones guard the *hàoguī* radiant tortoise.
The *hóngwéi* Red Mists reach the *jìngduì* boundary,
while the *hǔbiāo* Tiger Stars command the *sīpī* lofty canopy.

The *dǎngqiú* True Ones pierce through the foundations,
as the *zhìjié* True Ones exhaust their wisdom, known as *míngyí*.
The *qióngluó* vaulted heavens embrace the *yuán* origins,
while the *lónghuàng* Dragon True Ones radiate in resplendent salvation.

**The Seven Heavens of the North:**
The *gé lù* True Ones govern the *zhìdǒu* Fighting Stars,
as the *xīngzhāng* True Ones enter the *liǔliǔ* Willow constellations.
The *mǎgé* True Ones contain the *huǒhán* Fire,
while the *qiánlíng* True Ones bind the *fùchǒu* Hidden Stars.

The *jùkēi* True Ones preside over the *sìzhāng* Four Mounds,
as the *guānnǚ* True Ones lead the *yuánshǒu* Original Heads.
The *yùyuè* True Ones encircle the *lǐhé* River,
while the *qǔcān* True Ones descend to the *jiàngyǒu* Dipper.

The *fúyùn* True Ones mark the *chìtiān* Red Heavens,
as the *léihóng* True Ones thunder over the *jiǔfú* Nine Palaces.
They disperse *mó* demons with the *yuèdǐng* True Ones’ axes,
while the *bīngtú* True Ones plan their *piányóu* paired campaigns.

The *huānyún* True Ones ride the *rìtuó* Sun’s clouds,
as the *yuèfàn* True Ones guide the *mǔfǒu* Mother’s constellations.
The *dūtīan* True Ones command the *kěkān* True Ones,
while the *shèqīng* True Ones gather the *zhēnlián* Treasures of the *qīngyǒu* Netherworld.

The Dao speaks: Within these heavens,
the Descending True Ones of the Three *zhēn* True Ones,
the Ten-Directional *xiānshèng* Saints and True Ones,
prolong life and bring blessings to the years.
The Great Brahman’s hidden words resound in boundless tones.

The ancient texts were inscribed in vermilion and gold
beneath the *xīnlóu* Hypostyle of the Heavenly Canopy,
where they swirled and flowed in intricate patterns,
dividing the mists and scattering the clouds.
The Celestial True Ones and the *huángrén* Yellow Emperor
looked upon and transmitted them,
establishing them as the *zhèngyīn* orthodox tones.

Those who know this sound
and can fast and recite it,
the heavens shall dispatch *fēitiān* Flying Celestial Kings,
who descend to observe such people—
they shall not violate the Dao,
nor harm the world’s *zhēnjí* sacred beings.
The Celestial True Ones shall descend in person,
while the Five Emperors shall hold their brushes in reverence,
recording their meritorious deeds.
Life shall be prolonged, and their commands extended,
as they ascend to the heavens,
where the Ten Thousand Gods shall pay homage,
the Earthly *zhī* spirits shall guard their gates,
and the Three *guān* Excellencies shall confer great honors.
They shall be recommended to the ranks of the Immortals,
their Dao complete, and they shall attain
to wander the Three Realms,
ascending into the Golden Gates.

This sound cleaves through all obstacles,
dispels all calamities,
guides all souls,
and fulfills all aspirations—
it is the Celestial True Ones’ natural sound.
Thus, when recited, it summons the *fēitiān* Flying Celestial Kings to descend in observation,
as the *Shàngdì* Supreme Lord sings from afar,
the Ten Thousand Gods pay homage,
the Three Realms’ spirits guard the *xuān* hall,
the assembled *jiān* deities bow in submission,
the *guǐjīng* ghostly intelligences perish of their own accord,
the True Ones’ sentinels gather in remnants,
the Heavenly chariots halt their steeds,
the winds subside, the mists disperse,
the jade resonates in pure clarity,
and the boundless *liàng* merits of the *xiánxián* Mysterious Dao resound.

**The *Língbǎo* Scripture of the Supreme Mysterious Treasure for Guiding All Souls,**
**Chapter the Twenty-Ninth concludes.**
**Chapter the Thirtieth begins.**

**The *Língbǎo* Scripture of the Supreme Mysterious Treasure for Guiding All Souls,**
**Chapter the Thirtieth: The Section on Severing the Fetal Root and Sealing the Gates of Death**

The Dao speaks: *"In the beginning of the Azure Sky,*
the Purple Void’s Mysterious Cavern, Five-Luminous Flower Palace,
I received from the Primordial Origin the *Língbǎo* Scripture’s
supreme method of Severing the Fetal Root and Sealing the Gates of Death—
its boundless, highest-grade teaching.*

When the Primordial Origin, Celestial True One, proclaimed this sutra,
He circled ten times, calling the Ten Directions,
and then approached the seat.

The Heavenly True Ones’ Great Gods,
the Highest Saints and Lofty Worthies,
the True Kings of the Divine Clouds and Jade Purity,
the Supreme Sovereigns of the Celestial True Ones and the Consuming of Demons,
the Imperial Lords of the Vermilion Phoenix and Green Splendor,
the Imperial Lords of the Posterior Saints and Golden Gates,
the Ten Thousand Celestial Sovereigns,
and countless hosts beyond measure—
all rode the void and arrived,
flying through Clouds of Vermilion and Azure Constellations,
in emerald carriages and jade-wheeled chariots,
their feathered canopies casting shade,
their radiance like flowing elixir and luminous light,
five hues vibrant and resplendent,
illuminating the boundless expanse.

For nine days and nine nights,
all the Celestial realms’ sun, moon, stars, and lodestars,
the *Xuánshū* (Celestial Axis) and *Yùhéng* (Jade Balance),
halted their wheels in unison,
the divine winds stilled, the murmur ceased,
mountains and seas concealed their clouds,
the sky bore no floating veils,
the Four Seasons shone with clarity.
Within a single realm—earth, soil, mountains, rivers,
forests, and trees—
all became level, equalized,
no longer high or low.
All beings attained enlightenment and fulfilled the Dao,
the land transformed into jade of uniform hue,
no longer varied in color.

The assembled True Ones attended the seat,
as the Primordial Origin, Celestial True One,
ascended to His Emerald-Floating, Glasslike, Sun-Yang, and Treasure Seat.

When the sutra was recited once,
the Ten Thousand Celestial Sovereigns simultaneously praised its excellence,
bowed their heads in reverence twice,
and all attained the Dao.
At that time,
within the realm—men and women alike—
the dead revived,
the living attained enlightenment.

When recited twice,
birds, beasts, and armored insects
all gained eternal life.

When recited thrice,
the Four Seasons harmonized,
no longer cold or hot.

When recited four times,
the lodestars, sun, moon, and celestial realms
halted their eastward motion.

When recited five times,
all diseases and deep afflictions
were cured without fail.

When recited six times,
the earth leveled and straightened,
the dust of deities dispersed of its own accord.

When recited seven times,
the Five Phases unified,
blending into the Heavenly Way.

When recited eight times,
all pregnant wombs delivered,
sprouts cracked open their shells—
those already born and those yet unborn
all attained birth in an instant.

When recited nine times,
good and evil left no trace,
the heart returned to true transformation.

When recited ten times,
the civilized and the barbarian became equal,
no more crookedness or perversity.
At that time,
within the realm—men and women alike—
none failed to incline their hearts in devotion,
all receiving protection and attaining eternal life.

The Dao speaks: *"At that time,*
when the Primordial Origin, Celestial True One,
recited the sutra once,
the Supreme Saints of the East—
the Azure Constellation’s Green Splendor and Luminous Cavern—
and countless hosts beyond measure
floated through the void and arrived.

When recited twice,
the Supreme Saints of the South—
the Red Sun-Yang and Radiant Cavern—
and countless hosts beyond measure
floated through the void and arrived.

When recited thrice,
the Supreme Saints of the West—
the White Landscape and Luminous Cavern—
and countless hosts beyond measure
floated through the void and arrived.

When recited four times,
the Supreme Saints of the North—
the Mysterious Cavern’s Most Marvelous Transformation—
and countless hosts beyond measure
floated through the void and arrived.

When recited five times,
the Supreme Saints of the Northeast—
the Uppermost Cavern of Illuminating Reason—
and countless hosts beyond measure
floated through the void and arrived.

When recited six times,
the Supreme Saints of the Southeast—
the Cavern of Subduing Essence and Primordial Body—
and countless hosts beyond measure
floated through the void and arrived.

When recited seven times,
the Supreme Saints of the Southwest—
the Cavern of Radiant Reason and Piercing Void—
and countless hosts beyond measure
floated through the void and arrived.

When recited eight times,
the Supreme Saints of the Northwest—
the Cavern of Flowering Reason and Unifying Transformation—
and countless hosts beyond measure
floated through the void and arrived.

When recited nine times,
the Supreme Saints of the Upper Realm—
the Cavern of Universal Transformation—
and countless hosts beyond measure
floated through the void and arrived.

When recited ten times,
the Supreme Saints of the Lower Realm—
the Cavern of Tranquil Reason and Spontaneous Birth—
and countless hosts beyond measure
floated through the void and arrived.*

When all ten recitations were complete,
the boundless, highest-grade True Ones of the Ten Directions
gathered in unison,
and all within the realm—men and women alike—
inclined their hearts in reverence.

Those who arrived filled the space like dense yellow mist,
august clouds and auspicious vapors,
countless hosts beyond measure—
half the realm’s land sank beneath them,
unable to be restrained.

Then, the Primordial Origin
internally emitted a radiant light,
externally dispatched divine qi,
and ascended, releasing the *Níwán* (Earthly Pill),
its fiery brilliance illuminating
all Ten Directions of the celestial realms.

Afterward, He gathered the light and returned its reflection,
retrieving the essence and condensing the qi,
transforming it into a Treasure Pearl,
shaped like a dewdrop,
a billion ten thousand zhang above the earth.

The Primordial Origin then ascended,
drawing in the Heavenly True Ones’ Great Gods,
the Highest Saints and Lofty Worthies,
all the Celestial Sovereigns,
the boundless, highest-grade Supreme Saints of the Ten Directions,
and countless hosts beyond measure—
all entering the Treasure Pearl.

The mortals and deities gazed upward,
and saw only a brilliant radiance entering the Pearl’s mouth.
Once inside, they vanished from sight.
The people dispersed,
the earth returned to its original level,
its hue once more unchanged—
no longer jade.

The Primordial Origin, within the Treasure Pearl,
completed the recitation of the sutra.
The assembled True Ones, as guardians,
entrusted it to me.
At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words.

The ritual’s coarse details were exhausted,
the deities resumed their stations,
and in an instant—
silence remained, no trace of sound.

At that time,
all mortals and deities who encountered the sutra’s law
attained eternal life,
completing their natural years,
none perishing prematurely.
All inclined their hearts in devotion,
practicing benevolent minds.

They did not act recklessly or covetously,
nor were they full or empty,
leaning or failing,
departing or arriving,
dwelling or unseen.

Their hearts harbored no false thoughts,
their bodies bore no crookedness,
their equalized bones became as one with compassion,
and all perverse forms aligned in kinship.

The realm was secure, its people flourished,
rejoicing in eternal peace.
The teaching first emerged,
and the realm was governed by the Dao.
Those who held sincere devotion,
worshipped and revered it,
all attained the power to guide the world.

The Dao speaks: *"All that was spoken within this sutra*
by the Primordial Origin, Celestial True One,
are the inner realms of the highest deities and sovereigns,
the most subtle transformations of the True Ones into immortals,
the hidden forms of the Mysterious Kings,
the Supreme Lord’s inner taboo,
and the secret names of the Ten Thousand Gods—
not the ordinary words of the mortal world."*

The Most High Sage has already become a True Person,
penetrating the Mysterious and exploring the subtle,
able to discern all its chapters.

Reciting it ten times,
the highest deities sing from afar,
the Ten Thousand Emperors set forth rites,
the rivers and seas fall silent,
the mountains and valleys conceal their clouds,
the sun and moon halt their radiance,
the revolving sky-sphere ceases its motion,
demons submit their forms,
ghostly spirits vanish,
the dead arise and the living return,
white bones become flesh.

Those of supreme learning,
reciting it ten times,
shall have the Five Emperors as their guards,
the Three Realms bow in homage,
the Ten Thousand Gods protect the law,
the Hundred Spirits bless their bodies,
rescuing those near death,
and granting life to those who would perish.

Thus it is—
learned scholars, their impure *qi* not yet purged,
their bodies not yet perfected in truth,
cannot yet subdue the Ten Directions;
their might does not govern the celestial laws,
their virtue can only subdue the earthly *zhi* spirits,
bind the demonic *ling*,
but as common scriptures,
they do not yet grasp the subtle and wondrous,
and thus only repel death,
yet cannot restore life.

Lightly reciting this chapter
brings misfortune upon one’s body.

Supplying offerings and revering it
brings prosperity to one’s household,
generation after generation,
a bond with good causes,
and shields from all calamities,
as divine spirits guard the gate.

This sutra is most sacred and wondrous,
unmatched in the Jade Capital,
its power to guide beings immeasurable,
the root of all Dao/Way.

The vast and august range,
its virtue beyond reckoning.

The Dao speaks:
*"For those who recite this sutra ten times,*
the highest deities all assemble,
countless ancestors and progenitors,
suffering souls in torment,
all immediately receive guidance,
ascending to the Vermilion Palace,
all attain refined forms,
receive transformation and rebirth,
and become True Persons once more.

Those who love this supreme sutra,
with their merit fulfilled and virtue complete,
all attain the rank of Immortal,
ascending to the Golden Gates,
feasting in the Jade Capital.

Learned scholars of the highest order,
reciting and practicing this sutra,
all immediately receive guidance,
ascending to the Southern Palace.

Learned scholars of the middle order,
reciting and practicing this sutra,
know neither birth nor death,
coming and going in swift joy,
and attain the register of the Immortals.

Learned scholars of the lower order,
reciting and practicing this sutra,
gain a bright and nimble spirit,
diseases vanish,
and they live long in this world.

This sutra is subtle and wondrous,
its power to guide beings boundless.
All heavenly and human beings
rejoice in its blessings.

Its immeasurable benefits
extend to life and death,
a treasure of the highest heavens,
not passed down to the mortal world.

Only those of supreme virtue,
offering gold and jade with sincere devotion,
pledge to the heavens and transmit it.

Leakage or careless disclosure
brings calamity to the Nine Ancestors,
and guilt upon oneself.

Those who uphold it long shall have celestial officials,
serving incense to the Five Emperors,
twenty-four Jade Boy attendants and twenty-four Jade Girl attendants,
guarding the sacred texts,
protecting those who receive this sutra.

The Dao speaks:
*"On the first month’s long fast,*
reciting and chanting this sutra,
the dead gates close,
the roots of life are severed,
forms and spirits become subtle,
ascending to the Southern Palace.

On the seventh month’s long fast,*
reciting and chanting this sutra,
one attains the rank of Immortal,
the highest deities record one’s name,
golden tablets and jade talismans,
summoning spirits and revealing mysteries,
and gains eternal life.

On the tenth month’s long fast,*
reciting and chanting this sutra,
one becomes a sovereign king or emperor,
ensuring peace for ruler and subjects,
father and son,
stabilizing the nation’s fate,
preserving the heavens’ longevity,
the Dao’s mystery never fading,
eternally cutting off calamitous cycles,
bringing eternal peace to all.

On the eight festive days,
reciting and chanting this sutra,
one attains the rank of True Person in the Nine Palaces.

On one’s natal day,*
reciting and chanting this sutra,
spirit and soul become pure,
*qi* flows endlessly,
free from suffering,
the body radiant,
with the Three Realms as guards,
the Five Emperors welcoming,
the Ten Thousand Gods paying homage,
one’s name recorded in the heavens,
merit fulfilled and virtue complete,
ascending to the Upper Purity.

The Dao speaks:
*"On the day of Dao practice,*
one must bathe in fragrant water,
fast and enter the chamber,
facing east,
knocking teeth thirty-six times,
to the sound of the Thirty-six Heavens above,
bowing the heart thirty-six times,
closing the eyes,
calmly contemplating oneself seated within the three-colored clouds—red, yellow, and purple—
both within and without,
dark and vast,
with the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Tortoise,
Lion and White Crane arrayed on either side,
the sun and moon casting their light,
illuminating the void,
radiant and resplendent,
the celestial sphere forming at the neck,
filling the Ten Directions,
thus manifesting clearly.

The secret incantation says:
*'Without rival, the Most High Origin,*
*the Supreme Dao Lord.*
*Summon forth my thirty-six officials of Three Five merit,*
*attendants and messengers on left and right,*
*Jade Boys bearing incense,*
*Jade Girls transmitting words,*

all receiving life from the **Palace of Birth**,
the **Divine Infant** transformed,
sweeping away the **fetal roots** universally.
Severing the **blood impurities**,

wind and fire relentless,
thousands beheaded,
ten thousands decapitated—
**Demons dare not trespass**,

The **Seven Souls** rest undisturbed,

inner observation of the **Original Spirit**,

The **Backwind’s Death Path**,

The **Thirty-Nine Doors**—
each door may bring death,

Each door now open,
closing it keeps one from exiting—

the **Door** named the **Cavity**,
the **Cavity** truly the **Essence**.
**Spirit and Qi** converge,
the **Dragon and Tiger** fortify the roots,
**blood congeals, spirit gathers**—
only when undispersed does it succeed.
Dispersed, it is boundless,
nameless in its completion.
**Qi** swelling and overflowing,
penetrating the **Mud Pellet**,

hidden for ages, now revealed.
Severing the **Death Door**,

The **Celestial Court** returns through the Nine Transformations,
the **Divine Essence** gathers, reversing to the **Divine Infant**.

The **Three Realms** resplendent with sacred texts,

The **Taboos** cannot be spoken—

the **True Source**—six **Void Spirits** refined.

**Taiwei** revolves the **Sun and Moon**,
**Souls** ascend to the **Jade Capital**.

**Third Chapter: The Song of the Green Flower Emperor of the Eastern Exalted Sun**

The **Ten Thousand Phenomena** manifest as **Body**,
the **Hundred Gods** return to their **Root**.
When all is complete, **Spirit** arises—
only **Form** and **Body** are its vessels.

The **Root of the Great Dao** is the **Mysterious Essence**.
**Inner Observation** reveals it,
**External Phenomena** are hidden and still.
Without this **Supreme Dao**,
one cannot preserve life and endure.

Recite silently ten thousand times,
blending with **Heaven’s** completion.
**Blood Impurities** severed,
**Evil Roots** consumed.
Ascend to the **Celestial Rank**,
transcend the **Southern Palace**.

Lost in delusion, one sinks forever into the **Ghostly Realm**.
**Heaven’s Secret Records**—
**Elixir Flowers** vanish into **Obscurity**.

**Southern Harmony** holds the **Nodal Seal**,
**Northern Pole** guards the **Spirit**.
**Golden Qi** enters the **Three Realms**,
**Jade Marrow** opens the **Nine Gates**.

The **Emperor’s Unity** blends with **Truth**—
neither manifest nor luminous.
Above the **Three Realms**,
within the **Jade Texts’ Core**,
the **True King’s Song** resounds—
its sound harmonizes with the **Deep Chapters**.

Recite it a hundred times—
your name is recorded in the **Southern Palace**.
Recite it a thousand times—
the **Door of Death** is severed.
Ten thousand recitations complete the **Dao**,
ascending to the **Supreme Void**,
transcending the **Three Realms**,
ranked among the **Celestial Lords**.

Those who hear the **Divine Chapter**—
the **Ten Thousand Truths** bless the **Form**,
commanding the **Earthly Gate** to open,
warding off the **Five Sufferings and Eight Hardships**.
The **Seven Ancestors** ascend to **Heaven**,
receiving duties in the **Nine Palaces**,
**Souls** cross the **Vermilion Ridge**,
**Corporeal Bodies** are refined anew.
This is called **Boundless Compassion**,
universally liberating the endless.

There exists a **Secret Celestial Text**,
revered by all **Heavenly Deities**.
Revealing arrogance leads to **Hell’s Fall**,
bringing calamity to the **Seven Ancestors**.

The **Dao** speaks: These two chapters are the hidden sounds
of the **Heavenly Sovereigns**, the **Most Sacred Gods**, and the **Jade Purity True King**.
All are the words of **Mahābrahmā**—
not the common speech of the world.
Without melodic grace,
without ornate tunes,
thus called **Mysterious and Profound**—
difficult to trace or examine.

**Heaven’s Treasure** is guarded
within the **Divine Azure Palace’s** Eastern Wall Scripture Hall,
transmitted every **Sixty Million Eons** according to the **Mysterious Method**.
If a **Perfected One** brings **gold and jewels** with sincere devotion,
and pledges allegiance to the **Three Heavens**,
then it shall be granted.

The **Dao** speaks: The **Heavenly Mandate** and **Earthly Rotation** also have their **Terminations**.
The **Sun, Moon, and Five Stars** also have **Eclipses and Fullness**.
The **Most Sacred Immortals** also have **Ascendancies and Declinations**.
The **Unenlightened** also suffer **Illness and Injury**.
When such calamities arise,
those of **Kindred Qi** must refine their **Form** for themselves,
receive **Transformation** and **Liberation**,
recite the **Scripture Ten Times**,
transfer **Spirit** and stabilize **Qi**,
thus regaining **Rebirth**.

The **Boundless Text** universally liberates the endless.

The **Dao** speaks: The **Unenlightened**, with shallow **Dao**,
perhaps their **Immortal Rank** is incomplete,
the **Door of Death** unsealed,
the **Fetal Root** still lingering.
When their **Destiny** approaches annihilation,
their **Body** passes through **Great Yin**,
at the critical moment,
**Kindred Perfected Ones** open their **Spirit** and unfold the **Scripture**,
gather **Qi** and transmit the **Dao**,
thus liberating the **Corporeal Form** according to the **Law**.
The **Soul-Spirit** ascends directly to the **Southern Palace**,
based on their **Merits**, regaining **Rebirth** in calculated days.
Without confusion in the **Wheel of Rebirth**,
one attains **Divinity and Immortality**.

The **Dao** speaks: When the **Heavenly Mandate** reaches its **Termination**,
one must **Observe the Fast**, burn **Incense**, and recite the **Scripture**.
When **Stars and Constellations** misalign,
when the **Sun and Moon** lose their **Eclipses**,
one must **Observe the Fast**, burn **Incense**, and recite the **Scripture**.
When the **Four Seasons** are disordered,
when **Yin and Yang** are unbalanced,
one must **Observe the Fast**, burn **Incense**, and recite the **Scripture**.
When the **Sovereign** faces **Calamity**,
when **Wars** erupt in the **Four Directions**,
one must **Observe the Fast**, burn **Incense**, and recite the **Scripture**.
When **Plagues** spread,
when **Subjects** suffer **Death and Injury**,
one must **Observe the Fast**, burn **Incense**, and recite the **Scripture**.
When a **Kindred Scholar’s Destiny** approaches,
one must **Observe the Fast**, burn **Incense**, and recite the **Scripture**.

**Observing the Fast**, **Burning Incense**, and reciting the **Scripture**—
their **Merits** are profound.
Above, they **Dissolve Heavenly Calamities**,
**Protect and Secure the Emperor**.
Below, they **Ward Off Poisons and Harm**,
**Liberating the Myriad People**.
**Life and Death** depend on it—
their **Blessings** are boundless.
Thus it is said: **Boundless Compassion**,
universally liberating **Heaven and Man**.

The **Dao** speaks: Those who possess this **Scripture**,
for **Heaven, Earth, the Emperor, and the Myriad People**,
performing these **Meritorious Deeds**,
severing **Life and Death**,
transcending the **Celestial Palaces**—
on days of **Calamity**, if they **Resolve to Fast**, burn **Incense**, and recite the **Scripture Ten Times**,
all **Heavens** will record their names,
**Ten Thousand Spirits** will attend as guards,
**Separate Perfected Ones** will aid them,
and they shall become **Holy Ministers** of the **Golden Gate**.

The **Heavens** record **Merits and Offenses** without omission.
Even the **Magical Kings of Heaven** will **Recommend Their Worth**—
only those who attain the **Dao** can truly understand these **Profound Words**.

**The Dao** speaks: *"Within these Nine Heavens, the **Hidden Words of the Great Dharma**,
Endless **Sounds of the Mystic**,
Engraved in **Lingering Books** and **Jade Texts**,
All are **Dragon Scripts** and **Crimson Seals**,
Treasure **Chests of Jade** and **Gem-Lined Boxes**,
Sealed within the **Eastern Hall of Splendor**.
**Golden Threads** and **Jewel Flowers**,
**Floating Lights** and **Ten Thousand Phenomena**—
All are **Divine Treasures** concealed within.

**The True King of the Heavenly Dao, Jade Purity**,
And **Emperor of the Vermilion Phoenix, Green Splendor**,
All know these **Sounds**,
And **Transmit these Texts**.

Those who **Fast and Recite** them,
All the **Heavens** will dispatch **Flying Heavenly Kings**,
**Scripture-Bearing Officials**,
To **Descend and Observe** their forms,
**Record their Merits and Labors**,
And **Report to the Heavens Above**,
Where **Ten Thousand Spirits** pay homage in **Ceremonial Worship**,
**Earthly Spirits** attend the gates,
And the **Jade Purity, Magic-Subduing Kings**,
**Recommend them to the Perfected Ones**,
Thus **Fulfilling the Dao** and attaining **Supreme Virtue**.
They **Transcend and Ascend** to **Jade Capital**,
And **Enter the Golden Gate**.

This **Sound** reaches **All**,
**All** it descends upon,
**All** it **Transcends**,
**All** it **Accomplishes**—
The **Natural Sound of the Heavens**,
Thus it is.

Therefore, when one **Recites** it,
**Flying Heavenly Kings** descend to **Observe**,
**The Supreme Deity** sings from afar,
**Ten Thousand Spirits** pay homage in **Ceremonial Worship**,
The **Three Realms** attend the **Hall of the Perfected**,
The **Five Emperors** come to **Welcome**,
**Ghostly Essences** perish of their own accord,
And **Lingering Resonances** shake the **Ten Directions**,
All **Ten Thousand Spirits** tremble in submission.
They **Summon** the **Clustered Perfected Ones**,
The **Heavens** are **Free of Filth**,
The **Earth** is **Free of Dust**,
**Dark Wisdom** pierces through **Boundless Clarity**,
And **Great Compassion** is **Mystic and Profound**."

**The Thirty-First Scroll of the *Scripture of the Mystic Treasure for Perfecting and Liberating Beings*** is complete.

**The Chapter on Eternal Life and Everlasting Vision**

The Dao speaks: In ancient times, within the **Celestial Azure**, at the juncture of the **Jade-Luminous True Transformation Heaven**, there existed the **Great Mystic Music Heaven**, named **Eternal Life**. Within it dwelled an **Imperial Sovereign**, the **Great Sovereign of Eternal Life**.

The **Crimson Jade Palace**, the **Vermilion Azure Celestial Gate**, enveloped in swirling **Purple Clouds** and fragrant **Yellow Mists**, housed the **Imperial Treasure Vault**. Mountains, rivers, forests, and trees all radiated in the hues of **Rainbow Arcs and Crimson Glows**. **Celestial Officials and Divine Ministers**, attendants, scribes, and clerks numbered in the **hundreds of millions**.

This heaven connected eastward to the **Eastern Mongolian Palace**, the **Purple Extremity Heaven**, the **Luminous Truth Platform**, and the **Rare Jade Hall**; westward to the **Harmonious Celestial Palace**, the **Radiant Splendor Heaven**, the **Treasure Spirit Platform**, and the **Great Harmony Hall**. From above, it was draped with the **Nine-Luminous Pure-Mist Clouds**, while below, it was supported by the **Sea-Conch Jade Qi**, forming its **throne’s foundation**.

Resplendent and boundless, it shone among all heavens, known as the **Supreme Bliss**. When the **Primordial Beginning Venerable Lord** delivered this scripture, He revealed the **Great Law of Eternal Life and Everlasting Vision**.

The **Primordial Beginning Venerable Lord**, seated upon the **Five-Colored Lion Throne** in the **Celestial Azure**, summoned the **Jade-Luminous Celestial Boundary Great Mystic Music Heaven’s Great Sovereign of Eternal Life**. Because of the **Primordial Beginning’s Supreme Divinity and Auspicious Virtue**, His blessings and merit were complete, He entrusted the **Great Sovereign of Eternal Life** with the task of teaching **all beings in the Ten Directions**—**heavenly and mortal**—this **essential method for transforming mundane existence into sainthood and attaining eternal life**.

The **Great Sovereign of Eternal Life**, moved by the **Primordial Beginning’s profound intent**, rose from His seat. He commanded His **attendant Celestial Worthies**, the **Celestial Officials and Ministers**, the **Incense Officials** who guarded the scriptures, the **Jade Boys and Jade Girls**, and all **myriad heavenly beings and assemblies**, to gather at the **South-and-Harmony Hall of the Jade-Luminous Mystic Cavern**, before the **Supreme Law’s Jade Seat**.

The **Child of the Soul’s Elixir** ascended to support the **Elevated Platform**, striking the **Spotted Dragon Thunder-Sound Drum**. The **Jade-Cavern Maiden** ascended to the **Double-Splendor Cloudless Tower**, ringing the **Nine-Absolute Divine Golden Bell of the Yellow Court**. The **Holy Assembly gathered**, and all under heaven rejoiced.

The **Great Sovereign of Eternal Life** prepared to expound the **Mystic Law**. With **ten full recitations**, He summoned the **Ten Directions**. The **Heavenly Worthies**, **Supreme Saints**, and **True Persons of Marvelous Conduct**, beyond count, arrived **riding the void**, their **natural elixir qi** radiating like **flowing light piercing the heavens**. The **Eight Illuminations** shone round, their **luminous forms** piercing through **morning brilliance**, their **banners, palanquins, and carriages** woven from **nine hues**, their **thousand forms** casting **myriad shadows**, **dragons and phoenixes** intertwining in **splendid patterns**, **mountains and waters** taking shape in **living motion**.

Without obstruction, they manifested and vanished without constancy. **Palaces, halls, and platforms** emerged, along with **music and ritual implements**, **banners and flags** drifting on **floating mists**, the **land forming into patterned jade**. The **Worthy Ones** attended at His seat, while the **Great Sovereign of Eternal Life** ascended the **Nine-Revolutions, Seven-Transformations Red-Precise Red-Lotus Void Seat**.

When the scripture was **recited once**, the **Purple Void echoed**, and **heavenly inscriptions** emerged.
When the scripture was **recited twice**, the **Jade Capital emitted crystals**, and **transformations multiplied by billions**.
When the scripture was **recited thrice**, the **Dao-Void internally shifted**, revealing the **Primordial Source**.
When the scripture was **recited four times**, the **Divine Manifested in True Form**, and **all beings attained eternal life**.
When the scripture was **recited five times**, the **Jade Emperor opened the seals**, and **auspicious talismans granted eternal command**.
When the scripture was **recited six times**, the **Qionglin Whistled Wind**, and **void and dharma merged**.
When the scripture was **recited seven times**, the **Spiritual Pool glistened pure**, and the **Indigo Sea shared its hue**.
When the scripture was **recited eight times**, the **Sun and Moon united their radiance**, and **crimson mists drifted with fragrance**.
When the scripture was **recited nine times**, the **Dao’s operation was boundless**, and **heavenly longevity eternal**.
When the scripture was **recited ten times**, **glowing mushrooms formed platters**, and **sweet dew spread across the void**.

At that moment, **all men and women in the land** were moved to devotion, **all received protection and deliverance**, and **all attained eternal life**.

The Dao speaks: When the scripture was **recited once**, the **Eternal Life Great Gods of the East—Limitless and Boundless** arrived with **innumerable hosts**, floating through the void.
When the scripture was **recited twice**, the **Eternal Life Great Gods of the South—Limitless and Boundless** arrived with **innumerable hosts**, floating through the void.
When the scripture was **recited thrice**, the **Eternal Life Great Gods of the West—Limitless and Boundless** arrived with **innumerable hosts**, floating through the void.
When the scripture was **recited four times**, the **Eternal Life Great Gods of the North—Limitless and Boundless** arrived with **innumerable hosts**, floating through the void.
When the scripture was **recited five times**, the **Eternal Life Great Gods of the Northeast—Limitless and Boundless** arrived with **innumerable hosts**, floating through the void.
When the scripture was **recited six times**, the **Eternal Life Great Gods of the Southeast—Limitless and Boundless** arrived with **innumerable hosts**, floating through the void.
When the scripture was **recited seven times**, the **Eternal Life Great Gods of the Southwest—Limitless and Boundless** arrived with **innumerable hosts**, floating through the void.
When the scripture was **recited eight times**, the **Eternal Life Great Gods of the Northwest—Limitless and Boundless** arrived with **innumerable hosts**, floating through the void.
When the scripture was **recited nine times**, the **Eternal Life Great Gods of the Upper Realm—Limitless and Boundless** arrived with **innumerable hosts**, floating through the void.
When the scripture was **recited ten times**, the **Eternal Life Great Gods of the Lower Realm—Limitless and Boundless** arrived with **innumerable hosts**, floating through the void.

After **ten full recitations**, the **Eternal Life Great Gods of the Ten Directions** arrived simultaneously. **All men and women in the land** bowed in reverence with **devoted hearts**.

Their arrival was like **ten thousand mountains emerging from clouds**, **a thousand rivers surging with waves**, **thunderous peals shaking the seas**—**innumerable hosts** filling all heavens, pressing upon the **realms of the land**, beyond restraint.

Thus, the **Great Sovereign of Eternal Life**, raising His hand toward the south, **manifested within the void** a **hundred billion treasure lights**. Each **treasure light** contained **worlds without end**. Within each world stood **hundreds of thousands of pavilions and halls**, some nestled among **mountains, forests, and hills**, others near **cities, streams, or wilderness**.

There, **Worthy Ones** were seen **flying through the void**, **shooting flames and water**, **riding dragons and controlling reins**, **soaring over the divine lands**, **mounting phoenixes and ascending clouds**, **dashing and leaping with swift grace**, encircling the **Great Sigh**, eagerly awaiting the **Law’s words**, aspiring to **transcend the net of karmic bonds**, **awaken to the True Stage**, **grasp the Great Vehicle**, and **forget all habitual defilements**.

「Longsheng Dàdìjūn ascended to the **Celestial Realm** [天引], the **Heavenly Pure Great Spirit** [天真大神], the **Supreme Sage of High Veneration** [上圣高尊], the **Zhìxū True Person** [紫虚真人], and the **Ten Directions’ Boundless Longsheng Jiùshì Great Spirit** [十方无极长生久视大神] all ascended into the **Divine Domain** [神境]. The **celestial beings and mortals** gazed upward in reverence, the **Sages gathered and leaned in**, and **penetrated to see the Dao-root** [道根]. The **original essence** [本] was **unchanging and imperishable** [无变灭], the **Primordial Qi** [元始一炁]—those who could attain it would **endure boundless calamities** [浩劫无终].

Within, they **observed the Five Phases** [五体], without, they **beheld the myriad phenomena** [万象], with **sun and moon shining equally**, and **no limit to their vision** [已期]. **Longsheng** [长生] was the **Dao’s original non-birth** [道本无生], yet **born without perishing** [生而不灭]. **Jiùshì** [久视] was **vastly boundless in perception** [邈然无视], **piercingly illuminating the Three Pure Ones** [洞照三清]. **Seeking life in death** [求生於死], death **transformed into life** [死化为生]. **Jiùshì in the void** [久视於无], the **boundless became manifest** [无极为有]. In **retreat and stillness**, they **refined essence and calmed breath** [潜精内息], **silently observing nature’s spontaneity** [默观自然]. There was **no birth nor death within** [无生死中], yet **erroneously perceived as such** [妄有生死]. **Birth and death cycled endlessly** [生死流转], and those who could not **halt the flow** [止者], their **vision would not endure** [视不久也].

Yet **Jiùshì was steadfast** [久视则定], **steadfast vision revealed truth** [定照则真], and the **realms spontaneously manifested** [境自现]—**Eighty-One Days of the Celestial Cycle** [一天], **clear as if held in the palm** [洞如指掌]. The reason **all beings could not attain Longsheng Jiùshì** [众生所以不得长生久视] was due to **punishment and defeat by karmic retribution** [以刑克败绝], the **fluctuation of their qi** [其气有无], and the **true and false nature of their minds** [真妄其心]. When the **mind clung to birth and death** [心着生死], the **form followed its transformation** [则形亦随化]. When the **mind aligned with the Dao** [心与道一], it **merged with the spirit’s profundity** [一与神冥], **preserving the spirit while forgetting the mind** [守神忘心], the **Dao of life endured forever** [生道长久].

The **Tàiwēi Jade Talisman** [太微玉符] **sustained life and harmonized form** [续生和形], ensuring **no harm to the qi** [使气无害] and **granting the Nine Immortals’ Mystic Rituals** [九仙玄箓]. When **vision endured and penetrated** [使视久而彻], it **revealed the Dao** [彻则见道], and the **Dao’s manifestation brought form** [道来现形], which **could be cherished and guarded** [与子相守]—the **Longsheng Treasure Talisman** [长生宝符]. When the **Dao’s nature remained unaltered** [使道性不迁], **abandoning the mind to embrace the spirit** [遗心抱神], the **spirit’s transformation knew no bounds** [神变无方].

In **all ten directions’ worlds** [十方世界], the **eight wondrous voids** [八景妙空], one who **attained Longsheng** [一得长生] would **naturally perceive eternity** [自然久视]. **Floating and sinking through myriad phenomena** [浮沉万象], they **consumed and dissolved with the times** [应时消殒]. Only the **Longsheng Dàdìjūn** [长生大帝君] **manifested in boundless realms** [无量境界], with **limitless Law-body** [无边法身], **inexhaustible benevolent efficacy** [无穷惠用], **boundless transformations** [无极变化], appearing **instantly as if blinking** [一时出现], like **the hairs of one’s eyebrows** [如同眉睫].

All **celestial beings and mortals** [一切天人], upon **awakening to this great Law** [悟此大法], **rode clouds and dragons** [乘云驾龙], **traversing voids and emptiness** [来往空洞], and **viewed the ten directions’ Great Void as a single grain of millet** [视十方太空如一黍米]. The **Dao’s teachings transformed and governed the world** [仙真教化，应世权实], **ascending to the Pure and Perfect** [超证玉清], **ranking among the True Extremes** [位登真极]. When the **sutras were fully expounded** [说经都竟], the **multitude of spirits received initiation** [众真受度], **bore witness in my presence** [作证於我], and at that moment, **joy and celebration were indescribable** [当此之时，喜庆难言].

The **rituals of the Law were now complete** [法事粗悉], the **heavens resumed their stations** [诸天复位], and in an **instant, all was silent, leaving no trace** [倏欻之间，寂无遗响]. At that time, **all beings encountered the Law’s teachings** [天人遇值经法], **universally receiving salvation and deliverance** [普得济度], **Longsheng Jiùshì dwelling with the Dao** [长生久视，与道同居], **all reverently turned toward the earth** [倾土归仰], and **resided in the Wheel of Rebirth** [咸住轮转].

There was **no birth nor death** [无生无死], **no vigor nor decay** [无壮无老], **no sickness nor decline** [无疾无衰], **no suffering nor annihilation** [无苦无灭], **no action nor inaction** [无作无为]. Their **words contained no discord** [言无戾中], their **mouths uttered no foul sounds** [口无恶声], **all in harmony with compassionate love** [齐同慈爱], **diverse yet unified in kinship** [异骨成亲]. The **land was secure, its people prosperous** [国安民丰], **music and joy resounded in great peace** [忤乐太平], and the **Dao’s origin emerged as its teaching** [经始出教], **illuminating the entire realm** [一国以道].

Those who **previously held sincere devotion** [预有至心], **now revered and followed with ritual** [宗奉礼敬], all **achieved worldly transcendence** [皆得度世]. The **Dao’s words** [道言] declared: What was **called this sutra’s ten prohibitions** [凡谓是经十过], the **heavens all assembled** [诸天齐到], **verifying the names of the born** [检定生名], **and eliminating primordial evil** [罔坠元恶]. When **there were lingering offenses** [及有冥愆], those who **guarded the Dao and steadied their minds** [守道正心], the **spirit came to safeguard the body** [神来守身], and the **body attained Longsheng** [身得长生], **enduring eternally in the latter heavens** [后天永存].

Those who **had not heard the Dao** [凡不闻道], their **anger and joy shifted daily** [喜怒日迁], **water and fire clashed and punished** [水火克伐], **metal and wood intermingled** [金木相连], **not nourishing true water** [不滋真水], **nor subduing the flames** [宁制炎光], **water rising while fire descended** [水升火降], **the Dao’s completion ascended to immortality** [道备登仙]. When **balanced**, fire **descended and hid in the Great Abyss** [平则火降，伏藏太渊]. When **enraged**, it **consumed the body**, emitting **four extreme foul vapors** [怒则焚身，四极恶烟].

Knowing the **Dao of Longsheng**, one **entered the Mystic of Mystics** [义入玄玄]. **Tossing water to bathe in the pearl** [掷水泳珠], **fire dwelled in the Nine Abysses** [火居九泉]. **Fiery flames refined the form** [炎火炼形], **the golden body endured forever firm** [金体永坚]. The **dual uses of water and fire** [水火二用], **only the Sage could transmit** [非圣不传]. Within lay **true earth**, named **Natural** [自然]. **Natural was without knowledge** [自然无知], yet **all things were born from it** [万物以生]. **Fathomless and indistinct** [杳冥恍惚], **motion and stillness without interruption** [动静无间], **heaven, earth, and the Three Realms** [天地三界] **all arose from Natural** [从自然生].

**Natural was the earth** [自然为土], **earth capable of transformation** [土能变迁]. All **emanated from the Great Void’s Natural** [皆从太空自然中生], and **birth was thus endless** [生则无尽], **equal to the Dao’s eternal years** [与道齐年].」

Within one’s self, the **Nine Palaces** [九宫] are seen,
With no **White Hero** [英] nor **Primordial Element** [白元].
The **Yellow Sage’s** [黄老] **Divine Circulation** [运神] aligns with **Auspicious Spirits** [兆精].

**Thirty-two Heavens, thirty-two Emperors,**
the hidden names of all the Heavens,
the hidden names of all the Deities.
Within the Celestial Void, naturally the spirit marks appear,
the hidden names of all the Heavens, the sounds ascending to the South.
The Southern Celestial Sovereign, the Southern Celestial Deity,
the Great Lord of the Southern Celestial Bureau, the Southern Celestial Spirit.

The Nine Harmonies and Ten Unities,
extend life to countless years,
the divine pupil penetrates within,
long vision reveals only clarity.
The Dao of Eternal Life exists,
transformation ascends to Upper Clarity,
its boundless mysteries,
deep and unfathomable.
The virtue/power spreads the true essence,
universal salvation for Heaven and humanity.
Today, joyous celebration of receiving salvation,
passing through all the Celestial Heavens,
requesting the annihilation of the mortal Dao,
fulfilling the command of eternal life,
ascending beyond the Five Realms,
entering the Celestial Bureau to rise in mystique,
penetrating the boundless void,
faintly glimpsing the Jade Heavens,
jade towers in countless layers,
golden gates with thousand doors.

Within lies the Great Lord of the Southern Celestial Bureau’s Eternal Life,
wearing jewels and draped in azure,
riding crimson sandals and dark shoes,
holding the talisman of longevity,
adding years to the myriad.

The Eastern Celestial Bureau refines the soul,
the Western Celestial Bureau subdues the vital breath,
the Northern Celestial Bureau refines the true essence,
the Southern Celestial Bureau nurtures the spirit,
the Central Celestial Bureau’s canopy of glory,
beneath it, the Nine Mysteries are sheltered.

The Azure Emperor guards the soul,
the White Emperor attends the vital breath,
the Vermilion Emperor nourishes the *qi*,
the Black Emperor circulates the blood,
the Yellow Emperor presides as the central sovereign,
all spirits dare not transgress.

The Azure Heaven’s Primordial Sovereign,
the Jade Talisman preserves the true essence.

The Vermilion Heaven’s Primordial Sovereign,
the crimson talisman seizes the essence.

The White Heaven’s Primordial Sovereign,
the golden talisman commands the spirit.

The Black Heaven’s Primordial Sovereign,
the dark diagram guards the body.

The Yellow Heaven’s Primordial Sovereign,
the Five Elders oversee the true essence.
The Five Heavenly Primordial Sovereigns,
the origin of all spirits.
They ride the winds and command the clouds,
overseeing the celestial armies.
They traverse the boundless void,
eternal life inscribed in the jade register.
The Heavenly Emperor’s inspection and sealing,
clouds and silks adorned with brocade,
ten thousand dances resounding,
the verdant hall pierces the void.

The Nine Celestial Dragons circle in flight,
eternal life is bestowed,
the divine pupil rules the four directions,
seated to observe the myriad paths.
The subtle and profound are communicated,
the title of "Archer of the Vault" is granted,
the rank of True Duke,
the myriad subjects construct the mystique.

The sweeping away of all inauspiciousness,
monstrous beasts spewing venom,
four towering blades raised,
their sharpness extended forward,
True Martial wields the banner,
the Celestial Wolf hurls flames,
the mighty sword brandishes smoke.
Dare to interfere,
and be repelled by the Upper True One,
the Heavenly Reaper strikes ahead,
the Azure Tongue punishes behind,
the Black Heaven beheads the heretics,
the Blazing Emperor consumes the essence.

The Three Officials’ swift chariots,
the Northern Tartarus’ ranks arrayed,
no hiding permitted,
eight fierce steeds advance.
The proclamation spreads without end,
all spirits listen in unison,
the Three Realms and Five Emperors,
their words ascend to Upper Clarity.

The Great Mysteriousness begins to divide,
the Five Elders command the spirit,
the Three Primordial transformations,
thus manifesting the true body.

The mouth exhales purple *qi*,
coiling at the roots,
the Five Talismans open,
all things form anew.
The Talismans are the Heavenly Roots,
suddenly transforming into truth,
the Jade Emperor resides in his chamber,
the Three Glories revolve with clarity.

The Six Extremes’ boundless chamber,
entering mystique and emerging in azure,
congealed jade nectar and yellow honey,
forming the Vermilion City.
The Golden Platform stands in layers,
the Verdant Mountains rise in tiers,
beneath them, the seas boil in confusion,
the vast waves stretch into the void.

The Azure Dragon has nine heads,
the Fire Emperor has seven bodies,
coiling a hundred *li*,
spouting smoke and flashing eyes.
The sun and moon are its eyes,
its breath like racing clouds,
its armor of black iron,
protecting the world and safeguarding the people.

Bearing the [missing character],
this is the Dao’s true form,
the firm wind and unyielding stone,
accumulated yang becomes the Heaven.
Above and below the Heaven,
no darkness nor obscurity,
no form nor shadow,
no limit nor end.
The boundless Great Brahman,
the vast and empty light,
the crimson radiance ascends in the East,
the Primordial Beginning nurtures the infant.

At the Southern Celestial Bureau’s peak,
the crimson light glows in the courtyard,
within lies the Great Emperor,
named the Lord of Eternal Life.
Born with the Heaven,
illuminated with the Heaven,
phoenix robes and embroidered garments,
azure mist as his headscarf.
Seated in the boundless palace,
preserving the talisman eternally,
returning to the eternal tower,
his *qi* connects with the Jade Capital.
The Northern Celestial Bureau covers itself,
the Great Unity consumes the essence,
his vision reaches the profound and bright,
he gazes upon the divine scriptures.
The Five Talismans and Eight Substances,
the divine tiger and tortoise markings,
the Primordial *qi* flows and transforms,
the Thirty-two Heavens.

The Wheel turns without color,
revolving through the Ten Directions,
its wings sweep across the heavens,
returning to the Five Constants.

The Thirty-Five Divisions,
all *qi* ascends to the Supreme Origin,
the Eight Scenes merge in obscurity,
*qi* enters the most profound depths.

Within the profound, the scriptures are bestowed,
granting eternal life to all signs,
an instant replaces an aeon,
long gazing brings ten thousand years.

The Great Sovereign, the Highest True One,
the Supreme Emperor—his radiance drifts through the heavens,
he hums and sings the Cavernous Classics.
Golden light swirls and surges,
shaking the cloud encampments,
round brilliance gathers *qi*,
the Eight Seas cleansed in their depths.

The Jewelous Abyss flourishes in splendor,
rich hues float over the capital,
ten thousand harmonies merge,
naturally achieving the True.

Within the True lies the Spirit,
the Great Lord of Eternal Life,
the Noble Without Distinction, the White Primordial Venerable,
the Grand Unity overseeing fate—
Peach and Kang united in extension,
holding talismans and scriptures,
preserving life’s root.

Ascending to the Highest Purity,
entering and exiting the Azure Chamber,
within the Eight Obscurities, in the finest subtleties,
below, he governs the human form,
the Vermilion Palace of the Cinnabar Field,
harmonizing the Five *qi*,
blending with the Hundred Spirits.

Ten revolutions return the Soul,
ten thousand *qi* become Immortals,
the Dao values life,
boundless salvation for all.

Life and longevity together,
gazing into the boundless void,
opening the Eight Gates above,
the Heavenly Law Wheel flies.
Crimes and blessings, prohibitions and vows,
past lives and karmic ties,
universally receiving enlightenment,
the Dao transforms the body.

The body attains eternal life,
hearing the heavens above,
above the heavens, each has a birth gate.
Within are verses of the Hollow Song,
the Sacred Chapters of the Immortals,
words harmonizing with the High True Ones.

**First Chapter: The Song of the South Harmony True Lord of Eternal Life, Flying Through the Void**
I ride the flying carriage,
distant, constructing the Eight Desolations.
The Void generates wind,
jade tones echoing far and wide.
The Phoenix Pavilion rises,
encircling mountains and waters.
A palace of purple gold,
six dragons coiling at its base.
Within sits the Great Lord,
golden form, jade features.
Dignified upon purple clouds,
garments of crimson, shears of rainbow.
Below, he observes the myriad people,
recording virtuous deeds.
Obscurity and transformation merge,
eternal life without end.
Surveying the Ten Heavens,
soaring through mist, floating in the void.
Left, he clutches the Golden True,
right, he supports the Jade Boy.
Reciting this Cavernous Verse,
the Spirit ascends to the Nine Layers.

**Second Chapter: The Song of the Ever-Gazing True Consort, the Chapter of the Bright Jade Talisman**
The luminous pearl, dragon’s crest,
crowned with emerald brocade.
Flowing skirts like clouds,
fragrant carriage, jade wheels.
The Southern Palace, Nine Gates,
the sun appears, the moon hides.
At times, riding the Six Purity,
golden crane, single jade tablet.
Evening glance at Dragon Mountain,
mushroom fields, crimson peaks.
Celestial officials present strategies,
divine messengers stand in procession.
Recording the signs of life,
profound clarity, encompassing radiance.
Double pearls, four rules,
vast vision, no shadow.
The Lord of the Boundless Dao,
the Hollow True, the Jewel Name.
The Primordial *qi* circulates,
the jade talisman shifts form.
The signs of life, the Spirit *qi*,
the Green Emperor’s condensed soul.
Red beams contain light,
eight auras radiant.
Swallowing the jade spring,
dragons lower, tigers rear.
Granting the signs of secret precepts,
morning wind, brocade light.

**Third Chapter: The Song of the Divine Mother of the Supreme Palace Within the Great Emperor’s Court**
Six stars blazing,
opposing the Heavenly Rigor.
The Palace floats on purple mist,
jade cranes in the azure expanse.
The Emperor’s crimson robe,
jade tablet, dragon blade.
The Three Souls and Seven Spirits,
competing at the Well’s peak.
Heaven’s child radiant and refined,
humming, drifting on cloud waves.
Mouth spitting crimson script,
light entwining the radiant heavens.
The Six True Ladies,
brocade pavilion, golden armor.
Swift wind, crimson peak,
phoenix back, crane waist.
Drinking moonlight, chewing the sun,
emerald frost, coral balm.
Ten thousand stalks of dark herbs,
vermilion fruits, abundant peaches.
Granting eternal life.
Long gazing, wandering freely,
saluting this morning radiance,
immortal dew, honeyed wine.
Transforming bone into jade essence,
singing this profound verse.
This, above the Three Realms,
the Bright Jade Heaven’s center,
the flying song through the void,
its tone harmonizing with the Cavernous Chapter.
Recite it a hundred times,
your name ascends to the Southern Palace.
Recite it a thousand times,
the Heavenly Emperor preserves and welcomes.
Ten thousand recitations,
the Dao is complete,
ascending to the Supreme Void,
crossing the Three Realms,
ranked among the Immortal Lords.
Hearing this sacred sound,
the Immortal Kings respect the form,
commanding the earthly spirits,
attending and escorting.
The flowing fire, jade pupils,
naturally enter the body,
the body’s light like the pupil,
illuminating all spirits.
The Immortal of Eternal Life,
the Dao’s embryo forms the infant,
dragon *qi* bathes and purifies,
allied with the Southern Pole,
personally paying homage to the Yellow Old,
receiving the Divine Scriptures by mouth—
this is the boundless salvation,
universally delivering the endless.

There are secret celestial texts,
which all heavens hold in reverence.
To reveal or neglect leads to the hells,
disaster extending to seven ancestral uncles.
The Dao says: These two chapters are the hidden sounds
of the Great Emperor of Eternal Life
and the Immortal King of Eternal Life,
all the words of the Great Primordial,
not the common speech of the world.
Without melodic beauty,
they are all the great laws of eternal life, long gazing, and perpetual existence,
their chapters hidden,
thus called profound and obscure,
difficult to trace in detail.
Treasure of the heavens above,
secreted in the Purple Micro of the Supreme Mysteries,
transmitted according to the Mysterious Science every forty thousand kalpas.
If a perfected one brings gold and jewels with sincere devotion,
depending on the old format and pledging to the Ten Heavens,
then it shall be given.

The Dao says: The movements of Heaven and Earth
also have their endings.
The sun, moon, and Five Stars
also wax and wane.
The most sacred divine humans
also have periods of decline.
The unenlightened
also suffer sickness and injury.
To prolong life and transcend fate,
to surpass the cosmic cycles,
all must pray to the Great Emperor of Eternal Life,
the Southern Pole Divine King.
Then fate is inscribed on the jade register,
one’s name engraved on the golden decree,
crossing the three barriers,
surpassing the eight difficulties.
For any such calamity,
all of like *qi* must unite in heart,
observing fasts six times daily,
reciting the scriptures ten times,
virtue and merit descending,
dissolving all inauspiciousness.
Boundless texts,
universally delivering the endless.

The Dao says: To study the great law of eternal life and long gazing,
the heart must align with Nature,
profound silence, embracing the Dao,
uniting in obscurity with Transformation,
truly communicating with the Jade Purity.
Yet the world is plagued by entanglements,
worldly desires not yet exhausted.
Some, when fate arrives, change their bones,
the Five Organs regenerating.
Some, their spirit lodges in the Nine Palaces,
refining essence, transcending transformation.
Some, with shallow Dao,
their Immortal rank not yet fulfilled.

「When fate decrees annihilation and the body undergoes the Great Yin [1],
even if the great law of eternal life and long gazing is not fully attained,
one sees the deficiency in bodily cultivation yet finds the heart open and unobstructed—
the spirit already immortal, though flesh and bones remain unrefined.

At the moment of passing,
one should gather fellow Daoists of the Sage rank [2] to perform incense offerings,
recite the scripture ten times as prescribed,
and register the name of the departed in accordance with the law.
Directly ascending to the Southern Palace [3],
they are granted the path of rebirth,
and according to their cultivation, the days are counted
until they achieve regeneration.

With the Wheel of Rebirth unperturbed,
one attains the rank of Immortal Sage.

The Dao says:
The law of eternal life and long gazing
has prohibitions most severe.

Some follow the heart’s natural alignment,
profoundly contracting with the subtle Dao [4].
Some seek a teacher to request the law,
able to attain enduring life.
Some gather in the Yin realm [5] the virtues of all beings,
their merit extending to the multitude—
the Celestial Officials [6] record their names,
granting them eternal existence.
Some observe the inner spirit’s penetration,
clearly seeing the Dao’s roots,
gazing downward upon the Two Principles [7],
fathoming past kalpas [8],
near as day and night.

Hosted lives, karmic connections, and merits or debts—
all are as visible as searching for a span.
They walk as companions with Transformation,
emerging from birth and entering death,
their fate controlled by themselves,
prolonging days as kalpas,
hurrying kalpas as days,
a thousand springs as a morning,
ten thousand kalpas as a night—
eternal life and long gazing,
coiling and uncoiling at will,
is beyond what mere study and recitation can achieve.

Some are born with celestial endowment,
their *qi* and essence extraordinary.
Like the gods have Immortals,
the earth has pines and cypresses,
and humanity has the aged and wise—
all are naturally formed with spirit.

Upon hearing the Dao, they attain it;
upon hearing the Dao, they are born—
not relying on teachings or principles,
but uniquely obtaining Heaven’s true nature,
standing out transcendent in the world.

As for when Heaven and Earth’s cycles conclude,
the Three Celestial Luminaries [9] lose their order,
the Four Seasons fall out of harmony,
calamities arise in the land,
warfare never ceases,
pestilence spreads,
and teachers or friends pass away—
one must still observe fasts and burn incense,
reciting and chanting this scripture.

For fasting and recitation of scriptures
hold great virtue and merit.
Above, they dispel celestial calamities,
protect and uphold the emperor,
below, they avert poisonous harm,
and deliver the myriad people.
Life and death depend upon them,
their blessings boundless—
thus it is said: *unlimited texts*,
universally saving all Heavenly and Human beings.

The Dao says:
For anyone possessing this scripture,
able to perform these virtues and merits
for Heaven, Earth, the Emperor, and the myriad people—
on days of calamity,
when they resolve to fast and burn incense,
reciting the scripture ten times,
all the Celestial Beings record their names,
ten thousand spirits attend as guardians,
and they are ranked among the Sage Immortals,
worthy to become ministers of the Holy Sovereign
in the Golden Gate of the Saintly Emperor.

The Celestial Beings record all deeds and transgressions,
not missing even a hair’s weight.
The True King of the Celestial Realm [10]
also champions and uplifts your person,
so those attaining the Dao must truly comprehend
this profound utterance.

The Celestial Great Brahman [11] speaks in hidden tones of *unlimited sounds*,
The Dao Sovereign’s compilation:
*Scripture of the Eternal Life Great Dao Sovereign*,
*Jade Chapter of the Eastern Eight Celestial Realms*.」

The luminous and refined *Kē* [12] is serene and profound,
In stillness, the subtle *Lè* [13] is concentrated and pure.
The incense burns with steady glow,
The essence of the *Dào* [14] is vast and boundless.

Concealed in hidden taboos,
Mingled with the boundless and the obscure.
The *qì* penetrates inward and returns,
The spirit nurtures itself in self-preservation.

Its office blazes upon the isles,
Paired with the august and capacious.
Its chant is profound, silently received,
Its treasures are refined, warmly conveyed.

Bending like rivers to the earthly seas,
Ascending to the heavens with painted harmony.
Jade mists extend in gentle accord,
Alchemical refinement aids the celestial ascent.

**South of the Eight Celestial Realms:**
The *Pōhuí* [15] mists swirl in crimson,
Condensed to descend upon towering peaks.
The primal *Xuánhuáng* [16] nurtures transformation,
Curved depths irrigate the boundless.

The *Kuíshì* [17] chamber emits hollow light,
Three *Chén* [18] courts shine with brilliance.
Emerald and white *Yīngyuán* [19],
Yellow *Zhēn* [20] and the Fire Hall.

Its radiance illuminates the Eastern *Huá* [21],
Its elixirs dazzle with resplendent splendor.
Supporting the *Dào*’s thought, the Dragon ascends,
Guiding the chariot, controlling the *Xiáng* [22].

Capturing the *Tán* [23] with luminous glow,
Guarding the *Kūn* [24] at the *Xuán* [25] well.
The net of arrows stirs the bright,
The *Língmó* [26] is harmoniously complete.

**West of the Eight Celestial Realms:**
The courtyard clouds gather in dense layers,
The *Dīngqióng* [27] pearls stir the senses.
The left pool murmurs with *Mì* [28],
The *Jiéyīng* [29] welcomes the *Shī* [30].

Drawing from celestial abysses,
Restoring the *Tàiwēi* [31] circuit.
The distant *Shān Xuán* [32] is veiled,
The *Hǎngmìng* [33] command is faintly sweet.
The *Yīndòu* [34] aids the mortal frame,
With varying breezes, harmonious in embrace.
The *Chìzhāng* [35] and *Lǜdiǎn* [36],
The *Dàokuò* [37] responds to benevolence.
Unwoven threads merge indistinctly,
Sudden clarity reveals the *Yìhéng* [38].

The *Xiàngpēi* [39] precedes the primal,
The *Huàhuá* [40] blooms with *Sūxuān* [41].

**North of the Eight Celestial Realms:**
The *Yù* [42] and *Tīng* [43] are the leaders,
The *Yǐnglào* [44] governs the *Húnchǒu* [45].
Fragrant tones resound with *Jiān* [46],
The *Jièguān* [47] oversees the *Tàimí* [48].
The Dragon withdraws to the *Dúgǔ* [49],
The *Mǐyù* [50] revolves within the pores.
This [□] *Hóngchū* [51] emerges,
Piercing the *Dòngzhēn* [52] with harmonious brilliance.
Hidden virtues protect the *Zǐ* [53],
Longevity’s splendor shines resplendent.
The *Hūzhēng* [54] summons great slaughter,
The *Hán* [55] commands the celestial attendants.
Ascending beyond hidden peaks,
Silently manifesting the *Líqù* [56].
No name, yet the *Mù* [57] is profound,
The azure void floats with celestial migration.

The *Dào*’s words declare:
These are the *Zhūtiān Zhōngtiān Dàfàn* [58]’s hidden tones,
The sounds of the *Wúliàng* [59].

The ancient text, nine *qì* [60] *Zàngrén* [61] stained with *Bāohuì* [62] beasts,
Flowing with *Liúdān* [63] fluids,
Inscribed upon the *Chángshēng Dàidìjūn* [64]’s Southern *Míng* [65] Hall,
With the *Qīnghuán* [66] tablet,
Letters appearing in the void, each a yard in breadth.
The *Jīnqì* [67] carves with delicate threads,
The *Cǎimíng* [68] shines with violet hues,
The *Zhuìdān* [69] enters the *Xuán* [70],
The *Xuán* [71] again enters the *Dān* [72].

The *Dān Xuán* [73] rises in mist,
Darkly surging toward the *Shàngyuán* [74].
Inscribed upon talismans for wearing,
Recited and passed down in tradition.
The supreme secret is wondrous—
Guard it closely, do not utter lightly.

The *Tiānzhēn Huángrén* [75] once inscribed this text,
Establishing it as the correct sound.
Those who know this sound,
And can fast and recite it,
Shall have the Celestial Beings dispatch flying *Shénwáng* [76],
To descend and observe their form,
Recording their meritorious deeds,
And reporting them to the Celestial Beings.
Ten thousand spirits shall pay homage,
The earthly *Zhǐ* [77] shall guard the gates,
The *Mówáng* [78] of great prowess
Shall champion them to ascend as *Shàngxiān* [79],
Their *Dào* [80] shall be complete,
And they shall roam the *Sānjiè* [81],
Ascending to the Golden Gate.

This sound cleaves through all obstacles,
Dispels all calamities,
Saves all beings,
Accomplishes all things—
The natural sound of the *Tiānzhēn* [82].
Thus, when recited, it summons the flying *Shénwáng* [83] to descend,
The *Shèngdì* [84] to sing from afar,
Ten thousand spirits to pay homage,
The *Sānjiè* [85] to guard the hall,
The *Qúnjiè* [86] to bow in reverence,
The *Guǐjīng* [87] to vanish of their own accord.
The *Línláng* [88] resounds with splendor,
The ten directions are solemnly cleansed,
The rivers and seas fall silent,
The mountains and valleys swallow the smoke—
All spirits tremble and submit,
Summoning the assembly of Immortals.

The heavens are free of *Fēn* [89] and *Huì* [90],
The earth is free of *Jiè* [91] and dust,
The *Mínghuì* [92] is piercingly clear,
The *Dàliàng* [93] is profound and mysterious.

**Scripture of the *Língbǎo Wúliàng Dùrén* [94] Supreme Secret for Salvation**
*Chapter Thirty-One* concludes.
*Chapter Thirty-Two* ends.

**Chapter of the Five Phases in Harmonious Regulation**

The Dao speaks: In days of old, within the Jade Emptiness of Great Clarity Heaven, the Nine-Petal Treasure-Light Divine Auspicious Soil, I received from the Primordial Origin the *Five Phases in Harmonious Regulation* of wondrous efficacy.

When the Primordial Origin Heavenly Venerable delivered this scripture, circling ten times in recitation to summon the Ten Directions, the Heavenly Worthies of True Nature, the Supreme Saints of High Veneration, the True Persons of Marvelous Practice, and the Five Stars of the Upper Clarity True Lords—along with their countless retinues—descended upon the void.

Five-colored radiance gathered, with luminous clouds encircling them. The crimson jade palanquin and the purple *lín* chariot rolled forth, golden wheels turning in the sky, sun-chariots floating aloft, feathered banners linked with clouds, golden guardians standing vigil, flowing rainbows interweaving, and jade steeds ascending with mist—illuminating the azure void.

For three days and three nights, the Seven Celestial Sovereigns opened their divine halls, the Five Battalions aligned in order, the celestial balance and gnomon ceased their motion, the mountains and valleys settled in profound stillness, the Dao of Heaven shone forth, the groves of flowers bloomed in verdant splendor, and lofty towers lined the horizon. The assembly ascended upon the wind, entering the Golden Gate of the Jade Capital, where distinctions of high and low vanished. The earth was paved with precious stones, their hues exhaling like silk threads, and the myriad True Ones attended at the seat.

The Primordial Origin Heavenly Venerable took his seat upon the floating five-cloud platform of ice, jade, gold, and myriad treasures, alongside the Middle Heaven Purple Enclosure Azure Flower Born-of-Virtue Ten-Thousand-Life Dao Lord, the Crimson Flower Yang Virtue Ten-Thousand-Blessing Dao Lord, the White Flower Rectitude Ten-Thousand-Benefit Dao Lord, the Dark Flower One Virtue Ten-Thousand-Life Dao Lord, and the Great Flower Sacred Virtue Ten-Thousand-Compliance Dao Lord—the Five Directional True Primordial Lords. After the Primordial Origin unfolded his diagram, the Five *Qi* divided, the Dao Ancestors aligned, and the Qi-Mother received her distinctions. Thus, the Five Phases in Harmonious Regulation were proclaimed, nurturing and transforming the Three Realms, and the Dao of benevolent rearing for the myriad assemblies.

When the scripture was recited once, the Great Saints of the heavens simultaneously praised its virtue. At that time, within the land, men and women practiced the Harmonious Teachings without fail, and none suffered harm from conflict.

When the scripture was recited twice, the Four Seasons harmonized, and time moved without deviation.

When the scripture was recited thrice, the *Chong* and *Yong* aligned with Great Harmony, and the seasons flourished eternally.

When the scripture was recited four times, the ascending *qi* flowed evenly, and no one aged or withered.

When the scripture was recited five times, yin and yang regulated their courses, and sickness did not arise.

When the scripture was recited six times, all living beings fulfilled their nature, and the ten thousand realms attained peace.

When the scripture was recited seven times, the Five Stars converged in brilliance, and the celestial pearls circled their orbits.

When the scripture was recited nine times, heavenly light descended to aid, and the springs and valleys opened in clarity.

When the scripture was recited ten times, the land was transformed by the Dao, and all under heaven bowed in reverence. At that time, men and women of the land—without exception—turned their hearts toward it, all receiving protection and attaining longevity.

The Dao speaks: When the scripture was recited once, the East Directional Limitless Measureless Brand Azure Flower Nine *Qi* True Worthies of Ultimate Reality, with their countless retinues, descended upon the void.

When the scripture was recited twice, the South Directional Limitless Measureless Brand Crimson Flower Three *Qi* True Worthies of Ultimate Reality, with their countless retinues, descended upon the void.

When the scripture was recited ten times, the Lower Directional Limitless Measureless Brand Yellow Flower Twelve *Qi* True Worthies of Ultimate Reality, with their countless retinues, descended upon the void.

As the ten recitations concluded, the Limitless True Worthies of Ultimate Reality from the Ten Directions arrived together, and men and women of the land turned their hearts in devotion.

Those who came gathered at the sides, encircling the assembly, all desiring to hear the teachings with joy.

The Primordial Origin Heavenly Venerable then summoned the Five Primordial Dao Lords to expound the methods of Harmonious Regulation for eternal life. No creature perished young, and all calamity was forever severed. The entire world rejoiced, and the ages flourished in prosperity.

Thus, the Primordial Origin transformed his form, manifesting in splendor. His celestial seat towered high, vast as the Xiao Terrace, its emerald radiance layered across the eons, measured in billions of *rèn*. The Primordial Saint’s body stood majestic, luminous as a jewel mountain, with the Ten Directional groves of flowers all shading beneath him like an umbrella. His golden hue shone through, illuminating the Limitless.

As the Primordial Origin ascended, the Heavenly Worthies of True Nature, the Supreme Saints of High Veneration, the True Persons of Marvelous Practice, the Five Primordial Dao Lords, and the Limitless True Worthies of Ultimate Reality from the Ten Directions—along with their countless retinues—all ascended to the Mysterious Seat.

The celestial and human assembly gazed upward, each True One dwelling in their own heavenly realm. Jade railings and carved ceilings, golden gates and *láng* halls—none lacked their perfection. The voice of the teaching resounded uniformly among the myriad crowds, hearts communicating without words, the law-sound requiring no question, all delivering the teaching simultaneously without contradiction.

Like cascading springs, the profound meaning poured forth, and all beings clearly understood.

The *qi* of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—
the Five Phases—naturally regulated themselves, their essence free of conflict and punishment.

Though there were occasions of excess or obstruction, they were measured according to Heaven’s subtle intentions, giving rise to harmonious *qi*.

When the Five Phases merged and ascended, their virtues combined, their *qi* balanced, and the Three Realms attained great stability.

As for all sentient beings, their living forms—
constructed by the Three Primordials and refined by the Five Phases—
followed the Harmonious Regulation without obstruction, their vital power nurturing their spirits.

The Void embraces the True Dao, congealed like pearls and jade,
great as a marble ball, its radiance dazzling—
a form manifest in the boundless expanse.

At that time, all celestial beings and sentient life,
through Harmonious Regulation, severed the Path of Death.
All evils ceased to arise; great karmic debts and ancient grudges
were instantly extinguished.

The torments of the hells—fierce flames and molten copper—
transformed into blue lotuses. The Nine Abysses of the Northern Capital
became a Land of Bliss.

When the Five Phases aligned in Harmonious Regulation,
all things flourished in transformation. The Three Realms’ spirits and immortals,
all peoples without exception, were free from guilt or transgression.

The Celestial Hosts sang in unison, the myriad deities arranged rites—
the realm of a single land became like suspended ice-jade,
or a gemstone, its surface luminous and flawless,
without the slightest blemish or speck of dust.

At that moment, when the Primordial Sovereign manifested in the Mystic Seat,
the scripture’s teaching was completed. The Perfected Ones oversaw the transmission,
and bestowed it upon me. At that time, joy and celebration were beyond words.

The Celestial Hosts resumed their stations—
in an instant, silence remained, no trace of sound lingering.

At that time, all beings who encountered the scripture’s law
universally attained salvation, their lives preserved unharmed,
their years complete. All bowed in reverence.

They practiced in accordance with the heart, the Way, virtue, goodness,
the law, the Perfected, clarity, life, and transformation—
speech without contradiction, lips without foul words,
harmonizing in boundless compassion, even strangers becoming kin.

The land was secure, the people prosperous, rejoicing in eternal peace.
The teaching’s origin was the Dao; the entire land governed by the Way.

Those with sincere devotion, revering and honoring it,
all attained the power to save the world.

The Dao declares: Within the scripture’s words spoken by the Primordial Sovereign
lie the inner names of the Celestial Emperors and the hidden sounds
of the Five Phases’ Harmonious Regulation, which preserve all things.
They are also the taboo names of the Five Primordial Dao Lords,
the secret names of the mingled Five *Qi*.

Only the Most Exalted Sage, who has become a True Person,
mastering the Mystic and fathoming the subtle, can fully comprehend them.

If recited ten times, the Celestial Hosts align in salvation,
all things flourish in life, the celestial currents flow in harmony,
*qi* unobstructed, mountains settled, seas pacified.
The Six Heavens run in clarity, the Three Celestial Lights shine steadily,
the Nine Paths converge, demons and spirits submit, returning to the Way.
White bones and corpses, through Harmonious Regulation, are reborn.

For scholars who recite it ten times,
the Five Phases gather essence, the Three Fields nourish the embryo,
no harm befalls them, their lifespan equals Heaven’s.

Thus it is—scholars who chant this scripture
invoke the Five Stars, bringing harmonious joy and peace.
The Six Viscera settle, foul *qi* dissipates,
the heart resonates with the Perfected Truth,
commanding the Ten Directions. The law extends to the Celestial Spirit,
all beings turn in reverence. Disasters do not arise;
one can subdue the Earth Spirits, bind demonic essences,
ward off death and preserve form.

To recite this chapter lightly invites calamity.
To venerate and honor it brings prosperity to one’s gates,
generation after generation, unending flourishing.
With virtuous connections, ten thousand disasters cannot approach,
divine protection guards the door.

This scripture is supreme and wondrous,
unmatched in the Jade Capital, saving countless beings,
the root of all Dao paths.

Its grandeur is vast, its virtue beyond measure.

The Dao declares: For those who recite this scripture ten times,
the Celestial Hosts gather in unison, the Five Star Lords,
and the Five Directional Great Gods descend to their places.

The Three Celestial Lights govern life within the body;
if they collide, rage, or are eclipsed, bringing misfortune,
causing the world’s affairs to falter and logic to invert,
one must fast and recite the scripture.

When the Five Stars align in harmony, the Five Phases regulate,
disasters vanish. Countless ancestors, their suffering souls,
all immediately receive salvation, ascending to the Vermilion Palace,
their term fixed at nine years, transformed and reborn,
becoming noble beings.

Those who love learning and master this scripture,
when their merit is complete and virtue fulfilled,
all attain immortality, ascending to the Golden Gate,
feasting in the Jade Capital.

Scholars who practice and recite this scripture
cause the Five Stars to revolve in harmony,
returning without turning, filling the Three Palaces,
naturally attaining the Perfected State, immediately receiving salvation,
and ascending to the Southern Palace.

When mortals recite it, the Celestial Wheel moves in order,
the Twelve Mansions align without conflict,
their passage timely, *qi* surpassing the seasons,
all in perfect accord. No calamity befalls the body,
True *qi* congeals within, no illness or pestilence approaches,
longevity extends, and all later attain the Path of Corpse-Shedding.

The spirit-soul, though temporarily extinguished,
does not pass through the hells but immediately regains form,
wandering the boundless expanse.

This scripture’s subtlety is profound, its salvation boundless—
all celestial and human beings receive its blessings.

Its immeasurable merit spans life and death, a treasure of Heaven,
not to be passed down to the world below.

Only the virtuous, bearing gold and jade with sincere hearts,
pledging to Heaven before transmitting it.

To leak or neglect it invites retribution upon nine generations,
eternal servitude to ghostly officials.

The scripture is attended by the Five Emperors,
twenty-four Jade Boys and Jade Girls each,
guarding its divine text and protecting those who receive it.

The Dao declares: In the first month, if one observes a long fast
and recites this scripture, the Five Phases regulate,
spring *qi* flourishes, all things sprout and grow,
embryos and eggs develop without loss,
naturally attaining spiritual clarity.
Ancestral souls from past ages, bound to hell or laboring in torment,
are saved and ascend to the Southern Palace.

In the seventh month, if one observes a long fast
and recites this scripture, the Five Phases regulate,
autumn *qi* matures, all creatures harden their forms,
nourished in tranquility. The Golden Essence enters the bones,
the body attains immortality. The Celestial Hosts record their names,
yellow talismans and white tablets erase death for rebirth.

In the tenth month, if one observes a long fast
and recites this scripture, the Five Phases regulate,
winter *qi* solidifies, all things return to their roots,
yang *qi* withdraws, the Supreme One resumes His station,
the Dao of the Sovereign flourishes, the Five Stars converge,
sacred virtue renews daily. The Four Seas calm, the Six *Qi* harmonize,
subjects and ministers rejoice in peace. For ten thousand years,
eternal peace prevails, lifespan equals Heaven and Earth,
the sun and moon never decline. Wars cease, epidemics disperse,
the age is pure, virtue abundant. As king or emperor,
ruler and subject, father and son—
the nation’s destiny is secure, Heaven’s mandate eternal,
generation after generation, unbroken. The sovereign governs his realm,
the people proclaim eternal peace.

On the eight auspicious days,
reciting and chanting this scripture,
the Five Phases align in harmony,
the Ten Directions unite in their ranks,
True *Qi* circulates universally,
the seasons transform naturally—
all undertakings succeed,
inner cultivation is perfected,
and one attains the rank of **Nine Palaces True Person**.

On the day of one’s **Native Destiny**,
reciting and chanting this scripture,
the Five Phases align in harmony,
calamities do not befall—
the Three Punishments and Six Calamities,
the afflictions of *karmic* exhaustion and shock,
all vanish as the stars’ light envelops the body,
the Dao of immortality arises spontaneously,
and the soul and spirit become clear and upright.

The *Qi* of Ten Thousand Years endures,
free from suffering and distress,
the body radiates brilliance,
guarded by the Three Realms,
welcomed by the Five Emperors,
honored by myriad deities—
one’s name is inscribed in Heaven,
cultivation is complete, virtue fulfilled,
and ascension to the **Upper Pure** is achieved.

The Dao instructs:
On days of **Cultivating the Way**,
all should bathe in fragrant waters,
fast and enter the chamber,
facing east,
knocking teeth thirty-two times,
ascending to hear the **Thirty-Two Heavens**,
mentally repenting thirty-two transgressions,
closing the eyes,
quietly contemplating oneself seated within
the **Three Colors of Clouds and *Qi***—blue, yellow, white—
as inner and outer darkness enfolds,
the Five Stars rest upon the head,
their luminous *Qi* swirling around,
the **Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Tortoise, Lion, and White Crane**
arrayed on either side,
the sun and moon casting radiant light,
illuminating the chamber’s depths,
a circular halo forming at the neck,
its glow reaching the Ten Directions—
so vivid and distinct.

The secret invocation states:

*"Supreme Mysterious Origin,
Highest Dao Sovereign.
I summon forth my body’s Thirty-Five *Qi* Officials,
left and right attendants and celestial messengers,
serving boys of jade and pearl,
transmitting words through girls of jade,
the Five Emperors’ direct talismans,
the fragrant officials of the Thirty-Two Days,
each in groups of thirty-six,
to open the way as spoken.*

*Today is auspicious and joyous,
a long fast in the pure hall,
cultivating this scripture of boundless salvation.
May my invocation ascend directly
to the **Supreme Thirty-Two Heavens**,
before the **Most Venerable Emperor of Primordial Beginnings**,
the Most Exalted One.*

*Finished. Draw forth the breath of Thirty-Two Repentances,
facing east to recite the scripture.*

*Primordial Beginnings—Scripture of Boundless Salvation, Supreme Grade of Marvelous Teachings*

*Primordial Mysterious Dao—Essence of the Spirit Treasure’s Original Chapter,*
the Five Phases aligned in harmony,
True Transformation grants salvation.

A hundred demons retreat in silence,
their separation and union occur naturally—
the Great Void, the Mysterious Origin,
the boundless and the obscure, the True and the False.
From the utmost emptiness, the divine arises,
the True *Qi* and divine spirit endure,
the two halves ascending in unison,
as yin and yang first divide.

The black and white essences,
the Heaven’s most exalted treasures.
The central yellow, the earthly foundation,
as the Four *Qi*s withdraw into obscurity.

The **Red Clarity** unfurls its diagram,
and the Five Stars manifest.
Their luminous array,
the Dao’s profound and mysterious essence.

The **True Soil of the Supreme Void**,
its virtue self-named as **Settling Virtue**.
Its parental origins,
**Jia and Yi** as the source.

**Bound and Unbound** seek each other,
and the earthly form emerges.
**Yi and Geng** merge their *Qi*,
and the earth conceives the metal.

The **Metal’s Virtue** is divine and martial,
bearing Heaven’s root.
The **Metal Essence** transforms into water,
as **Heng** and **Xin** align.
Water’s nature nourishes below,
as metal and earth respond to transformation.

**Juxiang** exhales verdant *Qi*,
green sprouts rise like clouds.
The clouds return to the **Upper Pure**,
as **Gui** and **Wu** take form.

The sun and moon contain and nurture,
the **Red Clarity** ascends in smoke.
The smoke disperses, the body unites,
as *Qi* returns to its True Origin.

Divine transformation knows no gate,
no gate exists—emptiness itself.
This emptiness is the **Earthly Sovereign**,
as the Nine Returns and Seven Reversions unfold.

The **Supreme Dao’s essence**,
thus named the Five Phases.
In harmony and alignment,
yang顺 brings fortune, yin逆 brings calamity—
to align the Five Phases,
only the Emperor’s sacrifice suffices.

The **Ten Thousand Heavens** purify and refine,
as vast *karmic* exhaustion brings tranquility.
The Five Phases submit and conquer,
their oppressive and restraining forces differ in strength.
Without divine communion,
one cannot know the **Most Sacred**.

Earth as the **Central Sovereign**,
its *Qi* of the Five Exhaustions is potent—
wood comes to subdue it,
not to conquer or restrain,
but to ensure its harmonious flourishing.

Wood reaches its peak and offends metal,
metal triumphs, fire flows in retreat,
fire blazes, water rushes to aid—
all these are instances of submission and conquest.

The vulgar and ignorant of this world
fail to grasp Heaven’s Dao.
They prize only central harmony,
its balanced and unbiased virtue,
as the Emperor’s **Sacrificial Rite**,
aligning without deviation—
the **Mysterious**, yet again the **Mysterious**.

The **Most Precious** in harmony gives birth,
as pebbles transform into jade pavilions,
palaces of jade and gates of moonstone,
golden towers and emerald cities.
The **Idyllic and Lofty** halls,
mountains of jade in the **Upper Capital**,
the **Supreme Extremity**—the **Supreme**,
the **Great Luo** and **Jade Purity**.

Whether absent or present,
it manifests at will—
vast and boundless **Dharma *Qi***,
pervading formlessly.

Within are the **Three Pure Ones**—the Great Emperor,
within are the **Nine Elderly Immortals**,
the **True Essence** of the **Nine**,
within is the **Yellow Origin**—the **Nine Substances**’ Great Deity,
within is the **White Origin**—the **Luminous Void** Sovereign,
within is the **Supreme Mysterious**—the **Five Spirits** of the **Dongwei Cavern**,
within is the **Jade Verdure**—the **Nine Immortals**’ Venerable Sage,
within is the **Red Scripture**—the **Purple Text** Sovereign,
within is the **Supreme August**—the **Most Venerable**,
**Emperor of Ten Thousand Blessings**,
**Aligned Virtue**, **Primordial Transformation**,
**Prolonging Life**, **Granting Salvation from Calamities**.

the **Five True** of **Taiwei**,
the **Golden Brilliance**—**Boundless Transformation**,
the **White Deer and Vermilion Phoenix**,
the **Green Crane and Yellow Beast**,
the **Ten Thousand Blessings’** steeds,
the **Heavenly Immortals** in procession,
seven hundred million souls,
holding the **Double Pearl of Moonlight**,
wearing the **White Feathered** and **Dark Dry** crowns and sashes,
adorned with the **Nine *Qi* and Three Celestial Marks**,
chanting the **Nine Songs** with resonant tones,
the **Eight Substances** in harmonious melodies,
their **whistling hymns** clear and resonant,
as the **Five Elders** guide the path,
the **multitude of immortals** escort the carriage—
ten thousand chariots, a hundred thousand cavalry,
floating through the void,
their radiance returning as they align,
in harmonious transformation and generation."

The Celestial Marshals of all realms,
the Southern Palace of Nánchāng’s High Officials,
Kàn the Chief Record-Keeper,
the Supervising Vitality Great Deities,
the Five Emperors’ Marshals,
the Sensing-Generation Primordial Lords—
holding the sacred talismans and registers,
all assembled before the Sovereign’s throne.

Following their appointed salvations,
they traverse the cosmic cycles of the heavens,
repelling rebellion and suppressing violence,
harmonizing the Five Primordial *Qi*.
Water and fire no longer contend—
all things preserved intact.
Heavenly, human, ghostly, and divine—
all transform into immortals through the Way.

As loyal subjects, they prioritize virtue and filial piety,
their loyalty moving the Jade Emperor,
their piety reaching the Supreme Mysteries.
Yin and yang in perfect equilibrium,
the Three Officials’ decrees proclaimed,
humans and spirits alike rejoicing,
their ranks swelling in abundance.

Descending to the lowest abysses of Yōudū,
the northern mountains and river sources,
the suffering and liberated of the underworld,
ascending at every moment.

Through harmony, they attain life—
immortal transformation into humanity.
Their original bodies receive salvation,
eternal across all kalpas.
With the kalpas’ wheel, they align with Heaven’s years,
endlessly salvaging the Three Realms of Suffering,
transcending the Five Torments and Eight Hardships,
soaring freely in the Upper Clarity.

The hidden names of the Heavens,
the hidden titles of the Heavens.
Within the celestial void, natural patterns emerge.

In harmony with the Five Stars,
no delay or stagnation.
Those who harbor rebellion are suppressed—
the Dao’s *qi* reverses, leftward.
Offenders are pursued, their *qi* forced back to its course.
From rectitude, all things generate,
nourishing the myriad transformations,
sharing glory with the Sovereign,
none daring to cut short or harm.

Refined essence and concentrated *qi*—
nineteen thousand four hundred twenty-one varieties of grains, fruits, vegetables, and livestock,
the Five Phases generating in order—
those who consume them live long,
free from sickness, naturally attaining immortality.

This text conceals its mysteries—
the enlightened do not speak of it.
Awakening to the True, recognizing the Mysterious,
the Jade Scripts proclaim it clearly.

The Celestial Realms conceal their harmonies,
none prevail through conquest.

Warfare defies nature,
clashing with the Five Stars.

Their divisions in accord bring blessings to the Sovereign.
The eternal *qi* of ten thousand years
extinguishes the *xiān* demons and malevolent calamities,
drowning the perils of water.

The music of rectitude, the eminence of rectitude,
the divinity of rectitude, the magic of rectitude,
the spirit of rectitude.

The two luminaries and six harmonies
follow their courses in the Upper Clarity.

Purple Forbidden spreads its *qi*,
the Wandering Star arrays the stars.

Great Harmony surges and fills—
gold and wood assume the same form.
Water and fire unite as one,
earthly virtue converges together.

Slaying, harming, and wrathful strife—
through rectitude, peace is attained.

Boundless mysteries, profound beyond measure.
The divine and true are manifested,
universally benefiting heaven and humankind.

Today, rejoicing in receiving the passage,
passing through the gates of the Celestial Realms,
I pray to extinguish the delayed, stagnant, rebellious,
and destructive *qi*,
to sever the roots of the *xiān*,
to guide the Five Constants in harmony,
to let the True Flow of the Supreme Mysterious unfold,
as the Five Emperors turn the pivot,
weaving the celestial gates.

The Eastern Dipper prolongs life,
the Western Dipper unites *qi*,
the Northern Dipper nurtures the embryo,
the Southern Dipper directs momentum,
the Central Dipper receives form—
the three realms converge in blessing.

The Green Emperor harmonizes with metal,
the White Emperor aligns with wood,
the Red Emperor governs water,
the Black Emperor aids fire,
the Yellow Emperor embraces the void.

The Five Phases assist in concert—
let any who act wickedly or defy the Dao
be punished by wind and fire.

The True Kings of the Azure Sky subdue the wood spirits,
the True Kings of the Vermilion Sky behead the fire bandits,
the True Kings of the White Sky sever the metal evils,
the True Kings of the Black Sky annihilate the water monsters,
the True Kings of the Yellow Sky suppress the earthly calamities.
The Five Emperors are the sovereigns of ten thousand spirits.

Flying and marching with drumming retinues,
commanding the divine armies.
With banners and drums, they roam the boundless void,
self-proclaimed as resplendent—
the Celestial Realms unite in merit.
The heavens decree for humankind,
strictly restraining the *xiān* demons.

Wood *qi* rebels against earth,
earth exhausts water in restraint.
Water conceals fire’s essence,
fire refines and melts gold.
Gold returns to subdue wood—
their succession brings calamity.

The Five Emperors grasp their talismans,
the Five Stars command dragons.
Guiding the sacred cords,
harmonizing the *qi* in unity,
the Five Phases attain rectitude.
Without conquest or injury,
heaven and humankind align with the Dao,
all things radiant and flourishing,
naturally attaining longevity.

The transformations are bright and harmonious,
heaven and earth revolve in order.
The Six Spirits flourish abundantly,
ten thousand *qi* without fault.
The sacred age is boundless,
ten thousand spirits obey in unison.
The Three Realms and Five Emperors
proclaim the Upper Clarity.

The Dragon Han extends prosperity,
the True Dao endures eternally—
vague and formless, neither hidden nor revealed.

The primordial crystal is vast and boundless,
mixed *qi* radiates brilliance—
dark and red conceal the embryo,
the Five *qi* shine forth.

The domains are fixed in position,
east and west clash and repel,
forms and forces multiply—
some yielding, some rigid.

Wood and metal wage war,
dragons and tigers soar—
yin is restrained by yang,
yang presses against yin.
Seizing and plundering without end,
*qi* and spirit are wounded.

The Primordial Beginning walks the Dao,
the Five Stars are sovereign lords.
The virtuous follow yang’s rectitude,
the wicked bring calamity.
The True One governs the pivot,
the Central Pole commands the spirit.

Through rectitude, transformations unfold,
opening the Jade Capital,
dazzling the Mysterious Platform,
the Azure Abyss as heaven.

Above and below the heavens,
no depths, no darkness,
no form, no shadow,
no limit, no end.

The Crimson Brightness unfurls its diagram,
its movements proceed in order.
The Primordial Beginning settles and governs,
jewel seals and jade scriptures.
Soaring clouds and phoenixes,
the primal *qi* as the root of the Dao.

Preserving the cycles of cosmic ages,
ensuring heaven’s eternal endurance.
The *Fàn* and the Black *Mìluó*—
ten thousand patterns unfold.
The primal cords flow and manifest,
the Thirty-Two Heavens.

Revolving without color,
circulating the ten directions.
The Wheel and Dipper traverse,
returning to the Five Constants.
Thirty-five divisions,
converging *qi* at the Upper Primordial.

This is called rectitude in motion,
not transgressing the divine cords.
The cords govern the *qi*,
advancing and retreating as they lead.
Loving life and assisting in harmony,
the wheel turns without faltering.

Rectitude aligns with harmony,
harmony profound and abyssal.
The Eight Scenes merge in obscurity,
*qi* entering the most mysterious depths.
Within the Mysterious, the Supreme Sovereign,
the Highest True One.

Spreading the luminous diagrams,
manifesting the profound chapters.
The Five Crimson Scriptures
judge and sever inauspiciousness.
The threads of fate are woven,
the Three Realms as a blessed hall.
The Sovereign’s virtue follows its course,
the Purple Court links in fragrance.
The Cloud Residence is serene with jade,
the Sun Gate adorned with golden tassels.
The august and resplendent treasures bloom,
void and natural.

Ten thousand harmonies, ten thousand convergences,
the Five Governments attain truth.
Within truth lies the spirit,
the Great Lord of longevity.

No wood emperor of brilliance,
the White Primordial, the Golden Spirit.
The Great One governs earth,
the Fire Lord commands fate.
The Peach and Kang unite in extension,
the Water Ancestor, the Great Ming.
Holding talismans and scriptures,
preserving life’s roots.

Ascending to the Upper Clarity,
entering and exiting the Azure Chamber.
Within the Eight Scenes, in the most subtle realms,
descending to govern the human form,
the Vermilion Palace of the Cinnabar Field.
Regulating the Five *qi*,
blending with ten thousand spirits.
Ten revolutions return to the numinous,
ten thousand *qi* become immortal.

The Dao of immortality values life,
boundless in its salvation of humankind.
Ascending to the Mysterious Gate,
the flying celestial wheel of law.
Rectitude prolongs command,
sin and blessing are forbidden.

Past lives and karmic ties—
all receive enlightenment.
The flying soul generates the body,
the body attains rebirth,
ascending to hear the Celestial Realms.
Above the Celestial Realms,
each has a gate of birth.

Within are the void and natural songs,
the Five True Sacred Chapters,
words attuned to the Highest True Ones.

First, the True Lords of the Five Stars—
the Fixed Stars of Purple Forbidden
define their celestial positions in flight:
The boundless void, the Dao’s natural essence.
Dark and boundless, before all traces,
the mixed and hollow origin.

「The vague and fleeting essence of things,
when refined to its utmost, does not depart.

Rising in the yin, descending in the yang,
the primordial *qi* flows ceaselessly.

From whence does *qi* arise?
The Great Emptiness emits its mist.

Its clarity is within the embryo,
its divine *qi* a deep, unfathomable spring.

When the Three Five are named,
the Seven Nine are linked in sequence.

*Qi* divides at the cardinal points,
water and fire shift in their transformations.

Strength and weakness, hardness and softness—
the Dao’s work is never complete.

The roots and angles have their origins,
scattered yet present in the heavens.

From this, life and change unfold;
enlightenment brings divinity and immortality.

The Five Agents harmonize in aid,
the Five Bandits as their karmic ties.

Water, fire, metal, wood,
central earth and the heavenly gateways.

Restraining them leads to stagnation,
*qi* shifts into malevolence.

Stillness brings equilibrium,
transformation’s power ceases to flow.

Singing this sacred melody,
one rides the clouds in boundless flight.

**The Second Chapter of the True Lords of the Five Stars—
Harmonizing the Five *Qi* to Invoke the Mysterious**

Golden radiance in the East,
blazing, the Precious Dragon.

Western spirit bestows the talisman,
Southern Mountain thunders forth.

The yellow flags unfurl,
encircling the Celestial Enclosure.

Following the Dao brings no regret,
the true *qi* finds its home.

The brocade carriage gleams with resplendence,
golden steeds with jade reins.

What hunt do I pursue?
I roam the Eight Extremes.

Serving lords and serving parents,
loyalty and filial piety come first.

The Dao’s marvel lies here,
its secrets may not be revealed.

Above, it aids the Imperial Palace,
below, it proclaims virtue.

My Dao stands clear and bright,
its light shines through the Nine Heavens.

Life nurtures in harmony,
creation knows no difficulty.

Spread through the heavenly Dao,
pervading *qi* in endless cycles.

All beings flourish and multiply,
each employing its own essence.

Light extends above and below,
ten thousand *qi* ascend to immortality.

Inner blessings fill the Three Realms,
outer transformation opens the Mysterious.

Heaven follows clarity and purity,
earth follows peace and tranquility.

Humans follow the embryo’s elixir,
repeatedly refining the womb’s gate.

Birth without death,
piercing vision attains enlightenment.

The spirit transforms into the void,
riding the Nine Dragons in flight.

Celebration spreads in radiant hues,
the Five Elders receive their mandates.

Jade strategies and crimson seals,
left calls forth the Flowery Youth.

Right supports the True Lord,
golden flames and fire winds flow.

Following the secret Dao,
ten thousand emperors sing in reverence.

The Five Agents return to One,
the Non-existent within the Existent.

---
**The Third Chapter of the True Lords of the Five Stars—
Harmonizing the Movement and Course of the Five Agents in the Great Azure Song**

The Celestial Market, tiered walls,
stars arrayed in unrestrained splendor.

I hold the jade scroll,
its crimson text in grand characters.

Engraved are the luminous gates,
the crystalline halls in the Northern Chamber.

Ten thousand leagues of starry realms,
immortal citizens in endless ranks.

Within, the sovereigns reign,
purple thresholds and crimson mists.

Clouds fill my abode,
light floats over my pavilion.

Yin and yang, two luminaries,
pearls and jade in resplendent array.

Swiftly they move,
five colors manifest anew.

Retardation and obstruction,
disorder and rebellion—
those who follow virtue face no strife.

By following, one serves the Emperor,
actions align with divine decree.

By following, one serves Heaven,
the Dao is attained naturally.

By following, one nurtures life,
the spirit’s power flows unending.

*Qi* merges with the Great Nothingness,
recording the Precious Map.

Five sacred chapters in jade script,
revolving around the Imperial Chariot.

The Imperial Chariot in the East,
benevolent transformations spread far.

The Great Standard points West,
supporting the lance in perfect accord.

Following the Dao brings governance,
divine creation achieves the marvelous.

My station is the Highest King,
radiant in its purity.

Good and evil are not overlooked,
virtue is their refuge.

Following is the sacred virtue,
all underheavens take it as their model.

Disrupting Heaven’s course,
one becomes the Five Bandits.

The Dao is nearly formless,
obscure yet the essence remains.

Life and change know no end,
the dragon’s tracks carved in jade.

Purple clouds begin to stir,
swallowing the elixir of jade.

Gazing upon the Three Seals,
instantly one’s vision attains clarity.

The Divine Mother and Mysterious Father,
their eyes like sun and moon.

This—above the Three Realms,
within the flying void—
is the True Lords of the Five Stars’ harmonizing of the Five Agents in their most wondrous melody,
its words attuned to the sacred chapters.

Recite it a hundred times,
and one’s name ascends to the Southern Palace.

Recite it a thousand times,
and the Five Emperors welcome in person.

Ten thousand recitations complete the Dao,
ascending to the Great Void,
crossing the Three Realms,
and attaining the rank of immortal sage.

Those who hear this sacred melody,
ten thousand spirits reverence its form,
softening the earthly *qi* and gatekeepers,
attending and escorting in solemn procession.
Rising from the earthly gate,
the Five Sufferings and Eight Hardships vanish,
the Seven Ancestors ascend in rank,
eternally freed from the ghostly offices,
their spirits crossing to Vermilion Peak,
refined anew to take birth.

This is called boundless,
the Emperor’s salvation knows no end.

There are hidden celestial texts,
all heavens hold them in reverence.

Revealing or belittling them leads to hell,
disaster befalls the Seven Ancestral Sages.

The Dao declares: These two chapters are the sacred, hidden melodies
of the Celestial Emperors and the Five Directions’ True Primordial Lords,
all the words of the Great Brahman,
not the common speech of the world.

Returning to the harmonious course,
one’s movements flow as they should,
avoiding all calamities,
descending to gentle *qi*,
blessings as vast as the Treasury of Heaven—
thus it is called profound and mysterious,
its depths beyond ordinary seeking.

The Celestial Court treasures it,
hidden in the Mysterious Palace’s Purple Forbidden Upper Hall,
according to the secret arts of the Four Ten Thousand Kalpas,
transmitted but once.

If a perfected sage brings a heart of golden, precious essence,
and according to the ancient rites makes a solemn pact with the Ten Heavens,
then it shall be entrusted to them.

The Dao declares: When the Five Agents are harmonized,
all beings have their root.
Yin and yang reach perfect accord,
the Three Realms rejoice in harmony.
Heaven and humans live long,
no untimely death or injury.

If *qi* and transformation stray from order,
the stars’ courses overlap,
and the Five Agents’ restraints prevail—
unending punishment ensues.

Then the movements of Heaven and Earth
also reach their limits.
The sun, moon, and Five Stars
also wax and wane.
Even the most sacred immortals
have times of rest and decline.
The shallow practitioners
also suffer ailments and wounds.

For when the Five Agents’ *qi*
does not follow the Dao,
Heaven and humans grow angry,
not pleased,
and the human and ghostly realms
become ominous, not auspicious.

All who face such calamities,
sharing the same *qi*,
must together cultivate their hearts with fasting,
offer incense at the six times,
recite the sutra ten times in rotation,
and virtue shall descend in blessings,
dispelling all inauspicious signs.

Boundless texts,
salvation for all without end.

The Dao declares: The lives of mortals
are limited by fate’s constraints,
their courses bound by mutual reliance,
water and fire intertwined in error,
their numbers destined for annihilation,
their *qi* exhausted at life’s end—
all because the Five Agents’ restraints
converge at the Absolute Barrier.

They do not know that when the body decays and things wear out,
the true spirit, the master of the original essence,
the Dao’s most refined precision,
has not yet perished.

If the Five Agents go against their order,
Heaven and Earth reach their extremes.
Or if shallow practitioners,
their Dao yet incomplete,
face the fate of annihilation,
their bodies traversing the Great Darkness.»

When the hour of passage arrives,
the learned and the perfected shall perform rites for them—
burning incense, reciting the sutra ten times,
to guide the corpse’s form according to the Dao.

The soul and spirit ascend directly to the Southern Palace,
their rebirth determined by their merit,
the days calculated until they are reborn anew.

The Wheel of Rebirth turns without confusion—
thus, they attain immortality.

The Dao declares:
When the Five Stars transgress,
disordering their proper courses,
above, it brings celestial calamity,
below, terrestrial disaster,
and among mortals, affliction.

When Heaven and Earth exhaust their cycles,
the stars wander from their paths,
the sun and moon lose their eclipses,
the seasons lose their order,
and yin and yang fall into discord—
this is disorder toward Heaven.

When mountains collapse and the earth trembles,
when waters surge and springs run dry,
when beasts devour the people,
when locusts and rodents ravage the crops,
when lands sink and floods burst forth,
when winds and fires erupt,
when people are crushed, drowned, or shattered—
this is disorder toward Earth.

When the realm suffers plague,
when wars erupt and pestilence spreads,
when the common folk perish in masses,
when friends and kin meet untimely ends,
when ghosts arise as scourges—
this is disorder toward humanity.

When the Five Agents lose their order,
all things fall into chaos.

To restore harmony with the Dao naturally,
to bring peace to the world,
one must observe fasts,
display the true scriptures of the Five Directions,
erect altars and offer tribute,
and petition the Five Emperors,
burning incense and reciting sutras.

For fasting, chanting, and merit-making are of great weight.
Above, they dispel celestial calamities,
protecting and safeguarding the sovereign.
Below, they avert poisonous harm,
delivering the common folk.
Life and death depend upon them—
their blessings are boundless,
thus it is said: *unfathomable*,
universally saving both Heaven and humanity.

The Dao declares:
Whoever possesses this sutra
and performs these deeds of virtue
for Heaven and Earth, the sovereign, and the people—
when disaster strikes, if they resolve to fast,
burn incense, and recite the sutras,
ten times complete,
all the heavens shall record their names,
ten thousand spirits shall stand guard,
and the perfected shall be granted audience.
They shall become worthy ministers of the Golden Palace of the Holy Sovereign,
the heavens recording their merits and demerits without fail.
The True King of the Celestial Realm shall also recommend them,
and those who attain the Dao shall truly comprehend these profound words.

The hidden speech of the Great Brahman in the boundless sound,
composed by the Dao Lord,
the *Yushu Wuxing Shunzhi Yupan* of the Primordial Spirit,
the Eastern Eight Heavens.

The spirits often change their designs, the jade passes through the mountain’s return.
The Child of the Dao and the True King awaken sevenfold—
the Immortal’s waves support them deeply.

At dawn, the still and the serene are arrayed;
the *Jiānggěng* calls forth in welcome.
The precious incense spreads its blessing,
the Primordial Spirit’s *Shǐlì* prepares the body.

The mighty and the vast stand strong and upright,
the lowly and the humble are discerned in secrecy.
The *Lǔniǎn* chariot rests in its home,
the *Chǔtán* abode shifts the heart.

The demon’s chanting flows through the rivers,
the *Jiūqū* and *Zhāngpíng* are thoroughly examined.
The *Lánqiú* orb shines with sudden brilliance,
the *Qínlóng* and the *Fàn yīn* emerge in darkness.

**South of the Eight Heavens:**
The *Tàixuān* blends with the subtle,
the *Dǒuzhe* turns with radiant splendor.
The *Yǐyíng* shifts to *Qūlù*,
the *Bàogāi* extends without bound.
The *Niàndàng* surges with *Dōngyí*,
the *Jiùmíng* performs its migration.

The *Jídū* gathers in profound light,
the *Jiǔyáo* contracts with distant resonance.
The *Lùjǐ* pierces through *Hánsī*,
the *Jìxiè* summons the West.
The *Fēiyù* hurls itself into *Jiǎn*,
the *Qióngchóu* floats with sprouting seeds.

The *Dān míng* sinks into obscurity,
the *Chángjǐ* reaches *Yǐnguó*.
The *Qiānchuán* spreads the pure cleansing,
the *Fángdǔ* gazes upon the welcoming *Wèngtuó*.

**West of the Eight Heavens:**
The subtle sounds merge with the true,
the *Liǔjì* stillness settles upon the expanse.
The *Yìdiàn* guards with vast protection,
the *Gòujiàn* bestows the *Xíwú* without fail.

The *Zhàngzhang* swiftly confronts the *Chǒu*,
the *Yuèlú* clouds race with *Yúnbēn*.
The *Bùmáng* trembles with *Duōshēn*,
the *Wángzhōng* stands upon the *Xuántái*.

The *Yuāndòng* pierces through the *Èyì*,
the *Língtóng* ascends with *Fúfú*.
The *Xiángníng* truly attains *Zhájia*,
the *Língtí* stirs with *Dīngmóu*.
The *Qínxiān* delights in the radiant,
the *Yàoxióng* transmits the solitary.

The *Fànmíng* shines with imperial splendor,
the *Fēngxǐ* flourishes with the primordial.

**North of the Eight Heavens:**
The *Tàixuān* dwells in the *Wǎnshì*,
the *Qízhèng* stands upon the *Tíngbái*.
The *Shēnchóu* lingers with *Jǐchéng*,
the *Guìzhēn* bears the name *Xīmíng*.
The *Kuòdìng* stabilizes the *Yìgé*,
the *Shūlíng* awakens with *Sùyìng*.

The *Shàotíng* resounds with *Méihuò*,
the *Chǒunà* ascends with *Yìshēng*.
The *Sùyǔ* marks the *Línlì*,
the *Dàohùn* confounds the *Mó jīng*.
The *Wǎngbèi* envelops the *Yuānmì*,
the *Lónggù* entangles the *Míyuán*.

The *Tàiyīn* gathers the Nine Spirits,
the *Mówēi* aligns with the *Cháozhēng*.
The *Shényīng* sands the *Shālán*,
the *Yùngào* holds the *Xiānméng*.

**The Dao speaks:** This hidden speech of the Great Brahman within the boundless sound,
the limitless resonance of the old texts inscribed in purple script upon the *Xuánjī* gate.
By the first, second, and third characters of the **East of the Eight Heavens**,
the celestial divisions are rectified,
and the red script is inscribed upon the **Dragon Platform** and **Jade Mountain’s** central pavilion.
By the fourth, sixth, and seventh characters of the **South of the Eight Heavens**,
the Five Phases are made to follow their natural order,
and the *qì* does not harm or reverse.

The **Three *Huá* and *Tàixuān*** texts of the *Bìluò* are carved upon the **Central *Dǒu* Palace** and the **Grand Marshal’s** court.
By the third, fifth, and seventh characters of the **West of the Eight Heavens’** third heaven,
and the first and eighth characters of its fourth heaven,
the *Kēnmáng* is cut off to prevent harm.
Those who follow this path of rectitude,
before the Yellow Dao,
shall be made invulnerable—
water and fire shall not overcome them,
the true *qì* shall be harmonized and tranquil,
the Dao of the sovereign shall reach its imperial zenith,
and auspicious fortune shall gather and extend.

The **Great *Sùlù*** records its essence in script,
inscribed upon the **Central *Dǒu* and *Jǐ* Palaces**.
The **Dragon Mother’s** mountain in the northeast,
the **Resounding Drum Tower**,
the **True Spirit’s** jade gate,
above the **Watchtower’s** peak.
By the third and fourth characters of the **North of the Eight Heavens’** second heaven,
and the first, fourth, and seventh characters of its eighth heaven,
the Five Phases are made to follow their natural order,
and blessings descend upon both heaven and earth,
so that all spirits revere them,
and ten thousand deities obey.

Each character is broad and long, a *zhàng* in measure,
with eight corners and drooping rays,
square and vast as a seal.
The **Celestial True King** and **Imperial Sage** once inscribed these texts,
displaying them throughout the Eight Heavens and Ten Directions—
above, below, and all around—
as the standard sound.

If one knows this sound
and fasts while reciting it,
the **Heavenly Kings** shall dispatch the **Flying Heavenly Deities**,
to descend and observe their form,
to record their merits and diligence,
and report them to the heavens,
where ten thousand spirits shall pay homage,
the earth spirits shall guard the gates,
and the **Great Merit *Mó* King** shall recommend them to the **True Emperor**.
Thus, they shall attain the Dao,
fulfill their virtue,
and wander the Three Realms,
ascending to the **Golden Gate**.

This sound emerges from the **Void’s** depths,
from the **Great Harmony’s** boundless *qì*,
forming the true resonance.

When the Five Phases are disordered and bring harm,
or when celestial degrees are lost and their movements err,
and calamity befalls the people,
strike this sound and ward it off—
the heavens shall shower sweet dew,
the earth shall yield divine herbs,
golden treasures shall open freely,
and auspicious signs shall arise spontaneously.
It repels all ills,
wards off all disasters,
delivers all beings,
and fulfills all aspirations—
the natural sound of the Celestial True One.

Thus, when recited, it summons the **Flying Heavenly Deities** to descend and observe,
the **Supreme Sovereign** to sing afar,
the ten thousand spirits to pay homage,
the Three Realms to attend at the veranda,
and all demons to bow their heads.
The **Ghostly Essences** shall perish of their own accord,
the **Línláng** treasures shall resound,
the Ten Directions shall be purified,
the rivers and seas shall fall silent,
the mountains and valleys shall swallow the smoke,
and all spirits shall tremble in submission.
It shall gather all immortals,
clear the heavens of noxious vapors,
purify the earth of demonic dust,
pierce the darkness with wisdom,
and reveal the profound and mysterious—
the **Great Compassion**, the **Mysterious Mystery**.

**The *Língbǎo Wúliàng Dùrén* Miao Scripture** concludes its thirty-second chapter.
The thirty-third chapter ends here.

**The Chapter of the Five Directions’ Pure Qi**

The **Dao** speaks: In days of old, within the **Supreme Sovereign’s** **Great Compassion** and **Mysterious Mystery** realm of the **Way**, the **Pure and True** **Dao** of **Wuwei** and **Great Benevolence** arose in the **Bao Hua Ling** **Celestial Gate** of the **Upper Palace of Primordial Clarity**, transcending **Floating Light** and merging with **Original Transformation’s** **Chaotic Unity**.

The **Nine Mysteries** and **Eight Passes** span the **Blue Abyss**, while the **Celestial Wheel of Stars** shines with its **Effulgent Essence**. Within it dwells the **True Sovereign**, called **She Yun Shu**—the **Axis of Rotation**.

The **Dao’s** power is natural, its **virtue** sublime and profound. Within it lies the **Divine Treasure Mountain**, extending through the **Heavenly Interior**, with the **Celestial Gates** of the **Five Directions’ Heavenly Venerables**—**Zi Xiao Guang Ming Fei Xia**—radiant in **Purple Expanse** and **Luminous Clouds**. Its **officers** number a hundred million, its **common folk** a thousand billion, their **lifespans** endless, their **qi** everlasting as **Eternal Spring**. They adorn themselves with myriad floral hues, manifesting **Light**, and the **Jade Sea’s** **Red-Crested Phoenix** and **Green-Spotted Dragon** ever ride the **Nine True** **Celestial Chariot of Playen**, to pay homage to the **Jade Sovereign**.

This **Heavenly Qi of the Five Directions** generates the **Essences of the Five Phases**, aligning with the **Constant Dao of Heaven**, never bound by **restraint or confinement**. Thus it is called the **True One** **Original Qi**, the **Root of Ten Thousand Things**, a **Portent** and **Treasure**. Unlike the **Yin-Yang** **Qi of contention**, which **unites and separates**, **nourishes and harms**, **lengthens and diminishes**, lacking constancy.

The **Primordial Sovereign’s** **Great Compassion** transforms this **True Realm**. The **Five Directions’ Heavenly Venerables** take their seats, exhaling **Pure Qi**, absorbing the **Flowering Roots of the Five Phases**, and letting their **beneficent waves** spread far, reaching the **Heavenly Boundaries**. When **Heaven** receives **Pure Qi**, its **round canopy** stands firm, never tilting. When **Earth** receives **Pure Qi**, its **mountains and seas** are calm and tranquil. When the **Sovereign** receives **Pure Qi**, the **Way’s** **harmony** brings **Great Peace**. When **humankind** receives **Pure Qi**, they become **exemplary and virtuous**.

Those who **aspire to the Dao** and **seek immortality**, aiding the **Rectification of Transformation**, shall attain **true perfection**. The **Primordial Sovereign** now proclaims this **Scripture**, circling the **Ten Passes**, first summoning the **Five Directions** and calling upon the **Five Directions’ Heavenly Venerables**:
- The **Venerable of the East**, **Nine Gods of the Great Void**, **Pure and True God of Boundless Qi**,
- The **Venerable of the South**, **Three Floras of the Upper Extremity**, **Pure and True God of Boundless Dan Qi**,
- The **Venerable of the West**, **Five Clarities of the Great True**, **Pure and True God of Boundless Jin Qi**,
- The **Venerable of the North**, **One True Void**, **Pure and True God of Boundless Zhen Qi**,
- The **Venerable of the Central**, **Jade Flower of the Yellow Mysterious**, **Pure and True God of Boundless Qi**.

The **Five Directions’ Heavenly Venerables**, with reverence, accept the **Mysterious Edict**, riding the **Jade Chariot of Dan Ling**, with **Three Pure** **Flying Clouds** and **Dragon-Phoenix Feathered Canopies**, their **Divine Officers** bearing **Sacred Tokens**, while **Celestial Steeds** clear the path. They arrive as the **Swift Wind**, their **jewel bells** gleaming, **thunder and fire** illuminating the **Heavens**. The **Ten Directions’ Boundless Worlds** tremble in unison, all **Heavenly Beings and mortals** knowing the **Primordial Sovereign’s** summons. The **Five Directions’ Dao Masters** wish to hear the **True One’s Qi** and the **Supreme Mysterious Law** of **Boundless Perfection**.

The **Five Directions’ Heavenly Venerables** bow in homage, and the **Primordial Sovereign** gazes down with **Mysterious Benevolence**, summoning the **Ten Directions** to approach their seats. The **Great True Gods**, the **Highest Saints**, the **True Persons of Marvelous Conduct**, countless as the **sands of the Ganges**, ride the **void** and come.

Their **radiance** flows like **light**, their **jewel chariots** gleam with **rainbow wheels**, **colorous mists** veil the **void**, while **Divine Light** shines and **Sacred Radiance** spreads. **Divine Smoke** weaves in layers, **Treasure Clouds** stack like **celestial mists**, the **winds and smoke** still, and **harmonious qi** pervades. The **Earth’s transformation** grows firm and strong, deep as **golden essence**.

The **Divine Ones** attend at the seat, the **Primordial Sovereign** **playen** suspended in the **void**, above the **Celestial Gate’s** **cloudy peaks**, the **Jade Platform of Marvelous Light**.

When the **Scripture** is recited **once**, all **Heavenly Saints** simultaneously praise its **merit**.
At that time, the **men and women of a realm** first receive the **True Dao**, their **spiritual wisdom** **void** and **open**.

When recited **twice**, their **hearts** align with the **Marvelous Mysteries**, forever free from **obscurity and stagnation**.

When recited **three times**, the **Five Directions’ Pure Qi** **nourishes** the **Flowering Roots**.

When recited **four times**, the **Playen Light** flows and **illuminates**, casting **radiance** upon their forms.

When recited **five times**, the **Red Scriptures** and **Jade Halters** **bind** the **Dead Pass**.

When recited **six times**, **blessings** cover the **Heavens**, and **auspicious portents** arrive in abundance.

When recited **seven times**, the **Four Qi** **harmonize**, and all **things flourish**.

When recited **eight times**, the **categories** **gather and manifest**, ensuring **protection from calamity**.

When recited **nine times**, **evil essences** **perish at their roots**, and **demonic harm** ceases.

When recited **ten times**, the **aged regain vigor**, the **young seek longevity**—
then **all men and women of the realm**, without exception, **devote their hearts**, receiving **protection** and attaining **eternal life**.

The **Dao** speaks: When the **Scripture** is recited **once**, the **Pure and True God of Boundless Qi**, **Five Phases’ Essence**, arrives from the **East**.
When recited **twice**, the **Pure and True God of Boundless Qi**, **Five Phases’ Essence**, arrives from the **South**.
When recited **three times**, the **Pure and True God of Boundless Qi**, **Five Phases’ Essence**, arrives from the **West**.
When recited **four times**, the **Pure and True God of Boundless Qi**, **Five Phases’ Essence**, arrives from the **North**.
When recited **five times**, the **Pure and True God of Boundless Qi**, **Five Phases’ Essence**, arrives from the **Northeast**.
When recited **six times**, the **Pure and True God of Boundless Qi**, **Five Phases’ Essence**, arrives from the **Southeast**.
When recited **seven times**, the **Pure and True God of Boundless Qi**, **Five Phases’ Essence**, arrives from the **Southwest**.
When recited **eight times**, the **Pure and True God of Boundless Qi**, **Five Phases’ Essence**, arrives from the **Northwest**.
When recited **nine times**, the **Pure and True God of Boundless Qi**, **Five Phases’ Essence**, arrives from the **Upper Direction**.
When recited **ten times**, the **Pure and True God of Boundless Qi**, **Five Phases’ Essence**, arrives from the **Lower Direction**.

After **ten recitations**, the **Pure and True Gods of Boundless Qi** from the **Ten Directions** arrive together. The **men and women of the realm**, gazing intently upon the **Primordial Sovereign** and the **Five Directions’ Heavenly Venerables**, witness the **Marvelous Mysteries** and **Profound Depths**. The **Great Gods** transform, their **Nine-Colored Light** illuminating the **Ten Directions’ Worlds**, all **realms** in unison.

At that moment, each one called out to the others, gazing together and leading one another, bearing **Mysterious Incense**, **Precious Treasures**, **Wondrous Flowers**, and **Celestial Garments** with **auspicious banners**—all arriving from the **Ten Directions**.

They raised these countless treasures and marvelous offerings, presenting them before the **Heavenly Venerable’s** seat, swaying gracefully as they transformed into a **Jewel-Covered Canopy**. A hundred billion **pearls and jade**, a hundred billion **jewel-knotted sashes**, a hundred billion **silken banners**, a hundred billion **embroidered patterns**, a hundred billion **divine wonders**, and a hundred billion **radiant scenes** pervaded all the **Heavens** and their worlds.

Thus, the **male officials** and **female multitudes**, all reverently bowed in homage, gazing upward to hear the **Primordial Sovereign, Heavenly Venerable** expound the **Numinous Treasure Dao**, the **Way of Boundless Virtue** to save all beings, the **Five Directions’ Pure Qi**. With single-hearted devotion, they looked upon the **Sacred Countenance** and took refuge in their minds.

Then, the **Five Directions’ Heavenly Venerables**, the **Five Elders of the Supreme Deity**, stood in attendance beside the **Primordial Sovereign’s** **Law Seat**. The **Primordial Sovereign**, having risen and adjusted **His Celestial Robes**, sat again. At that time, **Purple-Golden Divine Light** emerged from the **Sacred Countenance**, its radiance interwoven with all the **Luminous Lights**—intricate and vast, dazzling with myriad hues. The **Heavens and mortals** alike were moved beyond thought or sight, as externally they beheld the **Heavenly Venerable** as serene as a **Jewel-Mountain**, while internally they saw their own **Three-in-One Nine-Palaces** and the **Mysterious Abodes of All Realms**, their **Qi and Light** boundless, ascending from below and descending from above, reaching from east to west and from west to east, cross-illuminating and flooding all things with **Holy Transformations and Divine Miracles**, beyond comparison or measure.

The **Primordial Sovereign** then declared to the **Great Assembly**: *"Now I shall save beings, expounding the **Five Directions’ Pure Qi’s** Law of Protecting Life and All Things. Those who receive my **Pure Qi** shall all attain the **Wondrous Dao**.*

*For the sake of the **Heavenly Worthies and Celestial Immortals** of the **Ten Directions**, and the benefit of all worlds, I proclaim this **Great Law**, so that all beings of the **Heavens** may hear its profound truths.*

The **Five Directions’ Heavenly Venerables** encircled the **Jewel-Covered Seat**, each emitting a **Great Light** that illuminated the world, as bright as a thousand suns, piercing through all the **Heavens**, the **Nine Ten Billion Earths**, the **palaces of Heaven and mortals**, the **platforms of Imperial Sovereigns**—all within the light’s reach were revealed without obstruction.

At that time, within the light, each of the **Heavens** displayed the **Five Directions’ Pure Qi’s Great Dao**, naturally condensing into visible forms, close enough to be pointed at.

Moreover, within the light, there appeared **Jade Scriptures**, **Five Chapters of True Texts**, blazing and unfurling, bending and flying—**suppressing, summoning, and exorcising**, bringing peace to all under Heaven.

The **Pure Qi of the East** manifested as **Dawn’s Nine Radiant Lights**, its **White Scenery** drifting, its **Jade Barriers** piled with **Azure Clouds**.

The **Pure Qi of the South** took form as **Purple Clouds and Stacked Smoke**, its **Crimson Elixir’s Three Essences** generating and transforming into billions of wonders.

The **Pure Qi of the West** became **Luminous Jade and Supreme Purity**, its **Light Rays** condensing—neither smoke nor mist.

The **Pure Qi of the North** descended as **Dark Portal’s Flying Essence**, its **Double Sovereign’s Supreme Subtlety** encompassing **Jade Purity**.

The **Pure Qi of the Center** emerged from the **Upper Celestial Treasure-Cave**, its **Wondrous Transformations** coiling into **Dragon and Phoenix**.

The **Pure Qi of the Five Directions**—countless in form—hung in the **Great Void**, each emitting **Auspicious Light**, bathing the **Primordial Sovereign’s** **Illuminating Fire, Jade Scepter, and Golden As You Wish** above, winding and circling in **Five Colors**, blending into one—vast as the **Bright Sun**, encompassing the **Five Directions**, and all seen things within.

The **Primordial Sovereign** then summoned the **Five Directions’ Heavenly Venerables**, the **Heavenly Worthies and Celestial Immortals**, the **Highest Saints**, the **Wondrously Conducting True Persons**, and the **Boundless Dao’s True Gods of the Ten Directions**, along with the **Limitless Multitudes**, all entering the **Five-Colored Blended Radiant Circle**.

When the **sutras** were fully recited, the **Celestial Worthies** oversaw the **transference**, bestowing it upon me. At that moment, joy and celebration were indescribable.

The **ritual matters** having been completed, the **Heavens** returned to their stations, and in an instant, all traces of sound vanished.

At that time, the **Heavens and mortals** who encountered the **Law of the Sutra** each received the **Pure Qi**, their **Dao-heart** awakening, and they beheld the **Gate of Generation and Transformation**, knowing the **Lineage of the Dao**, all attaining universal salvation and fulfilling their **original lifespan**. When their **years and fate** were exhausted, they ascended to the **Great Void**, escaping **birth and death**, and abiding with the **Pure Qi**.

Their **forms** numbered a hundred billion, their **transformations** shifting between **void and substance**—still, they became **emptiness**; in motion, they became **form**. They universally responded to the **Ten Directions**, aligned with the **Saints of the Dao**, their **awareness** like an illusion, **without action or doing**.

They universally saved all beings, forever severing the **cycle of rebirth**. With **form secure and at peace**, they forgot all **affection and harm**.

The **Pure Qi** entered their **bodies**, uniting with their **transformed and enlightened essence**. They broke free from all **doubtful snares** and **habitual stains**, their **forms** soaring into the **Great Void**.

As **Heaven’s cultivated folk**, they spoke without **florid ornamentation**, their mouths free from **harsh words**, their **conduct** uniformly **benevolent**, their **bones** though diverse, their **affinity** as one.

The **realm was at peace**, the **people flourished**, rejoicing in **Great Harmony**—the **Dao** began to spread its teachings, and the entire **realm** was transformed by the **Way**.

Those who had **devoted hearts beforehand**, who **reverently upheld and honored** the **Dao**, all attained the **salvation of the world**.

The **Dao’s** words: *"All that the **Primordial Sovereign, Heavenly Venerable** spoke within the **sutra** are the **inner names** of the **Five Directions’ Supreme Pure Qi**, the **hidden sounds** of **hundreds of spirits**. They are also the **taboo names** within the **Three Treasures’ Imperial Sovereigns** and the **Grandfather’s** **Numinous Names**, beyond the **common speech** of the world.*

The **Highest Saints**, having already become **True Persons**, mastered the **Mysterious and Profound**, comprehending its **entire meaning**. When recited **ten times**, they summoned the **Five Directions’ True Gods of Pure Qi**, who refined and condensed into **knots**, their **spiritual responses** nurturing the **embryonic True Ones**.

The **Pure Qi of the East** manifested as **Heroic Brilliance**, its **literary splendor and purity**, its **conduct and bearing** of **high worthies**, its **benevolent and forgiving** **Celestial Immortals**—in response to things, it became **rare jewels and strange treasures**, **precious birds and auspicious beasts**, omens beyond the world.

The **Pure Qi of the South** became **Luminous Wisdom**, its **rituals and governance** clear and profound, its **bright and swift commands**, its **spreading of laws and assisting** the **Heavenly Venerable**—in response to things, it became **crimson flowers and artful craftsmanship**, **vibrant colors and lustrous patterns**, the **matters of scriptures and paintings**.

The **Pure Qi of the West** took form as **Righteous Determination**, its **unyielding firmness and rectitude**, its **resolute and steadfast** **Celestial Immortals**—in response to things, it became **armored shells and metals**, **durable hides and teeth**, the **symbols of defensive weapons and military punishments**.

The **Pure Qi of the North** became **Keen and Omniscient**, its **intelligence and strategies**, its **adaptive and profound transformations**—as the **Hidden Spirit** of the **True Mother and Supreme One**—in response to things, it became **serpentine creatures and dark beasts**, **twisting and bizarre forms**, the **seals concealing ghosts and spirits**.

「Central Pure Qi is **Virtue/Power** most exalted, **concealing the Dao/Way** yet vast and encompassing, **broadly tolerant and boundless**, its **grand learning aiding transformation**. For **Emperors and Kings**, **Sages and Sovereigns**, **lofty and divine**, in response to things, it became **effervescent and gentle**, **replete and full**, the **verifications of distant grandeur and sweet harmony**.

When encountering Pure Qi, the **highest** become **Celestial Immortals**, the **middle** become **ministers and stewards**, the **lowest** become **virtuous and sagacious**, attaining **longevity**, **auspiciousness**, and **blessed rejoicing**. Therefore, reciting this **sutra**, all **Heavenly Beings** sing in unison, **ten thousand Deities** arrange rites, and Pure Qi gathers. The **depths grow clear**, the **mountains stand serene**, the **sun and moon unite in radiance**, the **celestial sphere** moves in order—**demons are dispelled**, their **bodies decayed**, yet their **bones return to life**.

For those of **highest learning**, reciting it ten times brings **five Emperors as attendants**, **three realms** bowing in homage—**Pure Qi descends upon the battlefield**, **ghostly demons vanish**, **saving those near death**, even the **dying are reborn**. Thus, it is that **learned scholars**, through **contemplation of the Divine** and **attainment of the True**, sit to summon Pure Qi. When **life and Dao/Way** meet it, then **they attain noble immortality**, **commanding the ten directions**, **uniting with Heaven**, **five Qi harmonized**, **central essence blooming**. **Virtue/Power and blessings** arise naturally.

To **recite lightly** this **sutra** brings **calamity upon oneself**. To **revere and honor** it brings **prosperity to one’s lineage**. **Age after age**, it **flourishes and thrives**—**aligned with benevolent causes**, **ten thousand disasters do not approach**, **Divine Spirits guard the gate**.

This **sutra** is **most sublime and wondrous**, **unmatched in the Jade Capital**, its **salvation of beings infinite**, the **root of ten thousand Dao/Way**. **Majestic and vast** are its **precepts**, its **virtue/power** beyond measure.

The **Dao/Way** speaks: *"Whosoever recites this **sutra** ten times, the **True Qi of the five directions** converges. Applying it to oneself, one attains **transformation into immortality** and **longevity**, and **refined Vital Essence** is complete. Using it to **nurture life**, one yields **great and auspicious beauty**, **radiant and wondrous vitality**. Applying it to **govern others**, one brings **clarity and renown**, **upright and distinguished**. Employing it to **communicate with ghosts and spirits**, one **summons myriad ancestors and souls**—**tormented spirits are pacified**, all **immediately receive salvation**; ascending to the **Vermilion Palace**. Where **Pure Qi supports**, the **five directions unite in truth**—**all are refined over nine years**, **reborn in transformation**, becoming **noble ones**.

For those who **devote themselves to this **sutra**,** when **virtue/power is fulfilled**, they all **attain immortality**, **ascending to the Golden Gate**, **roaming and feasting in the Jade Capital**. Those of **highest learning**, through **recitation of this **sutra**,** the **Pure Qi of the five directions** enters their bodies—**foolishness becomes wisdom**, **commonness transforms into virtue**, and **virtue leads to the Dao/Way**, which **realized becomes immortality**.

To **become saints or deities** is the **rectitude of Qi**. To **become demons or calamities** is the **perversity of Qi**. All **immediately receive salvation**, ascending to the **Southern Palace**. When **mankind recites**, the **five-directional Heavenly Deities** radiate their **Pure Qi**, revealing **true forms**—then **life is prolonged**, and **all attain the **Emptiness Dissolution** **sutra’s** way. **Souls and spirits** temporarily vanish, **not passing through the underworld**, immediately **returning to form**, **wandering the Great Void**.

This **sutra** is **subtle and profound**, **universally salvific without end**. **All Heavenly Beings and mortals** rejoice in its blessings. **Infinite blessings** bestow **mercy upon birth and death**. **Heaven’s treasure**, not passed to the lower world. **Those of highest virtue**, bearing **golden treasures** and **devoted hearts**, **pledge with Heaven** to transmit it.

To **leak or reveal it carelessly** brings **calamity upon nine generations**, **endless servitude to the Ghostly Court**. Attending this **sutra** are **five Emperors**, with **jewel boys and girls**, **twenty-four each**, guarding **Divine Scriptures** and **protecting those who receive the **sutra**.

The **Dao/Way** speaks: *"On the **long fast** of the **first month**, reciting this **sutra**,** the **five-directional Heavenly Deities** ascend the **Jade Treasure Green Splendor Gate**, deploying **Pure Qi of the five directions**, **transforming the three realms**, for **departed souls of the upper world**, severing **underworld imprisonment**, and **salvaging them to the Southern Palace**. On the **long fast** of the **seventh month**, reciting this **sutra**,** the **five-directional Heavenly Deities** ascend the **Crimson Ridge Vermilion Splendor Gate**, deploying **Pure Qi of the five directions**, **transforming the three realms**—**one’s body attains immortality**, **Heavenly Beings record their names**, **yellow talismans and white tablets** erase **death and bring rebirth**. On the **long fast** of the **tenth month**, reciting this **sutra**,** the **five-directional Heavenly Deities** ascend the **Purple Cloud Jade Pattern True Dao Gate**, deploying **Pure Qi of the five directions**, **transforming the three realms**, for **land’s emperors and sovereigns**, **calming and securing their reigns**, **protecting Heaven’s longevity**, **eternal without end**, **always as human rulers**, **securing their domains**, **people calling it the Great Peace*.

On the **eight festivals**, reciting this **sutra**,** the **Pure Qi of the five directions** circulates **around the eight directions**, returning to **unify with the Emperor**, **transforming and giving birth to all spirits**, becoming **True Persons of the Nine Palaces**.

On **one’s natal day**, reciting this **sutra**,** the **Five Elders of the Highest Deities** descend to **settle the five viscera**, and the **five-directional Heavenly Deities** **spew forth Pure Qi**, entering **one’s natal palace**, **Crimson Treasury**, and **Mud Pillow**—**True Dao/Way** unfolds naturally, **souls and spirits** grow **serene and rectified**, **all Vital Forces** endure, **not experiencing suffering**, **one’s body radiant**, **three realms as attendants**, **five Emperors overseeing welcome**, **ten thousand spirits paying homage**, **names inscribed in Heaven**—when **virtue/power is fulfilled**, one **ascends to the Upper Purity**.

The **Dao/Way** speaks: *"On **days of practice**, one must **bathe in fragrant water**, **keep fasts and abstain**, enter the chamber **facing east**,** **knock teeth thirty-two times**,** **ascending to hear the thirty-two heavens**, **bowing in heart to the thirty-two recitations**, closing eyes, **quietly contemplating** one’s seat amid **three-colored clouds of green, yellow, and white**—**interior and exterior dark and profound**, **True Qi of the five directions** enveloping and **circulating one’s form**, **light radiant and clear**, with **Green Dragon, White Tiger, Azure Phoenix, Dark Tortoise, Lion, and White Crane** arrayed on either side, **sun and moon shining bright**, **illuminating the chamber**, **a circular halo** forming at the neck, **light reflecting the ten directions**, so **distinct and vivid**.

The **secret incantation** says:
*"Supreme Mysterious Origin, **Highest Dao Lord**,
Summon forth from my body **the thirty-five Functionaries**,
**attendants and officials**, **jewel boys bearing incense**, **jewel girls bearing messages**,
**five Emperors’ direct seals**, **directing the sun’s incense officials**—**thirty-six each**,

**This is called Boundless**,
**Universal salvation without end**.

**There exists Secret Celestial Text**,
**All Heavens hold it in reverence**.
**Revealing arrogance falls to Hell**,
**Disaster extends to Seven Ancestral Uncles**.

**Dao says:** These two chapters are the Five-Direction Celestial Honored Ones’
and the Most Sacred Spirit Kings’ hidden words—
all are **Mahābrahmā’s speech**,
not the common language of the world.
**Words without melodious beauty**,
**Music without ornate grace**—
thus called **Profound and Mysterious**,
difficult to fathom.

**Supreme Heaven’s treasure**,
**Hidden in Godly Azure’s Eastern Scripture Hall**,
**According to the science**, transmitted every **37,000 years** in response to the age.
**If a perfected sage brings gold and jewels**,
**with sincere heart**, declaring allegiance to the Ten Heavens,
then it shall be bestowed.

**Dao says:** Five-Direction Qi,
if received in birth—
brings **honor, nobility, security, and enduring blessings**.
**Violating its Dao** causes Five-Direction Qi
to **err, disperse, and falter**,
unable to bring fortune and virtue—
then **destiny stagnates, the Three Lights wane and wax**,
**calamities and misfortunes arise, sickness and injury follow**.
**Whenever such disasters occur**,
**all of like-kind must unite in fasting**,
**offer incense at six times**,
**recite scriptures ten revolutions**—
**blessings descend immediately**,
**dissolving all inauspicious omens**.

**Boundless texts**,
**universal salvation without end**.

**Dao says:** If Five-Direction Qi loses its True alignment,
**it brings to mortals exhausted fate, depleted numbers**,
**the end of transformation and death’s seal**.
**Shallow learners, Dao insufficient**,
**destiny’s wheel exhausted**,
**body enters Great Yin**—
**at the moment of passing**,
**fellow students of perfection perform rites**,
**recite scriptures ten times**,
**to guide the corpse according to law**.
**Soul and spirit ascend directly to Southern Palace**,
**by merit attained, reborn in calculated days**.
**Turning the Wheel without doubt**—
**Immortal Perfection attained**.

**Dao says:** Five-Direction True Qi,
**from Dao as its womb**,
**born to spread across Five Directions**,
**forming all Ten Thousand Things**,
**upright in mortals and spirits**—
**Qi aligned brings blessing**,
**otherwise, calamity**.

**True** is **Heaven’s Central Essence**,
**Dao’s subtle naturalness**.
**Violating its True alignment**—
**Heaven and Earth’s momentum ends**,
**Stars and constellations misaligned**,
**Sun and Moon lose their eclipses**,
**Four Seasons disordered**,
**Yin-Yang unbalanced**,
**Kingdoms face disasters**,
**Wars and bandits arise**,
**Pestilence spreads**,
**Common folk perish in masses**,
**destiny exhausted, life’s thread severed**—
**all must fast, offer incense, recite scriptures**.

**The Fast and Its Virtues**

Fasting, keeping vigil, and reciting scriptures—
their merit is profound indeed.
Above, it dispels celestial calamities,
protects and secures the Imperial Land.
Below, it wards off pestilence and harm,
to deliver all the common folk.
Life and death depend upon it—
its blessings are boundless.

Thus it is said: *infinite, universal salvation for heaven and man.*

**Dao says:** Whosoever possesses this scripture
may, for the sake of Heaven, Earth, the Sovereign, and the people,
perform these deeds of merit.
On days of fasting, when one sets the mind to abstain,
burns incense, and recites the scripture ten times,
all the heavens record their names,
ten thousand spirits attend as guards,
and the Right Path’s elect are granted entry
as ministers of the Jade Pure Godly Treasury.

The heavens record each deed and transgression—
not a hair’s breadth is missed.
Even the Magical King of the Celestial Center
recommends one’s name upward.
Those who attain the Dao shall comprehend these profound truths.

Within the heavens, the Great Brahman whispers
the *Limitless Sound*—
**Dao Lord’s Compilation,**
**The Original Script of the Five-Direction Celestial Lords’ True Qi,**
**The Jade Classic.**

**Dao says:** These Five-Direction True Qi
merge with the Great Brahman’s essence,
winds swirling, mists turning,
forming the Jade Script.

With five-colored vermilion brush,
they shine upon the Celestial Pass.
The Five-Qi Scripture—
the Supreme’s treasured decree.
It summons the numinous and subtle,
the profound and mysterious.

The *Five Red Scriptures* are its complement.
The ancient text’s each character spans a *zhang* in breadth.

The **Supreme True Man of the Upper Pure**,
**True Lord of Dao**,
holding the Nine-Precision Celestial Brush,
dipped in vermilion ink at the **Taiwei Qingdu Hall**,
on the **Fengtai Southern Pavilion**,
to establish the True Sound.

Thus the Five-Direction Qi flows,
and the Three Realms are at peace.

Those who know this sound
and fast while reciting it—
all the heavens dispatch flying celestial kings
to observe their bodies,
record their merits,
and report to the Godly Exalted,
where ten thousand spirits pay homage,
earthly spirits guard the gates,
and the Great Virtue Magical King
recommends them to the Immortals.
When the Dao is complete,
they may traverse the Three Realms,
ascend to the Golden Gate.

This sound repels all,
wards off all,
delivers all,
accomplishes all—
the natural sound of the True One.

Thus, when recited, it draws the flying celestials to gaze below,
the Supreme sings from afar,
ten thousand spirits pay homage,
the Three Realms attend at the pavilion,
all spirits bow in reverence,
ghostly intelligences vanish in terror,
the *linglang* chimes resound,
the Ten Directions are purified,
rivers and seas fall silent,
mountains and hills swallow the mist,
all spirits tremble in submission.
It gathers the assembled immortals—
heaven is free of haze,
earth of profane dust,
the dark wisdom is illuminated,
the boundless mystery revealed.

**The Supreme Treasure of Infinite Salvation,**

**The Supreme Treasure of Infinite Salvation,**

**Chapter on the Radiant Ascension of the Two Scenes and Five Stars**

The Dao speaks: In the past, at the Uppermost Pole Heaven, the Celestial Radiance of the Great Bright Land of the Clear Mists and Clouds received the **Virtue** of the Primordial Origin for the Radiant Ascension of the Two Scenes and Five Stars, the highest grade.

When the Primordial Origin Heavenly Venerable expounded this Scripture, tenfold recitation circled the Ten Passes, summoning the Ten Directions—only then did the assembly arrive. The **True Ones** of Heavenly **Qi**, the Highest Saints, the **Virtue**-bearing True Persons, countless without measure, rode the void and came.

Purple mists swirled thickly, jade winds bore resplendent chariots, **Spiritual Clouds** shaded their assembly, casting bright reflections in the morning radiance. Nine-hued splendor shone forth, illuminating the Ten Directions.

For seven days and seven nights, the **Mysterious Breaths** of the Celestial **Qi** gathered and formed into precious treasures, all attending in reverence.

The Eight Winds blew harmoniously, the Four Seas settled in peace, the seasons passed without discord, all things flourished naturally. Within a single realm, earth and mountains, forests and trees, stretched level as one, with no high or low—all soil became moon-white jade and sun-like pearls, five-colored **Spiritual Flowers**.

The assembled **True Ones** attended in reverence. The Primordial Origin Heavenly Venerable, seated in the void, ascended in **Spiritual Transformation** as the **Dragon**’s **Dao**-harmonizing melody dawned upon the myriad forms. After one recitation of the Scripture, the Celestial High Saints all declared it excellent. At that time, the ruler and ministers of the realm, devoted to cultivating the **Dao** and **Virtue**, were moved to reverence the **True Ones**.

After two recitations, the Two Scenes shone brightly.
After three recitations, the Three Talents harmonized.
After four recitations, the Four Seasons followed their order, the jade torches balanced in accord.
After five recitations, the Five Stars circled their paths, never failing through the ages.
After six recitations, the Six **Qi** flowed in cycles, their transformations working in unity.
After seven recitations, the Seven **Primordial Breaths** ceased their vigor, their light extending far.
After eight recitations, the Eight Directions’ constellations aligned, their inscriptions unbroken.
After nine recitations, the Nine Palaces’ sovereigns took command, warding off calamities and averting disasters.
After ten recitations, the Ten Spirits settled in place, eternally bringing blessings and auspiciousness. At that time, all men and women of the realm, without exception, turned their hearts in devotion, all receiving protection and attaining **Long Life**.

The Dao speaks: At that time, when the Primordial Origin Heavenly Venerable expounded the Scripture once,
the **Great True God** of the Endless and Boundless Uppermost Pole, the **Crystal Radiance of the True One**, arrived in the void.

After two recitations, the **Great True God** of the Endless and Boundless Uppermost Pole, the **Crystal Radiance of the True One**, arrived in the void from the Southern Direction.

After three recitations, the **Great True God** of the Endless and Boundless Uppermost Pole, the **Crystal Radiance of the True One**, arrived in the void from the Western Direction.

After four recitations, the **Great True God** of the Endless and Boundless Uppermost Pole, the **Crystal Radiance of the True One**, arrived in the void from the Northern Direction.

After five recitations, the **Great True God** of the Endless and Boundless Uppermost Pole, the **Crystal Radiance of the True One**, arrived in the void from the Northeast.

After six recitations, the **Great True God** of the Endless and Boundless Uppermost Pole, the **Crystal Radiance of the True One**, arrived in the void from the Southeast.

After seven recitations, the **Great True God** of the Endless and Boundless Uppermost Pole, the **Crystal Radiance of the True One**, arrived in the void from the Southwest.

After eight recitations, the **Great True God** of the Endless and Boundless Uppermost Pole, the **Crystal Radiance of the True One**, arrived in the void from the Northwest.

After nine recitations, the **Great True God** of the Endless and Boundless Uppermost Pole, the **Celestial Controller of Constellations and Divine Symbols**, arrived in the void from the Upper Direction.

After ten recitations, the **Great True God** of the Endless and Boundless Uppermost Pole, the **Bearer of Light and Gatherer of Radiance**, arrived in the void from the Lower Direction.

When the ten recitations were complete, the **Great True Gods** of the Endless and Boundless Uppermost Pole, the **Crystal Radiance of the True One**, the **Void’s Day and Moon Constellations**, and the **Heavenly True Gods** all arrived together. All men and women of the realm turned their hearts in reverence and awe.

Those who came were like fine rain and dense mist—countless without measure, filling half the land, which sank unevenly, beyond restraint.

Then the Primordial Origin descended in grace, smiling and laughing, as the myriad multitudes gazed in adoration.

Then, the **Purple Mist** and **Jade Consort** were commanded to open the **Divine Treasure Furnace**, encircling the **Night Mountain Fire Jade** within. They kindled the **Wandering Mysterious Spirit Incense**, and its smoke gathered in the void, like treasures and clouds. A **Celestial Chamber of Pure Jade** appeared, floating ten zhang above the earth in the boundless heights.

The Primordial Origin ascended and led the way; the **Heavenly True Gods**, the Highest Saints, the **Virtue**-bearing True Persons, and the **Great True Gods** of the Ten Directions—all, countless without measure—entered the **Celestial Chamber of Pure Jade**. The heavenly beings looked up and saw only a wisp of mist emerging from the radiant scene, already vanished within the chamber, their whereabouts unknown.

The people of the realm dispersed, and the earth returned to its proper level, no longer tilted or sunken. The Primordial Origin then completed the full expounding of the Scripture within the **Celestial Chamber of Pure Jade**, and the **True Ones** supervised its transmission, bestowing it upon me. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words.

The ritual matters being roughly understood, the Celestials resumed their stations. In an instant, all sound ceased, leaving no trace.

At that time, those who encountered the Scripture’s **Dharma** all gained enlightenment, preserving their years forever, free from harm. All who received the **Virtue**’s transmission attained the **True Ones**’ essence—no disasters, no injuries, no untimely deaths, no ruin, no failure, no errors, no calamities, no decline, no death. Their faces shone like jade, their bodies gleamed like gold, flawless within and without, their **Spiritual Reflections** merging with the **Mysterious**.

Below, they safeguarded their families and realms, ensuring peace and prosperity. From the beginning of the teaching, the realm adhered to the **Dao**. Those who beforehand held sincere devotion, revering and honoring it, all attained **Liberation in the World**.

The Dao speaks: The names spoken by the Primordial Origin Heavenly Venerable during the expounding of the Scripture are the inner names of the Celestial **Supreme Ones**. They are the **Hidden Sounds** of the **Crystal Radiance of the True One** of the Two Scenes and Five Stars. They are also the **Hidden Names** of the **Linglang**’s Three Substances. These are not the common words of the world.

The Highest Saints, having already become **True Persons**, mastered the **Mysterious** and penetrated the subtle. They understood its full meaning, and when recited ten times, the Celestials sang in response from afar, the myriad **Supreme Ones** arranged their rites. The sun and moon cast their beams, the stars reflected their splendor, the treasures emitted their **Essence**, the **Mysterious Breaths** perfumed the Three Palaces. The hundred spirits drank from the jade, the thousand **True Ones** savored the fragrance, the multitude of demons bowed in submission, the **ghostly intelligences** perished in terror. The dead returned to life, white bones became flesh—all things transformed.

The learned and virtuous, reciting this ten times, shall then be scrutinized by the **Day Sovereign** for virtue, and the **Moon Consort** shall receive its essence. They shall transcend worldly calamities and attain eternal life.

This is so because the scholar, though now comprehending its profound meaning, has yet to refine the **True Essence** and must diligently cultivate through toil. As the **Way** ascends to the **Mysterious**, one may naturally dispel disasters and illnesses, attuning to the **Mysterious Qi**, yet only to avert death—not to restore life. A careless recitation brings misfortune upon the body.

To venerate and honor the **Sages**, one’s lineage shall flourish eternally, bound by ties of virtue, untouched by myriad calamities, with divine guardians watching over the gate. This **Sutra** is supreme and unmatched in the **Celestial Capital**, saving countless beings and serving as the root of all **Dao**s. Its grandeur is vast, its virtue boundless.

The **Way** speaks: For those who recite this **Sutra** ten times, the Celestials shall gather in unison. The **Seven Luminaries** shall protect and guide the virtuous, granting salvation to one body, elevating seven ancestors to the heavens, where they shall dwell in blissful ease within the **Celestial Palaces**. The accomplished scholar, reciting this **Sutra** and aligning with the **Way’s virtue**, shall harmonize with the **Heavenly True**.

Ordinary mortals, upon recitation, shall avert disasters and prolong their years, later achieving success. Encountering its sacred precepts, they may attain the **Way of Transformation** to save the world. This **Sutra** is subtly profound, universally salvific—all **Heavenly Beings** and mortals receive its grace, bestowing immeasurable blessings across life and death. A treasure of the **Heavens**, it is not passed to the mortal world. Only the virtuous, offering gold and jade with sincerity, may pledge to **Heaven** and transmit it. Leakage or negligence invites retribution upon nine generations, binding them to the **Earthly Bureaucracy** for endless service.

The **Sutra** is attended by the **Five Emperors**, each with twenty-four **Jade Boys** and **Jade Maidens**, forming a divine guard to protect those who receive it.

The **Way** speaks: In the **First Month**, observe a long fast and recite this **Sutra** to summon the **Day Soul**, preserving life and refining the corpse, merging with the **Luminaries** to attain **True Personhood**. It shall save the souls of the departed, severing their **Earthly Bonds** and granting passage to the **Upper Southern Palace**.

In the **Seventh Month**, observe a long fast and recite this **Sutra** to summon the **Moon’s Essence**, preserving life and refining the corpse, descending with the **Luminaries** to attain **True Personhood**, becoming an immortal. The Celestials shall record their name, inscribing them on **Yellow Talismans** and **White Tablets**, erasing death and granting rebirth.

In the **Tenth Month**, observe a long fast and recite this **Sutra** to summon the **Essences of the Five Stars**, preserving life and refining the corpse, uniting with the **Luminaries** to attain **True Personhood**, ascending in radiant splendor. All shall rely on this for birth, becoming rulers of nations and emperors, securing the **Mandate of Heaven** for their descendants, ensuring eternal sovereignty. They shall forever govern as sovereigns, bringing eternal peace to their realm.

On the **Eight Festivals**, recite this **Sutra**—the **Divine Qi** shall envelop and transform the body, completing the **Mysterious Work**, granting the title of **True Person of the Nine Palaces**.

On one’s **Birthday**, recite this **Sutra** to fortify the **Commanding Palace**, blocking the **Path of Death**, refining the **Soul and Vital Breath**, renewing the **Dao-Body**, transcending suffering, and radiating light. The **Three Realms** shall guard in attendance, the **Five Emperors** shall welcome, and all **Spirits** shall pay homage. Their names shall be inscribed in **Heaven**, their merits complete, ascending to the **Upper Purity**.

The **Way** speaks: On days of practice, one must bathe in fragrant waters, fast in purity, enter the chamber facing east, and strike the teeth thirty-two times, ascending to the **Thirty-Two Heavens**. With thirty-two bows of the heart, close the eyes and meditate, seated within the **Five-Colored Clouds**, inner and outer darkness merging. There appear the **Azure Dragon**, **White Tiger**, **Vermilion Bird**, **Dark Tortoise**, **Lion**, and **White Crane**, arrayed on either side. The **True Qi of the Five Stars** envelops the body, the sun and moon illuminate, their radiance filling the chamber. A round halo forms at the nape, its light shining in all directions—thus, clearly manifest.

The **Secret Incantation** is as follows:

*"Supreme Mysterious Origin, the **August Dao Sovereign**,
Summon forth from my body the **Three Five Officials**, left and right ministers, **Jade Boys** bearing incense, **Jade Maidens** transmitting words, the **Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans**, and the **Directing Day Incense Officials**, thirty-six each.
Open the **Passage** as spoken.
Today is a day of auspicious joy, a long fast in the pure hall, practicing this supreme **Sutra** to save countless beings.
May my petition reach directly before the **Supreme Emperor of the Thirty-Two Heavens**, the **Origin of All Beginnings**."*

Afterward, draw the **Qi** thirty-two times, facing east and reciting the **Sutra**.

**Soul crossing the Vermilion Mound**, **reforged and reborn**.

This is called **Infinite Salvation**, **universal liberation without end**.

There exists **Secret Celestial Scripture**, **all heavens hold in reverence**.
**Leaking or carelessness**—**falling into Hell**, **disaster upon the Seven Ancestral Uncles**.

**Dao speaks**: These **Two Chapters** are the **utterances of the Celestial Sovereigns of All Heavens**,
and the **Divine Xuan True King**, **gathering radiance, racing with the scenery**, **soaring upon the Way of the Five Stars and Sun/Moon**—
**hidden, sacred sounds**, all **words of the Great Brahman**,
not the **common speech of the world**.
**Words without melodic grace**, **melodies without ornate beauty**—
thus called **profound and mysterious**, **difficult to trace**.

**Heaven’s treasure**, **secreted in the Divine Xuan’s Jade Purity Hall, Eastern Hua Scripture Chamber**.
The **numbering aligns with the Year of the Dragon**—**destined to descend in this era**.
If a **perfected adept** brings **gold and jewels with sincere heart**,
and **according to the old formula** **pledges to the True King**,
then **it shall be granted**.

**Dao speaks**: The **movements of Heaven and Earth** also have **times of decline**.
The **Sun and Five Stars** also have **eclipses and fullness**.
The **Most Sacred Divine-Human** also has **periods of rest and decline**.
The **unlearned scholar** also has **sickness and injury**.

**When such calamities arise**, all who share the same *qi* must **unitedly purify their hearts through fasting**, **offer incense at the six times**, and **recite the scripture ten times**. **Virtue and blessings shall descend**, dispelling all ill omens. **The boundless texts** **universally liberate the endless**.

**Dao speaks**: The **unlearned in the Way** are shallow in their understanding, or their **adept ranks are yet unfulfilled**; their **fate may be extinguished**, their bodies **consumed by the Great Yin**. When death approaches, **adepts among their fellow students** shall **offer incense for them** and **recite the scripture ten times**, guiding their **corporeal form to transcend as prescribed**. The **essences of the Two Luminaries and Five Stars** shall **refine and purify the defilements of the corpse**, while their **spirit-soul ascends directly to the Southern Palace**, attaining rebirth in accordance with their **merits and cultivation**—**counted by days**. **The Wheel of Rebirth shall not falter**; thus, they **shall attain immortality**.

**Dao speaks**: When **Heaven and Earth’s cycles conclude**, when **constellations stray from their courses**, when **Sun and Moon lose their eclipses**, when **the Four Seasons falter**, when **Yin and Yang fall out of harmony**, when **provinces and counties suffer plagues or locusts**, when **floods and droughts displace the people**, when **pestilence and poison spread**, when **the common folk perish in masses**, when **teachers and friends meet untimely ends**—all these are the **workings of the Two Luminaries and Five Stars**. **Fasting, incense, and scripture-recitation** must be observed.

**Fasting and scripture-recitation** bear **profound virtue**. They **ward off celestial calamities**, **protect and uphold the emperor**. They **ward off poisons and harm**, **deliver the common folk**. **Life and death depend upon them**; their blessings are **immeasurable**. Hence it is said: **boundless**, **universally liberating Heaven and humankind**.

**Dao speaks**: All who possess this scripture may, **for the sake of Heaven, Earth, the Imperial Sovereign, and the common folk**, perform these **meritorious deeds**. On days of calamity, **when one resolves to fast, burn incense, and recite the scripture ten times**, all **celestial beings shall record their names**, and **ten thousand spirits shall stand guard**. The **adepts of the Right Path** shall **secure their ascent as ministers of the Holy Sovereign in the Golden Palace**. The **celestial beings record every deed and transgression without omission**. The **True King of the Celestial Realm** shall also **commend their worth**, and **those who attain the Way** shall **fully comprehend these profound utterances**.

Composed by **the Hidden Speech of the Great Brahman, the Boundless Sound Dao-Jun**,
**The Primordial Sacred Scripture of the Seven Stars’ Treasure Chapter**,
**The Eastern Eight Heavens**.

「The **Lofty Tower** stands firm and the **Shores of Symbols** are resplendent—
**Yuan Xiao** returns to **Asha**, while **Western Ze** races toward **Gan Ti**.
**Muo Zhan** descends to **Group Mo**, and **Zhi Dou** spreads its blessings.
**Miao Hua** sharpens its brilliance, and **Li Lun** probes the depths.
**Guang E** binds **Jiu Ding**, and **Yun Hun** clouds the mind.

The **Divine Caverns** are profound and boundless,
A hundredfold **Hu Fen** in reverent awe.
**Chi Zhe** rejoices in **Ling Lu**, and **Qi Yi** stores its treasures.
**You Lu** guides the **Shan Te**, and **Fei Yao** ascends without trace.
**Qi Diu** ends with **Shu Jian**, and **Bo Jian** finds no fault.
**Qiong Chi** exults in **Yi Huan**, and **Guan Di** mounts the heights.

**The Way speaks:** These are the **Hidden Speeches of the Great Brahman**,
Summoning the **Spirits of the Two Scenes and Five Stars**—
**Xia Ye** and **Shen Ye**, the **Primordial Sacred Sounds** of the **Highest Truth**.
The **Ancient Texts** of **Yuan Shi** first unfolded,
Born within the **Two Scenes and Five Stars**,
Ascending with radiant splendor, transforming all things—
Each character vast and long, a span in measure.

The **Celestial Sovereign** and **Imperial Sage** once inscribed these words,
Establishing them as **True Sound**.
Those who know this **Sound** and **fast while reciting it**—
All the **Heavens** dispatch **Divine Cloud Officials**,
Descending to inspect their bodies, recording their **meritorious labor**.
They present it to the **Heavens**, where **ten thousand spirits** pay homage,
And the **Earthly Deities** guard the gates.
The **Great Merit** of **Ling Si** preserves them,
The **Divine Way** is complete—
They ascend to the **Golden Gate**, traversing the **Three Realms**.

This **Sound** cleaves all obstacles,
Dispels all calamities,
Transcends all beings,
Accomplishes all things—
The **Natural Sound of the Celestial Truth**.
Thus, when recited, it brings forth **the luminous essence of the sun and moon**,
Makes the **body’s spirit ascend swiftly**,
And causes the **Five Stars** to bestow their splendor.

Refining **qi** into **immortality**.

The **Supreme Way**—
A **Scripture of Hidden Mysteries**, profound and arcane.
The **Highest Deity** sings from afar,
And **ten thousand spirits** bow in reverence.
The **Three Realms** attend its **Lofty Pavilion**,
All **spirits and deities** bind their heads in homage,
The **ghostly essences** vanish in confusion.
**Ling Lang** resounds, and **gold and stone** harmonize in echo.
**Celestial Immortals** and **Brahmanic chants** unite in rhythm,
The **Ten Directions** fall silent,
The **rivers and seas** still their murmurs,
The **Seven Stars** emit their light,
**Heavenly Demons** soar in flight,
The **mountains and valleys** swallow their smoke,
All **sentient beings** tremble and submit—
The **multitude of immortals** is gathered.

The **Heavens** are free of **impurities and filth**,
The **Earth** of **deities’ dust**,
**Ming Hui** is clear and profound—
The **Great Compassion** of **Xuan Xuan**.

**The Scripture of the Precious Treasure of Boundless Dao**—
**Supreme Chapter of Marvelous Teachings**, the thirty-fourth volume complete,
The thirty-fifth volume begins.

**Chapter on the Nine Palaces of the Immortal Register**

The Dao speaks thus: In days of yore, within the **Great Azure Heaven**, the **Purple Cloud** sang the **Primordial Song of the True Soil**, and received from the **Primordial Origin** the **Register of the Nine Palaces of Immortals**, the **Supreme Grade of Boundless Merit**.

When the **Primordial Origin Celestial Venerable** was to proclaim this Scripture, He circled ten times, calling forth the **Ten Directions**, and then took His seat. The **Heavenly True Great Gods**, the **Supreme Saints of High Venerability**, the **Mystic Conduct True Persons**, the **Three Primordial Registers of Immortals**, the **Nine Palace Great Gods**, and the **innumerable hosts**—all rode upon the void, arriving in **flowing clouds and misty heavens**, in **Ling Lang carriages and phoenix chariots**, with **feathered canopies and divine banners**, in **emerald palanquins and pearl-covered pavilions**, their **gold and jade radiance intermingling**, their **nine-hued splendor dense and bright**, illuminating the **vast emptiness**.

For three days and three nights, the **heavens, sun, moon, and celestial palaces** shifted their courses, the **star hosts altered their stations**, the **cosmic threads transformed**, the **Great Scripture unfolded**, the **loom of fate paused**, the **void became profound and silent**, the earth **trembled with jewel-flowers**, the heavens **spread crimson script**, the **harmonious melodies resounded**, the **divine tones emerged**, their **radiance piercing the upper realms**, the **Eight Gates opening wide**. Within a single country, the **earth, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees** all flattened into equality, with no high or low—all the soil became **purple jade**, **translucent and luminous**, reflecting the **round net of the cosmos**, their **flames flowing like crystals**, their hues unchanging.

The **multitude of True Ones** attended at His seat, while the **Primordial Origin Celestial Venerable** ascended the **floating divine transformation seat of the flying dragon’s feathered throne**. When the Scripture was proclaimed once, the **Great Saints of the Heavens** simultaneously praised its excellence. At that time, all men and women of the land **opened their hearts in enlightenment**, intuitively grasping the **mysteries**.

When the Scripture was proclaimed twice, the **hundred deities gathered**, their **bodies descending as jade essences**.

When the Scripture was proclaimed thrice, the **vital breath interwove**, merging into the **True Dao**.

When the Scripture was proclaimed four times, the **round void responded**, the **Five Palaces filled with smoke**.

When the Scripture was proclaimed five times, the **inner wheels turned**, aligning with the **Heavenly Pattern**.

When the Scripture was proclaimed six times, the **great calamities dissolved**, their **obstructions cleared away**.

When the Scripture was proclaimed seven times, the **divine insight became void and luminous**, piercingly revealing the **Ten Directions**.

When the Scripture was proclaimed eight times, the **Nine Palaces registered the names**, and the **bodies flew as listed immortals**.

When the Scripture was proclaimed nine times, the **mercy permeated all existence**, the **blessings extended to the Eight Dark Realms**.

When the Scripture was proclaimed ten times, the **living beings of the cold night** wandered free from suffering. At that time, all men and women of the land **inclined their hearts in devotion**, all receiving protection and guidance, all attaining **eternal life**.

The Dao speaks thus: When the **Primordial Origin Celestial Venerable** proclaimed the Scripture once, the **Supreme Grade of Boundless Merit, Pure Azure Wuyue Palace, Rectifying-Qi Great God of the Upper Primordial** and His **innumerable hosts** floated through the void and arrived.

When the Scripture was proclaimed twice, the **Supreme Grade of Boundless Merit, Yuanhuang Taiji Palace, Illuminating-Scene Great God of the Upper Primordial** and His **innumerable hosts** floated through the void and arrived.

When the Scripture was proclaimed thrice, the **Supreme Grade of Boundless Merit, Dongbai Taqing Palace, Radiant-Luster Great God of the Upper Primordial** and His **innumerable hosts** floated through the void and arrived.

When the Scripture was proclaimed four times, the **Supreme Grade of Boundless Merit, Dongxu Qingling Palace, Functional Great God of the Middle Primordial** and His **innumerable hosts** floated through the void and arrived.

When the Scripture was proclaimed five times, the **Supreme Grade of Boundless Merit, Nanji Dunyang Palace, Register Great God of the Middle Primordial** and His **innumerable hosts** floated through the void and arrived.

When the Scripture was proclaimed six times, the **Supreme Grade of Boundless Merit, Luoyuan Dao Mountain Palace, Primordial-Yin Great God of the Middle Primordial** and His **innumerable hosts** floated through the void and arrived.

When the Scripture was proclaimed seven times, the **Supreme Grade of Boundless Merit, Qinghua Fangzhu Palaces, Preserving Great God of the Lower Primordial** and His **innumerable hosts** floated through the void and arrived.

When the Scripture was proclaimed eight times, the **Supreme Grade of Boundless Merit, Nan Shui Jingxiao Palace, Primordial-Dao Great God of the Lower Primordial** and His **innumerable hosts** floated through the void and arrived.

When the Scripture was proclaimed nine times, the **Supreme Grade of Boundless Merit, Yintian Hunhua Palace, Mysterious Sovereign Great God of the Lower Primordial** and His **innumerable hosts** floated through the void and arrived.

When the Scripture was proclaimed ten times, the **Supreme Grade of Boundless Merit, Xuanji Lingji Palace, Divine Register Great God of the Immortal Treasury** and His **innumerable hosts** floated through the void and arrived.

When the tenfold proclamation was complete, the **Three Primordials and Nine Palaces**, the **Twenty-Seven Palaces**, and the **One Hundred Twenty Departments**—all the **Heavenly Gods who govern life, death, virtue, and vice, and the flying celestial deities**—all arrived together. All men and women of the land **inclined their hearts in reverence**.

The **Primordial Origin Celestial Venerable** then took the **Five-Luminous Treasure Fan** and pointed toward the **eastern-southern quadrant**. The **heavenly light blazed**, illuminating the void. The **heavenly folk**, following the fan’s direction, gazed upward in divine transformation and saw a **Treasure Mountain towering into the Jade Void**, vast beyond measure, its **jade terraces, gem observatories, and flower-adorned gates** arranged in divine order. The **Heavenly True Ones** paid homage to the **Primordial Origin**, ascending the void on **flying steps**, singing praises in chorus.

The Venerable then summoned the **Highest Pure-Mist Heavenly Official of the One-Grade Treasure of the Jade Void**, the **Great Pacifier of the Yellow Gate, the Second-Grade Earthly Official of the Universal Enlightening Territory**, and the **Third-Grade Water Official of the Great Dissolution, Flowing Function, and Mysterious Virtue of the Nine Abysses**, placing them at His right. The **Thirty-Two Heavenly Sovereigns** stood at His left, the **Nine High Saints of the Natural True Kings** before Him, and the **Great Gods of the Sun, Moon, Five Stars, Celestial Loom, and Primordial Threads** behind Him.

The **Yao Crystal and Jade Extremes** held the **cosmic threads**, the **Twenty-Five Great Demon Kings**, the **Ten-Directional Boundless Flying Celestial Gods**, the **Nine-Heaven Commands and Divine Guards**, and the **Three-Realm Divine Soldiers** all stood in order. **Jade flowers scattered through the void**, the **heavenly music played in harmony**, and the **divine procession ascended**, flying into the **eastern-southern heavens**.

The heavenly folk gazed upward and saw **ten thousand chariots and a hundred thousand riders**, **phoenix palanquins and dragon cars**, their **radiance like countless stars**, impossible to count. In an instant, **yellow clouds enveloped them**, and they vanished from sight.

The **Primordial Origin Celestial Venerable** then, within the **eastern-southern jade gate**, completed the proclamation of the Scripture. The **multitude of True Ones** supervised the **transmission of guidance**, bestowing it upon me. At that moment, **joy beyond words filled the heart**.

When the **ritual of the Law** was complete, the **ten thousand True Ones returned to their stations**. In a brief instant, all was **silent and unseen**.

At that time, the **heavenly folk understood this Great Pattern**, universally receiving **salvation and blessings**, all attaining **longevity**, forever severed from **sinking and ruin**. All within the realm **turned in devotion**, all recognizing the **root of life**.

The **Divine and True** opened the transformation, marking the names of the **Nine Palaces**. The **Primordial Harmony** shifted the **qi**, subduing the **evil spirits and calamities**. No creature suffered from **boils or rashes**; all things shone in **harmonious unity**.

The **path of evil was sealed**; the **Dao/Way** was opened wide. Forever aiding the **Supreme Heights**, their **commands spread far**. The **lands flourished in peace**; the **nation thrived, its people abundant**.

The **Scripture began to circulate**, its teachings spread across the realm. Each followed their **innermost truth**, revering and honoring it, all attaining **salvation of the world**.

The **Dao/Way** speaks: All that the **Primordial Origin Celestial Venerable** proclaimed in the Scripture are the **true names of the Nine Heavenly Natural True Kings**, hidden in **coded sounds**. They are also the **taboo names within the Three Primordial Palaces**, the **secret names of the hundred spirits**—not the common words of the world.

When the **Upper Clarity** opened the transformation, the **True Persons** penetrated to **True Understanding** and **Mystic Enlightenment**, all aligning with its chapters.

If one recites it **ten times**, the **Celestial Officials** chant from afar, the **True Lords** arrange the rites, the **Great Abyss** remains tranquil, the **Divine Mountains** gather the clouds, the **Primordial Sovereign** bestows teachings, the **Nine Palaces** register the names, the **Great Demon** is subdued, the **host of evil spirits** is annihilated, the **Returning Spirits** transform their forms, and **rotting bones become human**.

For those of **wondrous learning and high attainment**, reciting it **ten times** brings the **Nine Officials** to guard in ranks, the **Divine Marshals** to bow in homage, the **ghostly spirits** to flee in terror, daring not to offend. They **rescue and elevate** all beings, pulling them from **sinking to ascent**.

The people of the **Divine Land**, newly learning the **Supreme Dao/Way**, if they follow the **rituals** and recite it **ten times**, shall see **ten thousand evils destroyed**, **thousand blessings descend**, and their voices **resonate with the Great Enclosure**. The **Dao/Way** pierces the **Purple Mists**, the **Three Primordials** take up the pen, inscribing the **Nine Palaces above**. When the **fruit is ripe and the merit complete**, they ascend as **Earthly True Ones**, lightly reciting the **Jade Texts**, forever **free from sinking and ruin**.

With **reverent devotion and proper rites**, all wishes shall be fulfilled. **Generation after generation**, the teachings descend, **enlightening all living beings**, with **ten thousand demons** unable to interfere. The **Heavenly True Ones** guard the gates.

This Scripture is **profound and secret**, the **highest treasure of the Jade Clarity**. It **salvages all without limit**, serving as the **foundation of the Spirit Treasure**. Its **sublime and wondrous** nature is **beyond measure**.

The **Dao/Way** speaks: For those who recite this Scripture **ten times**, the **Nine Palaces’ ranked true officials** hold the **registers of life and transformation**, descending to oversee and observe, **erasing the black ledgers of Luo and Tang**, and **inscribing names into the Blue Registers**. The **ancestral spirits** all ascend. In the **Hall of Flowing Fire**, their **essence is refined**, their **spirits summoned**, becoming **heaven’s cultivated people**, harmonizing with **both existence and non-existence**.

For those who **master the profound and attain the ultimate**, the **Great Demon** petitions on their behalf, elevating them to **Red Mound**, soaring through the **Eight Extremes**, feasting in **Upper Clarity**. Descending through the **Heavenly Gates**, they become **worldly sages**. They **proclaim the Supreme Dao/Way**, aiding **enlightened rulers**.

When the world receives its recitation, **all ailments vanish**, the **spiritual storehouse** becomes luminous, **Jade Flower** refines within, **Golden Light** congeals without. Though **temporarily dwelling in the dense earth**, the **Great Yin transforms its form**, the **numbers reach Pure Yang**, and **life regenerates with each cycle**.

This Scripture’s **profound mysteries** universally benefit all, **every living being** receiving its blessings. **Infinite merits** arise from **birth and transformation**. What **Heaven forbids** is not passed to mortals. Only **noble scholars**, bearing **precious jade**, pledge their hearts in **solemn oath** before transmitting it.

To **neglect or slight** this sacred text brings **calamity to the Seven Mysteries**, binding one to **endless toil in the netherworld**.

The **Nine Palaces** attend with **twenty-four Jade Boys and Jade Girls each**, surrounding and guarding the **Sacred Texts**, protecting those who receive them.

The **Dao/Way** speaks: On the **long fast of the first month**, reciting this Scripture, the **Purple Micro Palace** registers the deeds in **Golden Scriptures**. The **wondrously practicing True Persons**, riding the **light of Minor Yang and Bright Mists**, open the **gates of darkness**, rescuing and elevating the **lost souls of past ages** into **Heaven’s Realm**.

On the **long fast of the seventh month**, reciting this Scripture, the **Empty Void Primordial Palace** records the merits on **Jade Tablets**. The **Dragon-Shining Divine Kings** present the names to the **Nine Heavens**, bestowing **vital qi**, granting **immortal bodies**.

On the **long fast of the tenth month**, reciting this Scripture, the **Square Array Caverns** submit the chapters above. Holding the **halter and knot**, the **Heavenly Great Demon** purges the **wicked spirits**, subdues the **hundred precincts**, dispels the **three calamities**, ensuring **peace and prosperity for the world**.

On the **eight seasonal festivals**, reciting this Scripture grants the title of **Earthly True One**, allowing **wandering through the Eight Dark Realms**.

On one’s **birthday**, reciting this Scripture refines the **Five Palaces**, intertwines the **double lights**, gathers the **Nine Primordials** in **harmonious union**, blending **soul and spirit**, ascending on **crimson vapors**, collecting **flowery radiance**, flowing with **spiritual springs**. When **merit is complete and the Dao/Way fulfilled**, the **spirit soars among the immortals**.

The **Dao/Way** speaks: On days of **practice**, one must **bathe in fragrant waters**, **fast and purify** within the chamber, facing **east**, striking the teeth **thirty-two times** to **communicate with the Thirty-Two Heavens**, bowing the heart **thirty-two times**, closing the eyes in **quiet contemplation**, seated amid the **nine-colored cloud qi**.

Within and without, **darkness gathers**: the **Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Tortoise, Lion, and White Crane** array themselves on either side. The **Three Primordials and Nine Palaces**, the **great gods of the immortal ledgers**, stand solemn before them. The **sun and moon** illuminate, the chamber **shines with radiant clarity**, a **circular symbol** forms at the nape, its light **mirroring the ten directions**, so vividly clear.

The **secret incantation** is thus:

*"Supreme Mysterious Primordial,
Greatest Sovereign of the Dao/Way.
Summon forth from my body the **Three Five Officials**, the **left and right attendants**, the **fragrant jade boys**, the **speaking jade girls**, the **Five Emperors’ direct symbols**, the **direct-day fragrant officials**—each thirty-six in number—**opening the gates** as spoken.

Today is a day of **auspicious joy**, a **long fast in the pure hall**, practicing this **supreme Scripture** to **salvage countless beings**.
May what is invoked **ascend directly** to the **Supreme Thirty-Two Heavens**, before the **Primordial Origin Emperor of Infinite Degrees, Most Exalted**.

Celebrating the gathering of auspicious causes,
With the kalpas turning in cycles,
And years aligned with the Heavens.

Passing beyond the Three Calamities,

**Thirty-Two Heavens**, **Thirty-Two Sovereigns**.
The Heavens conceal their names,
The Heavens conceal their signs.
Within the celestial void, scriptures manifest naturally.

The Heavens conceal their sounds,
The divine voices of the Heavens—
The exalted, the revered, the celestial gods.
They oversee true demons and *Dharma*’s hidden records.

Nine cycles, ten revolutions,
Transformations beyond mortal ken.
Boundless mysteries, vast beyond measure.
The primordial records of truth,
Uniting Heavens and humans.
The sacred registers of virtue,
Ascending to the lofty *Xuan* court.

Today, the Mystic Pass responds in kind,
Revealing the boundless decree—
Erasing the dark ledgers,
Bending the humble to rise high,
Guiding the winds to the upper ranges,
Transcending the weak to cross the abyss,
Subduing great demons,
All bow in unison before the Jade Pavilion.

The **Four Celestial Lodes** arise:
**Eastern Dipper** governs birth,
**Western Dipper** holds authority,
**Northern Dipper** dispenses blessings,
**Southern Dipper** rules migration,
**Central Dipper** broadens transformation,
Commanding the divine officials.

The **Five Celestial Sovereigns** descend:

**Black Sovereign** unites intentions,
**Yellow Sovereign** sits in vigil,
Bestowing great benevolence upon the Heavens.

**White Palace**, where the Sovereign’s luminous scenes flourish in splendor—
**Black Palace**, where the Sovereign’s violet purity enfolds—
**Yellow Palace**, where the Sovereign’s golden transformations manifest naturally.

The Five Palaces’ lofty spirits,
The revered ones of ten thousand Heavens.
Soaring through the Nine Enclosures,
Commanding the Heavenly armies.
Holding banners and wielding decrees,
Roaming the boundless expanse,
Their divine might resounding,
Aligned with the Dao’s eternal flow.

Ascending to govern mortals,
The Great Constitution spreads.
The Primordial Sovereign receives the mandate,
Sweeping away all inauspiciousness.
Stone-light gleams in radiance,
Heaven’s decrees unfold in full.

Jade steeds gallop, colossal beasts bear the peaks.
Fiery essences disperse far,
Sealing the divine villages.
Daring to transgress,
They are bound and slaughtered.
The Mystic Axe strikes left,
The Jade Cleaver fells right.
Dispelling monstrous illusions,
Severing the wayward and rebellious.

Rectifying the Heavenly Primordial,
The sacred movements converge.
Demons dare not test their limits,
Evil cannot hide its form.
The Nine Offices array their officials,
Registering the demonic camps.
No room for negligence,
Heaven’s ministers swiftly present.

Proclaiming to the divine gates,
All true spirits listen in awe.
The Three Realms and Ten Extremes,
All make known the decree.

The sacred texts and jade registers,
The crimson scriptures and hidden volumes.
The Five Transformations align with the eternal laws,
The Three *Qi*’s push forth in endless cycles.
The Great Primordial shapes itself,
Crystal brilliance unfolds in ceaseless radiance.

The boundless void merges with vast kalpas,
Ascending beings cross the abyss.
The Six *Qi*’s alternate in endless succession,
The boundless expanse knows no edge.

Above, the Five Lodes are arrayed,
Below, the Nine Abysses are spread.
Winds envelop the Great Void,
Waters swirl in celestial currents.
The Jade Capital stands firm,
The Nine Cities of the Great Primordial.

Lofty and splendid, the divine mansions,
Where the *Dharma*’s records command the true.
Emerald mists rise in misty splendor,
Long-lasting breezes scatter the Azure.
Congealing into mountains and peaks,
Flowing as rivers and streams.
The Central Treasury holds the upper spirits,
Commanding all cosmic threads.

The Primordial threads turn in cycles,
Through the Three Realms and all Heavens.
Enveloping the jade void,
Twisting the birth-gates.
Recording the revolutions of scriptures,
Returning the courses to their source.

Thirty-Nine Sovereigns,
Commanding the Four Mysteries.
Eight Treatments divide the true,
The *qi*’s merge with the abyssal sources.

Within the Central Palace, the Purple Court,
The Jade Treasury and Vermilion Mists.
Feasting on the divine scene,
Singing in hidden splendor.
Golden scriptures shine forth,
The Void Palace drifts in clouds.
Jade orbs refine the essence,
Divine sounds disperse in currents.
The Azure Gate unfolds in brilliance,
Opening the way to primordial virtue.

The lofty eminence of the *Yang* Valley.
The Infant Lord and the Marshal of Records,
The Thousand-Pure Primordial One.
Holding the jade talisman in command,
Preserving the sacred rites of life’s roots.
Ascending to the Great Void,
Entering and exiting the Encircled Rotations.
The Jade Mountains’ crags,
The lofty peaks of the Azure.

Descending to respond to mortal form,
The Five Treasures and divine rivers.」

The brain’s palace gates,
The square pool overflows with myriad treasures.
Six apertures return the primal springs,
The **Yīng** [1] essence soars in emerald brilliance.

Emerald splendor of the Nine Mysteries,
Unlocking the degrees for Heaven and Man.
Above, it ascends to the cloudly **Gāng**[2],
Eight Gates and the jade-wheeled **Lún**[3].

Great blessings and prohibitions,
Karma’s cause and effect.
Universal salvation and deliverance,
For the dead soul and the living body.

The body attains rebirth,
Above, it hears the Imperial Court.
Within the Imperial Court,
Each holds its own **Xuán** [4] sound.
There are Nine Palaces within,
Between the opening and closing,
The Three **Yuán**[5]’s sacred hymns,
Words harmonizing with the lofty **Zhēn**[6].

The first Nine-Palace chant of the gathered immortals,
Flying through the void—
Eight luminous and four ethereal,
Encompassing the Nine Mysteries.

The Crimson **Hún**[7]’s clarity,
Intertwined with the vast **Tài** [8] space.
Above the Eight **Yuán**[9],
Within the Windy **Zé**[10].

The **Dòng** [11] merges with the boundless,
Below, it steadies the Northern **Tíng**[12].
The Three **Guān**[13] govern in unison,
Within, the supreme **Shén**[14].
Holding the Heavenly Great **Xìan**[15],
Matching the Dao’s sovereign power.
Established as the Heavenly Emperor,
Overseen by the Jade **Zhēn**[16].
Wondrous transformations give birth,
To the Thirty-Nine Lords.

Above, they assist the **Yuánshǐ**[17],
In the Great **Jiè**[18], they are revered as **Zūn**[19].
Entering and exiting existence,
Soaring through the Jade **Jīng**[20].
The **Dòng** [21] chapter descends to teach,
The Ten Thousand Heavens proclaim its passage.

The second Nine-Palace chant of the immortal registers—
Purple jade celestial strategy,
Jade **Jí**’s true **Kē**[22].
Lofty **Zhēn**[23] concealed in mystery,
Above, it is sealed within the **Yuánluó**[24].
Crimson beads arrayed in names.
Purple silk of the Three **Huá**[25].
Flying immortals listed as saints,
Crimson script radiant with **Xiá**[26].
Dark gold sacred tablets.
Yellow jade pliant scrolls.
Recording all the **Zhēn**[27],
The Emperor’s heart weighs them.
The **Tàijí Xuán** [28] Palace,
Registers the immortals’ fate.
Pitying worldly beings,
Chasing transient things,
Their souls ascend, their spirits descend,
Drowning in the Nine **Quán**[29].
Why not climb the mountains?
Recite this **Dòng** [30] passage.
One enlightenment to the supreme Dao,
The body ascends to the Imperial **Xuān**[31].

The third **Tàijí** Nine-Palace hymn—
The **Tàiqīng** Nine Directions,
Returning brilliance like flowing clouds.
Holding the Heavenly **Jī**,
Opening the path to the Azure **Míng**[32].
Jade **Shān** and Purple **Hé**,
Dark **Wéi** [33] and Mysteries as neighbors.
The **Tàiwéi** Upper Registry,
Within, the Old Man [34].
Ascending Heaven, concealing the Dao,
Merging with the scene, giving birth to form.
Fanning the sky, the **Lú** clouds unfold,
Crimson light shines resplendent.
The Heavenly wheel revolves in cycles,
Scriptures transform the primal **Chéng**[35].
The Nine **Yuán** [36] enfold,
Opening the Dao at the **Jīn** crossing [37].
The **Qīngwéi** Emperor, the One,
The **Dàdòng** Spirit’s lofty **Zūn**[38].
Silent contemplation aligns with the Great **Yǒu**[39],
Naturally attaining the supreme **Zhēn**[40].
Seeking the Nine-Palace immortal songs,
Aspiring to join the Emperor’s celestial court.

This is the Three Realms above,
The near-void within,
The True King’s sacred melody,
Its words resonating with the **Dòng** chapter.

Recite it a hundred times,
To be named and delivered to the Southern **Gōng**[41].
Recite it a thousand times,
The True King will welcome you.
Ten thousand times, the Dao is complete.
Ascending through the Nine Palaces,
Crossing the Three Realms,
Rank attained among the **Xiān** lords.
Hearing the sacred sounds,
The **Mó** King reveres the form,
The **Dìzhǐ** [42] are ordered to guard,
Escorting and welcoming,
Drawn forth from the earthly **Hù**[43],
Free from the Five Sorrows and Eight Hardships [44],
The Seven **Zǔ** ascend in rank,
Forever departing from the Northern **Shān**[45],
The soul delivered to the Crimson **Líng**[46],
Refined and reborn again.

This is called the boundless,
Universal deliverance without end.
There are secrets to the Heavenly texts,
All the Heavens hold them in reverence.
Revealing them in carelessness,
One falls into the **Dìyù**[47].
Disaster befalls the Seven **Zǔ** Ancestors.

The Dao says: These two chapters are the hidden sounds
Of all the Heavenly Emperors,
And the Nine-Palace immortal registers.
Within, there are the Nine **Zhēn**—
The **Xióngyī** [48] masculine,
The **Cīyī** [49] feminine,
The true **Hùi** [50] names,
The saints’ inner designations.
Those who chant and recite them,
Engrave the **Tàijí**,
Will verify their rank in the Nine Palaces.

Within the brain, there is the **Zǐfáng** True Spirit,
Seated facing outward,
Hearing this scripture’s voice,
Ascending to harmonize with **Tàijí**,
Descending to respond to the **Dòng** echoes,
The Nine-Palace spirits,
Proclaiming the signs of the immortal **Qī**[51].

All are the words of the Great **Fàn**[52],
Not the common speech of the world.
Words without rhyme and grace,
Melodies without splendor and elegance.

Thus it is called the profound and mysterious—
difficult to trace in detail.
The Heavenly Sovereign treasures it,
secreted within the Highest Celestial’s **Shénxiāo** [Divine Mists],
the **Yùqīng** [Jade Clarity] **Yùfǔ** [Jade Palace],
in the Eastern Platform’s **Bǎozàng** [Treasure Vault],
according to the **kē** [scriptural] cycle of thirty-seven thousand years,
transmitted downward with the cosmic flow.

If there be a **Zhìrén** [Perfected Sage] bearing gold and jade with a sincere heart,
and according to the ancient rites pledges with the Nine Palaces,
then alone shall it be bestowed.

**Dao** says: When the Heavenly and Earthly cycles reach their limits,
when the sun and five stars wane and wax,
when the most sacred **Shénrén** [Divine Sage] rests or declines,
when the shallow scholars suffer affliction—
then all who share this **qi** must unite in heart,
observing fasts, offering incense at the six hours,
reciting the **sūtra** ten times in rotation,
and virtue shall descend to dispel all ill omens.

The boundless scriptures universally liberate the boundless.

**Dao** says: The shallow scholar, with Dao yet shallow,
or whose immortal rank is yet incomplete,
when the cosmic response fades and the body enters **Tàiyīn** [Great Darkness],
at the moment of passing,
the fellow **Zhìrén** must for them perform incense rites,
recite the scripture ten times in proper form,
to guide the corpse’s form as law dictates.
Then the **Yùhuá** [Jade Flower] Empress holds the flame to extinguish the yin malevolence,
while the **Yún’ý** [Cloud Comportment] Jade Maiden strikes the celestial **qìng** [stone chimes] in the brain palace—
thus the hundred spirits coalesce,
and the Nine **Guāng** [Luminous] essences
enter to fill the **níwán** [Cinnabar Field],
restoring their origin.
Soul and spirit ascend to the Southern Palace,
according to their merit, and in days are reborn.

The **Zhuánlún** [Turning Wheel] unceasing,
they attain **Shénxiān** [Immortal Sage].

**Dao** says: When the Heavenly and Earthly cycles reach their end,
when stars and constellations stray from their courses,
when sun and moon are obscured and darkened,
when the four seasons lose their order,
when yin and yang fall out of harmony,
when calamities plague the realm,
when pestilence spreads and the common folk perish,
when teachers and friends meet untimely ends,
when fellow students suffer misfortune—
all must observe fasts,
offer incense and recite scriptures.
For fasting and scripture-recitation bear great merit:
above, they dispel celestial disasters,
protecting and safeguarding the sovereign.
Below, they avert poisonous harm,
to deliver the common folk.

The birth and death of beings depend on this merit, which is boundless in its virtue.
Thus it is said: "Infinite, universally delivering all Heavenly and Earthly beings."

The **Dao** proclaims: All who possess this **sutra** may, for the sake of Heaven, Earth, the Celestial Sovereign, and the myriad folk, perform these virtuous deeds. When calamities arise, if one sincerely fasts, burns incense, and recites this **sutra** ten times, the **Devas** [天] will record their names, and the ten thousand **spirits** [神] will attend as guardians. They shall attain the rank of **Zhìrén** [Exalted Ones], becoming worthy ministers of the **Saintly Sovereign** [聖君] at the **Golden Gate** [金阙].

The **Devas** meticulously record the merits and demerits of all beings, not missing even the slightest fraction. The **Zhēnwáng** [True King] of the **Devas** will also champion their worth, and those who attain the **Dao** shall understand its profound truths.

Within the **Devas**, the **Great Brahman** [大梵] conceals the **Infinite Sound** [無量音].
The **Dao Lord** [道君] composed it as the **Elemental Scriptures** [元始靈書], the **Nine Palaces’ Register of the Immortal Worthies** [九宮仙籍], the **Sacred Names of the True Ones** [諸真寶訶]—the first chapter of the **Eight Celestial Devas of the East** [東方八天]:

*"Jia tú yuán líng, liú tǐ shè huí.
Huāng rú chéng Tài, zhōu jiàng míng chuí.
Láo lóng bì chū, dòu jiāng pín léi.
Yǎng duàn hóng jí, zhāo xiān nà huī.
Yǎn pǔ jì zhuó, kōng méng huá cuī.

Chá chén zǎo kē, mì lái fā shēn.

The **Eight Celestial Devas of the South** [南方八天]:

*"Hè nuó tí dū, míng yāo zhěn yàn.

The **Eight Celestial Devas of the West** [西方八天]:

The **Dao** proclaims: These are the **Infinite Sound** [無量之音], hidden within the **Devas**. The ancient scriptures were carved upon the **Nine Palaces’ Venerable Walls** [太極九宮崇墉] to summon those yet unenlightened.

For those of profound learning, their **spirit** [神] dwells in the **Nine Palaces**, their **qi** [氣] embraces the **Great Pole** [太極]. If they ponder the concealed melodies, their names shall be inscribed in the **Immortal Register** [仙籍], ascending to the **Great Mysterious** [太玄], their steps mounting to the **Left Primordial** [左元]. Each syllable is vast and long, a span.

The **Heavenly True Person** [天真皇人] of old inscribed these words, establishing them as the **Orthodox Sound** [正音]. Those who know this sound and fast while reciting it shall have the **Great Pole’s Right Minister** [太極右卿] sent down to observe their form, record their diligent merits, and report them to the **Devas**. The ten thousand **spirits** [神] shall pay homage in reverence, the **Earthly Spirits** [地祇] attend at the gate, and the **Great Brahman** [大勋真王] will champion their worth in the **Nine Palaces**.

Thus, the **Dao** is fully attained, and they may act across the **Three Realms** [三界], ascending into the **Golden Gate** [金門]. This sound dispels all that it encounters, averts all calamities, delivers all beings, and fulfills all desires. It is the **Natural Sound of Heaven** [天真自然之音].

Therefore, when recited, it invites the **Great Pole’s** observation below, the **Supreme Deity’s** distant chant, the ten thousand **spirits’** homage, the **Three Realms’** attendance at the hall, and the **group of Devas’** bowed submission. The **ghostly essences** [鬼精] perish of their own accord, while the **resounding treasures** [琳琅] echo vibrant, the **Ten Directions** [十方] grow serene. The **rivers and seas** [河海] fall silent, the **mountains and valleys** [山岳] swallow the mist, and all living souls [萬靈] tremble in awe. It summons the **host of Immortals** [群仙], leaving Heaven without **mists of impurity** [氛秽], Earth without **dust of Devas** [祆塵], and the **Darkly Enlightened** [冥慧] realm in perfect clarity. This is the **Infinite Great Mystery** [大量玄玄].

**Scripture of Infinite Virtue and Delivery of Beings** [靈寶無量度人上品妙經] concludes its thirty-fifth chapter.
**Thirty-sixth chapter** begins.

**Chapter on the Convergence of the Eight Scenic Deities**

The **Way** speaks: *"In days past, within the celestial realm of Zhuyang, the **Primordial Soul** sang the **Sacred Song of Great Fusion** upon the **Land of Pure Harmony**, receiving from **Yuan Shi** the **Supreme Method of Converging the Eight Scenic Deities** in boundless perfection.*

When **Yuan Shi Tianzun** delivered this **Scripture**, circling ten times to summon the **Ten Directions**, the **Celestial Worthies** took their seats. The **Heavenly True Gods**, the **Supreme Saints**, the **Mystic True Persons**, and the **Eight Scenic Great Gods of the Three Primordial Cycles**, with their countless **unfettered hosts**, rode the void and arrived.

**Divine clouds** spread their blossoms, **jewel chariots** and **jade palanquins** gleamed, **purple canopies** sheltered their radiance, and the **divine realm** shone in unison. **Auspicious hues** mingled in brilliance, and the **Eight Paths** blazed luminous. For seven days and seven nights, the **Eight Scenic Deities of the heavens** converged naturally, their reflections merging. **Ten thousand spirits and myriad souls** became one in **qi**, blending harmoniously like a turning wheel. The **entire land’s** mountains, rivers, forests, and trees shone resplendent, their highs and lows uniformly vibrant, the earth adorned with swirling, multicolored patterns like **embroidered silk**.

The **host of Worthies** attended at his side, while **Yuan Shi Tianzun** sat in **void-transcending meditation** upon the **Jade Terrace of the Celestial Vault**, where the **Ten Thousand Qi** converge in a luminous expanse.

When the **Scripture** was recited **once**, the **Heavenly Great Saints** proclaimed its excellence in unison. At that moment, **all men and women of the land** had their **desires for sensuality permanently severed**.

When recited **twice**, they attained **enlightenment to the Ultimate Truth**.

When recited **three times**, their **understanding and application of the Dao became profound**.

When recited **four times**, their **refinement of the Primordial Qi** harmonized with their form.

When recited **five times**, their **spiritual essence condensed**, safeguarding their **vital soul**.

When recited **six times**, **myriad deities formed floral patterns** upon their bodies, merging with their essence.

When recited **seven times**, the **Three Imperial Courts** gathered the **Celestial Worthies** in homage.

When recited **eight times**, the **hundred passages** were sealed in mystery, the **palaces and halls** interconnected, the **gates of death** blocked, and the **roots of birth** extinguished.

When recited **nine times**, the **Three Divisions** opened brightly, and the **Eight Scenic Deities** returned in unity.

When recited **ten times**, the **divine and enlightened** merged perfectly, their forms ascending as **Immortal Worthies**. At that moment, **all men and women of the land**, without exception, turned their hearts in devotion, all receiving **protection and deliverance**, attaining **eternal life**.

The **Way** speaks: *"At that time, when **Yuan Shi Tianzun** had recited the **Scripture once**, the **East’s Supreme True God of Boundless Limitless Perfection, the **Verdant Scenic Deity**, arrived with his **unfettered host**, floating through the void. When recited **twice**, the **South’s Supreme True God of Boundless Limitless Perfection, the **Crimson Scenic Deity**, arrived with his **unfettered host**, floating through the void. When recited **three times**, the **West’s Supreme True God of Boundless Limitless Perfection, the **Pure Scenic Deity**, arrived with his **unfettered host**, floating through the void. When recited **four times**, the **North’s Supreme True God of Boundless Limitless Perfection, the **Mysterious Scenic Deity**, arrived with his **unfettered host**, floating through the void. When recited **five times**, the **Northeast’s Supreme True God of Boundless Limitless Perfection, the **Nascent Scenic Deity**, arrived with his **unfettered host**, floating through the void. When recited **six times**, the **Southeast’s Supreme True God of Boundless Limitless Perfection, the **Luminous Scenic Deity**, arrived with his **unfettered host**, floating through the void. When recited **seven times**, the **Southwest’s Supreme True God of Boundless Limitless Perfection, the **Flourishing Scenic Deity**, arrived with his **unfettered host**, floating through the void. When recited **eight times**, the **Northwest’s Supreme True God of Boundless Limitless Perfection, the **Gloaming Scenic Deity**, arrived with his **unfettered host**, floating through the void. When recited **nine times**, the **Upper Realm’s Supreme True God of Boundless Limitless Perfection, the **Convergent Scenic Deity**, arrived with his **unfettered host**, floating through the void. When recited **ten times**, the **Lower Realm’s Supreme True God of Boundless Limitless Perfection, the **Transformative Scenic Deity**, arrived with his **unfettered host**, floating through the void.*

When the **ten recitations were complete**, the **Eight Scenic Celestial Worthies of the Ten Directions** arrived together. All men and women of the land **turned their hearts in reverence**, exulting and declaring:
*'We have each, through virtuous causes, either followed the **Dao’s practices** or encountered fortunate karmic ties, thus dwelling in this celestial realm and securing the **favor of the Heavenly Sovereign**.'*

To proclaim this **Method of the Convergence of the Eight Scenic Deities**, this **Supreme Transformation of the Highest Truth**, was not something our **unfettered hosts** had previously known. Now, those who hear it **must attain advancement to the rank of Highest Worthies**, fully aligning with **profound principles**.

As for us, we had not heard this **Dao** before, nor recognized the **mystery of the Eight Scenic Deities’ convergence**. How could we have ascended to unite with the **Supreme Dao of the Mixed Primordial**?

Thus, we came before the **Heavenly Sovereign**, petitioning to hear this **Supreme Teaching**. Like **fine rain and dense mist**, our **unfettered hosts** filled half the land, sinking the soil in places—an irresistible force.

At that time, **Yuan Shi Tianzun** surveyed the **Ten Directions**, his gaze descending with solemn attention. He **waved his Five-Luminous Feather Fan**, spoke in **jewel-toned voice**, and expounded the **essential principles**, revealing the **Great Ultimate**. With a single breath, the **Primordial Qi** divided, forming the **Three Celestial Lights**, which further separated into the **Eight Scenic Deities**.

The **Eight Scenic Deities** are the **natural luminous deities of the Eight Directions**. The **Eight Scenic Deities of Heaven** are divided into **three divisions**, each corresponding to the **Three Primordial Cycles**. The **Eight Scenic Deities of Man** are divided into **three divisions**, each corresponding to the **Three Canopies**.

Thus, the **Three Divisions of the Eight Scenic Deities**—**twenty-four Worthies**—are the **highest spirits of the Supreme Dao**. To **practice this method**, merging the **qi of the Eight Scenic Deities** with one’s own **spirit**, is to **converge myriad deities into an Imperial Unity**, dispersing as **thousandfold Worthies**, thereby achieving **highest Immortality**.

The **Eight Scenic Deities of Heaven** reside:
- **Upper Primordial Cycle’s Eight Scenic Deities** at the **Jade Terrace of the Celestial Capital (Yujing Xiaotai)**,
- **Middle Primordial Cycle’s Eight Scenic Deities** at the **Purple Palace of Taiwei (Taiwei Ziyun)**,
- **Lower Primordial Cycle’s Eight Scenic Deities** in the **Halls of Kunlun**.

The **Eight Scenic Deities of Man** correspond to:
- **Upper** merging with the **Nägel Bone (Nihuan)**,
- **Middle** merging with the **Vermilion Palace (Jiangong)**,
- **Lower** merging with the **Elixir Field (Dantian)**.

Each has its **name, size, and color**, dwelling in places where they can **summon celestial luminosity** to merge with human **spirit**.

When the **spirits of the Eight Scenic Deities** blend harmoniously with one’s own, **Highest Worthieship** is attained. Their **essence is profound and mysterious**, **void and luminous**, **serene and radiant**. To **focus solely on these eight matters** in practicing the **Dao** is to **surely achieve success**.

These eight are the **virtues and natures of the Eight Scenic Deities**. If one **diligently cultivates the True Gods of the Eight Scenic Yang-Precisions**, then the **Eight Scenic Deities** will descend upon you, **granting the **profoundly enlightened eternal life of the True Immortal**."*

The Great Assembly, upon hearing these words, prostrated themselves twice in obeisance, desiring to exhaust all teachings so as to enlighten those yet unawakened.

On that day, they rejoiced and were fortunate to hear the wondrous **Dao**—waves washing away my deep stagnation, with threefold supplications ceasing not.

Thus, **Yuan Shi** transformed the **One Primordial Essence (Yuan Jing)**, its form like a crimson sun, its radiant treasures gleaming, suspended within the **Void and Mysterious** expanse, nine *zhang* above the earth.

**Yuan Shi** ascended and summoned:
The **Great Celestial Spirit (Tian Zhen)**, the **Highest Sage (Shang Sheng)**, the **Exalted and Lofty (Gao Zun)**, the **Wondrous Conduct True Person (Miao Xing Zhen Ren)**, the **Limitless Ten Directions (Shi Fang Wu Ji)**, and the **Eight Scenic Deities (Ba Jing Da Shen)**—innumerable in their ranks—all entering the crimson sun’s midst.

The **Heavenly and Human Beings** gazed upward, seeing only a **booming brilliance** descending from the radiant treasures, entering within—whereafter, none knew their whereabouts.

The lands dispersed, the earth restored to its evenness, no longer askew or troubled.

**Yuan Shi** then, within the sun’s luminous core, delivered the **sutra**’s full exposition. The gathered **True Gods (Zhong Zhen)** watched and bestowed upon me, at that moment, joy beyond measure.

The **dharma**’s essentials now known, the **Heavens’ assembly** resumed their stations. In an instant, all was silent, no trace remaining.

At that time,
those **Heavenly and Human Beings** who encountered the **sutra**’s **Dao** universally received salvation, their **original nature (Ben Xing)** preserved, none harmed in mid-life.
All bowed in reverence, their minds filled with marvel.

**Merging with the Dao/Way and the Void**, **merging with the Limitless and the Spirit**, **merging with the Luminous and the Scenic**, **merging with the Illuminating and the Serene**, **merging with the Mysterious and the Wondrous**—
their **emotions** were without deception, their **nature** complete in **Celestial Purity (Tian Zhen)**.
Their **virtue** aligned with **compassion**, though their **forms** differed, their **bones** became kin.
The **land was secure**, the people prosperous, rejoicing in **Great Peace (Tai Ping)**.

The **sutra**’s origin issued forth, teaching the **land** the **Dao**.

Those with **supreme devotion**, who revered and worshipped it, all attained the power to **save the world**.

The **Dao**’s words:
*"What **Yuan Shi Tian Zun** spoke within the **sutra** was but the **inner names (Nei Ming)** of the **Heavens’ Supreme Lords (Zhu Tian Di)**,
the **hidden resonance (Yin Yun)** of sound.
It was also the **taboo names (Xie)** within the **Three Divisions and Eight Scenic Deities (San Bu Ba Jing)***,
the **secret names (Yin Ming)** of the **hundred spirits (Bai Ling)**.
Not the common speech of the world.

If one **diligently fasts and recites**, the **Eight Scenic Deities**’ **spirit** merges,
becoming one with **Heaven**—seven lifetimes extinguished,
the **uterine gate (Bao Hu)** sealed.
The **Highest Sage** thus becomes a **True Person (Zhen Ren)**,
penetrating the **Deep Mysteries (Tong Xuan)**, exhausting the **subtle (Jiu Wei)**,
knowing all its chapters.

To recite it ten times,
the **Heavens** compel song,
the **Ten Thousand Lords (Wan Di)** arrange rites.
The **source of the heart (Xin Yuan)** clears and stills,
**harmful qi (Hai Qi)** sinks and dissolves.

**Piercingly merging** with the **Eight Scenic Deities**,
the **spirit of the True Gods** overflows within.
**Demons (Gun Mo)** bind their forms,
**ghostly essences (Gui Jing)** perish utterly.
**Corpses rise**, **white bones become flesh**—
the **learned of supreme attainment (Zhi Xue Zhi Shi)** recite ten times,
and the **Eight Scenic Deities** escort and guard,
the **Three Primordials (San Yuan)** prostrate in homage.
**Demon essences (Mo Jing)** lose their sight,
**Ghostly spirits (Gui Jing)** vanish completely.
They **salvage the dying**, severing death to attain life.

Thus it is:
For **learned scholars (Xue Shi)**, their **impure qi (Ji Qi)** has not yet dissolved,
their **bodies** not yet **pierced by the True Spirit (Dong Zhen)**.
Though they **summon the Eight Scenic Deities (Cun Chao Ba Jing)**,
their **cultivation** is not yet fully accomplished.
**Heaven’s decrees (Tian Zheng)** may subdue **demons (Mo)** for trial,
**banishing calamities (Jue Mie Zai Huan)**,
yet they do not die—only **regenerate (Bu Neng Geng Sheng)**.
A **light recitation** of this chapter brings **misfortune (Bei Yang)**.

To **offer reverence and supply (Gong Yang Zun Li)**,
gates flourish, prosperity enduring through ages,
with **auspicious karmic connections (Yu Shan Yin Yuan)**,
a **million calamities** not approaching.
**Divine lights (Shen Ming)** guard the threshold.

This **sutra** is **most exalted and wondrous**,
unmatched in the **Jade Capital (Yu Jing)**,
its **salvation** boundless—
the **foundation of ten thousand Dao**’s.

Its **scope (Fan)** vast and profound,
its **virtue** beyond measure.

The **Dao**’s words:
*"For those who recite this **sutra** ten times,
the **Eight Scenic Deities** descend in full assembly.
**Calamities** are **severed and extinguished**.
A **hundred generations of ancestors (Yi Zeng Wan Zu)***,
their **souls in torment (You Hun Ku Shang)***,
all receive **salvation**—
ascending to the **Crimson Palace (Zhu Gong)***,
**attaining the Nine Heavens (Ge Jie Jiu Tian)***,
**regenerating and receiving transformation (Shou Hua Geng Sheng)***,
becoming **noble beings (Gui Ren)**.

Yet those who **love the **sutra**’s supreme teachings**,
whose **cultivation is painful and their **virtue** accomplished (Gong Tong De Jiu)***,
all attain **immortality (Shen Xian)**—
**flying to the Golden Gate (Fei Sheng Jin Que)***,
**wandering the Mysterious Jade Capital (Yao You Ming Yu Jing)**.

For the **learned of highest attainment (Shang Xue Zhi Shi)***,
to **cultivate and recite** this **sutra**,
their **wisdom opens and brightens (Zhi Hui Kai Ming)***,
**embracing light to nurture the refined (Han Guang Yu Ying)***.
The **Eight Scenic Deities**’ **spirit** merges,
**harmonizing with the Mysterious Court (Dao Qi Xuan Ting)***.
All receive **salvation**—
**flying to the Southern Palace (Fei Sheng Nan Gong)**.

When **worldly beings** recite it,
the **Eight Scenic Deities** dwell within their **bodies**,
**binding the gates of death (Gu Lu Si Men)***.
The **Eight Scenic Deities** of **Heaven** descend to **merge with their forms (Xia He Zhao Xing)***,
**spirit and scenic** converging.
They **attain the Dao** and become **True Ones (De Jing Cheng Zhen)***,
**prolonging life and years (Yan Shou Chang Nian)***,
later all attaining the **path of flying ascent (Fei Sheng Zhi Dao)***.
Their **souls and spirits refine (Hun Shen Bian Lian)***,
not suffering the **torments of the Three Realms (San Jie Ai Nao)***,
constantly preserving **innocence (Hai Ying)***,
**wandering the Great Void (Yao Xing Tai Kong)**.

This **sutra** is **subtle and wondrous**,
its **salvation** boundless—
all **Heavenly and Human Beings** rejoice in receiving it.

**Incalculable blessings (Wu Liang Zhi Fu)***,
**life and death** both graced with favor.
**Heaven’s treasures (Shang Tian Suo Bao)***,
not passed to the **lower world (Bu Chuan Xia Shi)**.
Only **supreme scholars (Zhi Shi)**, bearing **golden treasures (Jin Bao)*** in **devoted hearts (Xiao Xin)***,
pledging to **Heaven** to transmit it.
**Light disclosure or negligence (Qing Xie Man Luan)***,
**misfortune** extends to **nine ancestral generations (Ji Ji Jiu Zu)***,
**enduring servitude in the nether offices (Chang Yi You Guan)***.

The **Five Emperors (Wu Di)*** attend this **sutra**,
with **Jade Boys and Jade Girls (Yu Tong Yu Nu)**, each twenty-four in number,
**guarding and escorting the sacred texts (Ying Wei Shen Wen)***.
They **protect those who receive the **sutra**’s teachings**,
their **bodies** unharmed.

The **Dao**’s words:
*"In the first month, with **long fasting (Chang Zhai)***,
recite and chant this **sutra**,
and the **upper division’s Eight Scenic Deities** descend to the **spirit’s court (Shen Ting)***,
the **Elixir Field’s Mysterious Hall (Ni Wan Xuan Tang)***,
the **seven ancestors (Qi Zu)*** **ascend and depart (Chao Qian)***,
**salvaging those of the upper division to the Southern Palace (Du Shang Nan Gong)**.

In the seventh month, with **long fasting**,

one’s **body** attains **immortality (De Shen Xian)***,
the **Heavens** record their names.
With **green talismans (Qing Lu)*** and **purple tablets (Zi Jian)***,
their **forms** rise, **becoming flying immortals (Fei Xian)**.

In the tenth month, with **long fasting**,
recite and chant this **sutra**,
and the **lower division’s Eight Scenic Deities** bind **one’s form (Gu Zhao)***,

**ten thousand *qi*’s (Wan Qi)*** coalesce into **spirit (Jie Shen)***,
**revolving wheels in the Great Void (Wu Lian Tai Xiao)***,
**soaring through the Upper Purity (Yao You Shang Qing)***,
**a hundred generations rejoicing (Yi Shi Han Huan)***,
**vast calamities** all **extinguished (Hao Jie Qi Ling)**.

On the **Eight Festive Days (Ba Jie Zhi Ri)***,
recite and chant this **sutra**,
and the **Eight Scenic Deities**’ **spirit** merges,
**ascending to the Jade Capital (Chao Deng Yu Jing)***,
becoming **Upper Purity True Ones (Shang Qing Zhen Ren)**.

On the **day of one’s original fate (Ben Ming Zhi Ri)***,
recite and chant this **sutra**,
and the **Three Divisions’ Eight Scenic Deities (San Bu Ba Jing)***,
the **Twenty-Four True Ones (Er Shi Si Zhen)***,
**mingle and transmute as infants (Hun Bian Ying Er)***,
in **embroidered robes and silk skirts (Jin Yi Xiu Qun)***,
**seated in ranks within the Elixir Field (Lie Zu Ni Wan)***,
their **bodies**’ palace.
Their **souls and spirits** clear and rectified,
**ten thousand *qi*’s** eternally preserved.
**A hundred gates** undergo **refinement (Shou Lian)***,
their **bodies** radiant with light.
The **Three Realms** guard and escort,
the **Five Emperors** oversee their welcome.
**Ten thousand spirits** pay homage,
their names recorded in **Heaven**.
Their **cultivation complete**, their **virtue accomplished (Gong Man De Jiu)***,
they **fly to Upper Purity (Fei Sheng Shang Qing)**.

The **Dao**’s words:
*"On the **days of Daoic practice (Xing Dao Zhi Ri)***,
all must **bathe in fragrant waters (Xiang Tang Wu Yu)***,
**fast and enter the chamber (Zhai Jie Ru Shi)***,
facing east,
**knocking teeth thrice (Kou Chi)***—thirty-two times through—
**ascending to hear the Thirty-Two Heavens (Shang Wen San Shi Er Tian)***,
**bowing in heart thirty-two times (Xin Bai San Shi Er Guo)***,
closing eyes,
**quietly contemplating** one’s **self seated amid the Eight Colored Clouds’ *qi* (Ba Se Yun Qi)***,
**inner and outer** enveloped in **darkness (Yong Ming)***.
There appear:
**Azure Dragon (Qing Long)***, **White Tiger (Bai Hu)***, **Vermilion Bird (Zhu Que)***, **Dark Tortoise (Xuan Wu)***, **Lion (Shi Zi)***, and **White Crane (Bai He)***,
**arrayed on left and right (Luo Lie Zuo You)***.
The **Twenty-Four True Ones** come before **one’s form (Zhao Qian)***,
**sun and moon** casting **radiant light (Zhe Yue Zhao Ming)***,
**piercingly illuminating the chamber (Dong Fan Shi Nei)***,
**a circular halo forming at the neck (Xiang Sheng Yuan Xiang)***,
its **light reflecting the Ten Directions (Shu Guang Shi Fang)***.
Thus, **distinct and clear (Fen Ming)***."

The secret incantation proclaims:
*"Supreme Primordial Dao/Way, the Most High Dao Lord.*

**Summon forth** from within my body the **Three Five Officials of Merit**, the **left and right ministerial envoys**, the **attendant jade boys** bearing incense, the **speaking jade maidens**, the **Five Emperors’ direct talismans**, and the **direct-day incense officials**—each **thirty-two in number**—to **open the gates** as spoken.

**On this auspicious day of fasting and purity**, **reciting the sacred scriptures**, **boundless in salvific power**,
I **pray that my petition may ascend directly** before the **Supreme Most High Emperor of the Thirty-Two Heavens of the Primordial Origin**,
**completing the ritual**—**drawing qi through thirty-two passages**, facing east to recite the scripture.

The Heavens conceal their names.
The Heavens conceal their forms.
The central void is naturally illuminated.
The Heavens conceal their melodies—
the eight harmonies of the cosmos.
The eight noble harmonies, the eight divine harmonies,
the true kings of the eight harmonies,
the eight luminous spirits,
the divine convergence of the eight harmonies—
transforming into the Supreme Clarity.
The boundless mysteries, unfathomable depths.
The divine essence unfolds, universally enlightening heaven and man.

Today, rejoicing in the reception of enlightenment,
the divine realm becomes one—
the luminous essence, preserved without doubt,
ascending to the lofty immortals.
Golden visage, jade limbs,
unobstructed in the void,
clear perception untainted,
unimpeded guidance.

Piercing the cosmic flow, free from contrivance,
pure without turbidity,
spotless without defilement,
radiant and resplendent.

Illuminating the silent natural order,
the eight paths of the divine—
uniting these eight gates,
forming transformation into substance.

Silken robes of dragon-cloth,
divine refinement in perfection,
wandering the jade steps,
receiving office in the Eastern Palace.

Commanding the Three Officials,
forever extinguishing all malevolence,
severing the roots of birth,
blocking the gates of death.
Listed among the Supreme Mysteries,
the Three Provinces overseeing all—
no obstruction remains.

The Eastern Dipper governs calculations,
the Western Dipper records names,
the Northern Dipper judges death,
the Southern Dipper grants life,
the Central Dipper, the Great Chief—
overseeing all spirits.

The Azure Sovereign guards the soul,
piercing the luminous scene to attain truth.
The White Sovereign attends the spirit,
the splendid scene securing the abode.
The Vermilion Sovereign nourishes the *qi*,
the primal scene receiving illumination.
The Black Sovereign harmonizes the blood,
the enlightened scene clear and profound.
The Yellow Sovereign, the central master,
the unified scene arrayed in full.

The True Kings of the Five Heavens:
The Azure Heavenly True King—
the azure scene transforming into divinity.
The Vermilion Heavenly True King—
the crimson scene radiant with brilliance.
The White Heavenly True King—
the pure scene blending with the spirit.
The Black Heavenly True King—
the dark scene, still and deep.
The Yellow Heavenly True King—
the eight harmonies revolving in unity.
The Five Heavenly True Kings—
the source of ten thousand deities.

Flying drums and processions,
commanding the divine armies.
Banners and rhythmic beats,
wandering the boundless expanse.

Self-proclaimed as resplendent,
the Heavens’ functions unified.
The Celestial Degree bestows upon mortals,
strictly governing the Northern Underworld.
The Divine King receives command,
sweeping away all inauspiciousness.
The Divine Dragon suppresses poison,
the Heavenly Steed gallops with four hooves.
The Vanguard repels the false,
the Heavenly Marshal wields the banner.
Fires hurl ten thousand *li*,
bell-chimes resound in eight directions.
Dare any trespass—
blocked from ascending to the True Ones,
the golden axe strikes first,
the jade axe executes last.

Slaughtering the ghostly rebels,
wind and fire relentless,
thousands beheaded,
ten thousands dismembered.
No demon dares offend,
no ghost dares linger—
the Three Officials of the Northern Underworld
clearly inspect the ghostly encampments.
No concealment permitted,
the Golden Horse Inn reports,
universally proclaiming the endless—
all deities listen in accord.

The Three Realms’ Five Emperors
declare to the Supreme Clarity.
The True Sovereign’s jade decrees,
the mysterious transformations merging in darkness.
The cosmic *qi* circulates,
in the boundless void.
The upper scene is not color,
the lower scene is not the abyss,
the central scene is the Great Emptiness—
mysteriously uniting with nature.

The eight harmonies converge,
the Golden Vajra ascends the Heavens,
above and below the Heavens—
no darkness, no obscurity.
Formless, shadowless,
boundless, infinite.

Twenty-four True Ones,
cyclically arrayed in palaces.
When Heaven and Earth first formed,
the Divine Emperors concealed the Dragon.
The boundless Great *Dharma*,
vast without light.
The eight harmonies unfold the diagram,
the Three Sections spread out.
The Primordial Beginning stabilizes.
The Five Classics unfold.

Eons pass, yet they never fade—
*Endless ages, yet their joy remains.*

*Floating on the Azure Dragon’s celestial light.*
Feasting in the **Three Primordial Palaces**,
*With luminous days and radiant pupils.*
Within the middle realm, eight scenes arise,
*Guarding the birth-gates of life.*
If one preserves and upholds them,
*They ascend to the Jade Capital Peak.*

*Endless ages without sorrow.*

The **Third Chapter of the Eight Scenes Divine Harmony**—
*The Sun-Chariot with cloud-banners,*
*Jade pendants and pearl ornaments.*
Seated in the Golden Gate,
*Pointing to the **Pang Sang** trees.*
The Twenty-Four True Ones,
*Play with the Sovereign’s wisdom.*
Soaring through the Celestial Mists,
*Treading the Flowery Hall.*
Below, the eight scenes—
*Their names are **Zhuang** and **Qiang**.*
They give birth to all living things,
*Weighing the **Dou** and the **Gang**.*
Within the kidneys, four scenes—
*The Dark True Great Spirit.*
**Mao Mao**, **Chi Chi**,
*Purple Return aids the True One.*
**Yue Nu** descends from the clouds,
*The Four Scenes’ True Persons.*

*Towering, their light illusory,*
*The Immortal Ke extends his path.*
**Xiong Yuan** follows the **Yang**,
*The Cloud Ropes connect within.*
The Pure Palace knows no defilement,
*Dispelling ghosts and demonic harm.*
The Three Sections, eight scenes,
*Twenty-Four Youths in brocade and silk,*
Dwelling in the Divine Hall,
*United as one, flying high at dawn.*
Sing this song, and the **Xian Gong** responds—
*The Dao’s path is boundless, none can exhaust it.*
The Omen can embody it.
*Riding the Azure Dragon’s reins.*

This is above the **Three Realms**,
*Within the Flying Void,*
The **True King’s Song of Harmony**—
*Its melody echoes the Cavernous Chapters.*
Recite it a hundred times,
*And one attains the Southern Palace.*
Recite it a thousand times,
*The True King comes to welcome.*
Ten thousand recitations complete the Dao,
*Ascending to the Supreme Void,*
*Crossing the Three Realms,*
*Ascending to the Immortal’s Court.*
Hearing the Sacred Sound,
*The True King reveres the form,*
*Commanding the Earth Spirits.*
They attend, escorting, welcoming.
*Emerging from the Earth’s Gate,*
Free from the Five Torments and Eight Hardships,
*The Seven Ancestors ascend,*
Forever parted from the Ghostly Officials,
*The Soul passes the Vermilion Ridge,*
*Refined anew in life.*
This is called **Limitless Salvation**,
*Universal Liberation without end.*

There are **Secret Celestial Scriptures**,
*Which all the Heavens hold in reverence.*
To reveal them carelessly invites the **Hell Realms**,
*And the **Seven Ancestral Uncles** descend.*
The Dao says:
*These two chapters are the voices of the Heavenly Sovereigns*
*And the hidden melodies of the Eight Scenes Divine Kings.*
If one chants and sings them,
*The hundred spirits merge,*
*The eight scenes rejoice as one,*
*Embracing the Spirit to become True,*
*The body sprouts wings—*
*These are the words of the Great Brahman,*
*Not the common speech of mortals.*
Without melodic grace,
Without ornate tunes,
*Thus called profound and elusive,*
*Difficult to fathom.*

Treasured by the Highest,
*Sealed within the Eastern Hall of the Jade Pure Palace,*
*In the Celestial Chamber of the Jade Court.*
The Dao Lord governs below,
*Transmitting the teachings abroad.*
If a perfected one brings gold and jade,
*With a sincere heart,*
And according to the ancient rites,
*Pledges allegiance to the Celestial Mists,*
Then the scripture shall be granted.

The Dao says:
*When Heaven and Earth’s cycles falter,*
*The Sun and Moon, the Five Stars wane and wax,*
*The most sacred gods rest or decline,*
*The shallow scholars suffer ailments.*
Should such calamities arise,
*All who share the same breath must unite in fasting,*
*Offer incense at the six hours,*
*Turn the scripture ten times,*
*And virtue shall descend,*
*Dissolving all ill omens.*
The limitless text,
*Universally liberates without end.*

The Dao says:
*If the unenlightened are shallow in the Dao,*
*Or their Immortal rank is incomplete,*
*And their fate is to perish in the **Great Yin**,*
At the moment of passing,
*Let the perfected among them offer incense,*
*Recite the scripture ten times,*
*And conduct the corpse according to the rites.*
Then the eight scenes shall descend,
*The True Spirits merge,*
*Left flying, right crouching,*
*The Spirit moves through the Qi Valley,*
*Now merging, now separating,*
*The scenes and spirits blend in darkness,*
*The decayed are renewed,*
*The fallen rise anew,*
*The soul ascends directly to the Southern Palace,*
*According to their merit,*
*And on that very day, they are reborn.*
The Wheel of Rebirth brings no confusion,
*And one attains Immortality.*

The Dao says:
*When Heaven and Earth’s cycles end,*
*The stars shift their courses,*
*The Sun and Moon lose their eclipses,*
*The four seasons fall out of order,*
*Yin and Yang grow unbalanced,*
*Disasters plague the lands,*
*Pestilence spreads,*
*The people perish,*
*Teachers and friends meet untimely ends,*
*And the learned suffer misfortune—*
*Then too, they must fast,*
*Offer incense, and recite the scripture.*
For fasting and recitation of scripture
*Are deeds of great merit.*
Above, they dispel celestial calamities,
*Protecting the Emperor’s reign.*
Below, they avert poisonous harm,
*Delivering the people.*
Life and death depend on it—
*Their blessings are boundless.*
Thus it is said:
*The limitless, universally liberates Heaven and Man.*

The Dao says:
*Whoever possesses this scripture*
*Can act as Heaven’s Emperor,*
*Or the people’s sovereign.*
On days of disaster,
*Let them resolve to fast,*
*Burn incense,*
*And recite the scripture ten times.*
All the Heavens shall record their names,
*Ten thousand spirits attend as guards,*
*And the perfected shall be ranked among the Holy Ones*
*As ministers of the Golden Gate.*
The Heavens record every deed and sin,
*Without the slightest omission.*
Even the **True Kings of Heaven** shall recommend you,
*And those who attain the Dao shall truly comprehend these sacred words.*

*The Dao speaks: These are the Hidden Speech of the Great Brahman,*
*The boundless sounds of the Heavens.*
*Engraved in the old texts of the Dragon Mountain’s Northern Ridge,*
*To harmonize the Three Primordials,*
*And establish the school of the Perfected.*

*The High Immortal True Person*
*All engraved and recited with reverence,*
*To exchange with the Eight Scenes’ Gods.*

*The True Qi spreads throughout the Heavens,*
*Descending to the mortal world,*
*Where the Immortal Officials set their jade tablets,*
*The Jade Maidens offer incense,*
*And the spirits are joyfully summoned.*
*Calamities and misfortunes cannot approach.*

*The characters are all broad and long, a yard in measure.*
*The True Person of the Heavens once inscribed these words,*
*To establish the correct sounds.*

*Whoever knows these sounds*
*And can fast while reciting them,*

*Within the Mysterious and Wondrous Heaven,*
*There is the Supreme Void Heaven of Unsurpassed Constant Abiding,*
*Whose Heavenly Sovereign is named*
*The Overarching Inspector of Ghosts and Spirits,*
*Residing in His palace.*

The **Daoist immortal** residing here in **Yujing** disperses into five forms, manifesting countless divine beings.

Now, dwelling in this realm, I behold the **Ten Directions of the Boundless World**, infinite beings all reciting the **essentials of the Dao**, comprehending the ultimate truth, and showing the **Path of Mysterious Clarity**.

The heaven where you dwell reaches upward to the **Colorless Realm**, descends to the **Kunlun Mountains**, extends to the **Northern Platform**, the **Dark Peaks**, and the **Ghostly Metropolis**—all under my dominion. The **Northern Celestial Spirits** bow down to the **Yinlu Underworld**, near the **Sea’s End**, and within human realms, their **interwoven connections** and **erratic movements** bring foulness and filth that cannot be endured. They prey upon the **Six Celestial Realms** and the **Eight Directions’ Ghosts and Spirits**, slaughtering and devouring all peoples, cutting short their natural lifespan and inflicting untimely deaths.

In the **Three Primordial Years** of your life, at the **limits of fate and destiny**, the **Yinlu Underworld’s officials** conspire, and the **Ghostly Judges** decree misfortune. They fabricate calamities and afflictions—various torments and punishments—that bring **the cries of summoning souls** and **the lamentations of the dying**, unceasing to the ears.

Seeing these sufferings, my own body entangled in misfortune, I now wish to descend to that heaven and preach the **Law of Liberation** to mortals.

You, born from the **Empty Void**, occupy this celestial station yet do not understand the **subtle, profound, and vast Dao**. I, the **Wondrous Formless Heavenly Sovereign**, gave birth to the **Three Qi**, the **Three Treasures**, and the **Three Sovereigns**, creating the **Chaos of Primordial Darkness**, distinguishing the **Ten Thousand Heavens**, and establishing imperial courts in order. I made **the Three Sovereigns** soar in unity, and the **Thirty-six Thousand Celestial Beings** shine like the sun and moon in one moment—this is my doing.

Now, descending, I transform into the **Great Primordial Chaos of Jade**, residing beneath the **Jade-Canopied Glorious Imperial Hall**, within the **Purple Weave Enclosure**, known as the **Great Emperor of the Northern Pole**. I wear **Dragon Robes of Mysterious Splendor**, with **pendant sashes and grand headgear**, twelve **Primordial Officials** at my side, **Thunderer and Lightning Lord** stationed beside me, thirty-six generals guarding my rear, and five marshals and four **Celestial Virtues** leading my procession.

At the **Dawn of Crimson Clarity**, I became the **Divine Lord of Upper Purity**. After the **Great Peace**, I was the **Great Emperor of Northern Yin**. With the **world pacified**, I ascended to **Central Heaven**, the **Purple Extremity Court**, where all beings in the **Ten Directions** gaze upon me unmoving—the **Pivot of the Celestial Axis**.

Yet all forms are in motion; only the **Formless remains still**. The **Northern Pole Star** stands apart from the others, threefold in its wonders. The **Central Void** is the **Northern Dipper**, the **True Form of the Heavenly Sovereign**. Gazing upon it, its **radiance gleams**, the five stars casting their light, luminous and bright—this is the **Imperial Seat**. But one sees only the seat; how could one hastily visit its sovereign?

This **Great Emperor of the Northern Pole** commands all **ghosts and spirits of the Three Realms**, the myriad gods and thousand spirits—all bow their heads in supplication. The **Five Sacred Mountains and Four Great Rivers**, the **spirits of earth and water**, all kneel in reverence, beseeching blessings for **water, drought, wind, and rain**.

This **Northern Pole Emperor** is my **fifth manifestation**, seated in the **Supreme Celestial Authority**, the **Jade Emperor** as my ancestor, establishing the **Primordial Element of the Great Void**. In the **Nine Palaces**, I am called the **Central Yellow Sovereign**, wearing a **purple brocade robe**, girdled with **twelve golden fire bells of the Celestial Streams**, appearing as a **baby**, holding the **Seven Primordials**, and exhaling **azure breath**.

Now, I dwell beneath the **Jade-Canopied Glorious Imperial Hall** in the **Central Heaven**, riding the **Big Dipper’s Celestial Chariot**, ascending the **Three Platforms**, taking my place in the **Great Horn**, and sitting in the **Bright Hall**. Seven attendants in **purple embroidered robes** stand beside me—the **Seven Stars of the Big Dipper’s essence**.

You should go there and petition me to descend to this **heavenly palace**, so that I may hear the **essentials of the Dao**. Thus, the **Heavenly Sovereign** adjusts his crown and holds his **ceremonial jade tablet**, kneeling in reverence. I now humbly request the **Northern Pole Emperor** to descend to this **heavenly court**, hoping to hear the **Great Law**.

Then, with the **Heavenly Assembly**, we take leave of **Primordial Sovereign**, descending to the **Central Yellow Purple Court**, beneath the **Jade-Canopied Glorious Imperial Hall**. The **True Officials** guide us forward, the **Law Enforcers** follow behind, directly reaching the **Northern Pole Emperor’s Presence**. We fully recount the matters above, kneeling in reverence and offering obeisance, our pleas sincere and heartfelt, tears streaming down.

The **Emperor** clad in **Mysterious Dragon Robes** descends and speaks: *"I ascend to serve **Primordial Sovereign** in spreading the **Supreme Teaching**; I shall grant this request."*

Thus, the **Heavenly Sovereign** shines his light, gazing upon the **Northern Celestial Spirits**, the **Pure Void of the Supreme Heaven**, and the **Imperial Hall within the Central Heaven’s Jewel**. Within the **Three Qi’s Radiant Hall**, as I prepare to ascend the **Law Seat** and deliver this **Scripture**, I circle ten times to summon the **Ten Directions**. Then, the **Five Celestial Sovereigns**, the **Seven Primordial Lords**, the **Highest Saints**, the **True Persons of the Void**, and countless others without number, ride the **void** and arrive.

**Rainbow clouds** span the heavens, **luminous vapors** spread in all directions. The **Jade Platform’s Phoenix Chariot** descends, **feathered scepters and golden banners** unfurling. The **treasures of myriad hues** gather, **dense and vibrant**, their **radiance piercing the void**. For seven days and seven nights, the **gods and spirits of all heavens**, the **celestial beings of sun and moon**, the **star spirits and cloud generals** pause their wheels. The **rigid winds** harmonize, **bright light** cascades forth, and the **mountains, rivers, forests, and trees** all turn the color of jade. The earth shifts to **emerald glass**, soft and **glowing with pristine clarity**. All spirits attend the seat in awe.

The **Northern Pole Emperor** first faces **Yujing**, bowing his heart in reverence to **Primordial Sovereign**, with utmost respect. Then, he ascends the **Floating Five-Colored Dragon Platform** of the **Void**.

After reciting the **Scripture once**, the **Heavenly Saints** simultaneously declare its excellence. At that moment, all men and women in the land hear the **Northern Pole Emperor** proclaim the **Mysterious Decrees**, countless beings liberated, and the **Seven Stars** expound the **Supreme Essentials of the Dao**.

After reciting the **Scripture twice**, the **Seven Stars** shine brightly, and the **Mysterious Talismans** appear in the void.

After reciting the **Scripture thrice**, the **Great Axe cleaves the heavens**, mountains split and stones fracture.

After reciting the **Scripture four times**, the **Heaven and Earth align in harmony**, the **four seas purified**.

After reciting the **Scripture five times**, **celestial music fills the void**, and **sacred incense drifts afar**.

After reciting the **Scripture six times**, the **heavenly rainbow encircles all**, forming a bridge across the void.

After reciting the **Scripture seven times**, the **Seven True Ones descend to observe**, and the **demonic essences lose their courage**.

After reciting the **Scripture eight times**, the **Ghostly Sovereign flees in terror**, and the **ten thousand demons are crushed**.

After reciting the **Scripture nine times**, the **heavens pour sweet dew**, and **pearls scatter like rain**.

After reciting the **Scripture ten times**, the **ghosts and spirits awaken to the Dao**, the **dark and hidden beings ascend to immortality**. At that time, all men and women in the land—without exception—turn their hearts toward the **Way**, receiving protection and attaining **eternal life**.

The **Dao/Way** speaks: At that time, the **Northern Pole Sovereign** recites the **Scripture** once, and the **Boundless Infinite** of the Eastern **Heavenly Dipper** and the **Seven Stars** dispatch the **Great God of the Zoroastrian Faith** (祆大神, *Qián Dàshén*), along with the **Unrestrained Host** (無鞅之眾, *Wúyáng Zhī Zhòng*), floating through the void to arrive.

After reciting the **Scripture** twice, the **Boundless Infinite** of the Southern **Heavenly Dipper** and the **Seven Stars** dispatch the **Great God of the Zoroastrian Faith**, along with the **Unrestrained Host**, floating through the void to arrive.

After reciting the **Scripture** three times, the **Boundless Infinite** of the Western **Heavenly Dipper** and the **Seven Stars** dispatch the **Great God of the Zoroastrian Faith**, along with the **Unrestrained Host**, floating through the void to arrive.

After reciting the **Scripture** four times, the **Boundless Infinite** of the Northern **Heavenly Dipper** and the **Seven Stars** dispatch the **Great God of the Zoroastrian Faith**, along with the **Unrestrained Host**, floating through the void to arrive.

After reciting the **Scripture** five times, the **Boundless Infinite** of the **Ghostly Dipper** in the Northeast and the **Seven Stars** dispatch the **Great God of the Zoroastrian Faith**, along with the **Unrestrained Host**, floating through the void to arrive.

After reciting the **Scripture** six times, the **Boundless Infinite** of the **Yang Dipper** in the Southeast and the **Seven Stars** dispatch the **Great God of the Zoroastrian Faith**, along with the **Unrestrained Host**, floating through the void to arrive.

After reciting the **Scripture** seven times, the **Boundless Infinite** of the **Retreating Dipper** in the Southwest and the **Seven Stars** dispatch the **Great God of the Zoroastrian Faith**, along with the **Unrestrained Host**, floating through the void to arrive.

After reciting the **Scripture** eight times, the **Boundless Infinite** of the **Ascending Dipper** in the Northwest and the **Seven Stars** dispatch the **Great God of the Zoroastrian Faith**, along with the **Unrestrained Host**, floating through the void to arrive.

After reciting the **Scripture** nine times, the **Boundless Infinite** of the **Flying Dipper** in the Upper Realm and the **Seven Stars** dispatch the **Great God of the Zoroastrian Faith**, along with the **Unrestrained Host**, floating through the void to arrive.

After reciting the **Scripture** ten times, the **Boundless Infinite** of the **Descending Dipper** in the Lower Realm and the **Seven Stars** dispatch the **Great God of the Zoroastrian Faith**, along with the **Unrestrained Host**, floating through the void to arrive.

When the tenfold recitation is complete, the **Ten Directions** are fulfilled.
The **Boundless Infinite** of the **Heavenly True One** (天真, *Tiānzhēn*), with **Limitless Virtue/Power** (無量, *Wúliàng*), subdues the **demons** and dispatches the **Great God of the Zoroastrian Faith**, all arriving together at once. All men and women in the land turn their hearts toward the **Dao/Way** and bow in reverence.

Those who come forth each vow to eliminate the accumulated suffering of countless past lives, wherein their hearts were not pure, defiled by impure thoughts. The **Three Corpses** (三尸, *Sānshī*) roam unrestrained, the **Seven Spirits** (七魄, *Qībò*) envy and harm, and they consort with **ghostly qi** (鬼氣, *Guǐqì*), along with all manner of **demons**.

Thus, they suffer from **dharma afflictions**, fail to see the **Way** clearly, and though dwelling in the realm of mortals and gods, they fall into the cycle of rebirth.
Even those who attain the **Sages’ Stages** (證位, *Zhèngwèi*) and temporarily ascend the **True Path** (真階, *Zhēnjiē*) are ensnared by the **demonic essences** entering their hearts, the **Zoroastrian trials** (祆試, *Qiánshì*) causing confusion, their thoughts stirring dust, and their **karmic connections** (攴缘, *Qīyuán*) clinging to false paths, generating countless causes and performing myriad deeds.

Now, hearing the **Northern Pole Sovereign** proclaim the **Seven Stars’ Method** of dispelling **Zoroastrian evils** and protecting the **True**, opening the obscured eyes of the deluded, traversing the **Path of Celestial Clarity** (玄清路, *Xuánqīng Lù*), and aspiring to the **Highest True Ones** (高真品, *Gāozhēn Pǐn*), they are filled with shame and prostrate in homage. The **Unrestrained Host** stands in attendance, listening with reverence.

Thus, the **Northern Pole Sovereign** gazes upward to the heavens and downward to the earth, observing all things under the sun, summoning **Limitless Virtue/Power** (無量心, *Wúliàngxīn*), awakening the **Soul-Treasury Wisdom** (靈寶慧, *Língbǎo Huì*), and universally instructing the assembly:

Before the **Primordial Origin** (元始, *Yuánshǐ*) was born, the void of eons left no trace. When the **Chaos of Non-Differentiation** (混沌, *Hùndùn*) was cleft, the **Seven Orifices** (七窍, *Qīqiào*) opened.

The grand became the **Sun and Moon** (日月, *Rìyuè*), the subtle became the **stars** (星辰, *Xīngchén*). The **Sun, Moon, and Five Stars** (日月五星, *Rìyuè Wǔxīng*), collectively called the **Seven Primordials** (七元, *Qīyuán*), are aligned with the **Northern Dipper** (北斗, *Běidǒu*).

The **Northern Dipper’s Twelve Stars** (北斗十二星, *Běidǒu Shíèr Xīng*), with five as the **Hidden Luminaries** (隱曜, *Yǐnyào*), contain within the **Mouth of the Dipper** (斗口, *Dǒukǒu*) the **Twenty-Four Jade Sovereigns** (二十四玉皇, *Èrshísì Yùhuáng*), whose radiance is not visible—only the **Seven Luminaries** (七曜, *Qīyào*) shine brightly, illuminating the **Ten Directions**.

The **essences of the Seven Stars** reside within the **Seven Orifices** of humans.
Their **spirits** also divide, manifesting as **pupils** in the eyes, granting the power of sight, hearing, speech, and smell, with all knowledge derived therefrom.

The **assisting stars’ essences** (辅弼二星, *Fǔbì Èr Xīng*) descend into the **eyes’ pupils** (目中瞳子, *Mùzhōng Tóngzǐ*).
The **Seven Stars’ spirits** possess both **yin-essence** (陰魄, *Yīnbò*) and **yang-soul** (陽魂, *Yánghún*), as well as the **essence of the True Star**.

Within the **Dipper’s Method of Dispelling Zoroastrians** (斗中除祆, *Dǒuzhōng Chúqián*), there are the **Five Marshals** (五帥, *Wǔshuài*), the **Four Virtues/Powers** (四德, *Sìdé*), the **Seven Thousand Divine Generals** (七千神將, *Qīqiān Shénjiàng*), the **Heavenly Ganges and River Bosses** (天罡河魁, *Tiāngāng Hékuí*), the **Great Slayer and Great Horn** (大殺大角, *Dàshā Dàjiǎo*), who stand resolute in the **Dipper’s Array** (豁落立斗, *Huòlà Lìdǒu*), clad in **black robes of primordial darkness** (黑衣玄冥, *Hēiyī Xuānmíng*), and the **Seven Slayer Spirits** (七殺之神, *Qīshā Zhīshén*), who extinguish **malevolent Zoroastrian demons** (凶祆, *Xiōngqián*) and sweep away **wandering malevolent spirits** (魔鬼, *Móguǐ*).

If one can **unify their heart** (齊心, *Jíxīn*) and **observe the fast** (修齋, *Xiūzhāi*), adorn themselves with **talismans and amulets** (服佩符箓, *Fúbèi Fúlù*), and **recite prayers with earnest devotion** (奏告懇祝, *Zòugào Kěnzhù*), then the **Seven Stars’ Great Gods** descend to that person’s dwelling, and the **Zoroastrian evils** are immediately dispelled.

If one can **inquire into the Dao’s essence** (稽索道要, *Jīsuǒ Dàoyào*) and **strive diligently for purity** (勤企止清, *Qínqǐ Zhǐqīng*), the **Seven Stars’ Gods** teach them the **Path to Ascension**, allowing them to **fly upward and become Immortals** (飛升神仙, *Fēishēng Shénxiān*), with the **Seven Ancestors** (七祖, *Qīzǔ*) guiding their **transformation into the Natural** (炼化自然, *Liànhuà Zìrán*).

The **Seven Stars’ essences**, the **Three Celestial Lights** (三辰, *Sānchén*), the **Five Dippers**, and the **Nine Palaces/Eight Trigrams** (九宮八卦, *Jiǔgōng Bāguà*) all reside within the **Sage’s heart**.

The **Seven Stars’ descending divine light** (降神, *Jiàngshén*) fills the **inner chambers** (華房, *Huáráng*), where the **inch of the heart** (方寸, *Fāngcùn*) contains **Seven Sanctums** (七室, *Qīshì*), subtle and profound secrets that must not be divulged.

Those who have already ascended to the **Highest True Path** (上真, *Shàngzhēn*) should not again engage in these practices.

At that moment, within the **Assembly of the Law** (法會, *Fǎhuì*), the **Northern Pole Sovereign** completes the recitation of the **Scripture**, and the **True Ones** oversee and bestow upon me. At that time, joy and celebration are beyond expression.

The **Law’s rites** are now fully known, and the **Ten Thousand Worlds** return to their proper order. In an instant, all sound fades into silence.

At that time, **heavenly beings and mortals** encountering the **Scripture and the Law** universally receive salvation and protection, preserving their **original nature** (本年, *Běnián*) and suffering no harm.

The **Seven Stars’ descending light** (垂光, *Chuíláng*) illuminates their **true forms** (真形, *Zhēnxíng*), internally generating the **Celestial Elixir** (玄丹, *Xuándān*), and externally dispelling the **Zoroastrian essences** (祆精, *Qiánjīng*). All turn toward the **Dao/Way** and follow its teachings with devotion.

They dispel **demons**, **illusions**, **delusions**, **cravings**, **attachment**, **perceptions**, **acquisitions**, **doubts**, and **evil**.
Their words align with the **Heavenly Law** (天律, *Tiānlù*), and their speech contains no falsehood. Their hearts are unified in **compassionate love** (慈愛, *Cí’ài*), and though their **bones differ**, they are bound as kin. The **land is secure**, the people prosperous, and they rejoice in **Great Peace**.

The **Scripture** originates from the **Assembly of the Law**, and the **entire land** follows the **Dao/Way**.
Those who have **sincere aspiration** (至心, *Zhìxīn*) and **reverently uphold** (宗奉, *Zōngfèng*) the teachings will all attain **world-transcendence** (度世, *Duòshì*).

The **Dao/Way** speaks: The names mentioned in the **Northern Pole Sovereign’s** recitation of the **Scripture** are all the **Hidden Titles** (隱韵, *Yǐnyùn*) of the **Seven Stars’ Celestial Array** (七星天中列帝, *Qīxīng Tiānzhōng Lièdì*), the **concealed sounds** of the **Northern Sovereign**, and the **secret names** of the **Hundred Gods** (百神, *Bǎishén*), not the common words of the world.

The **Supreme Sage** (上聖, *Shàngshèng*), having already become a **True Person** (真人, *Zhēnrén*), and **penetrating the Mysteries** (通玄究微, *Tōngxuán Jiūwēi*), knows all its chapters. When recited **ten times**, the **Eight Celestial Thunders** (八威, *Bāwēi*) march their armies, the **Five Heavens** (五天, *Wǔtiān*) hurl their flames, the **demon kings** (魔王, *Mówáng*) take warning in their ranks, the **star generals** (星使, *Xīngshǐ*) ride their celestial chariots, and a **myriad-hosted army** (甲卒億萬, *Jiǎzú Yìwàn*) beheads the **evil** and dispels the **Zoroastrian demons**, burning the **celestial clouds** (烧霞, *Shāoxiá*) and scorching the void (燎空, *Liàokōng*), with the **golden axe** (金鉞, *Jīnyuè*) marking the light. The **hosts of demons** are bound in form, their **essences extinguished**, the **returning corpses** (回尸, *Huíshī*) rise from death, and the **white bones** (白骨, *Báigǔ*) are restored to life.

The **scholars of profound learning** (至學之士, *Zhìxué Zhīshì*), when reciting the **Scripture** ten times, will see the **Seven Primordials** descend in truth, the **Three Realms** bow in homage, the **demonic essences** lose their power, and the **ghostly Zoroastrian demons** be extinguished. They will save the dying and bring life to the departed, severing rebirth and attaining existence.

Thus it is that scholars, with reverent recitation of this profound text,
spread the **Primordial Warrior’s** *qi*, slaughtering and purifying the **Zoroastrian demons**,
sweeping away defiled *qi*, embodying the **Perfect Truth**,
and summoning dominion over the ten directions.
Though their might does not yet govern the **Celestial Mandate**,
their **virtue** suffices to subdue the **Earthly Spirits**,
binding the **demonic essences**—yet only to repel death,
not to restore life.
Light recitation brings calamity to body and wealth,
while reverent offerings and homage bring prosperity to the household,
generation after generation, flourishing and radiant.
Bound to the **auspicious causes**, they escape all misfortune,
and the **Divine Ones** guard their gates.

This **Scripture** is most exalted, unmatched in the **Jade Capital**,
its salvific power boundless, the **root of ten thousand Dao**.
Its grandeur is vast and its **virtue** profound.
The **Way** declares:
*"Whoever recites this Scripture ten times,*
*the **Celestial Steed** of the **Central Dipper** descends,*
*the **Seven Stars’ Great Deities** arrive,*
*and the **Heavenly Emperor’s Envoys** gather,*
*to eradicate the **Zoroastrian demons**,*

*Capturing ghosts and searching corpses,*

*wandering the **Great Void**.*

*This Scripture is subtle and wondrous,*
*its salvific power boundless,*
*all **Heavenly Beings and mortals** rejoicing in its blessings.*
*Infinite blessings bestow life and death’s grace.*
*Treasured by the Heavens, it is not passed to the world below.*
*Only the **Noble Ones**, bearing gold and jewels with sincere devotion,*
*pledge to the Heavens before transmitting it.*
*Leakage or negligence invites calamity upon nine generations,*
*eternal servitude in the **Ghostly Bureaucracy**.*

*Attending this Scripture are the **Five Emperors**,
*with **Jade Boys and Jade Maidens**, twenty-four each,*
*guarding the **Divine Texts** and protecting those who receive it.*

The **Way** declares:
*"In the first month, with prolonged fasting,*
*reciting this Scripture,*
*the **Seven-Star True Lords** open the **Northern Mystic Registers**,*
*examining the guilty spirits,*
*the **Central Dipper’s Commanders** refining the **Seven Stars’ Light**,*

*erasing death to grant rebirth.*

*"In the tenth month, with prolonged fasting,*
*reciting this Scripture,*
*the **Central Dipper’s Heavenly Sovereign** seizes the **Seven Stars***
*to eradicate the **Zoroastrian demons**.*
*The **Red Emperor and Yellow Old One**, together with the **Omen’s Refined Soul**,
*shade beneath the **Flowering Canopy**,*
*sitting upon the **Seven Stars**,*
*their **Stellar Essence** entering the brain,*
*the **True Fire** refining the form.*
*The **Violet Lord of the Vital Marrow**, whose taboo name is **Guiying**,
*reclines upon a **Golden Bed in a Jade Pavilion**,*
*adorned in **Purple Embroidered Silk Skirts**,*
*with a **Fire-Bell Girdle**,*
*eradicating the **Zoroastrian demons** and extinguishing the **Spirit-Essences**—*
*blessings and慶 naturally arise,*
*their station reaching the **Highest Minister**.*
*As **kings and emperors**,*
*rulers and subjects,*
*fathers and sons,*
*they stabilize the **national fate**,*
*preserve the **Heavenly Mandate**,*
*enduring forever without cessation,*
*always as sovereigns,*
*stabilizing their domains,*
*the people calling it the **Great Peace**.*

*"On the **Eight Nodes’ Days**, reciting this Scripture,*
*the **Seven Stars’ Light** spreads across the eight directions,*
*the **Northern Emperor** takes the central position,*
*the **Nine Palaces** aligning,*
*one white, two black,*

*attaining the **Nine-Palace True One**.*

*"On one’s **Birthday**, reciting this Scripture,*
*[when the hour is] **Zi, Chou, Wu, Wei**,*

*fast and enter the chamber,*
*facing east,*
*knocking the teeth thirty-two times,*
*hearing the **Thirty-Two Heavens** above,*
*bowing in the heart thirty-two times,*
*closing the eyes,*

*purple, green, and crimson—*
*dark and vast within and without,*
*the **Seven Stars** covering the head,*

**Primordial Emperor’s Supreme Scripture of Boundless Salvation**
**Primordial Mystic Essence’s Sacred Original Chapter**
**The Seven Stars’ Eradication of Zoroastrian Demons**
**The Primordial Halter’s Salvation of Mortals.'"*

The **Celestial Gate** turns and shifts—
separation and union by nature’s own design.
The heavens hold three souls,
two luminous essences contained within.
The heavens hold seven spirits,
seven luminaries flowing with essence.

The **Azure Pavilion** bends and straightens,
five and three ascending in flight.
Purple clouds form the gate,
green mists drift obscurely.

Within lies the **Northern Pole**,
a golden city of nine layers.
Mountains encircle, peaks arrayed,
dark grasses drooping with dew.

The **Cavern’s Portal** is deep and dim,
eight pathways of pure vacancy.
Head erect, firm and mighty,
feet tread the **Black Dragon**,
hand wields the **Emerald Veil**,
striking jade, knocking bronze bells.

**Heavenly Ding** with nine heads,
four-eyed aged sage,
bearing the **Golden Axe**,
quelling Zoroastrian fiends.

The **Revolving Pearl** as pivot,
moving by void mechanism,
the **True Dao** unfolds naturally,
its light spreading through the Nine Palaces.

The **Great God of the Dipper** stands,
thunderous and majestic.
The **Nine Fiends** vanish,
clad in the Dipper, riding the wind.
Spitting venom, spewing flame,
endlessly guarding the world.

Ghostly spirits scatter and cower,
the **Divine Treasury** shines clear.
Azure *qi* washes through,
blending with the hundred deities.
The **Golden Gate, Jade Chamber**,
red mirror’s radiance takes flight.
Flowing clouds stretch ten thousand *zhang*,
pervading the Eight Dark Realms.

Within are the **Seven-Star Gods of Zoroastrian Eradication**,
within the **Celestial Strategist, Sovereign of Purple Extremity**,
within the **True One of Azure Constellation, Supreme Emperor**,
within the **Great God of Heavenly Ding Binding the Dragon**,
within the **Lord of Black Heavenly Killing, Four Virtues and Five Marshals**,
within the **True Lord of Heavenly Peng’s Mighty Transformation, Mystic Luster**,
within the **Seven-Star Sovereign God of Primordial Halter’s Sacred Ordinance**.

Lions and white cranes,
their roars and songs resounding.
**Heaven’s First** opens the path,
**Divine Soldiers** guard the axle,

timely ascension at every moment,
the **Northern Capital’s Cold Pool**,

With the eons’ wheel turning,

Forever salvaging the **Three Abysses**,
the **Five Sufferings and Eight Hardships**,
transcending the **Three Realms**,
adrift in **Upper Clarity**.

**Upper Clarity’s Heaven**,
**Heavenly Emperor of Jade Purity**,
the **Formless Realm of *Dharma*-Walking**.

**Heavenly True Sovereign** declares:

the True Ones of Zoroastrian Eradication—
by the **Great Emperor of the Northern Pole**, successor to the **Primordial Emperor of Heaven**,
entrusted to **Mingwei True Person of Cloud Palace, Purple Chamber, and Manifest Awe**."*

**Mingwei** holds the **Highest True** rank,
sequentially titled **Dao-Speaker**,
for logic resides within.
As for the **Thirty-Two Heavens**,
they are the **spokes** of the **Thirty-Two Heavens**,
the **Twenty-Eight Constellations** as wheels,
the **Seven Stars** as the **box**,
the **Two Luminaries** as **checks**,
the **Northern Pole** as **pivot**,
all converging at the four quarters.
The **Thirty-Two Heavens**—

---
**Thirty-Two Heavens, Thirty-Two Emperors**
The hidden names of the Heavens, the hidden titles of the Emperors.
The void within the Heavens, naturally forming sacred diagrams.
The sounds of the Seven Stars, the majesty of the Seven Stars.
The gods of the Seven Stars, the great demons of the Seven Stars, the spirits of the Seven Stars—
Nine harmonies, ten unions, transforming into the Highest Clarity.

The boundless mysteries, profound beyond measure.
Eighty-four thousand stars, great and small, the Celestial River’s Nine Districts,
The True Child of the Northern Dipper.
Dark-bodied, beastly in form, awe-inspiring and revered—
The Seven Stars of the North, the True Form’s essence.

If you know this, the *qì* of the demons will not interfere,
The gates of the spirits will be scattered, the Primordial Dipper’s essence will soar,
The gods will transform, the *qì* will manifest—
Boundless and spiritually resonant.

With a green body, three braids, yellow eyes, and a black form,
Eighteen rays, twelve flying wheels.
Or transformed as a woman, in embroidered robes and crimson skirts,
Or as an old man, with a purple sash and dark headwrap.
Or as a red serpent, a giant tortoise with a serpent’s body,
Spouting fire, emitting smoke, hurling bells to summon clouds.

Before Heaven and Earth were born, the Seven Stars were in chaotic darkness.
The Holy Mother of Wu gave birth to them on Kunlun.
The essence of the Seven Stars transformed into the Seven True Ones,
Wearing jade caps, cloaked in green with golden sashes,
Their *qi* forming talismans, the Supreme’s mysterious script.

The Eastern Dipper opens life, riding the Azure Void on smoke.
The Western Dipper’s brilliance soars through the heavens.
The Northern Dipper’s dark radiance transforms into True Immortals,
Their gaze stealing sunlight, their hands grasping the Celestial Lock.
The Southern Dipper’s Vermilion Precision rides dragons with banners,
Overseeing records and commanding the boundless.
The Central Dipper’s Imperial *Qi* wears a jewel-crowned lotus,
Riding a dragon robe, bearing the Five Classics,
Leading the Heavenly Ganges, with all gods powerless before them.

The **Green Heaven Demon King**—**Bīn Chǐ Yuán Chéng**.
The **Red Heaven Demon King**—**Lín Zhì Fāng Shēng**.
The **White Heaven Demon King**—**Wén Zhū Yù Yīng**.
The **Black Heaven Demon King**—**Huáng Dào Xuán Míng**.
The **Yellow Heaven Demon King**—**Hé Hùn Yuán Jīng**.

The Five Great Demons, the ancestors of all gods,
With flying drums and banners, commanding ghostly armies.
Wielding flags and drums, they roam the cosmos,
Self-proclaimed as **Hè Yì**, their deeds equal to the Heavens.
They judge mortals from above, strictly overseeing the Northern Underworld.

The Seven Stars of Slaying sweep away all inauspiciousness.
The Tortoise summons *qi*, the Vermilion Serpent unfurls its coils,
The Giant Spirit strikes the bell, the Divine Consort presents incense.
The Azure-Tongued Marshal, the Green-Toothed King—
They obey the Seven Stars, their transformations radiant with power.

Black *qi* darkens the sky, the sea wind howls,
The flowing fire blazes, the Lightning Maiden’s jade pendants gleam.
The Dragon Flag sweeps the heavens, its shockwave dazzling—
Demons’ brains are crushed, the *qì* sect hides in defeat.
The Three Officials of the North, the Underworld’s bright inspection—
No hiding place remains; the Golden Horse Relay presents the guilty.

A universal proclamation is made, all gods listen.
The Three Realms’ Five Emperors speak to the Highest Clarity.
The vast **Yù Jīng**—boundless and immeasurable—
The Primordial *qi* forms clouds, the Purple Brightness’s jewel-wheel.
Dazzling the cosmos, firmly rooted in Heaven’s foundation,
Its roots connect to the Wind Marsh, the Hollow Void gives birth to dragons,
As *yin* and *yang* intertwine, movement sparks flight.

The Supreme Light’s dark armor, the Twelve Primordials.
Its body coils around the Azure Veil, its back bears the Divine Continent.
The sun and moon flow beside it, the Three Mysterious Treasures gleam.
All transformations merge in brilliance, illuminating the floating light.
Thirty-five divisions, twenty-eight constellations—
The Heavenly Form’s depiction, the revolving cosmic chart.
The Dipper’s stars—**Dī Fáng Shēn Wěi**—circle the radiant brilliance.
The Horn, Handle, and Net stars soar through the Vermilion Veil.
Within lies the Cloud Cord, its light encircling the Imperial Palace.
[Missing text]—**the Seven Great Kings**, transforming into **Tiān Pēng**.
Ten million fire soldiers, the Eighteen-Eyed Old Man,
Howling to summon black *qi*, the Giant Thunder Dragon.
The Just Wind Spirit-Tiger, the Southern Vermilion Jade Boy—
They behead and exterminate demonic groups, annihilating ghostly blades.

Above Heaven and below Earth, no darkness, no obscurity,
No form, no shadow, no limit, no end.
The boundless **Míng Huǎng Dà Fàn**, vast and lightless.
The Seven Primordial’s radiance extinguishes all inauspiciousness.
The Three Celestial Bodies unite in clarity, the Supreme One presents the script.
The Jade Emperor descends to observe, the Yellow Flag summons spirits.
The Void’s *qi* forms seals, the jade talisman’s sacred text.
Engraved on golden tablets, blending the Nine Primordial *yang*.
Divine omens arise naturally, the Purple Hall’s Mysterious Platform.
The *qi* of the *fàn* pervades, all patterns unfold.
Degrees flow and transform, the Thirty-Two Heavens revolve.
The celestial axis sweeps through the rooms, returning to the Northern Mysterious.
The Seven Stars blaze, gathering *qi* to the Highest Primordial.
The Eight Sceneries merge in darkness, the *qi* enters the Deepest Mysterious.
Within the Mysterious, the Dipper Stars—
The Northern Pole’s exalted eminence,
Floating across the Azure Micro, converging at the Sentence Array.
The Golden True One holds the script, presenting it to the Heavenly Sovereign.
The Jade Sound summons *qi*, the spirit’s transformation shines forth.
The Pure Void radiates, its wheel turning through the ten thousand directions.
Thousands and ten-thousands unite, naturally becoming True.
Within the True lies the spirit, the Primordial Dipper’s Great Lord,
The Emperor of the Primordial Net, the Yellow-Silk Flying Immortal,
The Supreme One who governs fate, the Peach-Kang Union—
These great gods are the Seven Stars, the gods of transformation.

The Seven Gods reside within the body, exorcising demons and refining the True.
Heaven has the Three Platforms, man has the Three Souls.
Heaven has the Seven Stars, man has the Seven Spirits.
The Three Souls govern the *yang*, the Seven Spirits govern the *yin*.
The Three Platforms and Six Stars—void essence, pure *qi*—
When they converge, they give birth to curves:
Heavenly corpses, Earthly corpses, and human corpses—
Together forming the Six Spirits.

「Summon the True and descend the Spirit,
Exorcise and annihilate the demonic miasma,
Wield talismans and grasp scriptures,
Guard life and nurture its roots.

Ascend to the Upper Game and Upper Purity,
Enter and exit the Celestial Palace,
Within the Eight Murky Realms,
In the minutest depths.

Descend to govern the human form,
The Great Cavern of the Muddy Pellet,
The Vermilion Palace’s Mysterious *Qi*,
Mingled with the Hundred Spirits.

Tenfold revolutions restore the Spirit,
Ten-thousand *qi* harmonize with the Immortals.

The Dao/Way of Immortals values life,
Measureless salvation for all beings.

The Upper Rotation of the Seven Stars,
Flying Celestial Law Wheels.

Transgressions and blessings—prohibitions and karmic causes,
Host fate and retributive ties.

All-embracing reception and universal liberation,
Dead souls reborn into bodies.

Bodies thus receive life,
Ascending to hear all the heavens.

Above all heavens,
Each has its own Gate of Birth.

Within are verses of Void Caverns and Echoing Songs,
Seven Stars’ Sacred Scriptures,
Words attuned to the Highest Truth.

**First: The Chapter of the Seven Stars’ Flying Boy**
The sound of *Yuándòu*’s flying ladle—
Broad and vast, the True Stars.

Sunshine and lightning, thunderfire,
Subduing demonic legions.

Directing the Primordial Transformation,
Guarding the Heavenly Gate.

First establishing *Zǐwēi*’s Purple Weft,
Hurling fire, scattering gold.

Spreading across the Nine Paths,
The True of the Northern Pole.

Turning the Two Principles,
Commanding all Spirits.

Thirty-six boys, jade caps and pearl tassels,
Overseeing celestial records,
Holding the keys of life’s formation.

Their radiance boundless,
Demons and monsters vanish unseen.

Severing evil, capturing ghosts,
The Right Dao/Way flows unobstructed.

Dispelling the Nine Abominations,
Heaven clears, Earth settles.

**Second: The Chapter of the Seven Stars’ Jade Consort**
Layered jade clouds, brocade brilliance,
Celestial splendor shines clear.

Within lies the Imperial Spirit,
Internally called the Jade Consort.

Pushing the celestial reckoning,
Guiding the Four Seasons through the heavens.

Lightning’s flash resplendent,
Stars’ constellations scattered.

Commanding the Ninefold Legions,
For the world, exorcising demons.

Bestowing blessings, averting calamities,
The Right Dao/Way reveals itself.

Fourfold jade talismans fly,
Ten-thousand evils purged.

Primordial Transformation surges,
Piercing *Qi* through the Purple Expanse.

Once received, the True Mystery,
Form and Spirit never decay.

Wearing the Nine, treading the Mysterious Palace,
Circulating through the Four Symbols.

*Tàiwēi*’s revolving light,
The Divine Repository opens from afar.

**Third: The Chapter of the Seven Stars’ Godly King’s Song of the Day**
Black armor spans the sky,
The Three Officials array their words.

True and Demon Spirits’ generals,
Ten-thousand legions at their command.

*Tiānpéng* treads the Primordial One,
The Dark Mother opens the Golden Gate.

*Líyīng* heralds the Imperial Truth,
Revolving light surges through the Great Microcosm.

Majestic, the Godly Expanse’s Lord,
Riding the Dragon, tilling the Celestial Peach.

Fragrant breath permeates the Primordial Framework,
Spiritual illumination reveals the Divine Pool.

Stepping through the Cloudy Net,
Flowing incense scatters across Heaven’s Streams.

Twenty-five mingled with Mysterious Scenes,
Three Primordials array the Jade Mechanism.

Interweaving the logic of the Imperial Rotation,
Commanding *Qi*, harmonizing with Immortals’ flight.

The Crimson Spirit shines at the Afar Obscure,
The Azure Boy opens the Heavenly Gate.

Exorcising demons, aiding the Right Dao/Way,
My Dao/Way daily flourishes bright.

These Three Chapters—above the Three Realms,
Within the flying void—
The Stars’ True Songs, their verses attuned to the Cavern’s Depths.

Recite them one hundred times,
And your name will be recorded in the Southern Palace.

Recite them one thousand times,
And the Demon King will come to welcome you.

Ten-thousand recitations complete the Dao/Way,
Ascending to the Great Void,
Crossing the Three Realms,
Ranking among the Immortal Lords.

Hearing the Sacred Sound,
The Seven Stars guard your form,
Imperial decrees command the Earthly Spirits,
Attending as escorts to send and welcome,
Extracted from the Earthly Portal,
Five Sufferings and Eight Hardships,
Seven Ancestors ascend,
Forever parted from the Demon Officials,
Souls pass through the Vermilion Gate,
Refined and reborn.

This is called Measureless,
Universal Salvation without end.

There are hidden Heavenly Scriptures,
All the heavens hold them in reverence.

Revealing them carelessly leads to the Hell Realm,
Disaster befalls the Seven Ancestors.

The Dao/Way says: These two chapters are the Sacred Words of the Heavenly Sovereigns,
And the Hidden Songs of the Spirit-Demon Kings,
The Seven Stars’ Godly Kings of Immortal Truth.

All are the words of the Great *Bramah*,
Not the common speech of mortals.

Words without melodious grace,
Verses without ornate beauty—
All are the Seven Stars’ esoteric formulas for exorcism,
The Highest Truth’s profound and guarded secrets.

Thus called the Mysterious and Profound,
Difficult to fathom in detail.

Treasure of the heavens,
Hidden in the Godly Expanse’s Eastern Vault,
By the Mysterious Science passed through the Four Ten-thousand Kalpas.

If a perfected adept brings a golden treasure with a sincere heart,
According to the ancient format, pledging alliance to the Ten Heavens,
Then it shall be entrusted to them.

The Dao/Way says: When the heavens and earth complete their cycles,
The stars and constellations shift their courses,
The sun and moon lose their alignment,
The Four Seasons fail their due,
Yin and Yang fall out of harmony,
Disasters plague the realm—
Floods and fires ravage,
Plagues spread, epidemics flow,
The populace dies in droves,
Teachers and friends pass away,
Those with shared vows perish,
Or it is the Great Force’s Demon Gods,
The Six Caverns’ Ghostly Marshals,
Arbitrarily stirring demonic transformations—
One must also observe the fasts,
Burn incense, recite the scriptures.

The fasts and prohibitions, the recitation of scriptures,
Their merits are most profound.

Above, they dispel celestial calamities,
Guard and protect the Emperor.

Below, they avert poisonous harms,
Salvage the populace.

Life and death depend upon them,
Their blessings cannot be surpassed.

Thus called Measureless,
Universal Salvation for Heaven and Man.

The Dao/Way says: For all who possess this scripture,
It can enable the Heavenly Sovereigns, the Imperial Masters,
And the populace to perform these merits.」

「When calamities arise,
One must resolve to observe the fasts, burn incense,
And recite the scriptures ten times over—
All the celestial beings shall record their names,
Ten thousand spirits shall attend as guards,
And the righteous shall be distinguished from the common,
Thus attaining the merit of becoming a holy minister beneath the golden threshold of the Sage-King.

The celestial beings record the merit and fault of all,
Without the slightest loss or omission.

Even the demon kings in the heavens shall commend your virtue,
And those who attain the Dao shall now comprehend the profound truth.

**The hidden speech of the Great Brahma in the celestial realm, the Measureless Sound of the Ten Thousand Spirits and Five-Fight Demons:**

The ancient text first emerged in the Jade Threshold of the Northern Dipper,
And ascended to the Three Enclosures and the Gates of the Three Officials.
It traces the true path of the Seven Stars,
Commands the spirits and demons,
Slays evil and expels demonic forces—
The secret scripture of the Northern Sovereign.

The Heavenly Sage-King of old inscribed this text,
Establishing its true resonance.
Those who know this sound,
And observe the fasts while reciting it,
Shall have the celestial generals send flying spirit kings to inspect their form,
Record their diligent merits,
And present them to the celestial beings.
Ten thousand spirits shall pay homage,
Earthly deities shall guard the gates,
Great merit demon kings shall commend the highest truth,
And the Dao shall be complete—
Thus one may traverse the Three Realms,
Ascend into the Golden Gate.

This sound repels all that it encounters,
Averts all harm,
Delivers all beings,
Accomplishes all desires—
The natural sound of the Heavenly Sage.
Hence, when recited, it summons the flying spirits to descend and observe,
The Supreme Deity to chant from afar,
Ten thousand spirits to pay homage in the Three Realms,
Demon gods to bow in submission,
Ghostly spirits to perish of their own accord,
And the resounding brilliance to spread tenfold—
All realms grow tranquil,
Rivers and seas fall silent,
Mountains and hills swallow their mist,
All living beings tremble in awe,
Summoning the assembly of spirits,
Cleansing the heavens of all impurities,
The earth of all demonic dust,
And the netherworld of all obscurations—
A boundless, profound virtue.

**The Supreme Scripture of Measureless Salvation, Volume Thirty-Seven, concludes.**
**Volume Thirty-Eight begins.**」

**The Chapter on Divine Talismans for Removing Calamities**

The Dao speaks: *"In days of old, at the Vermilion Spirit’s Dan Heaven, where the Radiant and Illuminating Eightfold Glory shines upon the Divine Gate, I received from the Primordial Origin the sacred and wondrous talisman for removing calamities and saving beings. When the Primordial Origin, the Heavenly Venerable, was to expound this scripture, He circled ten times, calling forth the Ten Directions, and only then did He take His seat.*

*The Celestial True God, the Supreme Sage, the Mysterious Virtue True Person—with their countless retinues beyond reckoning—ascended through the void. The imperial mists mirrored the emptiness, jade wheels and gem-studded carriages gleamed, precious herbs and jeweled canopies unfurled, their radiance intertwining in dazzling splendor, ten thousand lights flashing in brilliance. For five days and five nights, the wondrous qi of the heavens interwove in patterned splendor, dragon-light and phoenix-hovering clouds gathering naturally, forming a chapter in an instant. The spirit wind swept clear, the stars paused their wheels, and all phenomena shone resplendent. Impurities dissolved, and across the land—earth, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees—seven treasures congealed into jade, their heights and depths equalized, all assuming the hue of floating, billowing clouds in the *liluo* pattern. The assembled True Ones took their places, and the Primordial Origin sat in seclusion upon the floating divine diagram of the Eight Spirits and Nine Transformations, the jade array above.

*When the scripture was expounded once, the Heavenly Great Saints all proclaimed its excellence. At that moment, the Ten Realms were purified, the spirit wind dispersed the mists, celestial omens manifested, and terrestrial auspicious signs appeared. All gathered in celebration, extending to all living beings. When the scripture was expounded twice, demonic plagues vanished, and the vermilion talismans shone in the void. When the scripture was expounded thrice, calamities and illnesses were dispelled. When the scripture was expounded four times, natural spirit-writings spontaneously appeared, illuminating the Eight Emptinesses. When the scripture was expounded five times, the people awakened to understanding, grasping the meaning of the talismans. When the scripture was expounded six times, all reverently upheld the sacred writings and attained the Dao/Way. When the scripture was expounded seven times, the precious writings and jade scriptures opened boundless salvation. When the scripture was expounded eight times, the three luminaries’ wondrous qi nourished the form and spirit. When the scripture was expounded nine times, tormented souls underwent transformation, refined in the Vermilion Mound. When the scripture was expounded ten times, the nation’s destiny was secured, eternal peace preserved. At that time, all men and women in the land, without exception, turned their hearts in devotion, all receiving protection and attaining longevity."*

The Dao speaks: *"When the Primordial Origin expounded the scripture once, the God-King of the Measureless Supreme Talisman of the East, the Most True Great God, with His countless retinues beyond reckoning, ascended through the void. When the scripture was expounded twice, the God-King of the Measureless Supreme Talisman of the South, the Most True Great God, with His countless retinues beyond reckoning, ascended through the void. When the scripture was expounded thrice, the God-King of the Measureless Supreme Talisman of the West, the Most True Great God, with His countless retinues beyond reckoning, ascended through the void. When the scripture was expounded four times, the God-King of the Measureless Supreme Talisman of the North, the Most True Great God, with His countless retinues beyond reckoning, ascended through the void. When the scripture was expounded five times, the God-King of the Measureless Supreme Talisman of the Northeast, the Most True Great God, with His countless retinues beyond reckoning, ascended through the void. When the scripture was expounded six times, the God-King of the Measureless Supreme Talisman of the Southeast, the Most True Great God, with His countless retinues beyond reckoning, ascended through the void. When the scripture was expounded seven times, the God-King of the Measureless Supreme Talisman of the Southwest, the Most True Great God, with His countless retinues beyond reckoning, ascended through the void. When the scripture was expounded eight times, the God-King of the Measureless Supreme Talisman of the Northwest, the Most True Great God, with His countless retinues beyond reckoning, ascended through the void. When the scripture was expounded nine times, the God-King of the Measureless Supreme Talisman of the Upper Realm, the Most True Great God, with His countless retinues beyond reckoning, ascended through the void. When the scripture was expounded ten times, the God-King of the Measureless Supreme Talisman of the Lower Realm, the Most True Great God, with His countless retinues beyond reckoning, ascended through the void. When the tenfold circuit was complete, the Measureless Masters of the Ten Directions, the God-Kings of the Supreme Talismans, the Celestial True Gods—all arrived together at once. All men and women in the land turned their hearts in reverence.*

*Those who came were as dense as rain and mist converging, their countless retinues beyond reckoning filling the land, causing the earth to tremble—an unstoppable force. Thus, the Primordial Origin, seated in meditation, gazed into the void and summoned His mighty divine power. From His mouth issued sacred writings in cloud-script and dragon-patterns, flowing like molten gold, their eight-cornered brilliance radiating keenness. They shifted and transformed in the void, forming a precious altar nine zhang above the earth, beneath which floated the华云 (*huayun*—clouds of glory*). The Primordial Origin ascended, along with the Celestial True Gods, the Supreme Sages, the Mysterious Virtue True Persons, the God-Kings of the Measureless Supreme Talismans of the Ten Directions, the Most True Great Gods, the divine talisman officers, and their countless retinues beyond reckoning—all ascending to the altar that had manifested.*

*The heavenly and human beings looked on and saw them ascending gradually from the four sides of the altar. Once ascended, none were left behind. The people of the land dispersed, and the earth returned to its natural stillness. The Primordial Origin then, upon the precious altar, completed the expounding of the scripture. The assembled True Ones oversaw the salvation and transmitted it to me. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words. The ritual matters were now complete, the heavens and their hosts returned to their places, and in an instant, all sound ceased.*

*At that time, those who encountered the scripture’s teachings were all saved, their lives preserved for the year, calamities and injuries averted. All turned in devotion, and all attained auspicious karmic roots. Free from worry or vexation, from illness or misfortune, from fear or terror, from calamity or disaster, from trials or demonic assaults—speech aligned with the Dao’s intent, the heart with the Dao’s truth. All were harmonized in unity, disparate bones forming kinship. The nation was secure, the people prosperous, rejoicing in great peace. The teaching emerged, and the land was governed by the Dao. Those who approached with sincere hearts, revering and worshipping, all attained world-transcendence."*

The Dao speaks: *"What the Primordial Origin spoke within the scripture are the roots of the Five Elders’ Divine Fire-refining luminous essence, the hidden and void-transforming essence of the Three Primordials’ wondrous qi, the secret inner names of the gods. They are also the taboo names of the Three Heavens and the hidden names of the hundred spirits—not the common words of the world. The Supreme Sage, having already perfected the True Person, penetrating the Mysterious and attaining the Marvelous, could fully comprehend these writings. When recited ten times, the demon kings bowed in reverence, malevolent spirits perished, impurities were cleansed, the Dao’s qi harmonized with the divine, the two luminaries shone forth, the Five Glories received their brilliance, calamities and plagues dispersed, and death was turned back into life."*

The learned and virtuous, reciting this scripture ten times, shall receive the Emperor of the True’s discerning aid, the High Celestial descending in splendor, secretly imparting Mysterious utterances, precious talismans, and jade inscriptions. Together, they govern ghosts and demons, repelling calamity and deceit.

Thus it is: the sacred sounds converge in the subtle purity, the supreme principles harmonize with the Primordial roots. The wondrous essence is stirred, summoning qi and attaining the True. The transformations are boundless, nothing escapes its divine power. Lightly reciting this chapter brings misfortune upon oneself. Reverently supplying offerings and rites, one’s gates flourish. Prosperity endures through generations, divine symbols avert disasters, and ten thousand calamities cannot approach. The numinous protects the door.

This scripture is most exalted and unique, unmatched in the Jade Capital, saving countless beings and serving as the source of ten thousand Dao. Its grandeur is vast and its virtue immeasurable.

The scripture states: Those who recite this text ten times shall have all the heavens converge, the thirty-six thousand divine symbols of wondrous qi, and the eighty-four thousand essences of the Vermilion Texts, all descending upon their bodies. The body undergoes refining and nourishment, forming the True and the Transcendent. After nine years, the jade talismans confirm their birth, erasing the name of death, and all lingering souls—suffering from grievances and entangled in the depths—are all rescued and granted freedom. Their forms transform, their nature and insight become clear, and they reverently uphold the subtle words, their Mysterious powers fully manifest. They ascend to the Nine Palaces, surpass the Great Vermilion, and soar beyond the Purple Clarity.

The learned who cultivate and recite this scripture shall have the true texts of the Nine Heavens gathered within their essence, binding the sacred threads of the spirit, entering their bodies, enveloping the Five Viscera, nourishing the refined essence, extending their lifespan to longevity and ascension. Common folk who recite it shall summon divine officials, talismans following as attendants, the True Rulers of the Three Luminaries, and the Five Qi Celestial Sovereigns, whose awe-inspiring spirits guard against ten thousand calamities. Their bodies are infused with Dao-qi, and at death, their True essence does not perish. They ascend directly to the Southern Palace, returning to transformation and eternal existence.

This scripture is subtly wondrous, universally saving without end, and all heavenly and human beings receive its blessings, their lives and deaths both favored.

A treasure of the heavens, it is not transmitted to the mortal world. Only the virtuous, bearing gold and jewels with sincere devotion, may swear to the heavens and pass it on. Leakage or negligence brings ruin upon nine generations, and eternal servitude to ghostly officials.

The scripture is guarded by the Five Emperors, with twenty-four Direct-Symbol Jade Boys and Jade Girls each, attending and protecting those who receive it.

The scripture states: In the first month, with prolonged fasting, recite this scripture to invoke the Long-Living Jade True Highest Sovereign Emperor of the Eastern Extremity Palace in the Upper Primordial. He bestows the Nine Qi Mysterious Life-Generating Symbols, protecting and saving one’s body. The nine ancestral spirits, submerged in darkness, are all liberated, merging with the Dao.

In the seventh month, with prolonged fasting, recite this scripture to invoke the Precious Flower Most Wondrous Supreme Extremity Highest Sovereign of the Western Ling Highest Brightness Palace in the Middle Primordial. He proclaims the Seven Qi Golden Light Jade Symbols, severing karmic bonds, subduing demonic essences, dissolving guilt, and eternally preserving purity. The Golden True refines the flowered essence, the jade-like vitality flourishes within, the body grows firm, and longevity spans ten thousand years.

In the tenth month, with prolonged fasting, recite this scripture to invoke the Jade Sovereign Great Dao Supreme Emperor of the Northern True Purple Supreme Palace in the Lower Primordial. He scatters divine blessings, bestowing the Five Qi Heavenly Mysterious Great Symbols, sweeping away deceit and impurity, banishing malevolent omens, safeguarding the state and people, ensuring the emperor’s longevity, and extending boundless blessings and fortune to all under heaven, perpetually preserving the Great Peace.

On the eight seasonal festivals, recite this scripture to invoke the Eight Scenes Vermilion Precision Dan Flower Jade Text Eight Mighty Divine Strategies of Luminous Qi, descending upon the body, nourishing the Nine Palaces, and filling the Three Fields with True essence. All ailments are dispelled, ten thousand harms are cut off, demons cower in fear, and one escapes calamity. The Green Book records their merits, the Purple Talisman marks their ascension, and their Mysterious powers ascend to the Upper Clarity.

The scripture states: On days of practice, one must first bathe in fragrant water, fast, and enter the chamber facing east. Knocking the teeth thirty-two times, one hears the Thirty-Two Heavens. Bowing the heart thirty-two times, one closes the eyes, meditating on the seated figure enveloped in clouds of green, yellow, and white. Within and without, the darkness swells, and there appear the Six Jia Direct Symbols, the Nine Palace officials and degree-symbol gods, the Direct-Symbol generals and attendants, arrayed on either side. The sun and moon illuminate the chamber, its brilliance piercing through, a round symbol forming at the neck, its light radiating in all ten directions—thus, clearly manifest.

The secret incantation reads:
*"Supreme Mysterious Primordial,
Highest Dao Lord.
Summon forth from my body the thirty-two officials of the Three Five, left and right officers, the fragrant jade boys attending, the speaking jade girls, the Five Emperors’ Direct Symbols, the Direct-Day Fragrant Officials—each thirty-two in number—opening the way to my words.*

Today is a day of joyous blessing, with prolonged fasting in the pure hall, practicing this supreme scripture to save countless beings. May my petition reach above, directly before the Throne of the Supreme Primordial Emperor of the Thirty-Two Heavens.

*Conclude, drawing qi thirty-two times, facing east and reciting the scripture.*

**The Supreme Primordial Scripture of Unlimited Salvation, Most Wondrous Chapter**

The Supreme Primordial Hidden Rhyme, the Divine Symbol of Wondrous Difficulty Removal, the Jade Text of Boundless Transformation, tenfold in saving beings.

The True Heaven’s hidden sounds, naturally merging and separating. The Mysterious Void’s eight layers, the Great Chaos’s origin. The luminous light forms the body, brightly illuminating the Jade Capital. It differentiates into the Three Scenes, inheriting the purity of the Seven Primordials. Endlessly applied, it encompasses the True Spirit.

The talismans are inscribed, commanding all spirits. Established through talismans, acting through talismans, saving through talismans, generating through talismans. The talismans’ decrees—none dare disobey. Where calamity approaches, it vanishes without trace. This is the divine treasure.

The Northern Emperor’s hidden inscription, the Heavenly Sovereign’s phoenix seal. The Mysterious Law’s female green, the great edict suppressing evil. The Grand Architect’s unity, beyond the body’s destruction and annihilation."

The mountain demons crush the wicked, the Purple Court’s hidden mysteries unfold.
The net spreads its unyielding might, slaughtering ghosts with merciless clarity.

Within the Abyss of Subdued Demons, the Yellow Talisman and White Scriptures refine suffering souls through supreme alchemy, confining them to the Great Mystery.

They govern the Dark Void, commanding life and death, their salvation boundless.

Within are the luminous gods of transformation,
the sovereigns who dispel calamity and scatter misfortune,
the great gods who annihilate demons and shatter harm,
the Nine-Light Three-Qi Venerable Ones,
the Five Emperors wielding talismans and decrees—
their majestic might subdues, revives the dead, and liberates countless beings.

and the **Ten Directions’ Ultimate True Flying-Heaven Talisman-Dispelling-Difficulty Divine Kings, Eternal World-Liberating Great Gods**—

All ascend in the **Scenic Cloud-Crimson Chariot**, with feathered brilliance and flowing canopies, imperial radiance and jade-encrusted wheels, yoked to scaled phoenixes and crimson winds, bearing the Nine-Light Jade Banners and Five-Qi Glorious Flags.
Before them, the **Lion and White Crane** resound with melodious harmony,
while the Four Generals clear the path, the Jade Emperor’s chariot wheels gleaming,
a myriad hosts soaring on white mist, their splendor flashing like lightning.
They command the transformation of essence, manifesting the **Celestial Sovereign’s aura**,
overseeing the **Taiwei Jade Palace**, as the **Heavenly Halter’s Chief Minister**,
holding talismans and decrees, assembling the lofty and pure.

They examine the sentiments of all things under Heaven, rescuing each according to their nature,
deploying the **Three Caverns’ formations**.
They proclaim to the **Ten Directions’ Five-Peak Divine Lords**—
from the Southern Elixir Fields to the Northern Abyss,
across the rivers and seas to the murky wilderness—
where the Imperial Edict reaches, wind and fire relay it swiftly.
They suppress and investigate malevolent omens, excising guilt and wickedness,
until the long night of sin binds the sinking souls—
all are absolved, their miasma cleansed,
no demon or poison dare resist.

The sacred scriptures circulate, gathering all spirits,
all receiving **Dao and virtue**, refined by the sun’s essence.

they bear decrees from the Supreme God,
proclaiming true talismans.
In response to karmic inclinations,
virtuous ones are summoned.

The **Third Scripture of the Supreme One’s Mysterious Flying Talisman**:
**Jade Sovereign’s Hidden Decree** of the **Upper Purity’s** **Clear Micro Heaven**—
above these **Three Realms**,
within the **Flying Void**,
**Mysterious Transformations’** divine talismans,
naturally forming texts.

The **Supreme One’s True Talismans**,
the **Three Realms’ True Lords**,
**Divine Talismans’** songs and sounds,
harmonizing with the **Mysterious Chapters**.

「When recited a hundred times, one’s name ascends to the **Southern Celestial Palace**.
When recited a thousand times, the **demon kings** bow in welcome.
When recited ten thousand times, the **Dao** is complete,
and one ascends to the **Flying Void**,
crossing the **Three Realms**,
to attain the rank of **Immortal Official**.

Upon hearing the **numinous sounds**,
demons flee in terror,
and by imperial decree, the **Earth Deities** are commanded
to serve as escorts and guardians,
shielding one from worldly calamities,
dissolving misfortunes and afflictions,
quelling official strife and weapons,
the **Five Sufferings** and **Eight Hardships**,
and granting the **Seven Ancestors** ascension.
One shall forever depart from **ghostly tribulations**.

The **Divine Talismans** transcend mortal form,
**Spiritual Essence** refined anew.
Riding the **Dao’s** numinous power,
one receives transformation naturally.

The **Divine Talismans** protect life,
and their resonance ascends to the **Heavenly Hosts**.
They hold **secret celestial scriptures**,
which all **Heavenly Hosts** revere.
Should one reveal them carelessly,
one shall fall into the **Hell of Torment**,
and bring ruin upon the **Seven Ancestors**.

The **Dao** declares:
These **Mysterious Chapters** are the hidden voices
of the **Heavenly Sovereigns** and **True Talismans** of the **Divine Talisman Kings**,
all the speech of **Mahabrahma**,
not the common words of the mortal world.
Without melodic grace or ornate phrasing,
they are called **profoundly esoteric**,
difficult to fathom fully.

Treasure of the **Heavens**,
hidden within the **Three Celestial Palaces** and **Three Mysterious Caverns**,
transmitted through **Four Ten-Thousand-Kalpa Eons** of arcane science.

If a **Perfect Sage** brings a heart of **golden treasure**,
and by the old **pattern** pledges alliance with the **Ten Heavens**,
then the **talismans** shall be entrusted to them.

The **Dao** declares:
Even the **Heavenly Earth’s** calamities have their **judicial assemblies**,
and the **Sun, Moon, and Five Stars** also have their **illuminations and eclipses**,
bringing **misfortune and disaster**.
The **Most Holy** and **Divine Sages** too have their **prosperity and decline**,
and the **unlearned** face **hardship and calamity**.
All who encounter such afflictions,
with **shared qi**, must **unify their hearts** and **observe fasts**,
burn incense at **all six hours**,
receive **talismans** and recite **scriptures**,
so that **virtue and power** descend swiftly,
and all **inauspicious omens** are dispelled.
The **limitless texts** universally save the boundless multitudes.

The **Dao** declares:
For the **unlearned**, whose understanding of the **Dao** is shallow,
or whose **Immortal Virtue** is yet unfulfilled,
if their **fateful cycle** is extinguished,
and their body passes through the **Great Darkness**,
at the moment of crossing,
those who share their **learning** must burn incense for them,
receive **talismans**, and recite **scriptures** ten times while resting.
Or, they may lie upon **clothing and bedding**,
reciting **scriptures** ten times in accordance with the **law**,
to transcend their mortal form.
Their **Spiritual Essence** shall ascend to the **Southern Celestial Palace**,
and by their **merits**, they shall be reborn on the appointed day.
If the **Wheel of Rebirth** does not cease,
then **Spiritual Fatigue** shall ensue.

The **Dao** declares:
During the **Three Primordial Cycles’** calamities,
when disasters arise in competition,
one must **observe fasts** and burn incense,
receive **talismans** and recite **scriptures**.

When **star hosts** influence one’s fate,
and **hardships and reversals** befall,
one must **observe fasts** and burn incense,
receive **talismans** and recite **scriptures**.

In times of **thieves and warfare**,
**water, fire, rivers, and wells**,
**collapsing stones, blades, and ropes**,
**epidemics, wrongful accusations, and familial strife**,
**husbands and wives torn apart**,
**children and youths dying young**,
**teachers and friends bound in suffering**,
and **all manner of calamities**,
one must **observe fasts** and burn incense,
receive **talismans** and recite **scriptures**.

For those who receive **talismans** and recite **scriptures**,
the **virtue and power** are most profound.
The **Three Heavens’ Divine Talismans**,
when used by the **Master**,
all yield **great efficacy**.
They dispel **celestial disasters** above,
and safeguard **emperors and kings**.
Below, they avert **calamities and misfortunes**,
and deliver **myriad people**.
The **talismans of life and death**,
their blessings are boundless.
Thus it is said: **limitless**,
universally saving **heavenly beings and mortals**.

The **Dao** declares:
All who possess this **scripture**,
can act as **sovereigns, ministers, parents, children, and myriad people**,
performing these **meritorious deeds**.
On days of **calamity**, they must **aspire with sincerity**,
**observe fasts**, burn incense, and receive **talismans**,
reciting **scriptures** ten times.
All shall be recorded by the **Heavens**,
and the **Ten Thousand Spirits** shall serve as guardians.
Those who receive **talismans** shall attain
the **golden gates** of the **Sage-King’s** **Celestial Palace**.
The **Heavenly Hosts** record every person’s **merits and demerits**,
without the slightest loss.
The **True Immortals of the Celestial Talismans** shall also
**commend and elevate** one’s **body**,
and those who attain the **Dao** shall **penetrate** these **profound words**.

The **hidden language** of the **Great Mahabrahma’s** **Divine Talismans**—
**limitless sounds** of the **Dao Sovereign**—
**revealed by the Primordial Talisman’s Jade Scriptures**,
the **Eight Celestial Treasures of the Eastern Quarter**.»

The **Purple Celestial Capital**, where the **Great Sovereign’s** sacred tones resound.
The **Mahābrahmā** and **Vairocana**—**Great Awakening**, **Dhyāni-Buddhas** revealed.
**Jambhala’s** reach extends, the **Red String’s** virtue compassionate.
**Hua Xian** ever flourishing, **Immortal Complements** attained.
Yet **Vairocana’s** subtle form—
**Dharmakāya’s** splendor, what name shall we bestow?
**Leading the **Dharma-Door**, the **Pure Path’s** rightful gate.
**Wondrous Spirits** transcend the void,
**Commanding the **Divine Departments**, **Mystic Patterns** revealed.

**Southward Eight Heavens**—
**Talisman’s Manifest Drive**, **Golden Blossoms**, **Jade Discourse**.
**Illustrious Edicts** subdue demons,
**Lunar Rites** before the **Ancestral Throne**.
**Wen Ni’s** hallowed platform, **Flower-Lit** with myriad hues.
**Mountains of the Capital**, **Imperial Summons** descend.
**Jade Barriers**, **Crimson Teeth**—
**Stellar Qi** drifts, **Azure Phoenix** ascends.
**Sun’s Progress** secured, **Lotus Pool’s** four wheels.
**Void’s Nurture** vast, **Treasure’s Peak**—**Mara’s** guise.
**Supreme Exhaustion**, **Immortal Departure**—
**Boundless Darkness**, **Dao’s** profound palace.

**Westward Eight Heavens**—
**Tortoise Pavilion’s** midstream, **Swallow’s** rare passage.
**Mang Ji’s** arrayed ranks, **Rainbow’s** elysian hall.
**Song’s Pavilion** sinks into dusk, **Lu’s** eastern peaks.
**Dharma’s Silence**, **Coiled Songs**—
**Trigrams’ Depths**, **Spiritual Metropolis**.
**Child’s Shadow** seeks **Kushinagar**,
**Steps** toward **Hengshan’s** summit.
**Talisman’s Halt**, **Legal Retribution**—
**Crimson Radiance**, **Flame-Crowned**.

**Dharma’s Ferry**, **Gods’ Manifestation**.
**Harmonious Celebration**, **Cowherd’s** ascent—
**Subtle Virtue**, **Devoted Immortals**.

**Northward Eight Heavens**—
**Guan Ao’s** noble name, **Cinnabar Essence** spreading through **Heaven’s** pole.
**Transformed Music** from the **Few**, **Ascending Stars** riding the **Void**.

**Female Weavers’** treasures refined.
**Rising Void’s** edicts, **Jia’s** discerning truth.
**Di Tu’s** subtle **Hu**—
**Long Rules** multiplying **People**.

**The Dao speaks**: These **Divine Talismans**, spreading **Transformation’s** **Heavens**,
reveal the **Mahābrahmā’s** **Hidden Language** in **Red Script**—
**Limitless Ages** past.
**Ancient Texts** flow through **Heaven’s Gate**, **Louvre’s** halls,
**Celestial Sovereigns’** **True Humans** recording with **Purple Brushes**,
characters a **丈** square, **eight-cornered**, **pendant rays**,
**curved yet majestic**, **refined and wondrous**—
deployed across the **Ten Directions**, above and below,
as **Sacred Talismans’** **Treasure Texts**.

Those who know their **sounds** and recite them in **fasting devotion**,
or inscribe **eight celestial characters** in **cinnabar** as **talismans**,
shall find **great efficacy**.

All **Heavens** dispatch **Talisman-Guarding Kings**,
**Directing Talisman Lords**, **Taiyi’s** envoys,
to inspect their **bodies**, record their **merits and labors**,
and report to the **Heavens**—
**Ten Thousand Spirits** pay homage,
**Earthly Deities** guard the gates,
**Great Merit** spans the **Three Realms**,
**Commending the **True Ones**—
when **Dao** is complete, they **penetrate** **Divine Manifestations**,
ascend through the **Imperial Pass**.

**Completion of the *Supreme Treasure Limitless Salvation Scripture* (上品妙经), Volume Thirty-Eight**
*New Daoist Canon Compilation Committee*

**Volume Thirty-Nine: The *Southern Palace Prolonged Life* Chapter**

The Dao speaks: Once, within the **Danling Heaven**, amid crimson clouds and golden winds, the **Juling Changtu** soil received the **Limitless Prolonged Life** from **Yuan Shi’s** transmission to **Southern Palace Nángōng Yánshēng**. When **Yuan Shi Tianzūn** was to expound this scripture, circling ten times to summon the **Ten Directions**, he then took his seat.

The **Heavenly True Great Deity**, the **Supreme Sage of High Venerability**, the **Mystic Conduct True Person**, the **Inner Supervisor of Southern Palace Nángōng**, the **Preserver of Immortality True Dao Lord**, the **Supreme True Ruler of Southern Palace Nángōng’s Celestial Mechanism**, the **Supreme True Ruler of Celestial Mechanism’s Officials**, the **True Ruler of Celestial Mechanism’s Weary Ones**, the **True Ruler of Celestial Mechanism’s Straight Gods**, the **Dan Yuan Immortal Officials**, the **Three Primordial Immortal Officials**, the **Celestial Mechanism’s Chief Clerks**, the **Godly Cavalry of the First Rank**, and the **Countless Hosts without Reins** arrived, riding the void. Beneath **crimson clouds and divine mists**, their **jewel-carved carriages** and **cinnabar wheels** gleamed, **phoenix canopies** cast their shade, and **flowing violet light** radiated in **nine hues**, resplendent across the boundless expanse.

For six days and six nights, the **Southern Palace Nángōng** stood still—**star pivots guarded their courses**, the **hour-drums fell silent**, **dragon peaks and waters** ceased their flow, **jade droplets** hung suspended, **mist-banners** drifted in the sky, and **vaporous curtains** coiled with fragrance. The **Pivot and Mechanism’s Twin Provinces**, the **Ten Officials bearing their tablets**, led their ranks in solemn order, as **divine winds** brushed lightly, the **void-sea** mirrored pure clarity, the **heavenly visage** shone vast and open, and the **qi realm** radiated boundless. Within this land, mountains, rivers, forests, and plains all flattened into equal measure—no high or low remained. The earth transformed into **soft jade**, deep indigo and lustrous, piercing through the **circular netherworld**, its hue unchanging.

The assembled **True Ones** attended at his side. **Yuan Shi Tianzūn**, seated upon the **floating void-throne of six dragons playing with pearls and ascending cloud-silk**, expounded the scripture once. The **Great Sages of All Heavens** simultaneously proclaimed its excellence.

At that time, within the **Southern Palace Nángōng**, the **Inner Supervisor** recorded the **auspicious name of Nángōng Yánshēng** for the **ten billion**—countless in number—who attained immortality.

When the scripture was expounded a second time, the **Southern Star’s crimson flower** illuminated the **azure void**, while **cloudly cords** swirled and the **wonderful balance** bent low.

A third recitation brought **jewel-tones resounding**, their **praise echoing in profound verses**.

A fourth saw the **Southern Palace’s gates open**, giving birth to **ten thousand assemblies**.

A fifth brought **Celestial Mechanism’s flowing virtue**, as the **Five Powers** flourished in harmony.

A sixth shook the **Six Stars’ radiance**, as **all deities** rejoiced in unison.

A seventh ensured **immortal ranks without end**, and **worldly life extended to the utmost**.

An eighth subdued **true demons**, sealing their fate to **prolong life for the myriad**.

A ninth brought **flowering rains a foot deep**, as **heavenly fragrance merged with clouds**.

A tenth ensured **no untimely death in the world**—all, male and female, **leaned their hearts in devotion**, receiving protection and attaining **eternal life**.

The Dao speaks: When the scripture was expounded once, the **Limitless Prolonged Life Great True God of the East’s Boundless Direction** arrived with his **countless hosts**, floating through the void.

A second recitation summoned the **Limitless Prolonged Life Great True God of the South’s Boundless Direction**, with his **countless hosts**, floating through the void.

A third brought the **West’s**, a fourth the **North’s**, a fifth the **Northeast’s**, a sixth the **Southeast’s**, a seventh the **Southwest’s**, and an eighth the **Northwest’s**—each **Limitless Prolonged Life Great True Gods** of their respective directions, with their **countless hosts**, arriving in turn.

By the tenth recitation, the **Limitless Prolonged Life Heavenly True Great Gods of the Ten Directions’ Southern Palace** all arrived together. The men and women of the land **leaned their hearts in reverence**, prepared to hear **Yuan Shi Tianzūn** proclaim the **method of Southern Palace Nángōng Yánshēng** and the **essentials of attaining Truehood**.

They spoke among themselves: *“We, though certified as Heavenly Humans dwelling in the heavens, have never heard of the **Celestial Officials** governing our ranks, their **names, stations, or residences**, nor how they **rule the Three Primordials**, determine **life and death, rewards and punishments**, or assess **merits and faults**. We only know in broad strokes that the **Southern Palace Nángōng** serves as the **Grand Sovereign of Southern Extremity’s Prolonged Life**, yet where does **Prolonged Life** truly reside? What **typical officials or chief clerks** oversee it? How should the **citizens of the Three Primordials** petition to **attain Prolonged Life** and **enjoy the Boundless**? Today, the **Heavenly Sovereign** unfurls the **array of laws**, enlightening **Heavenly Humans**. We must each **refine our minds**, take refuge in the **Great Law**, and **cultivate our certifications**—prostrating twice in homage.”*

The arrivals came like **dense mist and clouds**, their **countless hosts** causing half the land’s soil to sink unevenly—an unstoppable force. All the **great assemblies** gathered around the seat, gazing in awe at the **divine visage**.

They longed to hear the **mystic law**.

「元始俯仰四顾，揽几回天，俨紫金光容，发言宣告大众曰：夫天地定位，君臣乃立。三天上帝，设官布政，分治三元。紫微太微，为两极之司，以主生死，世人罪福，仙真功过，紫微曹局，系於北斗；太微案掾，隶於南辰。紫微天官之司，则有太玄都省，以统三官；太微大君之司，则有天枢天机二省，以延注生命，校领群灵。

南斗第五星曰天枢，第六星曰天机，枢机二省为上帝之内司，长生大帝正所御也。天有三省，以治三元，则枢机之司并属於南昌上宫，即太微宫也。三省之内，金阙侍中、上相、上宰、侍郎、倦卿司命，以共治之。

兆能长斋，奉词天机省中，恳礼长生大帝，严备供养，勤诚不替，则有九天采察考校真官，按兆功过，上闻机省，上相注笔，为兆延生，寿无纪极，不必丹芝，可俟仙道。大众欣跃，乞获详教，渴伫圣言。

於是元始悬一宝珠，大如黍米，在空玄之中，去地五丈。元始登引，天真大神、上圣高尊、妙行真人、天机内省上相真宰、灵官直符、甲卒统骑、南宫延生无量大神、十方无极至真尊神、无鞅数众，俱入宝珠之中。天人仰看，惟见拂拂从珠口中入，既入珠口，不知所在。国人廓散，地还平正，无复欹陷。

元始即於宝珠之内，说经都竟。众真监度，以授於我，当此之时，喜庆难言。法事粗悉，诸天复位，倏欻之间，寂无遗响。是时，天人遇值经法，普得济度，全其本年，无有中伤，倾土归仰，咸得延生。不杀不害，不嫉不妬，不淫不盗，不贪不欲，不憎不恚。言无华绮，口无恶声，十二善行，专则延生，南宫自闻。

天机列言，七世命仙，齐同慈爱，异骨成亲；国安民丰，欣乐太平，经始出教，一国以道。预有至心，宗奉礼敬，各得度世。道言：元始天尊说经中所言，并是上帝南宫延生内名，隐韵之音；亦是天机省中上相内讳，百灵之隐名也。斋戒诵之，直符诣天机省，乞延生之箓，太上度南宫之契，兆得延生，永世长存。

非世之常辞，上圣已成真人，通玄究微，能悉其章，谓之**Ten Transgressions** [*shíguò*], 诸天遥唱，万帝设礼。南宫延生，天机纪龄，双景照顶，泥丸返精，群魔束形，鬼疠灭爽，回尸起死，白骨成人。至学之士，诵之**Ten Transgressions** [*shíguò*]，则大君流迁，三省言功，魔精丧眼，鬼祆灭爽，济度垂死，绝而得生。

所以尔者，学士秽气未消，体未洞真，召制百神，威未制天政；**德** [*dé*]可伏御地祇，束缚魔灵，但却死而已，不能更生。轻诵此章，身则被殃；供养尊礼，门户兴隆。世世昌炽，与善因缘，万灾不干，神明护门。

斯经尊妙，独步玉京，度人无量，为万道之宗。巍巍大范，**德** [*dé*]难可胜。道言：凡诵是经**Ten Transgressions** [*shíguò*]，诸天齐到，南昌宫中，天机省宰、上相真君，请长生大帝玉篆龙文，九云之书，云章宝箓，统仙驱吏八鸾真符。

告下酆山泉曲之府，使亿曾万祖，幽魂苦爽，皆即受度，上升朱宫，格皆九年，受化更生，得为贵人。而好学至经，功满德就，皆得神仙，飞升金阙，游宴玉京也。上学之士，修诵是经，南极丹元、左灵仙府、真官直符神吏，为兆延生，皆即受度，飞升南宫。

世人受诵，则九元八极，四斗三真，十二仙官，教兆隐迁，延生长年，后皆得作**Emptiness Dissolution** [*xījiě*]/**Body Dissolution** [*shīxiě*]之道，魂神暂灭，不经地狱，即得返形，游行太空。」

This scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally liberating without end.
All celestial and human beings alike receive its blessings.
Infinite blessings bestow life and death with grace.
Treasure of the heavens, it is not passed down to mortal ages.
Only the virtuous, bearing gold and jewels with sincere devotion,
pledge to the heavens before transmitting it.
Leakage or negligence brings calamity upon nine ancestral generations,
and eternal servitude in the underworld.

Attending this scripture in the Southern Palace,
twenty-four celestial boys and girls guard with divine texts,
protecting those who receive the scripture in body.

The Dao speaks:
In the first month, with prolonged fasting,
recite this scripture—
the Southern Palace’s **延生长生大帝** (Yánshēng Chángshēng Dàdì, "Longlife Immortal Emperor of the Southern Palace")
commands **太玄九仙君** (Tàixuān Jiǔxiān Jūn, "Nine Celestial Immortals of the Great Mysterious"),

elevating them to the Southern Palace.

and **太上秀乐君** (Tàishàng Xiùlè Jūn, "Supreme Lord of Refined Joy")
to banish delusion,
secure eternal truth,
ascend as divine immortals,
and be inscribed in the Southern Palace’s registers—
yellow talismans on white tablets—
erasing death to attain rebirth.

In the tenth month, with prolonged fasting,
recite this scripture—
the **金阙侍郎** (Jīnquè Shìláng, "Attendant Minister of the Golden Gate")
of the Southern Palace’s **延生**
invokes **玉华洞灵君** (Yùhuá Dònglíng Jūn, "Lord of Jade Flower and Cavernous Spirit"),
**玉华紫灵君** (Yùhuá Zǐlíng Jūn, "Lord of Jade Flower and Purple Spirit"),
and **元丹中皇君** (Yuándān Zhōnghuáng Jūn, "Central Sovereign Lord of the Primordial Elixir")
to shield the body,
serve the august with loyalty,
extend filial piety to one’s household,
and for kings and emperors,
ministers and subjects,
fathers and sons—
stabilize the nation’s fate,
preserve the heavens’ longevity,
ensure unbroken succession,
and perpetually rule as sovereigns,
bringing eternal peace to the land.

On the eight festivals,
recite this scripture—
the **玉清三皇太帝** (Yùqīng Sānhuáng Tàidì, "Three Sovereign Emperors of Jade Purity"),
**华阳仙君** (Huáyáng Xiān Jūn, "Celestial Lord of Radiant Yang"),
**紫灵仙君** (Zǐlíng Xiān Jūn, "Celestial Lord of Purple Spirit"),
and **洞阳仙君** (Dòngyáng Xiān Jūn, "Celestial Lord of Cavernous Yang")
open the eight gates,
grant visions of true immortals,
and attain the rank of **Nine Palace True Person**.

On one’s birthdate,
recite this scripture—
the **延生长生大帝** (Yánshēng Chángshēng Dàdì, "Longlife Immortal Emperor of the Southern Palace")
commands **太极仙君** (Tàijí Xiān Jūn, "Celestial Lord of the Supreme Polarity"),
**清灵仙君** (Qīnglíng Xiān Jūn, "Celestial Lord of Pure Spirit"),
**九光仙君** (Jiǔguāng Xiān Jūn, "Celestial Lord of Nine Radiances"),
and **十华仙君** (Shíhuá Xiān Jūn, "Celestial Lord of Ten Flowers")
to extend the register of life,
pardon sins and transcend the spirit,
purify the soul and vital essence,
ensure eternal vitality,
avoid suffering,
and radiate luminous light—
with the Three Realms’ guardians,
the Five Emperors’ escorts,
and the myriad gods’ homage—
one’s name inscribed in heaven,
virtue fulfilled, power attained—
ascending to the Upper Clarity.

The Dao speaks:
On days of practice,
one must bathe in fragrant waters,
fast and enter the chamber,
facing east,
knocking the teeth thirty-two times to honor the **Thirty-two Heavens**,
mentally bowing to the **Thirty-two Transgressions**,
closing the eyes,
and meditating in stillness upon the three-colored clouds—
purple, crimson, and vermilion—
surrounding the body within and without,
where **Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Tortoise, Lion, and White Crane**
stand arrayed on either side.
The **Heavenly Mechanics of the Southern Palace** and the **Ministerial Gods**
descend before you,
illuminating the chamber with sun and moon,
a radiant halo forming at the nape,
light shining in all ten directions—
so vivid and clear.

The secret incantation:
*"Supreme Mysterious Origin,
Great Dao Lord on High.
Summon forth from my body
the thirty-two **Functional Officials**,
left and right attendants,
celestial boys bearing incense and jade,
celestial maidens transmitting words,
the Five Emperors’ direct talismans,
and the **Direct-Day Incense Officials**—
each thirty-two in number—
to open what is spoken.*

*Today is a day of auspicious joy,
prolonged fasting in the pure hall,
practicing this wondrous scripture of boundless liberation.
May what is invoked ascend directly
before the **Thirty-two Heavens’ Supreme Origin Emperor of Infinite Degrees**.*

*Complete, drawing the **qi** thirty-two times,
facing east to recite the scripture."*

The **Taiwei’s Venerable One**, the **Southern Palace’s God**. The **Celestial Mechanism’s True Sovereign**, the **Southern Palace’s Spirit**. The **Nine Departments and Ten Offices** fly reports to **Upper Purity**.

The **Boundless Mysteries** are profound, **unfathomable in depth**. They **deploy divine truths**, universally salvaging **heavenly and human beings**.

Today, they rejoice in receiving salvation, **eternally securing life-prolongation**, passing through **all heavenly passes**, requesting the **extinction of all evils**, **severing earthly roots**, transcending the **Five Sufferings**, and being **enrolled in the Great Dao**.

The **East Star records fate**, the **West Star records names**, the **North Star records death**, the **South Star records rebirth**, the **Central Star is the Grand Champion**, overseeing all spirits. The **Green Emperor protects the soul**, the **White Emperor attends the spirit**, the **Red Emperor nourishes the *qi***, the **Black Emperor harmonizes the blood**, the **Yellow Emperor is the central sovereign**—**no god surpasses them**.

The **Green Talisman True Officials** are **auspicious and numerous**; the **Red Talisman True Officials** **split mountains and uplift stones**; the **White Talisman True Officials** command **yellow and red spirits**; the **Black Talisman True Officials** **clutch thunder and iron bellies**; the **Yellow Talisman True Officials** wield **heavenly Dao’s power**. The **Five Talisman True Officials** are the **ancestors of all gods**.

With **drumming attendants leading**, they **command celestial armies**. Their **banners and drums** survey the **Southern Palace**, their **thunderous voices** resound as the **Emperor reviews their merits**. The **Southern Palace’s achievements in life** strictly **oversee the Northern Luo**. The **Divine Treasury receives commands**, sweeping away all **inauspicious omens**.

「The **Celestial Dragon** spews venom, the **Heavenly Steed** strides with four hooves.
The **Golden Essence** leads in advance, the **Flying Spirits** brandish their banners.
Hurl flames ten thousand *li*, let **jingling bells** chime through the eight cardinal directions.
Dare to interfere? They shall **repulse and block the Highest Truth**.

With **golden axes** striking ahead and **flaming swords** following in punishment,
they **slaughter and sever the demonic**, their scorching winds relentless.
Thousands upon thousands behead, ten thousands upon thousands mutilate.
No demon shall dare to trespass, no ghost to **steal vital essence**—
the **Three Palaces** and **Northern Luo** are made manifest,
their **bright inspections** piercing the **ghostly camps**.
None shall be **harbored or concealed**, the **Golden Steed** marks the path.
A boundless proclamation—**all gods hear in unison**.
The **Three Realms** and **Five Emperors** align their words to the **Highest Purity**.

The **Great Cavern** opens its records,
**this** harmonizes with **Nature**—
**vague and indistinct**, the **qi** coalesces,
the **boundaries of existence** thus expand.
**Sovereign, Father, Ministers, and People**,
each **fulfills their roles** in the **schools of virtue**.
**Congealed jade** forms the capital,
**initially transforming** into **Dragon’s Tranquility**.
The **Emperor emerges to govern**, his **left and right** uphold the **principles of order**.
The **Three Palaces** establish their foundations,
the **Three Provinces** unfold their banners,
the **Three Treasuries** oversee all commands.
They **examine the records** to maintain **defenses**—
**myriad and minute**, within the **chaos of primordial void**.

below, **void** without depth.
The **winds stir the marshes dry**, the **waters harden** into mountains.
**Void** gives birth to **primordial earth**, the **Diamond Rider** ascends to **Heaven**.

**charged with overseeing the world**—
both **above and below Heaven**,
**no hidden nor obscure**,
**no form nor shadow**,
**no limit nor end**.
**Nature** transforms into **Divine Manifestation**,
**shaping and creating** all **forms and appearances**,
the **vast and profound Great Brahman**,
**united with the Dao**.

Yet **mankind** has ears and eyes,
**yet they do not know to see or hear**—
**silent and oblivious**, in **darkness without light**.
**Red Brightness** unfurls the **scrolls**,
**movements and degrees** are thus proclaimed.
**Primordial Origin** brings **tranquility**,
**the Five Talisman Enemies** are vanquished.

**Red Scripts** with **jade characters**,
**Eight Awe** and **Dragon’s text**,
**preserve the laws** of **calamity and fate**,
**eternal across the Three Realms**.
**Talismans** transform into **immortal officials**,
**bureaucrats and ministers** align in ranks—
**qi** regains its **talismanic form**, its **image** merging with **void**.
**Brahmanic qi** pervades **Luò**,
**ten thousand patterns** unfold.
**Primordial rules** rest in **celestial lodges**,
**following the qi** to manifest.

The **Thirty-two Heavens** revolve in **void**,
**passing through the ten directions**—
**shrouded by the **Chariot of Shadows**,
**ascending to the **Purple Chamber**,
**the Supreme Mysterious** presides.
The **Great Official** stands firm,
**pivoting the cosmic axis**—
**grasping the Dipper** to establish **principles**,
**supporting the **Two Provinces**,
**commanding the **Southern Palace**,
**conforming to the **Six Harmonies**,
**cycling the **Five Constants**,
**thirty-five divisions**,
**unifying the **qi** with the **Highest Primordial****.

The **Eight Scenes** merge in **darkness**,
**qi** enters the **Deepest Mysterious**,
**Highest Sovereign** pivots the **axis**,
**Heaven’s throat and tongue**.
Below, **responding to the body**—
**the heart and eyes** as **Mysterious**.
Within **Mysterious**, the **Supreme Radiance**,
**the Southern Palace** extends **life**.
**Highest Sovereign** of **Highest Truth**—
**spreading the **Eight Scenes** in **Supreme Crimson****.
**Whistling and chanting** the **Cavern’s chapters**,
**Golden Truth** shines **profoundly**.
**Echoes resonate** in the **muddy sphere**,
**cloudy camps** dwell within.
**White pearls** link in succession,
**jade tones** **restrain the qi**—
**ears keen as bells**, **spirits** **revolve naturally**.
**Hundreds of gods** gather in **smoke**,
**Purple Void** **radiates with refinement**.
They **assist and uphold all immortals**,
**thousands harmonized**, **ten thousands unified**—
**naturally becoming truth**, within **truth** there is **divinity**.
**Great Lord of Longevity**,
**Left Lord of Azure Transformation**, **Right Divine Jade Consort**,
**Southern Dao King**—
**holding jade**, **draped in silk**,
**Primordial Unity** leads ahead,
**Life Officer** follows behind,
**Peach Tranquility** **unites in extension**,
**spitting **Eternal Youth’s** essence**—**refining and extending**.

**Clutching talismans**, **brandishing scripts**,
**preserving life**, **rooting the command**.
**Reviewing records** in the **Southern Palace**,
**invoking calculations** from the **Northern Primordial**.
**Ascending to Highest Purity**, **entering and exiting the Azure Chamber**,
within the **Eight Dark Realms**, in the **finest subtleties**—
below, **restraining the human body**,
**the axis** as **cranial void**.
**Stillness** is **void**, the **Vermilion Palace** as **axis**.
**Searching the profound**, **perceiving the minute**,
**grasping the central logic** of the **Five Qi**,
**mingling with the Hundred Gods**,
**tenfold revolutions** of **refined essence**.
**Ten thousand qi** attain **immortality**,
**the Southern Palace** extends **life**.
**Boundless degrees** for **mankind**,
**the axis opens** the **Eight Gates**,
**the Flying Heavenly Law Wheel**.

**Guilt and merit** are **prohibited and ordained**,
**past lives** and **karmic causes**—
**all receive enlightenment**.
**Dead souls** regain **bodies**,
**bodies** attain **rebirth**,
**above**, they **hear the teachings of all heavens**.
**Above all heavens**, each has **gates of life**.
Within, there are **void caverns**—
**the chapters of folk hymns**,
**the sacred verses of True Saints**.
**Language** **aligns with Highest Truth**.
**First Chapter**: The **Southern Palace** extends **life**, the **Heavenly Axis’s** **Highest Official**—
**the sound of flying void**.
**Heavenly Axis** **grasps and restrains**,
**the Imperial Palace** is **Southern**.
To **extend your life**,
**do not provoke the axis’s reins**.
**Stillness** of the **axis**,
**the Dao** **must not be forced**.
**Reins** **drive the axis**,
**illness** **follows** if not **stillness**.
**Heavenly Axis** **rides upon things**,
**summoned**, it **responds**.
**Good and evil**, **merits and demerits**,
**all relate to the **Life Officer****.
**Axis still**, **spirit moves**,
**immortals fly** to the **Southern Palace**.
**Guard the axis**, **conceal the truth**,
**stand tall** as **refined beings**.
**Operate the axis** with **Heaven**,
**Dao’s method** is **natural**.
**Operate the axis** with **heart**,
**lose vital essence**, **lose the body**.
**Heart and eyes** as the **axis**,
**mirrored by the Four Seasons**.
I **hold its treasure**,
**known by Highest Sovereign**.

**Second Chapter**: The **Southern Palace** extends **life**, the **Heavenly Axis’s** **Highest Official**—
**six stars** in the **South**,
**ascending to Vermilion Peak**.
**Flame-lit crimson heavens**, **scarlet gates** and **red courts**.
**Encompassing the axis** is **void**,
**void** has **no form**.
**Formless and motionless**, who **makes it divine**?
**Divinity** **cannot be summoned**,
only the **Emperor** is **worthy**.
**Heaven’s governance** follows **constant laws**,
**do not punish nor boast**.
If **there is form**, it **assists**—
**merely a name** for the **master**.
**Stillness without action**, the **Dao** is **public and fair**.
**Like the muddy sphere**, within **resides the Supreme Spirit**.
**Mingling with void**, the **hundred bones** **generate naturally**.
**Great Axis** **fulfills its purpose**,
**without gain nor fame**.
I **ride the flying winds**,
**below**, I **observe the myriad paths**.

**Third Chapter**: The **Song of the Great Longevity Emperor** of the **Southern Palace**—
**Lightning wheels** dance in **void**,
**I command the divine chariot** to the **Heavenly Palace**.
**Cloud banners** gleam with **radiance**,
**purple clouds** **illuminate with brilliance**.
Below, **ten thousand immortals**,
**dragon wings** **support my reins**.
**Purple mist** as **canopy**,
**heavenly robes** and **riverine sashes**.
**Music** **accompanies the Highest**,
**feasts** **host the Azure Chamber**.
**Southern Palace** **lists its decrees**,
**Dao** **fulfills the true merits**.
**Bestowing blessings**, **extending life**,
**glory** **shines upon the immortal lineage**.
**Humans** **lack private axes**,
**upright intentions** **serve as guides**.
**Thoughts and emotions** **rise like blades**,
**summoning demons**, **inviting ghosts**.
**Immortal Saints** **transcend distinction**,
**how much more** the **Great Longevity**!
**Floating** between the **Eight Scenes**,
**gazing downward** upon the **Azure Lotus Net**.
**Red Forests** **cover all heavens**,
**jade tones** **echo the Cavern’s hymns**.
**Pitying mortals** in the **dusty world**,
**in an instant**, they **follow the flowing tide**.

Burn incense, present the sacred scriptures—
the True Person comes in person.

Above the **Three Realms**, within the flying void,
the **True King’s** song resounds—
its melody harmonizes with the **Cavern’s** hymns.

Recite it **a hundred times**—
your name ascends to the **Southern Palace**.
Recite it **a thousand times**—
the **True Immortals** come to escort you.

When **ten thousand** recitations are complete,
you **ascend to the Celestial Void**,
crossing the **Three Realms**,
and attain the rank of **Immortal Sage**.

Those who hear this sacred sound—
the **True King** manifests in reverence,
commanding the **Earthly Spirits** to attend,
guarding and escorting them.
They emerge from the **Earthly Gates**,
free from the **Five Torments** and **Eight Hardships**,
the **Seven Ancestors** ascend in glory,
forever released from the **Dark Prison**,
their souls crossing the **Crimson Ridge**,
refined and reborn.

This is called **limitless salvation**,
universal deliverance without end.

There are **secret celestial texts**,
revered by all the **Heavens**.
To reveal or slight them brings **falling into Hell**,
and calamity upon the **Seven Ancestral Lords**.

The **Way** declares:
These two chapters are the **hidden songs** of the **Celestial Emperors**
and the **Southern Palace’s** **Great Longevity**—
the **pivotal mechanisms** of the **Supreme Sovereign’s** voice and vision,
serving as the **throat, tongue, eyes, and heart** of the **Dao**.
All are under the **Southern Palace’s** **Upper Court**,
the **key to the Golden Gate**.

Those who can **long fast and seal petitions**,
presenting them to the **True Spirits**,
appealing to the **Celestial Officials** and **True Rulers**,
and proclaiming their merits—
may they **prolong their years**,
enjoy **Heaven’s blessings**,
and extend their grace to future generations.

These are the words of **Great Brahman**,
not the common speech of the world.

Words without melodic grace,
songs without ornate beauty.

「Thus it is said of the profound mysteries,
difficult to seek and examine in detail.
Treasured by the Celestial Heights,
hidden within the **Playthorn Highest Palace**—
**Heavenly Highest, Divine Highest, Jade-Clear Palace**—
the **Dao** aligns with the age of governance,
responding to the **Law** to transmit it.

If any **adept** brings a heart of golden virtue and essence,
in accordance with ancient forms to pledge allegiance to the **Jade-Clear**,
then they shall be entrusted with it.

The **Dao** declares:
When the **Heavenly Dao** and **Earthly Dao** approach their end,
and the **Sun, Moon, and Five Stars** wane or wax in disorder,
the **Most Holy** and **Divine Person** rest or depart,
the **unlearned** suffer affliction and injury—
all who encounter such calamities,
**adepts of shared qi** must unite in heart to practice **fasting**,
offer **incense** at all six times,
recite the **sutra** tenfold in rotation,
and **meritorious virtue** shall descend,
dissolving all ill omens.

The **sutras** are infinite in number,
and their **universal salvation** is boundless.

The **Dao** declares:
The **unlearned**, shallow in the **Dao**,
or those whose **immortal essence** is yet incomplete,
with **fated responses** diminished,
may experience the **Great Darkness**,
and when death approaches,
**adepts of shared qi** must offer incense on their behalf,
recite the **sutra** ten times in accordance with the **Law**,
to deliver their mortal form.

The **Celestial Officials** and **Heavenly Ministers**,
shall open the **Southern Palace’s** **Great Longevity**—
**Continuation of Life**—
and record their virtuous deeds.
Their **souls and spirits** shall ascend to the **Southern Palace**,
following their **learned merits**,
and by the count of days,
they shall attain rebirth.

Without hesitation in the **wheels of rebirth**,
they shall become **Immortal**.»

The **Dao** declares:
When the **Heavenly Dao** and **Earthly Dao** reach their end,
the **star hosts** stray from their courses,
the **Sun and Moon** lose their radiance,
the **Four Seasons** lose their order,
**Yin and Yang** fall out of harmony,
and the **realm** suffers yearly disasters—
plagues and poisons spread,
the **myriad people** perish and are injured,
**masters and disciples** meet their fate—
all must practice **fasting**,
offer **incense**, and recite the **sutra**.

The **fasting** and **sutra-recitation**,
their **merits** are profound indeed.
Above, they avert **Celestial Calamities**,
and safeguard the **Sovereign Emperors**.
Below, they repel **poisons and harm**,
and deliver the **myriad people**.
Life and death rely upon them,
and their blessings are incalculable.
Thus it is said: infinite,
universal salvation for **Heavenly Beings** and **humans**.

The **Dao** declares:
All who possess this **sutra**,
can for **Heaven, Earth, the Imperial Sovereigns**, and the **myriad people**,
perform these **merits**.
On days of calamity,
they must **generate the mind** to practice **fasting** and burn **incense**,
recite the **sutra** ten times.

All shall be recorded by the **Heavenly Hosts**,
guarded by the **Ten Thousand Spirits**,
and placed in the **adepts’ register**,
thus attaining the rank of **ministers** in the **Golden Gate** of the **Saintly Emperor**.

The **Heavenly Hosts** record all human merits and faults,
without the slightest omission.

The **True King** in **Heaven** shall also recommend your **self**,
and those who attain the **Dao** shall **penetrate and clarify** these profound words.

The **hidden language** of the **Great Brahman** in the **Heavenly Hosts** is infinite in sound.

**Dao Lord** composed,
**Primordial Spirit’s** **Sacred Scriptures**—
**Southern Palace’s Great Longevity Secret Chapter**—
**Eastern Eight Heavens**.

「The **Dao** of the **Eastern Eight Heavens**:
Lo Wu holds the pivot, and its borders stretch with surging waves.
Chuo Mo rejoices in its generals, and the Six Tu stand firm beneath the Emperor’s decree.
It embraces **virtue/power** to nurture life,
and leans on the solitary grace of the **Xian**—
the sharp and noble **Lin** of the **Primordial Spirit**,
the boundless and radiant **Hong** of the **Flame**—
the horns fly in unison, the **Lu** resounds with joy and wisdom.
The **Yue** bestows upon the **Jia** of the **Tong**,
and the **Yun** bestows upon the **Chu** of the **Fu**.
The **Great Brahman’s** **Dao** descends in response,
and the **Pale** **Yin** follows its course.
The **Bite** **Doors** ascend to the **Xiang**,
and the **Ping** **Ning** overflows with sacred script.

**Dao** speaks: Within these **Heavens**, the **Great Brahman’s** **hidden language** is infinite in sound.
The ancient script was carved upon the **Southern Palace’s** **Fengtai**,
summoning the **True Person of the Southern Dipper**,
opening the **auspicious jade calendar**,
prolonging life through endless ages,
and elevating the **Seven Ancestors**.
The Emperor’s blessings descend in abundance,
the body ascends to the **Golden Room**,
and the scriptures are held by the **Red Infant**,
each character vast as a yard.
The **Great Lord of Longevity** once treasured this text,
deeming it the **orthodox sound**.

Those who know this sound,
and practice **fasting** while reciting it,
shall have the **Heavenly Hosts** dispatch the **True Spirit Kings** to descend and observe their **self**.
Their merits shall be recorded with diligence,
and presented to the **Heavenly Hosts** above.
The **Ten Thousand Spirits** shall pay homage,
the **Earthly Deities** shall guard the gates,
and the **True King of Great Function** shall recommend them to **Nanchang**,
thus attaining the **Dao** in full.
They shall wander the **Three Realms**,
ascend to the **Divine Tower**.

This sound banishes all that it encounters,
cleanses all impurities,
elevates all beings,
and fulfills all aspirations—
the **natural sound** of the **Heavenly True**.
Thus, when recited, it summons the **Spirit Kings** to descend and observe,
the **Supreme Sage** to sing from afar,
the **Ten Thousand Spirits** to pay homage,
the **Three Realms** to guard the **Xuan**,
and the **hosts of spirits** to bow in submission.
The **ghostly essences** shall perish of their own accord.

The **Lingbao** resounds with splendor,
the **Ten Directions** grow serene,
the **rivers and seas** fall silent,
and the **mountains and valleys** swallow the mist.
All **sentient beings** tremble in awe,
summoning the **cluster of immortals**,
while **Heaven** remains free of **Yin** **impurities**,
and **Earth** free of **spirit-dust**.
The **Dark Wisdom** penetrates with clarity—
a **mystic abundance** of the **Primordial Spirit**.

*End of the Thirty-Ninth Volume of the **Lingbao Scripture of Infinite Virtue/Power for Elevating Beings***
*Begin the Fortieth Volume.*

**Chapter on the Northern Capital’s Removal of Calamities**

The Dao speaks thus: In days of old, within the Purple Primordial Heaven, the **Elemental Lord of Great Mysterious Light** drifted upon flowing clouds, receiving from **Primordial Origin** the **Supreme Scripture for Removing Calamities from the Northern Capital**. When **Primordial Origin, Lord of the Highest**, was to proclaim this scripture, He circled ten times, summoning the **Ten Directions**, before taking His seat.

Then descended:
- **Heaven-True Great God**, **Supreme Sage of High Veneration**, **True Person of Marvelous Conduct**,
- **Great Emperor of the Northern Capital**,
- **Assemblies of the Luo and Tang Spirits**,
- **Star Lords of the Seven Mansions of the Northern Dipper, Bull, Girl, Empty, Danger, and Wall**,
- **Marshal of the Northern Dipper**, **Inspector of the Northern Capital**, **Officials and Attendants of the Bureau**,
- **Flying Cavalry of the Northern Capital**, **Great God of the Standing Dipper**, **Black Armored Guards of the North**, **Five Qi Chiefs of the Bureau**, **Great God of the Boundless Cold**,
- **Nine Malevolent Spirits of the Northern Capital**, **Captors of the Five Heavenly Marshals**, **God-Kings Who Remove Calamities**, and the **Hosts of the Unrestrained**—all riding the void.

Their **Purple-Hued and Azure-Canopied Chariots**, drawn by **Clouds of Carved-Jade Mountains**, cast **Emerald Shades** and **Jade-Lustered Radiance**, their **Sea-Hued Aura** dense and luminous, piercing the **Great Void**. For seven days and seven nights, the **celestial wheels of the heavens** ceased their turning, the **celestial coordinates** halted, the **Dragon Mountains** stilled their drums, the **Jade Gnomon** moved no more, the **Divine Winds** fell silent, and the **Mountain Clouds** dispersed their shadows. **Heaven’s Virtue** shone pure, **Earth’s Foundation** settled in clarity—within the realm, all **mountains, rivers, forests, and fields** leveled as one, their soil transformed into **spotted jade**, without variation.

The **Assemblies of the Perfected** took their places. **Primordial Origin, Lord of the Highest**, sat aloft in **Void-Floating Purity**, His **Six Radiant Orbs** illuminating the **Nine Palaces of Mixed Qi**, upon the **Jade Mountains and Treasure Forests**.

When the scripture was recited once, the **Great Saints of the Heavens** proclaimed its excellence in unison. At that moment, all men and women of the land, through the **Power of the Dao**, found their hearts suddenly illuminated with clarity.

In past lives, the people had accumulated **karmic debts**, their **retributive sufferings** unceasing, binding them to **Luo and Tang**. Had they not heard this scripture, their calamities could not have been removed.

When the scripture was recited twice, they beheld **Primordial Origin**, His body radiant with **Wisdom-Light**, illuminating the **Ten Directions** like the rising sun. The **Three Officials of the Northern Capital**, the **Upper and Lower Six Abysses**, the **Nine Profound Realms without Interval**, all **grievances and enmities** dissolved, and the **Five Sufferings** ceased their torment.

When the scripture was recited thrice, its **Law-Sound** pure and wondrous, it was heard throughout the **Ten Directions**, and all **heavenly and human beings** attained **flawless enlightenment**.

When the scripture was recited four times, all **common beings** abandoned **venomous hatred**, their **shadowy plots of harm** transformed into **Dharma companions**.

When the scripture was recited five times, the **sufferings of calamities**, the **three great disasters**, and **lingering illnesses** were instantly liberated, and all rejoiced in rebirth.

When the scripture was recited six times, the **true disciples of the land** stilled the **Supreme Void**, their **right-mindedness** penetrating the **Divine Court**.

When the scripture was recited seven times, the **land endured eternal peace**, **venerating the Dao and cherishing life**, free of **private desires**, and none perished by **arrows or wounds**.

When the scripture was recited eight times, the **heavens rejoiced**, the **Northern Capital’s calamities removed**, and all moved in **harmony and sincerity**, attaining the **True Principle**.

When the scripture was recited nine times, **heavenly rainbows descended**, and **earth bore divine fungi**.

When the scripture was recited ten times, the **Great Emperor** appeared in person, arriving to **attest to the Law**, and **heavenly and human beings** praised in unison, their voices echoing through the **Nine Purity Realms**. At that moment, all men and women of the land, without exception, **turned their hearts in devotion**, receiving **protection and deliverance**, all attaining **longevity**.

The Dao speaks thus: When **Primordial Origin, Lord of the Highest**, recited the scripture once, the **Great God of the Northern Capital Who Removes Calamities—Limitless and Boundless of the Eastern Quarter**, with his **Unrestrained Hosts**, floated through the void. When recited twice, the **Southern Quarter’s Great God** arrived. When recited thrice, the **Western Quarter’s Great God** came. When recited four times, the **Northern Quarter’s Great God** descended. When recited five times, the **Northeast’s Great God** appeared. When recited six times, the **Southeast’s Great God** arrived. When recited seven times, the **Southwest’s Great God** came. When recited eight times, the **Northwest’s Great God** descended. When recited nine times, the **Upper Quarter’s Great God** appeared. When recited ten times, the **Lower Quarter’s Great God** arrived.

After ten recitations, the **Great Gods Who Remove Calamities from the Ten Directions** gathered at once. All men and women of the land, **turning their hearts in reverence**, united in **non-action**, finally understanding that **one mind** had forged these **many karmic deeds**.

The **foolish and ignorant**, acting without wisdom, **transgressed loyalty and filiality**, harbored **shadowy treacheries**, were **greedy, ruthless, and obstinate**, **licentious and murderous**, **jealous and destructive of the virtuous**, **violating the forbidden Mysterious Statutes**. Their **souls returned to the Northern Capital**, their **bodies abandoned by the Three Officials**, enduring **sufferings for countless kalpas**, without respite.

Even upon rebirth, **disasters and illnesses** clung to them, none escaping **a single virtue**, unaware of their **accumulated sins**—thus they endured these calamities. If they did not **chant the True Scriptures**, **pray to the Northern Capital**, or **offer thanks to the Seven Mansions**, their calamities could not be removed.

Now, those who hear the **Manifest Law of the Northern Capital’s Removal of Calamities by Primordial Origin**—when they arrive, they come like **fine rain and dense mist**, their **Unrestrained Hosts** causing half the land to sink unevenly, beyond restraint.

Thus, **Primordial Origin** proclaimed to the **Ten Directions of Heaven and Man**: *"Within the Northern Capital’s Luo and Tang lie the **Great Emperor**, the **Six Abyssal Mountain-Cities**, the **Twelve Minor Abysses**, the **Three Officials and Nine Ministries**, the **One Hundred and Twenty Bureaus**, the **Sixteen Prisons**, the **Twenty-Four Prisons**, the **Thirty-Six Prisons**, the **Eighty-One Prisons**, and the **One Hundred and Twenty Prisons."*

Thus, the Great Abyss of the Northern Capital, the Cold Pool, lies far in the Lower Realm’s Eastern North, within the Great Sea. There is the Luo-Tang Mountain-City, named the Northern Capital, governed by the Heavenly Venerable, the Dark True Ghost Emperor—thus it is called Zhengdu.

"Luo" is the name of the city, "Tang" of the mountain, and "Du" signifies its gathering place. Though distant from this Heavenly Domain when viewed from afar, the mountain’s height spans thirty-six million *li*, and its roots sink into the waters another thirty-six million *li*. Its palaces, towers, and gates rival those of the Celestial Realms. Within its bounds, the interrogation of guilty souls never ceases, day or night, their lamentations echoing through the heavens and earth.

This great mountain reaches up to the **Seven Mansions of the Big Dipper and Bull**, each mansion’s **qi** descending into the city below. It is thus under the dominion of the **Yin Spirit of the Northern Dipper**.

Within the Northern Capital resides the Great Emperor, the **Venerable Heavenly Lord Black Emperor**, whose divine form stretches a thousand *chi* in length. He wears the **Primordial Dragon’s Garment**, a round crown and square footwear, riding upon the **Nine Dragons’ Boundless Chariot**. His ministers and attendants number countless billions of ghostly deities.

Yet these ghostly deities are truly no different from mortals—they too are born from the womb, their bodies naturally endowed with **ling** and capable of **bianhua** transformation. Like dragons, serpents, and venomous beasts, they emerge from the egg or the womb, their forms varying in size, their divine transformations beyond measure. The ghostly deities of the Northern Capital are all such.

Their countless multitudes return to the human realm, mingling in marriage, officialdom, commerce, and livelihood—identical in every way to mortals. All are secretly dispatched by the Great Emperor to observe living beings.

When beings fail to restrain their hearts and natures, indulging in unrestrained wickedness—disloyal, unfilial, unrighteous, and lacking in benevolence—their transgressions are meticulously recorded and reported to the Northern Capital. The **Ghostly Kings of the Northern Capital** then tally them by the day and present the records to the Great Emperor. Upon imperial decree, the lives of mortals are thwarted, leading to untimely calamities, all manner of misfortune, and premature deaths—each a self-invited fate. Even after ten thousand deaths and rebirths, escape is impossible.

Out of compassion, I universally rescue and protect, commanding the Northern Capital to remove calamities and extinguish disasters. For the Northern Capital holds many great deities: when all beings submit petitions and supplications, perform solemn rites and erect altars, recite the **True Scripture** openly, and swear to heaven in repentance, their calamities and disasters are instantly dispelled, and their longevity secured.

These great deities are:
The **Ghostly King of the Northern Capital**,
The **Ghostly Marshal of the Northern Capital**,
The **Left Commander of the Yin Dipper**, who oversees birth, named **Ge**,
The **Right Commander of the Yin Dipper**, who oversees death, named **Kai**,
The **Left Commander of the Northern Capital**, who records sins of life and death, named **Guan Sheng**,
The **Right Commander of the Northern Capital**, who presides over all punishments, named **Qi Cheng**,
The **Left Inspector of the Northern Capital**, who examines virtues and transgressions, named **Min**,
The **Right Non-Conformist of the Northern Capital**, who governs the penal archives, named **Guan**.

All the above great deities are the ones who inflict calamities and disasters. Yet they can also remove them. If one submits petitions and prayers with sincerity, even the heaviest burden of calamities will be instantly lifted and released—take it upon yourself to receive this blessing.

All assembled prostrate themselves upon the earth, bow twice, and kneel in reverence, solemnly vowing to uphold this practice. When **Primordial Origin** finished expounding the **Scripture**, the **Crowd of True Ones** supervised and bestowed it upon me. At that moment, my joy and celebration were indescribable.

The essential rites of this **Dao** are now roughly known: the **Ten Directions of Heaven and Man** resumed their positions, and in a flash, all traces of sound vanished. At that time, those who encountered this **Scripture** were universally saved and delivered, their lives preserved for the year, free from any disaster. All under the heavens turned to reverence, their hearts filled with goodness.

They refrained from killing or harming, from witchcraft or jealousy, from lust or theft, from greed or desire, from hatred or **yuan** (resentment). Their words were plain and unadorned, their mouths free from evil speech. They aligned in compassion, transcending differences, and sought harmony as kin. The realm became secure, the people prosperous, rejoicing in eternal peace. The **Scripture of the Dao** emerged, and the entire land followed the **Way**.

Those who approached it with utmost sincerity, revering and worshipping it, were all delivered from the world. The **Dao** proclaims: The names spoken by the Heavenly Venerable **Primordial Origin** within this **Scripture** are all the hidden titles of the Great Emperor within the Northern Capital, their sounds veiled in **yin** (resonance). They are also the internal taboos of the Northern King, the concealed names of the hundred deities—uncommon words of the mortal world.

The **Supreme Sage**, having already attained the **True Person**, delved into the **Primordial Mysteries** and comprehended their depths. Knowing all their chapters, if one recites them ten times, the **Ten Directions of Heaven** will echo in response, the ten thousand emperors will set forth their rites, the **Yin Spirit** will release its grip, and the calamities of suffering will be dispelled. Blessings will naturally manifest, auspicious signs will shine forth, all demons will be subdued, and the **Ghostly Essence** will vanish. Corpses will revive, white bones will reform as flesh, and the dead will return to life.

Scholars of the highest learning, reciting it ten times, will cause the **Northern True One** to tremble in awe, the **Yin Officials** to kneel in reverence, the **Demonic Essence** to lose its sight, and the **Ghostly Calamities** to be severed at their source. They will rescue those near death, who will then live on. This is why: such scholars have yet to purge their **impure qi**, their bodies not yet perfected in **True Essence**. Though they can command the **Ten Directions**, their might does not yet reach the **Heavenly Governance**. Their **virtue/power** can subdue the **Earthly Deities** and bind the **Demonic Spirits**, but only to remove calamities—not to revive the dead.

A lighthearted recitation of this chapter will bring calamities upon oneself. Yet if one honors and venerates it, one’s household will flourish, one’s lineage will prosper eternally, and one will be free from all misfortunes. The **Divine Ones** will protect the gate.

This **Scripture** is supremely noble and wondrous, unmatched in the **Jade Capital**. It delivers countless beings and stands as the **宗** (foundational) of all **Dao**. Its vast and lofty influence is beyond measure, its **virtue/power** insurmountable.

The **Dao** proclaims: For those who recite this **Scripture** ten times, the **Northern Lord** will arrive in full. Countless tens of millions of ancestors will gather, tormented spirits will find relief, and the records of calamities will be severed. All will immediately receive deliverance, ascending to the **Red Palace** and attaining nine years of **hua** (transformation). They will then be reborn as noble beings.

Those who study this **Scripture** with devotion, their calamities lifted and deliverance secured, will ascend to the **Southern Palace**. Mortals who recite it will sever all malevolent influences, and the gates of death will be closed. The Northern Capital will remove calamities, and the **Eastern Hua** (Heavenly Records) will register their names. Thus, their lifespan will be extended, and in the end, they will all attain the **Way of Emptiness Dissolution**—where the **soul-spirit** temporarily vanishes, avoiding the **Earthly Prisons**, and immediately returns to their original form, wandering freely through the **Great Void**.

This **Scripture** is subtle and profound, universally delivering the boundless.
All celestial and mortal beings rejoice in receiving its blessings.
Infinite merits are bestowed upon life and death alike.
Treasured by Heaven, it is not passed down to the mortal world.
Only the virtuous, bearing gold and treasures with sincere devotion,
pledge to Heaven and transmit it.

Leaking or neglecting it brings calamity upon nine generations,
and eternal suffering in the Northern Mountains.

When guarding this **Scripture**, the Five Emperors attend with twenty-four
jade boys and jade girls, their divine retinues protecting the practitioner’s body.

**The Dao speaks:**
In the first month, observe long fasts and recite this **Scripture**—
the Northern Capital removes calamities, and transmission brings swift peace.
For the departed of past ages, it severs earthly imprisonment and rebirth,
ascending to the Southern Palace.

In the seventh month, observe long fasts and recite this **Scripture**—
the Northern Capital removes calamities, and seven generations ascend.
The practitioner attains immortality, their names recorded by the celestial courts,
with yellow talismans and white tablets, erasing death for rebirth.

In the tenth month, observe long fasts and recite this **Scripture**—
the Northern Capital removes calamities, and lifespan flourishes.
As kings and sovereigns, they stabilize their realm,
ensuring eternal rule for their descendants,
forever governing in peace, their lands prosperous.

On the eight festivals, recite this **Scripture**—
the Northern Capital removes calamities, and all beings receive blessings,
becoming True Persons of the Nine Palaces.

On one’s birthdate, recite this **Scripture**—
the Northern Capital removes calamities, erasing fate and death.
The **soul-spirit** clarifies, **qi** endures eternally,
free from suffering, the body radiant.
The Three Realms guard in attendance, the Northern Emperor welcomes,
all spirits pay homage, their names inscribed to Heaven.
With virtue complete and power fulfilled, they ascend to the Upper Purity.

**The Dao speaks:**
On days of practice, bathe in fragrant waters, fast in purity,
enter the chamber facing east, and strike the teeth thirty-two times,
hearing the thirty-two heavens above.
Bow in the heart thirty-two times, close the eyes,
and meditate upon the seated self amid the three-colored clouds—
azure, yellow, and dark.
Within and without, the void expands:
a **Qinglong** (Azure Dragon), **Baihu** (White Tiger), **Zhuque** (Vermilion Bird),
**Xuanwu** (Dark Tortoise), lions, and white cranes arrayed on either side.
The great gods of the Northern Capital stand solemn before the table,
descending to manifest before you.
Sun and moon illuminate the chamber, its brilliance piercing all directions,
a luminous halo forming at the neck, light radiating ten thousand ways—
thus, clearly revealed.

**Secret Incantation:**
*"Supreme Primordial, the Most High Dao Lord.
Summon forth from my body the thirty-two **Gongcao** (Divine Officials),
left and right ministers, jade boys bearing incense,
jade girls transmitting words, the Five Emperors,

*The dark bronze prison, the sea’s foundation, mountain roots,
the Ghostly Ancestor of the Great Primordial,
whose bones and flesh form his body.
Through Dao transformation, dragons coil, winds race,
plundering mortal laws, exhaustively probing karmic causes.
Sowing misfortune endlessly, eternally trapped in the Wheel.*

*The Dao possesses the Jade Texts, opening merciful scriptures.
Without scriptures, there is no light,
no clarity, no establishment, no completion.
Without scriptures, there is no deliverance, no rebirth—
this is the Great **Dharma**, Heaven within Heaven.*

*Yanluo’s Northern Terrace, Black Mountain’s Mystic Capital,
the Supreme Highest, the Vast and Pure.
Vast and boundless, as if nonexistent, as if existing,

demonic caves and ghostly encampments, fire mountains and cold pools.

the Black Emperor Spirit Lord of the Northern Pole,
the Great God Marshal of the Nine-Heaven Capital Prohibitions,

The Celestial Procession ascends upon Azure Chimeras and colossal beasts,
with flying canopies and galloping wheels, yoked to Qí-Long and the Black-Horned Divine Tiger.
They bear the Summoning Spirits’ banners, radiant with the Divine Pennants’ glory—
before them, the Nine Songs resound in unison, behind them, the Eight Tones harmonize in chorus.
Purple Whales and Dark Feathers chant in melodious wails,
while the Five Elders clear the path and the Host of Immortals wings the chariot’s axle.
Ten thousand chariots, a hundred thousand steeds—
they float through the void, their radiance turning back,
to remove calamities and deliver the living.

The Northern Capital Chancellor, the Six Palaces of Fúchéng,
the Grand Registrar of All Affairs, the Great God of Calamity Removal—
holding the talismanic tablets and registers,
they all present themselves before the Sovereign,
strictly examining the Six Heavens as decreed.

They proclaim to the Three Realms, the Boundless Divine Domain,
the Spirit Valley’s Bureau, the Northern Capital’s Underworld,
the Three Officials and Nine Ministries, the Twelve River Sources—
to absolve ancestral spirits, the countless eons’ kin,
to sever the lineage of calamity and misfortune,
to erase the register of sins and extinguish the roots of evil.
No binding, no forcing into ghostly throngs.
By the Primordial Talismans and Mandates, ascension at the appointed hour.

The Northern Capital’s Cold Pool guards form and spirit,
subdues demons and elevates the worthy,
transcends the Southern Palace’s ranks.
The dead souls undergo refinement, transformed into immortals;
the living bodies receive deliverance, eternal across eons.
With the eons’ wheel turning, they align with Heaven’s years—
eternally delivering from the Three Abysses, the Five Torments, and Eight Hardships,
transcending the Three Realms, unbound in Upper Clarity.

The Heaven of the Nine Clarities’ Radiant Dao Transformation, ruled by Emperor Yè Yáng Yún Guāng.

**The Thirty-Two Heavens, the Thirty-Two Sovereigns.**
The Heavens’ concealed names, the Heavens’ veiled titles.
The Central Void’s emptiness, the Natural Divine Script—
the Northern Capital’s hidden resonance, the Dharma’s transformed sound.

The Northern Capital’s Venerable One, the God of Calamity Removal,
the Northern Capital’s True Demon, the Spirit of Removal.
The Nine Saints and Ten True Ones transform in Upper Clarity.
The Boundless Mysteries, profound beyond measure—
the Divine and True unfold, universally delivering gods and mortals.

Today, rejoicing in receiving deliverance,
the Northern Capital’s Calamity Removal traverses the Heavens’ passes,
petitioning the annihilation of the Three Abysses,
severing the earthly roots, flying across the Five Qi,
transcending to the Northern Divine Capital—
the calamity’s lineage is erased, swept away without remainder,
the corpse refined into an immortal, named in the Great Mystic’s register,
the True King overseeing elevation, unbound by Heaven’s gates.

The Eastern Dipper’s Heavenly Azure, the Western Dipper’s Prison,
the Northern Dipper’s Imperial Chariot, the Southern Dipper’s Celestial Scheme,
the Central Dipper’s Yellow Pavilion—
the Five Dippers descending gods, the Ox and Girl’s constellation aligned,
the talisman beneath the Northern Capital grants calamity removal and bestows blessings.

The Azure Sovereign prolongs life, the White Sovereign slays the spirits,
the Vermilion Sovereign burns the heretics, the Black Sovereign, the Northern Lord—
establishing the capital at Luo Mountain, erecting the gate at Fúchéng’s city.
Ten billion subjects present offerings to the Imperial Court,
bearing the world’s sins and extinguishing the clinging calamities.

The Six Heavenly Envoys patrol the dark and bright.
The Yellow Sovereign, the Central Lord, protects the realm and secures the people.
Ten thousand gods assemble in homage, the Primordial’s manifested body.

The Azure Heavenly King shines over the Embalmed Lord,
the Vermilion Heavenly King brandishes the Arrow and Stone,
the White Heavenly King beheads ghosts and shatters mountains,
the Black Heavenly King glares with thunderous eyes.
The Yellow Heavenly King overturns the seas with mighty force.
The Five Sovereign Demons, the ancestors of ten thousand gods—
overseeing the Northern Capital, flying with drumming retinues,
commanding ghostly armies, their banners and drums resounding.
They survey the boundless void, their nine flags blazing.
The Six Heavens unite in function, removing calamities and delivering beings,
strictly governing the Northern Underworld.

The Divine Kings receive their mandates, sweeping away all inauspiciousness—
Luo Heaven vomits its poison, the Heavenly Wolf’s jaws yawn wide.
Fire Officers lead the charge, the Capital Marshals brandish their banners,
poisonous dragons stretch a hundred zhang, divine tigers charge eightfold.
Dare any obstruct? They defy the Celestial Worthies—
the Golden Axe strikes first, the Great Heaven’s punishment follows.
They slaughter and dismember the ghostly host, the winds and fires relentless.
Thousands upon thousands beheaded, ten thousands upon ten thousands dismembered.
Demons dare not interfere, ghosts dare not scheme.

The Three Officials of the Northern Underworld inspect the ghostly encampments,
tolerating no concealment—
the Golden Horse Relay presents the evidence.
They proclaim to the boundless, all gods heed their words.
The Three Realms’ Five Sovereigns speak to Upper Clarity.

The Original Darkness yet unilluminated, the void boundless and extreme.
The Void gives birth to *qi*—wind and fire become stone.
Eight *Ā* and Nine *Zhōu*, neither knowing nor recognizing.
Sudden transformation into the Azure Dragon, its body a hundred *yì* long.
Coiling around the Five Pillars, from Dragon to Kang.
Infinite upon infinite *kalpas*, within the chaos.

Above the Sea of Heaven is formless, below the Sea of Heaven is bottomless,
The Central Sea holds wind and mist, the Hollow Embraces the Sky.
Gold and stone are firm and unyielding.
Gradually forming the Jade Circle.
The Six *Qi* move of themselves, the Five *Phases* complete the heavens.
Heaven above and heaven below—
No hidden depths, no shadowy realms,
No shape, no trace.
Boundless and endless, the *Mínghuáng* and the *Tàixuán*,
Vast and dark, without light.
The Primordial Sage, *Yuánshǐ*, emerges.
Then it transforms into the Northern Sovereign.
Beating iron into mountains, smelting gold into halls,
Carving jade into towers, the Nine *Qi* radiant and bright.
Then it is named the Black Sovereign, the *Tàixuán Yuánwáng*,
Ruling over the dead souls, severing fate and dispelling calamities.
Ten thousand ghosts and demons, their ranks subdued, pacifying the ten directions.
Also, it reveals the *Kāitú*, its decrees unfolding naturally.
*Yuánshǐ* maintains the peace;
The Five *Lù* enemies are defeated:
The Red Book of Jade Characters, the Eightfold Dragon Script.
Preserving the *Lù* against the *Yùn*, ensuring Heaven’s eternal endurance.

「The *Fànqì* permeates the void,
Ten thousand *fàn* unfold in splendor.
The Primordial Principles flow and manifest,
Thirty-two heavens in grand array.

Revolving through five hues, encircling the ten directions,
Turning the *Lùdǒu* in its course, circling the Five *Cháng*.
Thirty-five divisions, the *Zǒngqì* ascending to the Upper Primordial,
Eight *Jǐng* merging in darkness, the *qi* entering the *Xuán xuán*.

Within the *Xuán*, the Northern Sovereign.
The Highest Daoist Lord, *Shàngdì Gāozhēn*,
Floating in the *Tàicóng* radiance, the North Capital dispels calamities.

Calamities are the seeds of sins,
Through countless *jié* they never perish.
How shall the *Yīn* be dispelled?

With *zhì* sung in profound chapters,
The *Jīnzhēn Làngyù* resplendent.
Lightning and fire surge in conflagration,
Echoes ripple through clouded camps, black banners for ten thousand armies.

The *Yùyīn* captures the *qi*,
Disasters swiftly selected.
The *Língfēng* gathers smoke,
The North Capital’s decrees proclaimed.

The *Zǐxū* opens in splendor,
Assisting myriad *xiān* immortals.
The *zhènzhào* unified in one body,
The *nìhuán* governing a hundred *guān*.
Severing and extinguishing malevolent calamities,
The *Língfù*’s *qi* proclaimed, all spirits gathered in accord.
Jade nectar in golden goblets,
Ten thousand harmonies, a million unifications—
Naturally attaining the True.

Within the True, there is Spirit,
The Lord of Eternal Life, *Chángshēng Dìjūn*.
The Great Green Emperor, *Qīnghuá Dàdì*,
The Nine *Lúo* gods in flight.
The *Tàiyī* oversees fate,
The *Táokāng* unites to prolong life.
Holding the talismans and scriptures,
Preserving life’s roots, ascending to the Upper Primordial.
Entering and exiting the *Huáfáng*,
Within the Eight *Míng*’s depths,
In the finest subtleties, descending to govern the mortal frame.
The *Nìhuán* and *Fēnggōng* palaces,
The Five *Qì* harmonized within,
The myriad spirits gathered, tenfold revolutions restoring souls,
All *qi* aligned with immortals.

The Dao of immortality esteems life,
Granting boundless degrees to all.
Opening the Eight Gates,
Ascending with the *Fēitiān Qǐelún*.
Prohibiting sin and fortune,
Hosting past lives and karmic ties.
All receive universal salvation,
Dead souls reborn in bodies.
Bodies attain rebirth,
Ascending to hear the *zhūtian*.
Above the *zhūtian*, each has its own Gate of Life.
Within, there are verses of empty voids and ethereal songs,
The True King’s sacred scriptures,
Words that match the Highest Dao.
The First Chapter of North Capital Dispelling Calamities—
The celestial sound of ascending to the void.
Four steeds lift the reins,
The elixir follows my wheels.
Clouds fly like banners,
Conquering this demonic host.
The North Capital resounds,
Its records myriad and vast.
The foolish are bound by deeds,
The world nurtures evil roots.
Calamities arise from these roots—
Why not repent?

The Dao is boundless and true,
Surrender your heart before the Lord.
With Eight *Wēi* talismans at your side,
Golden thresholds and jade inscriptions.
Twelve great gods manifest their signs,
The North Capital’s calamity-dispelling sovereign.
Mounting the *Fèngxuān* chariot,
My path traverses the void,
Golden carriage and jade yoke.
Gazing down upon the Nine Regions,
Descending like into the abyss.
The marvel of the Great Dao—
Only the worthy may pass it on.

Hearing this void-ascending sound,
The Seven Ancestors rise to the heavens.
The Second Chapter of North Capital Dispelling Calamities—
The Lord of Life’s command.
The *Tōngchén Dàguān*, scarlet robes with dragon patterns,
Only I hold the Highest *hù*.
The Lord of Life’s decree,
The divine seal’s radiance.
Descending to the North Capital,
Shielding the *yīnkuí* with righteousness.
Rigorous preparations for the myriad spirits,
The scribe stands beside.
For all mortals, life and death are the greatest calamities.
The dragon prays to the North Sovereign,
Purifying the altar with incantations.
The sacred talismans command,
Storing the *Língguāng* within.
Calamities dispelled, fortune born—
Longevity and blessings flourish alike.
Forever free from the Eight *Nàn* and decline,
Ascending to the *Zǐyúnfáng*.
Saving the world as the True Person,
The *fànchàng* flows without end.

The Third Chapter of North Capital Dispelling Calamities—
The Song of the Northern Lord:
Thirty-six million *lǐ*,
The North Capital’s *Luó Lìngshān*.
Above, the *Yègāng* gate gleams,
Below, the Nine *Fǔ* officials arrayed.
Yin and Yang nurture life and death,
Calamities and fate halted between.
The world’s foolish do not ponder the Dao,
Their passions chase and cling.
A hundred years in mortal form,
Once gone, never to return.
Hell is born from your own heart,
The True Realm lies at the edge of a *fāngcùn*.

Why not thank the North Capital,
Silently bow before the *Zǐhuáng*’s court?
First, abandon your passions,
Heaven’s mercy knows no difficulty.
One body may attain the Dao,
The Seven Ancestors transcend the *Míngquán*.
Calamities forever severed,
Fortune comes like rolling spheres.
I lament the path of life and death,
A million *jié* trapped in the abyssal gates.
Carving resolve in the *Shénxiāo*,
Gazing upward at the golden visage in the clouds.

This, above the Three Realms,
Within the void-ascending.
The True and the Magical Song’s sound,
Its words match the *Dòngzhāng*.
Reciting it a hundred times,
The *Nán Gōng*’s name reaches a thousand repetitions.
The True and Magical welcome and protect,
Ten thousand calamities dispelled—
Ascending to the void,
Crossing the Three Realms,
Ascending to the *Xiāngōng*.
Hearing the sacred sound,
The True and Magical respect its form,
The decree commands the *Dìzhǐ*.
Guards attend and escort,
Drawn forth from the earthly gates.
The Five *Kǔ* and Eight *Nàn*,
The Seven Ancestors’ ascension,
Forever freed from calamities,
Souls crossing the *Zhūlíng*,
Refined and reborn anew.

This is called boundless,
Universal salvation without end.
There are hidden celestial texts,
Praying to Heaven for shared reverence.
Revealing arrogance leads to hell,
Disaster befalls the Seven Ancestors.
The Dao speaks:
These two chapters are the words of the *Zhūtian Shàngdì*,
And the North Capital’s *Zhēnyuán* hidden sounds,
Blessing the people, dispelling calamities.
Those who earnestly pray and sever fate’s transmission,
No harm shall arise,
The True Spirit’s grace descends,
One body attains the Dao,
The Seven Ancestors ascend to the True—
All are the Great *Fàn*’s words,
Not the common speech of mortals.

No rhyme nor ornate melody,
No embellished tune.
Thus called profound and mysterious,
Hard to trace and examine.
Treasure of the heavens,
Hidden in the *Gāoshàng Shénxiāo Yùqīng Yùfǔ*,
The Dao Lord descending as a saint,
Transmitting the law as decreed.

If a perfected sage brings a golden treasure to the heart,
Dependent on the ancient rites to pledge allegiance to the Dao Lord,
Then it shall be granted.

The Dao speaks:
When Heaven and Earth’s revolutions falter or end,
The sun, moon, and Five Stars wane or wax,
The most sacred gods and spirits rest or decline,
The shallow scholars suffer harm.
All who face these calamities,
With shared *qi*, must unite in heart to practice fasting,
Offering incense at six times,
Reciting the *sūtra* tenfold revolutions,
Fortune and virtue descending,
Dispelling all ill omens.
The boundless texts,
Universal salvation without end.

The Dao speaks:
The shallow scholars, their Dao still weak,
Perhaps their merit is insufficient,
Their fate destined for extinction,
Their bodies passing through the *Tàiyīn*.
At the time of their departure,
Let fellow scholars and perfected sages offer incense for them,
Recite the *sūtra* ten times,
To guide their mortal forms as per the law.»

Then the **Northern Capital Great Emperor ( Běidū Dàdì )**, the **Playful Lord of Heavenly Darkness ( Xuánzī Tiānjūn )**, oversee the slaughter of demons, sternly command the **Netherworld Officials ( Yōufāng )**, as the **Supreme Unity ( Tàiyī )** returns to life and the **Lord of Destiny ( Sīmìng )** bestows prosperity, ensuring this mortal form and spirit remain unharmed and radiant. The **soul and spirit ( Húnshén )** ascend directly to the **Southern Palace ( Nángōng )**, and according to their **learning and merit ( xué gōng )**, they are granted a new birth on the appointed day.

Through the **cycles of rebirth without obstruction ( Lúnzhuǎn bùhuò )**, they attain **immortality ( Shénxiān )**.

The **Dao speaks**:
When Heaven and Earth’s revolutions reach their end,
The **constellations ( Xīngxiù )** stray from their courses,
The sun and moon grow dim and obscured,
The Four Seasons lose their order,
**Yin and Yang** fall out of harmony,
And calamities plague the realm,
Pestilence and poison spread,
The countless people perish and are wounded,
And **teachers and friends** die in their passage,
Then too one must practice fasting,
Offer incense and recite the **sūtra**.

For fasting and recitation of the **sūtra** bear **great virtue/power ( gōngdé )**,
Above, they dispel **celestial calamities ( Tiānzāi )** and safeguard the **Emperors ( Dìwáng )**,
Below, they avert **poisonous harm ( Dúhài )** and deliver the **countless people ( Zhàomín )**.
Life and death depend upon them,
And their blessings are boundless.
Thus it is said: **without measure ( Wúliáng )**, universal salvation for **Heavenly Beings and mortals ( Tiānrén )**.

The **Dao speaks**:
All who possess this **sūtra**,
Can act as **Heavenly Sovereigns ( Tiāndì )**, **Emperors ( Shì )**, and **lords of the myriad people ( Zhàomín )**,
And perform these **meritorious deeds ( gōngdé )**.
On days of calamity,
When they **generate a heart of devotion ( fāxīn )** and practice fasting, burn incense,
And recite the **sūtra** ten times,
All **celestial deities ( Zhūtiān )** will record their names,
And **ten thousand spirits ( Wànshén )** will guard them.
They will be ranked among the **perfected sages ( Zhìrén )**,
And attain the status of **holy ministers beneath the Golden Gate ( Jīnquè zhī chén )**.

The **celestial deities** record the **virtue/power and transgressions ( gōngguò )** of mortals,
Without the slightest loss or omission.
The **True King of Heaven ( Tiānzhōng Zhēnwáng )** will also champion them,
And those who attain the **Dao** will surely comprehend these **profound truths ( Zhìyán )**.

The **Great Brahman ( Dàfàn )** of the **Eight Celestial Palaces ( Bā Tiān )** in the East
Speaks in **hidden languages ( Yǐnyǔ )** of **infinite sounds ( Wúliáng yīn )**.

**Daoist Lord ( Dàojūn )** composed,
**The Sacred Scriptures of Primordial Origin ( Yuánshǐ Língshū )**—
*Northern Capital Sutra for Exorcising Calamities and the Jade Chapter ( Běidū Chúyāng Yùpiān )*

Thus when the **Great Brahman** of the **Eight Celestial Palaces** speaks in **hidden languages** of **infinite sounds**—
*the **Northern Palace**:*
**Huán Yǐchí**, **Tuò Túyán** the pregnant;
**Lúxū** welcomes the **Royal**, **Zhǐluó Jì** cleanses.
**Pú** transforms, **Guǎn** broadens;
**Suōbīn** bears the clouds.
**Miǎnluò** vanishes in **Yìhū**,
**Yóuláng** flees the **Capital**.
When all transformations settle,
**Yìtuó Zǔqīng** stands firm.
**Lánshǒu Jiālóu** treads the **dark path**,
**Dǎnjì Duòmèi** falls into **obscurity**.
**Jiàobāng**’s **Pínlú** awakens,
**Yīngxuán** points to the **Gate**.

**Southward, the Eight Celestial Palaces:**
**Yǒngníng Jìtóng**, **Yánchuāng** glows red with **achievement**.
They **prolong the Emperor’s** **auspiciousness**,
**Lìngpá** rolls the **floods** away.
**Yīnmǐn** pities the **cavernous depths**,
**Jīxián** honors the **virtuous**.
**Huīmáng** shines in the **well’s enclosure**,
**Lìzhān** follows the **ancestral path**.
**Xīyún** harmonizes with **appropriateness**,
**Yìsuǒ** unlocks the **barbarian’s** way.
**Juègōng** extends to **Hán Yán**,
**Wángyí** soars with **preparedness**.
**Biànfàn** binds the **strange cords**,
**Sùxuān** observes the **solemn rites**.

**The **Spirit of the Relay** descends—**
**This** alters the **boundless pool**.

**Westward, the Eight Celestial Palaces:**
**Yìtáng**’s **divine splendor** ascends,
**Jiànfú** offers **auspicious rites**.
**Yìluò** follows the **path’s rules**,
**Yànfú** swallows the **beams**.
**Lìbēn** races with **Gēnghé**,
**Míxiè** conceals the **subtle**.
They **forge the Star-Chariot** to **ward off calamities**,
**Huíhuáng** reverses the **dim stars**.
**Jiǎozhèng** cuts the **lofty gaze**,
**Tújiān** reports the **deceitful**.
**Yuèmào** strives to **soothe the guilty**,
**Cáoyán Qiūdiàn** tilts the **rocky fields**.
**Zhuó** sings of **Yáofú**,
**Biànhuāng** distinguishes the **blades of grass**.
**Niǔzī** ties the **cloud pendants**,
**Bìguāng** aids the **distant brilliance**.

**Northward, the Eight Celestial Palaces:**
**Zhòuyáo** echoes in the **Jade Capital**,
**Běijūn** binds the **shadows**.
**Wùshù** commands the **proper path**,
**Bìpián** weaves the **jade tokens**.
**Zhìdào** stretches **endlessly**,
**Yìngbì** mirrors the **Heavenly splendor**.
**Dīnglěi** piles the **autumnal vessels**,
**Zhuōfǎng** clumsily **replies**.
**Chìfān** supports **Wú**,
**Lièmìng** seals the **Battle**.
**Luánzhèng** stands at the **chill peak**,
**Dòngxián** tilts the **salted cords**.
**Zhuǎnxiá** twists the **crimson threads**,
**Níngtiān** freezes the **flat sun**.

**Wú** casts the **auspicious rune**, **Lǚ** pairs with **Xióng**.

**Dao speaks:**
These are the **hidden languages** of the **Great Brahman** in the **Eight Celestial Palaces**—
the **infinite sounds**, inscribed in **ancient script** upon the **Nine Terraces of Áo City**,
to **prevent calamities** from taking root,
to **uphold the True Dao**, **effortlessly transcendent**.
Each **character** spans a **yard in breadth**.

The **True Person of Mystic Light** once inscribed these words,
establishing the **correct pronunciation**.
Those who **know these sounds** and **fast while reciting them**—
the **Celestial Deities** will dispatch **True Officials of Investigation**,
descending to **inspect their bodies**,
recording their **merits and labors**,
and **reporting upward** to the **Celestial Hosts**.
The **Ten Thousand Spirits** will **pay homage**,
the **Earthly Deities** will **guard the gates**,
the **True Kings of Great Merit** will **recommend them to the Northern Primordial**,
and they shall **fully attain** to **wander the Three Realms**,
ascending into the **Golden Gate**.

This **sound** **repels all**,
**wards off all**,
**saves all**,
**fulfills all**—
the **natural sounds of the Celestial True**.
Thus, when recited, the **Investigators descend to observe**,
the **Supreme Deities** chant from afar,
the **Ten Thousand Spirits** pay homage,
the **Three Realms** attend the **pavilion**,
the **hosts of deities** bow their heads,
the **ghostly intelligences** vanish in terror,
the **precious stones resound**,
the **Ten Directions grow solemn**,
the **rivers and seas fall silent**,
the **mountains and hills swallow the mist**,
all **spirits tremble in submission**,
**gathering the assembled immortals**,
**Heaven** knows no **haze or filth**,
**Earth** knows no **deity-dust**,
the **darkly enlightened** grow **pure**—
**Great Compassion**, **profound and profound**.

**Scripture of the Most Precious and Boundless Salvation of Beings**
**Supreme Marvelous Sutra**
**Volume Forty completed**
**Volume Forty-One completed**

The **Five Phases Complete and Abundant Realm of Vitality and Longevity**—the Dao speaks:

*"Of old, within the Great Luo Light Heaven, in the wondrously tranquil realm of the Flying True One, the Great Benevolent Ultimate Soil, the Primordial Origin taught the Five Phases Complete and Abundant Realm of Vitality and Longevity, an incomparable supreme grade. When the Primordial Origin Sovereign was to expound this scripture, He circled ten times, summoning the Ten Directions, and then took His seat.

The Heavenly True Gods, the Highest Saints, the Wondrous Conducted True Persons, innumerable hosts without number, rode the void and arrived. Purple mists dispersed their radiance, flowing clouds intermingled in reflection, celestial hymns harmonized, divine winds stilled the echoes, crimson chariots and jeweled canopies, precious cords and jade pavilions, threefold white jade luminosity, ninefold flowery elegance—all resplendent in the boundless expanse. For seven days and seven nights, the palaces of the heavens were observed daily, the moon gates traversed, the starry cords abandoned, the Dipper constellations marked their stations, the revolving spheres and jade weights paused in stillness, divine mists dispersed, mountains and seas concealed their clouds, the heavens knew no floating vapors, the Eight Sceneries shone pure and clear. The land of the realm—its mountains, rivers, forests, and trees—lay level, without high or low, all soil transformed into indigo jade, no hues differing. Vermilion hues and azure clarity intermingled, their reflections shifting in radiance.

The assembled True Ones attended upon His seat, while the Primordial Origin Sovereign sat aloft in the void upon a five-colored lion throne.

After the first recitation of the scripture, the Great Saints of the heavens simultaneously praised its virtue. At that time, the men and women of the realm lived in tranquil longevity, the Five Phases qi fully complete and abundant, without deficiency or harm.

After the second recitation, auspicious clouds shone forth, benevolent dew spread across the void.
After the third recitation, ten thousand treasures displayed their omens, the Five Phases thrived in order.
After the fourth recitation, divine refinement perfected the mind, the people knew no sickness.
After the fifth recitation, celestial lotuses bloomed in splendor, True Immortals manifested in person.
After the sixth recitation, jade infants sang in the void, their voices harmonizing with the Great Cavern.
After the seventh recitation, the Nine Abysses ceased their opposition, water and fire separated at their sources.
After the eighth recitation, true talismans proclaimed grace, both hidden and manifest beings shared in the blessing.
After the ninth recitation, ten thousand spirits welcomed the radiance, the mixed generations unified under the Imperial One.
After the tenth recitation, decayed corpses revived, vital essence formed as human, and at that time, the men and women of the realm—without exception—turned their hearts in devotion, all receiving protection and attaining eternal life.*

The Dao speaks: *At that time, after the first recitation, the Infinite and Boundless Great God of Manifest Virtue from the Eastern Direction arrived with innumerable hosts, floating through the void. After the second recitation, the Infinite and Boundless Great God of Powerful Transformation from the Southern Direction arrived with innumerable hosts, floating through the void. After the third recitation, the Infinite and Boundless Great God of Comprehensive Survey from the Western Direction arrived with innumerable hosts, floating through the void. After the fourth recitation, the Infinite and Boundless Great God of Gathering and Restraining from the Northern Direction arrived with innumerable hosts, floating through the void. After the fifth recitation, the Infinite and Boundless Great God of Steady Will from the Northeast arrived with innumerable hosts, floating through the void. After the sixth recitation, the Infinite and Boundless Great God of Universal Resonance from the Southeast arrived with innumerable hosts, floating through the void. After the seventh recitation, the Infinite and Boundless Great God of Preserving Security from the Southwest arrived with innumerable hosts, floating through the void. After the eighth recitation, the Infinite and Boundless Great God of Rectified Qi from the Northwest arrived with innumerable hosts, floating through the void. After the ninth recitation, the Infinite and Boundless Great God of Primordial Radiance from Above arrived with innumerable hosts, floating through the void. After the tenth recitation, the Infinite and Boundless Great God of Wondrous Spirit from Below arrived with innumerable hosts, floating through the void.*

When the ten recitations were complete, the Infinite and Boundless Heavenly True Gods of the Ten Directions arrived together at once. The men and women of the realm turned their hearts in reverence and submission. Those who came were as fine as mist filling the sky, converging in boundless ranks—innumerable hosts—half the land sinking into a depression, beyond restraint.

Thus, the Primordial Origin moved the True and Divine Realm, gathering eighteen thousand heavens, the Ten Directional lands, the Nine Earthly abyssal springs, and formed them into a single pearl, great as a millet grain, suspended in the void a hundred zhang above the earth. The Primordial Origin ascended and drew in the Heavenly True Gods, the Highest Saints, the Wondrous Conducted True Persons, the Infinite and Boundless Five Directional Complete and Perfect True Gods—innumerable hosts—all entering the precious pearl.

The celestial beings looked on and saw only a surging influx from the pearl’s mouth. Once inside, their whereabouts were unknown. The people of the realm dispersed, the land returned to its even plain, no longer tilted or sunken.

Within the precious pearl, the Primordial Origin addressed all—heavenly beings, humans, immortals, saints, and all ghosts and spirits of the Ten Directions, the innumerable hosts—proclaiming:

*The Five Phases Complete and Abundant Realm of Vitality and Longevity is the ultimate of Heaven and Earth, the essential mystery of the Dao. Only the Highest Saints may comprehend it.

The Five Phases are the divine functions of the Three Powers, the refined essence of the Ultimate Truth. Wind, heat, dryness, dampness, and cold are the Five Phases of Heaven. Wood, fire, earth, metal, and water are the Five Phases of Earth. Joy, anger, thought, worry, and fear are the Five Phases of humanity. Generation, growth, transformation, contraction, and storage are the Five Phases of the Four Seasons. The revolving heavenly qi completes one cycle in six periods. The final span of the earthly realm fulfills one sufficiency in five years. When the Five Phases are complete and abundant, the qi flows in balanced harmony. When the qi flows in balanced harmony, no one meets untimely death, all attaining their full natural lifespan.

The learned of the highest order suppress excess and aid deficiency, ensuring the True Qi endures without the perils of excess or deficiency. Thus, eternal life and immortality are attained, enduring vision without end, securing the Realm of Tranquil Longevity.

The term *domain* refers to boundaries and demarcations, the meaning of sealed territories. The cycles of beginning and end—five and six—converge, and seventy-two periods of qi constitute one era, thirty years in total. Fourteen hundred and forty periods of qi span sixty years, completing one full cycle.*

When the Five Phases are neither excessive nor deficient, then they are not complete and abundant. What is called *complete and abundant* is when the **True Qi** of the **True Dao** is balanced—when the **Lesser Dao** and its **Lesser Qi** are unbalanced, this is not *complete and abundant*.

When the Five Phases are in perfect harmony, the **yin** and **yang** suffer no calamity of mutual suppression. If the **yang** laws are applied in accordance with their nature, one attains **eternal life and immortality**, undergoes **transformation and return**, entering death and rebirth, rebirth and death. Through **feather ascension**, one becomes a **divine immortal**, merging with the Dao, and ascends as a **True Person**.

When the **sutra** is fully recited, the **Dharma Assembly** of all **True Ones** oversees the transmission and grants it to me. At that moment, joy and celebration are beyond words. The **ritual matters** are thoroughly understood; the **Celestial Hosts** return to their proper stations. In an instant, all is silent, leaving no trace of sound.

At that time, **all beings**—both **celestial** and **human**—encounter the **sutra’s Dharma**, universally receiving salvation and attaining their full natural lifespan, without premature injury. All turn to the **Taoist Sage** in reverence, embracing benevolent hearts.

There is **no action, no affair**, **no strife, no desire**, **no greed, no arising**, **no extinction, no thought**, **no gain, no following**. Words are spoken without **singing of the material world**, lips utter no **false sounds**; all are unified in **compassionate love**, and even the **dead** are treated as kin. The realm is **secure and prosperous**, rejoicing in **Great Peace**; the **Dao’s teachings** emerge, and the entire land follows the Way.

Those with **devoted hearts** worship and revere it, all attaining salvation in the world. The Dao speaks: The names of **Primordial Beginning, Celestial Sage**, and others in the **sutra’s** recitation are the **inner names** of the **Celestial Hosts and Supreme Emperors**, the **hidden sounds** of **mystic resonance**. They are also the **taboo names** of **demonic kings**, the **concealed names** of **hundreds of spirits**. These are not the common words of the world.

The **Supreme Sage**, having already become a **True Person**, with the Five Phases complete and abundant, **lifespan unbounded**, mastering the **mysterious and subtle**, knows all its **precepts**. When one recites this **chapter ten times**, the **Celestial Hosts** respond from afar, the **Ten Thousand Emperors** arrange rites, the **rivers and seas** fall silent, the **mountains and peaks** conceal their clouds, the **sun and moon** halt their course, the **celestial sphere** stands still, all **demons** are subdued, **ghostly essences** are extinguished, the **returning dead** rise, and **white bones** become flesh. The **five stellar essences** descend in form, their **qi cycles** complete and abundant, **Dao’s birth** eternally secured. The **purple veins** coil around the brain, the **red sinews** frost the marrow, and the **withered and decayed** are renewed.

Those who study deeply and recite this **chapter ten times** will have the **Five Emperors** as their attendants, the **Three Realms** bowing in homage, and **demonic spirits** blinded. **Ghostly officials** are extinguished, the **dying** are cleansed, and the **dead** are reborn. This is so because the **learned** know the **five qis’** functions, **supplementing deficiencies** and **balancing excesses**, **prolonging life** and **extending vitality**, **fulfilling the Dao’s cycles**, understanding the **principle of birth** and the **root of the Way**. Though the **Five Phases** are not yet fully balanced, **impure qi** has not yet dissipated, the **body** has not yet **penetrated the True**, and one’s **summoning power** extends to the **Ten Directions**, yet the **imperial decrees** of the **Heavenly Sovereigns** remain unmastered. The **virtue/power** can **subdue the Earthly Deities**, **bind demonic spirits**, but only **avert death**—it cannot **revive the dead**. A **lighthearted recitation** of this **chapter** brings **calamity** upon oneself.

With **devotion and reverence**, one’s **gateways flourish**. **Generations prosper**, forming **auspicious connections** with the **good**. **Ten thousand disasters** do not approach, and the **divine luminaries** guard the door.

This **sutra** is **most sacred and subtle**, surpassing all in **Jade Capital**—its salvation is boundless, and it is the **foundation of all Dao**. Its **grand scope** is vast, its **virtue/power** beyond measure.

The Dao speaks: For those who recite this **sutra ten times**, the **Celestial Hosts** gather in full, the **Ten Thousand Ancestors** descend, **wandering souls** are cleansed, and all receive the **transmission**, ascending to the **Vermilion Palace** of the **Southern Celestial Realm**. For nine years, they undergo **transformation**, then are reborn, becoming **noble ones**. The Five Phases, when their **cycles reach nine**, **nine transforms into one**, and **one transforms into nine**, neither excessive nor deficient, great and small in perfect equilibrium.

Then the **metal and wood** cycles harmonize, the **water and fire** merge in **virtue/power**. The **single breath** of **earth** wanders within them. These **four symbols**—the **wandering souls** cleansed—**penetrate the Mysterious and Subtle**, receiving **alchemical refinement**. When the **Five Phases** are complete and abundant, one ascends to **Truth** in nine years, transformed and reborn. Those who **cherish this sutra** and **master its essence** will all become **divine immortals**, ascending to the **Golden Gate**, feasting in **Jade Capital**.

The **highest scholars**, reciting and **cultivating this sutra**, immediately receive the **transmission** and ascend to the **Southern Celestial Realm**. The **Southern Celestial Realm** is the **domain of the five qis and six cycles**—not its proper station is **heresy**, in its proper station is **orthodoxy**. When the Five Phases are complete and abundant, one ascends to the **Vermilion Palace’s** halls of the **Southern Celestial Realm**, receiving the **True Qi** of **orthodoxy**, entering the **body** and attaining **immortality**.

**Worldly beings** who recite this **sutra** will **prolong their lifespan**. *Complete* means **no lack**, *abundant* means **no excess**. All **living beings** who **fulfill this Dao** will have their **lifespan’s domain** securely calculated; afterward, all may attain the **Way of Corporeal Dissolution**.

The **soul-spirit** is temporarily extinguished, **not experiencing Hell’s torments**, immediately **restoring its form**, wandering in **Great Void**. This **sutra** is **subtle and profound**, salvaging **all beings** without end. **All celestial and human beings** rejoice in its blessings. **Boundless merit** extends to **life and death**, all benefiting from its grace.

Though **Heaven’s treasures** are not passed to the **lower world**, the **devoted scholars** offer **golden treasures** with **sincere hearts**, swearing to **Heaven** and receiving its transmission. **Leaking or neglecting** this **sutra** brings **calamity** upon the **Nine Ancestors**, and one is **endlessly enslaved** to **ghostly officials**.

**Twenty-four Jade Attendants**—both **Youths** and **Maidens**—serve this **sutra**, **guarding and protecting** those who receive it. The Dao speaks:

In the **first month**, after **fasting and purification**, recite and **chant this sutra**, and the **nine qis** arise, benefiting the **departed of the upper world**, severing their **Hellish bondage**, and guiding them to the **Southern Celestial Realm**.

In the **fourth month**, after **fasting and purification**, recite and **chant this sutra**, and the **three qis** nourish, bringing **prosperity to all things**. **Relatives and kin** all attain **long life**.

In the **seventh month**, after **fasting and purification**, recite and **chant this sutra**, and the **seven qis** gather, forming **all treasures**. This aids the **myriad people**; one’s **body** attains **divine immortality**, and the **Celestial Hosts** record their names. With **yellow talismans** and **white tablets**, they **abolish death** and **ascend to life**.

In the **tenth month**, after **fasting and purification**, recite and **chant this sutra**, and the **five qis** settle, **blessing the sovereign**. The **nation’s fate** is prolonged, eternally **preserving Great Peace**.

On **auspicious days of the four seasons**, recite and **chant this sutra**, and the **single qi** harmonizes and stands upright, **forever severing harm** and **dispelling pestilence**, ensuring the **people’s safety** and the **land’s joy**. One attains the **station of the Nine-Palace True Person**.

On **days of separation and union**, recite and **chant this sutra**, and the **Heavenly Dao** clarifies, the **Great Earth** stirs not. The **heart** aligns with **Ultimate Truth**, achieving **ascension**, the **soul-spirit** purified, **all qis** enduring. **No suffering** is experienced; the **body** shines with **radiance**, the **Three Realms** stand as **guardians**, the **Five Emperors** **welcome**, and **Ten Thousand Spirits** **pay homage**. Their names are **written to Heaven**; when **merit and virtue** are fulfilled, one **ascends to Upper Clarity**.

The Dao speaks: On the day of practicing the Way, one must first bathe in fragrant water, observe strict fasting and purity within the chamber, and face east. One should strike the teeth thirty-two times, ascending to hear the Thirty-Two Heavens, and with the heart, bow to the Thirty-Two Offenses. Closing the eyes, one meditates quietly, imagining oneself seated amid the three-colored qi-clouds—blue, yellow, and white—while within and without, the darkness thickens. There are nine of Wood, three of Fire, one of Earth, seven of Metal, and five of Water, totaling Twenty-Five True Ones, standing guard on either side. The sun and moon shine brightly, the Five Stars radiate, and a round symbol grows upon the neck, its light illuminating the Ten Directions with such clarity.

The secret incantation is thus:

*"Supreme Mystic Origin, Sovereign Dao Lord of the Highest.*
*Summon forth from my body the Thirty-Six Functionaries of Three-Five, the left and right officials and messengers, the attendants of fragrant jade boys, the speaking jade maidens, the Five Emperors’ direct seals, and the direct-day incense officials—each thirty-six in number—to open the way as spoken.*

*Today is a day of auspicious celebration, with prolonged fasting in the pure hall, practicing this most wondrous sutra to deliver countless beings.*

*May what is invoked ascend directly to the presence of the Most High Supreme Sovereign of the Thirty-Two Heavenly Primordial Emperors.*

*Concluded. Drawing the qi through thirty-two passages, facing east, recite the sutra.*

**The Supreme Primordial Sutra of Infinite Salvation**

The Supreme Primordial *Dongxuan Lingbao* Scripture is complete in the Five Phases, nurturing the domain of eternal life for all sentient beings, and granting tenfold salvation.

The Six Qi and Five Movements converge to achieve ascension, while the Great Void stretches boundless, establishing the Primordial Root.

Divine spirits manifest as fleeting visions, the Great Transformation gives birth to sound, and the Three Mysteries descend to refine, formless and shapeless.

The Eight Enclosures radiate light, yin returns to yang’s clarity, and the interplay of firm and yielding completes the Sovereign Dao’s rotation.

The Jade Mechanism’s flying wheel flows through the Ten Thousand Heavens, its crimson radiance crystalline, the True Qi unbroken.

The Supreme Mystic Emperor, One, opens the Diagram of Life, and the Sovereign’s pristine brilliance receives the True Seal universally.

On green tablets with emerald script, the phoenix-bound divine scriptures shine, the Seven Spirits illuminate, and the Five Phases are complete.

The threads of Heaven and Earth interweave, the wheel turns through the Four Voids, and the august Mystic Scene stands as the abode of Ten Thousand Saints.

Within are the Lords of Broad Mist who record the celestial registers, the Sovereigns of Long Reach who respond to the cosmic cycles, the True Ones of Refined Yin who forge the elixir, the Master of Idle Unity who transforms the qi, and the Lord of Kunlun and Langyang who governs the Primordial Transformation, commands the Dao, extends life, and stands as the Infinite Savior—floating above the clouds, stabilizing the mountains, delivering countless beings.

Together, they ride the gusting winds, in emerald chariots and resplendent palanquins, beneath purple canopies and flying wheels, harnessed by dragons and tigers. The Dao follows the clouds, bearing the crimson-light banner, the sacred phoenix flag, and to the left, the Nine Heavenly Treasures; to the right, the Eight Scenic True Scripts. The divine seals and crimson talismans gather the myriad spirits, with the Heavenly Halters leading and the Seven Primordials following.

From the Four Extremes and Ten Directions, they chant in praise and come.

The Heavenly Scripture shines brightly, summoning spirits and guiding immortals.

Idle Unity assists as minister, the Highest True One of the Great Cavern, the Assistant of Azure Flower, and the First Sage of Ten Thousand Beginnings—all oversee the celestial registers and present themselves at the Imperial Court.

Through the eons, they establish the framework, strictly recording the Five Phases.

Holding the celestial knots, they regulate the cosmic mechanism, ensuring the qi remains unerring.

**First, the Flying Immortal praises the Five Phases’ complete sounds:**
The Primordial Beginning unfurls its diagram,
Giving birth to Yin and Yang.
The Two Forms established, the Seven Luminaries fly their light.
The Pure and the Void spread their spirits,
All things unharmed.

Returning the Three Flowers.
Born to life, they receive the Dark and Bright qi,
In the net of Yùluó.

Vast and boundless, their desires,
Drowned in the River of Love.
Through endless kalpas, lost in their pursuits,
How could they escape the Wheel?

The Great Demon seizes their forms,
Their wandering souls follow the breath’s return.
Having abandoned the True Path,
Their births—where shall they depend?

Drowning in the Three Paths,
Causing the Heavenly Immortals sorrow.
Why not heed Creation’s heart,
Equalizing life—what need for limits?

The Ten Sections of the Cavernous Mysteries,
As the foundation for attaining the True.
One enlightenment of the Long-Life Dao,
The Spirit Treasury opens wide.

The body enters the Great Void,
The form ascends as an Immortal.

**Third, the Highest True One proclaims the song of transcending the Five Phases to attain the Dao:**

The towering, dark察山,
Where the Jade Celestial was born to this peak.
Entrusted to the Hong lineage’s womb,
In seclusion for countless kalpas.

Meeting the Celestial Sovereign’s grace,
The Sacred Treasure’s laws unfolded.
Heaven steadfast, never tipping,
Serene, he sits in the Golden Gate.

Rescuing countless beings,
His spirit descending to the Dipper’s Pole.
Seizing Heaven and Earth’s mechanisms,
Their threads and measures established.

The Pure Spirit wields the Crimson Banner,
The Azure Sovereign raises the Golden Axe.
Adrift in the Crimson Light,
The Jade Texts emerge, one by one.

All born beings, their Five Phases complete.
Numbers exhausted, returning to the Void—
Who can fix birth and death?

The True Ones who study the Dao,
Why not race the sun and moon?

One recitation of the Flying Heaven’s Text,
A great kalpa may be transcended.
Feasting in the Land of Nowhere,
A hundred thousand Heavens, joy and delight.

This, above the Three Realms,
In the flying space between,
The Immortals’ songs,
Their melodies matching the Cavernous Chapters.

Recite them a hundred times,
Your name ascends to the Southern Palace.
Recite them a thousand times,
The Magic King welcomes you in reverence.

Ten thousand recitations complete,
The Dao is whole—
Ascend to the Great Void,
Cross the Three Realms,
Ranked among the Immortal Lords.

Those who hear the Sacred Sounds,
The Magic King bows in respect,
Commanding the Earth Spirits,
To guard and escort you.
Drawn from the Earth’s Gate,
Free from the Five Sufferings and Eight Hardships,
The Seven Ancestors ascend,
Forever parted from the Ghostly Bureau,
The soul passes through Zhu Ling,
Refined and reborn.

This is the boundless,
The endless salvation.

There are secret celestial texts,
Revered by all the Heavens.
To reveal them carelessly is to fall into Hell,
Bringing calamity to the Seven Ancestors.

The Dao says:
These two chapters are the sacred sounds
Of the Heavenly Sovereigns and the Most High Magic Kings,
Hidden in secrecy.

All are for harmonizing the Five Phases,
So they do not clash or harm,
Their courses complete, their qi full,
Summoning the Concordant Breath,
Making life’s commandments
Supplement the broken and severed,
Endlessly renewed,
Blessings descending, the realm of longevity extended.

The Primordial Beginning’s flying mystic qi,
Formed into the Cavernous Chapters, the Great Brahman’s words,
Not the common speech of the world.
Their words lack melodious grace,
Their tunes lack ornate beauty.
Thus they are called profound and obscure,
Difficult to trace in detail.

Treasured by Heaven,
Hidden in the Purple Micro’s Upper Palace,
According to the Mysterious Science,
Transmitted once every four hundred thousand kalpas.

If a perfected one, bearing gold and jade with a sincere heart,
Follows the ancient rites and pledges to the Ten Heavens,
Then it shall be granted.

The Dao says:
When Heaven and Earth’s courses falter,
The sun and moon, the Five Stars wane and wax,
The most sacred and divine rest or decline,
The shallow scholars fall ill—
All are due to the Five Phases being incomplete,
Thus bringing calamities.

When such disasters arise,
All of like breath must unite in heart,
Fast in the six periods,
Burn incense at ten times,
Turn the sutras ten thousand times,
And virtue will descend to dispel all misfortunes.

The boundless texts,
Salvaging the endless.

The Dao says:
The shallow in the Dao are few,
Their Immortal rank not yet complete,
Their fate exhausted, their bodies in the Great Yin,
The Five Phases’ qi
Unfulfilled, insufficient—
Wood and metal steal their essence,
Water and fire assault their breath,
Earth collapses, gold melts,
Their spirits thus depart.

When the time of passing arrives,
The fellow students and sages alike shall perform incense rites for them,
Recite the sutras ten times over,
To guide their mortal forms according to the law.

Then the Five Stars’ qi harmonizes with their vital essence,
Their complete and fulfilled destiny returns to their bodies,
Their souls ascend directly to the Southern Palace,
And according to their learning and merit,
They shall be reborn within a calculated number of days.

With no hesitation in their rebirth,
They attain immortality and divinity.

The Dao says:
When Heaven and Earth’s courses reach their end,
The stars and constellations stray from their paths,
The sun and moon lose their eclipses,
The Four Seasons fall out of order,
Yin and Yang become unbalanced,
The realm suffers plagues and calamities,
Martial qi invades the Dipper,
Pestilence and poison spread,
The common people perish and are wounded,
Teachers and friends meet their fates,
Fellow students perish—
All are due to the varying degrees of the Five Phases’ cycles,
Their actions straying from the Dao,
Defying the complete and fulfilled virtue,
They too must fast, burn incense, and recite sutras.

For fasting, keeping precepts, and reciting sutras,
Their merit and virtue are most profound.
Above, they dispel celestial calamities,
And safeguard the emperor.
Below, they avert poisonous harm,
To deliver the common people.
Life and death depend upon them,
Their blessings are boundless.

Thus it is said: *Unfathomable*—
Universal salvation for Heaven and humanity.

The Dao says:
All who possess this sutra,
Can, for Heaven, Earth, the Emperor, and the people,
Perform such merit.
On days of calamity,
With a sincere heart, they fast, burn incense, and recite the sutras ten times over,
All their deeds are recorded by the celestial hosts,
Ten thousand spirits attend as guardians,
And the sages of the Right Path
Shall surely become holy ministers of the Golden Palace.

The celestial hosts record every person’s merits and transgressions,
Without the slightest omission.
Even the demon kings of Heaven shall recommend your name,
And those who attain the Dao shall truly comprehend these profound words.

From the *Hidden Words of the Great Brahman, Infinite Sound*,
Composed by the Dao Lord,
*Middle Chapter of the Primordial Spirit Scripture*,
Eastern Eight Heavens.

The Mystic Pearl Cavern, the Azure Ford’s unfathomable depths.
The interplay of water and fire—dragon-borne, wondrous Brahman.

Mingled divine and true, without noble splendor or rank.
The White Primordial, brocaded in imperial splendor, within the Tiger’s realm.

Treading white, void-bound, the phoenix’s watchtower wheels with treasure.
Mystic wisdom halts—life and death drift as dust.

**Western Eight Heavens:**
Guard the unknowing, the Dao’s profound obscurity.
Detach from borders, thoughts depart—Divine Expanse has its gate.
Await the utmost void; the void is the honored origin.
Divine motion stirs the cauldron of intent—Three-in-One eternally luminous.
Jade scriptures, precious tablets, the Great Brahman’s golden wheel.
Seal leisure without revealing—naturally attaining the True.
Demons, ghosts, and spirit marshals—summons drive away the miasma.
Fulfill the destined cycles—life’s essence safeguards the body.

**Northern Eight Heavens:**
True longevity, Heaven’s blessings—receiving tribute, nurturing the people.
Nine Chants’ sacred banners, none dare transgress without seeking.
Embrace verdant hues, floating mists over the Luo Terrace.
Nurture the jade canopy’s sprouts—day leads, moon entrusts.
Transforming essence, dragon-spirits—East’s Azure, South’s Netherworld.
Silent reflection on mystic judgments—vast heavens obscure the path.
Thathan’s capital ascends, records of passage inscribed.
The Primordial Emperor’s distant gaze—expansive grace aids sincere devotion.

「The Dao speaks: Within these heavens, the Great Brahman’s hidden words,
Resound in boundless tones. The ancient texts of the Five Senior Emperors of Heaven
Engraved upon the Five Stars and Jade Gate,
To rectify the divisions of destiny,
Descend the *qi* of completeness and sufficiency,
Granting longevity to all living beings—
Each character vast and extended, a *zhang* in breadth.

The True Emperor of Heaven, in ancient times, inscribed these texts,
Establishing them as the correct sounds.
Those who know these sounds,
And can fast while reciting them,
Shall summon the flying heavenly kings of all the heavens,
Who descend to observe their forms,
Record their merits and labors,
And report to the heavens above.
Ten thousand spirits shall pay homage,
Earthly deities attend at the gates,
Great Virtue demon-kings bestow protection,
And elevate the Highly Pure.
The Dao’s completion ensures attainment,
Wandering through the Three Realms,
Ascending into the Golden Gate.

These sounds dispel all obstacles,
Ward off all calamities,
Conduct all beings,
And fulfill all desires—
The natural sounds of the True Emperor of Heaven.
Thus, when recited, they draw the flying kings to descend and witness,
The Supreme Emperor’s distant chant resounds,
Ten thousand spirits pay homage,
The Three Realms attend at the hall,
All deities bow in reverence,
Demon spirits perish of their own accord,
And the *ling* and *lang* gems tremble in response,
The Ten Directions grow serene,
Rivers and seas fall silent,
Mountains and valleys swallow their mists,
All living beings tremble and submit,
Summoning the assembled immortals,
The heavens free of miasma,
The earth free of demonic dust,
The netherworld’s wisdom pierces and clarifies—
This is the boundless, profound Great Virtue.

**Scripture of the *Lingbao* Mystic Treasures: Supreme Method of Boundless Degrees**
*Chapter 41 concludes. Chapter 42 begins.*」

The **Supplication for Continuing Lineage and Prolonged Prosperity** speaks thus:

In days of yore, within the **Great Beginning Broad-Generating Heaven**, in the **Purple Mists Cavernous Song of Great Blessedness and Joyous Realm**, the **Mystic Scripture of Supplication for Continuing Lineage and Prolonged Prosperity** was received from the **Primordial Beginning’s Transmission**.

When the **Primordial Beginning Venerable Sovereign** delivered this scripture, circling ten times in recitation to summon the Ten Directions, the **Heavenly True Gods**, the **Supreme Saints**, the **Wondrous Conduct True Persons**, and the countless **Unfettered Hosts** arrived, riding the void. Fragrant mists floated like smoke, soaring cranes followed their banners, crimson light blazed ahead, jade carriages rolled with thunderous wheels, and resplendent celestial clouds shimmered in myriad hues, illuminating the boundless expanse.

For seven days and seven nights, the heavens and great mountains exchanged azure and roseate brilliance, while the sun, moon, and stars shone with concentrated clarity. Divine winds swept from afar. Jade cliffs glowed with dew, celestial emeralds hung in the high void, and crimson qi drifted, rendering the land’s earth, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees pure and level—so clear that even the finest hairs were visible, with overlapping reflections and unified patterns. The soil transformed into soft jade, all tinged with indigo-green.

The assembled **True Ones** attended at the seat, while the **Primordial Beginning Venerable Sovereign** sat in void-suspended lotus-petal gemstone platform.

After the **first recitation**, the **Heavenly Saints** of all realms simultaneously proclaimed its excellence. At that time, all men and women of the land awakened to the root of birth.

After the **second recitation**, they steadfastly observed the **Original Source**, avoiding suffering’s paths.

After the **third recitation**, they all knew the **Supreme Dao**, the origin of birth and generation.

After the **fourth recitation**, they were born in an **Age of Saints**, becoming virtuous and wise scholars.

After the **fifth recitation**, their hearts practiced filial piety and benevolence, excelling in nurturing the aged.

After the **sixth recitation**, **Yin and Yang harmonized in virtue**, nurturing spiritual embryos.

After the **seventh recitation**, they attained the **Supreme Law’s Gate**, their Dao-born lives unending.

After the **eighth recitation**, though they took birth, they were free from desire and attachment, severing lustful thoughts.

After the **ninth recitation**, they comprehended the **Subtle Mysteries**, blending male and female, their essence penetrating the **Void’s Profound**.

After the **tenth recitation**, all sentient beings eternally prolonged their lineage, rejoicing across the boundless seas, their blessings extending to both the living and the departed. At that time, all men and women of the land—without exception—devoted their hearts, receiving protection and attaining longevity.

The **Way** speaks thus:

When the **Primordial Beginning Venerable Sovereign** completed the **first recitation**, the **Cloud-Bud Divine Dew Great God of the East’s Boundless Limitless Realm** arrived with the **Unfettered Hosts**, floating through the void.

When the **second recitation** concluded, the **Cloud-Bud Jewelous Flower Great God of Illuminated Nature from the South’s Boundless Limitless Realm** arrived with the **Unfettered Hosts**, floating through the void.

When the **third recitation** concluded, the **Cloud-Bud Sensitizing Great God of Great Substance from the West’s Boundless Limitless Realm** arrived with the **Unfettered Hosts**, floating through the void.

When the **fourth recitation** concluded, the **Cloud-Bud Stabilizing Infant Great God of Divine Water from the North’s Boundless Limitless Realm** arrived with the **Unfettered Hosts**, floating through the void.

When the **fifth recitation** concluded, the **Cloud-Bud Illuminating Wisdom Great God of Received Cognition from the Northeast’s Boundless Limitless Realm** arrived with the **Unfettered Hosts**, floating through the void.

When the **sixth recitation** concluded, the **Cloud-Bud Gathering-Use Great God of Threaded Filaments from the Southeast’s Boundless Limitless Realm** arrived with the **Unfettered Hosts**, floating through the void.

When the **seventh recitation** concluded, the **Cloud-Bud Chief Blessing Great God of Virtuous Essence from the Southwest’s Boundless Limitless Realm** arrived with the **Unfettered Hosts**, floating through the void.

When the **eighth recitation** concluded, the **Cloud-Bud Healthy Nurturing Great God of Yang Momentum from the Northwest’s Boundless Limitless Realm** arrived with the **Unfettered Hosts**, floating through the void.

When the **ninth recitation** concluded, the **Cloud-Bud Nine-Palace Great God of Azure Lotus from the Upper Realm’s Boundless Limitless Realm** arrived with the **Unfettered Hosts**, floating through the void.

When the **tenth recitation** concluded, the **Cloud-Bud Reviving Command Great God of Spiritual Treasury from the Lower Realm’s Boundless Limitless Realm** arrived with the **Unfettered Hosts**, floating through the void.

As the tenfold recitation reached completion, the **Boundless Limitless Heavenly True Gods of Transformation** from all Ten Directions arrived simultaneously. All men and women of the land bowed in reverence, awakening to the **Dao’s Source**, establishing lineage continuity, and perpetuating the foundation of birth and generation. They inherited ancestral blessings, extending prosperity without end.

Those who came were as dense as fine rain and mist. The **Unfettered Hosts** caused half the land’s soil to sink unevenly—an occurrence beyond restraint.

The **Primordial Beginning’s Great Compassion** sought to enlighten countless beings, revealing the mysteries of **Creation’s Workings** and the **Dao’s Depths**. Thus, the **Supreme Mysteries** were concealed in secrecy to manifest the **Divine Pair’s Unity**—the **Yin-Yang** as the **Trigram’s union**, blending a hundred deities, swirling like mist and dispersing wind, transforming into the **True One**, which is the **Ultimate Secret of Human Perfection**.

Even the **Flying Transmitted Listed True Ones**, before attaining the Dao, would descend golden elixirs by casting cloud-pearls, their **Profound Sensitivities** merging to produce this **Spiritual Embryo**, its **qi and essence** fully formed. Within, the **True Body’s Unmoving Form** manifested, and the **Method of Supplication for Continuing Lineage and Prolonged Prosperity** was expounded.

The root of life begins with **Primordial Qi’s** cultivation. The **Qi’s essence** is as fine as a thread’s grain.

Thus, a **Treasure Pearl**—as large as a millet grain—was suspended in the void, ten zhang above the earth. The **Primordial Beginning** ascended and summoned the **Heavenly True Gods**, the **Supreme Saints**, the **Wondrous Conduct True Persons**, and the **Ten-Directional Boundless Limitless Cloud-Bud Generative Jade Infant True Child Great Gods**, along with the **Unfettered Hosts**, all entering the pearl.

The **Heavenly and Human** gazed upward, seeing only a faint flutter from the pearl’s mouth. Once inside, their whereabouts were unknown. The people dispersed, and the land returned to its even state, with no further subsidence.

The **Primordial Beginning** then, within the pearl, transformed into the **Lotus-Birth Infant Form**, completing the scripture’s delivery. The **Assembled True Ones** oversaw the transmission.

It was bestowed upon me. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words. The **Law’s rites** were fully observed, the **Heavens’ deities resumed their stations**, and in a flash, all traces fell silent.

At that time, those who encountered the **Scripture’s Law** saw their lineages flourish, blessings descend, and their entire year pass without misfortune. All bowed in devotion, their hearts turned to goodness.

「Practicing benevolence and harmony, practicing gentleness and transformation, practicing pity and forgiveness.

Practicing frugality and compassion, practicing steadfastness and humanity. Their words held no sectarian chanting, their mouths no flattery—all in equal accord with compassion. Even the divergent and the profane became kindred.

With the land secure and the people prosperous, they rejoiced in the Great Peace. The Dao/Way began to manifest its teachings, and the realm was governed by the Dao/Way.

Those with sincere devotion revered and honored it, all attaining the power to save the world.

The Dao/Way’s words: The names spoken by the **Primordial Beginning** (元始天尊) within the **Scripture’s Law** are indeed the sacred titles of the **Heavens’ deities** (诸天上帝). The hidden resonance of nurturing life and fostering the infant form. They are also the **true taboos** (真魔内讳) of the **hidden transformations** (混化变胎), leading to the flourishing of lineage and the blessings of the hundred spirits.

To open and expound the Great Law, to illuminate the root of the Dao/Way. Initially from the nurturing of the embryo, **Juzing** (朱精) and **Bailian** (白铅) blend. The harmonious mixing of myriad faults, the **Three—Drums** (三－鼓) dancing in rhythm.

With **Yuyi** (玉饴) nourishing the spirit, **liu-zhu** (流珠) awakening clarity, the **Imperial Consorts** (帝妃) performing the sacred dance, the **purple cells** (紫胞) splitting open, the **Heavenly Infant** (天婴) rising forth.

Named **True One** (真一), with the domain of **Jingyan** (精延). As the sovereign of form, the honored one of all spirits.

Firmly rooted in the **Primordial Dao/Way** (固道元命), the true body of the **Dao/Way’s birth** (生道真身).

Now you wish to pray for a virtuous heir, to ensure the prosperity of your lineage, so that the **qi** does not perish and the Dao/Way remains boundless.

Only those who have attained the **Great Sage of the Dao/Way** (已得道大圣) can fully comprehend its teachings.

Reciting this chapter ten times, the **Heavens’ deities** (诸天) chant in harmony from afar, the **Ten Thousand Deities** (万帝) arrange their rites, the **Holy Mother** (圣母) breaks the bonds, the **Spirit of Life** (司命) decrees birth, the **Guardian of Souls** (监魂) enhances virtue, blessings and rejoicing multiply in abundance, the **host of demons** (群魔) are subdued in form, the **vital essence of ghosts** (鬼精) vanishes completely, the dead rise and the unborn are reborn.

For those of **highest learning** (至学之士), reciting this chapter ten times brings the **Celestial Palace’s** (玉京) protection, the **Three Realms** (三界) singing in reverence, the **Heavenly Mechanism** (天机) descending to assist, and the **Spirit of Life** (注命) granting rebirth.

The lineage flourishes, blessings extend to the gates of the noble, and those in peril are delivered—none are lost, all preserved complete.

Thus, for you: The scholars purify the outer world of its **filth** (世殗), and inwardly attain the **depths of transformation** (化渊). The **Youthful Immortals** (童君) present the **sacred tablets** (箎), the **Female Immortals** (女君) play the **xun flute** (埙), their voices harmonizing as the **spirit** spreads, and the **wondrous taboos** (妙讳) are transmitted. The **Dao/Way’s embryo** (道胎) nurtures the **spirit’s gestation** (灵孕), and the infant breathes naturally.

Summoning and commanding the **ten directions** (十方), they safeguard and refine the **embryonic Immortals** (胎仙), ensuring the descent of noble heirs, with none dying prematurely.

A careless recitation brings calamity upon oneself. Reverent offerings and proper rites extend blessings to the lineage, generation after generation, in eternal flourishing. The Dao/Way’s virtue remains boundless, and the **spirits of light** (神明) guard the gates.

This scripture is most sublime, unparalleled in the **Celestial Capital** (玉京). Its power to deliver beings is immeasurable—it is the **root of the Dao/Way’s birth** (生道之宗).

Awe-inspiring and vast, its **virtue/power** (德) is beyond measure.

The Dao/Way’s words: For those who recite this scripture ten times, the **Heavens’ deities** (诸天) gather in full, opening for you the **Registry of Life** (生录), granting noble descendants to continue the lineage, and perpetuating the **Great Sage’s lineage** (大仙宗).

Even those with **ten thousand ancestors** (亿曾万祖) and **suffering souls** (幽魂苦爽) shall receive this deliverance, ascending to the **Vermilion Palace** (朱宫), all attaining nine years of transformation, reborn through the Dao/Way’s nurturing, and becoming **noble beings** (贵人).

Those who love this scripture and recite it diligently, with **virtue/power** (功满德就) fulfilled, shall have descendants and grandchildren who become **Immortal** (仙), each leaf receiving the Dao/Way, the lineage rejoicing in blessings, all ascending to the **Golden Gate** (金阙) and feasting in the **Celestial Capital** (玉京).

For those of **highest learning** (上学之士) who recite this scripture and pray for descendants among all living beings, ensuring the **Dao/Way’s birth** (生道) never ceases and the people have heirs, honoring the **ancestral mysteries** (祖玄) through sacrifice, their **hidden virtue** (阴德) bestowed in abundance.

All shall receive this deliverance, ascending to the **Southern Palace** (南宫).

When beings of the world recite it, their **lifespans** (冑系) and **progeny** (绵昌) extend, ensuring long life and all attaining the **path of the corpse-resolution** (尸解之道).

Their **soul-spirits** (魂神) temporarily vanish, not passing through the **hells** (地狱), immediately returning to form, wandering freely in the **Great Void** (太空).

This scripture is subtle and profound, delivering beings without end. All **Heavens’ deities and mortals** (天人) receive its blessings.

Immeasurable blessings, granting mercy across life and death. It is treasured by the **Heavens** (上天), not transmitted to the lower world.

Only those of **highest virtue** (至士) who offer **golden treasures** (赍金宝) with sincere devotion may swear to the **Heavens** (盟天) to keep this scripture from being carelessly revealed or leaked.

Calamity falls upon the **nine ancestral lines** (殃及九祖). Endless servitude in the **Netherworld’s offices** (长役冥官).」

Attended by the Five Sovereigns, twenty-four Jade Boys and Jade Girls each, they guard and protect the sacred scripture and those who receive it with divine presence.

The Dao speaks: In the first month, observe a long fast, reciting and chanting this scripture. Pray for descendants and prosperity of one’s lineage, invoking the divine winds and fire lords of the gods, who transmit celestial radiance, granting life to the command. The wise and enlightened, the brightest among mortals, shall be raised from the dead of past ages, freed from earthly bonds and servitude. They ascend to the Southern Palace.

In the seventh month, observe a long fast, reciting and chanting this scripture. Pray for descendants and prosperity of one’s lineage, invoking the golden qi of the Yellow Chamber, transmitting the numinous essence, so that form may be perfected. The palace halls grow firm within, a hundred spirits enter the womb, the body becomes divine and immortal. The names of all the Heavens are inscribed—yellow talismans, white tablets—transforming death into life.

In the tenth month, observe a long fast, reciting and chanting this scripture. Pray for descendants and prosperity of one’s lineage, invoking the supreme essence of the One Dao. Transmit the luminous spirit, so that nature may pierce the boundless void, wisdom illuminate the Nine Dark Realms, foresight discern omens before they arise, and one may harmonize with transformation, becoming king or emperor. Pray for sacred descendants, with jade and orchid blooming in abundance, a hundred spirits rejoicing, all under Heaven receiving blessings. Stabilize the nation’s fate, preserve Heaven’s enduring existence, ensuring the lineage never ceases, always ruling as sovereign, pacifying the realm, and the people calling it the Great Peace.

On the eight seasonal festivals, chant this scripture for those without descendants, descending Dao-qi to grant them children, establishing their families, and making them True Ones of the Nine Palaces.

On one’s birth-day, chant this scripture to return to the Three Primordials, congealing the white pearl of spirit. The Dao-Father and Dao-Mother eternally guard the cinnabar field. The Record-Keeper of Life registers one’s fate, the Lord of Flowers extends one’s years, the soul-spirit clarifies and steadies, and the ten thousand qi endure. One does not pass through suffering, and the body radiates with light. The Three Realms attend as guards, the Five Sovereigns welcome, and ten thousand gods pay homage. One’s name is inscribed in Heaven, virtue fulfilled, ascending to the Upper Purity.

The Dao speaks: On the day of practice, one must bathe in fragrant waters, fast in purity, enter the chamber facing east, and strike the teeth thirty-two times, ascending to hear the Thirty-Two Heavens. Bow in the heart thirty-two times, close the eyes, and in stillness, imagine oneself seated amid five-colored clouds, inner and outer darkness enveloping. There stand the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Tortoise, Lion, and White Crane, arrayed on either side. Sun and moon illuminate, the chamber glows brightly, a round symbol forms at the nape, its light radiating the ten directions—thus, clearly manifest.

The secret incantation:
*"Supreme Mysterious Origin, the Most High Dao-Lord.
Summon forth from my body the thirty-five officials of the Three-Five, left and right officers and messengers, the Jade Boys attending with incense, the Jade Girls transmitting words, the Five Sovereigns’ direct seals, the direct-day incense officials—each thirty-six in number—opening the way as spoken.*

Today is a day of auspicious joy, a long fast in the pure hall, practicing this most wondrous scripture, delivering countless beings.

May what is invoked ascend directly to the Supreme Throne of the Most High, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Origins, the Most Venerable Emperor of the Beginning.

*Conclude, drawing qi thirty-two times, facing east to chant the scripture.*

Eyes as sun and moon,
Head as Kunlun,
Brows as the Canopy,
Hair as mountains and forests,
Intestines as rivers and seas,
Breath as wind and clouds,
Voice as thunder and lightning—
First light emerges.

Vast eons pass,
Qi undifferentiated.
Above, no hue remains,
Below, no abyss remains.
Wind and mist pierce the void,
Diamond-ridden, ascending to Heaven.
Heaven births, Earth nurtures,
Outer defenses at every pass.
Golden qi firm and unyielding,
Boundaries vast and obstinate.

At the start of the eon,
No darkness, no obscurity,
No form, no shadow,
No limit, no end.
Boundless Great Brahman,
Vast and lightless.
Crimson Clarity unfurls the diagram,
Natural motion unfolds.
Primordial Beginning stabilizes,
Five Scriptures spread.
Crimson texts, jade characters,
Eight威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威

Recite it a hundredfold—
The Dao’s qi fills the world.

Recite it a thousandfold—
The weary gaze upon it in awe.

Ten thousandfold, the Dao is complete,
Stirring the divine and the spirit,
Giving birth to pure and virtuous men,
Making them sages of the world,
Advancing their Daoic deeds,
Lifting their forms to ascend.

Hear the sacred sound,
A hundred spirits guard their bodies,
Commanding the earthly deities,
Escorting them at entry and exit,
Drawing them forth from the earthly gate,
Freeing them from the five sufferings and eight hardships,
Ascending the seven ancestral stages,
Forever departing the ghostly realm,
Their souls crossing the Vermilion Mound,
Undergoing refinement and rebirth.

This is called boundless salvation,
Universal deliverance without end.

There are secret celestial texts,
Revered by all the heavens.

To reveal or scorn them leads to hell,
Bringing calamity upon the seven ancestral uncles.

The Dao speaks:
These two chapters are the words of the Celestial Sovereigns of all the heavens,
The Most Exalted True Kings,
The Heavenly Masters of the Highest Mysteries,
Who hang the fate of the living,
Determine succession without end,
Uninterruptedly nurturing,
Flowing the source of transformation,
Making life nearly endless.
Those who attain it from without—
Their descendants flourish, branches and twigs teeming.
Those who attain it from within—
Divine union of male and female,
Drawing upon the qi spring,
Conceiving a jade-like infant,
Inheriting the true and pure,
Resembling in form and essence,
Establishing the lineage of immortals,
Receiving the divine transmission,
Splitting into myriad forms,
Dwelling in the hidden heart,
Their spirits permeating the ten directions with secret sounds.

All are the words of the Great Brahman,
Not the common speech of the world.
Words without melodious grace,
Melodies without ornate beauty.

「Thus it is spoken of the Highest Mysteries,
Difficult to seek and discern in detail.

The treasures of the heavens are kept in secret
Within the **Divine Constellation** (*Shénxiāo*) and **Jade Purity** (*Yùqīng*) Upper Palaces.
When the time is ripe and the transmission descends,
The **Way** (*Dào*) speaks, and the teaching is proclaimed.

**Way** speaks: The virtuous and faithful,
Though their descendants are yet unborn,
Their **filial piety** (*jiǒng*) and **lineage** (*sì*) fail to continue,
Their noble houses wither and decline,
Or they bear sons and daughters in vain,
Who perish young before reaching maturity—
Only to see their children, still in infancy,
Meet with sudden ruin.

All who suffer such calamities,
With shared **qi** (*qì*), must together petition,
Offering prayers and incense,
Supplicating the **Highest Authentic Ones** (*Shàngzhēn*),
With united hearts and fasting,
Burning **sandalwood** (*xiāng*) at all six hours,
Reciting the **Tenfold Universal** (*shíxiàn*) **Sutra** in full cycles,
And the **Virtue and Power** (*fúdé*) of the **Heavenly Lords** (*Tiānzhǔ*) descend in response—
Their descendants take root and flourish,
Their blessings extend across generations,
And all ill omens are dispelled.

The merit is boundless,
And the salvation endless.
**Way** speaks: Those of shallow understanding,
Or whose **meritorious deeds** (*fúyè*) are yet insufficient,
Though they pray for descendants,
Often bear children who die before adulthood—
**Fated harm** (*jiāohài*).

If those of shared learning,
The **Perfect Ones** (*Zhìrén*), perform the rites of incense,
And recite the **Sutra** ten times over,
According to the proper **method** (*fǎ*),
Their **spirits and souls** (*húnshén*) ascend directly to the **Southern Palace** (*Nángōng*),
Following their virtuous deeds,
They are reborn once more.

As **virtuous and enlightened** (*xián dé*) sons,
They bring prosperity to their noble houses,
Their lineage endures without cessation,
And they attain **Divine Immortality** (*Shénxiān*).

**Way** speaks: The common folk do not grasp
That **having no heirs** (*wǔhòu*) is the greatest misfortune.
They fixate on the belief that
This body will perish and all **lineage** (*lù*) will be extinguished,
Yet they fail to comprehend the **Great Dao** (*Dàdào*)
And that **life-giving qi** (*shēngqì*) is boundless,
That **unbroken continuity** (*běn*) across ages is the foundation.

The **Nine Mysteries** (*Jiǔxuān*) and **Seven Ancestors** (*Qīzǔ*),
The **recent-worldly progenitors** (*jìnshì zǔkào*),
Are abandoned, their rites neglected,
Their prohibitions violated most grievously.

Some, though aged, have no descendants,
Though they often conceive,
They fail to fulfill **marriage and official duties** (*hūn yuàn*),
Or bear children who are born **foolish and dull** (*yúlù*),
Their **wisdom and spirit** (*huìlíng*) unopened.
Even if they reach adulthood,
They do not follow the **Four Occupations** (*sìyè*),
Their studies are **common and lowly** (*fán xià*),
Their travels lack purpose (*wúfāng*),
Bringing sorrow and anger to their parents.
The young and weak are plagued by sickness,
And though treated, their ailments never heal.

All these woes are the **karmic retribution** (*yāngzhù*) of their ancestors,
The **suffering invoked** (*xián hū*) by their forebears—
They must perform the rites of incense,
Recite the **Sutras** in supplication,
And pray to the **Heavenly Officials** (*Tiān sī*),
To summon **blessings and joy** (*fúqìng*).

The **fasting and recitation** (*zhāijiè*) of **Sutras** bear great merit.
For the **Heavenly Sovereign** (*Rénjūn*) above,
It brings **prosperous descendants** (*fánqīng*).
For the **myriad households** (*zhàoshù*) below,
It extends the **continuity of the family line** (*jiāmén*).
Life and death depend upon it,
And the blessings are **immeasurable** (*nánshèng*).

Thus it is said: Boundless merit,
Salvation for all **Heavenly Beings and Humans** (*Tiānrén*).

**Way** speaks: All who possess this **Sutra** (*jīng*),
And perform these **merits and virtues** (*gōngdé*) for **emperors and commoners** (*dìzhǔ*),
On the day they pray,
With **devoted resolve** (*fāxīn*) and fasting,
Burning incense and reciting the **Sutra** ten times over,
Will be **recorded by all the heavens** (*Zhūtiān jìmíng*),
Guarded by **ten thousand spirits** (*Wànshén shìwèi*),
And **distinguished by the Perfect Ones** (*Zhìrén*),
Thus attaining the **status of a Saintly Official** (*Shèngjūn*) beneath the **Golden Gate** (*Jīnquè*).

All the heavens **record merit and demerit** (*gōngguò*),
Without the slightest loss.
The **True Sovereigns** (*Zhēnzhǔ*) in the heavens
Also **commend and uphold** (*bǎojǔ*) your person—
Those who attain the **Way** shall **penetrate and clarify** (*dòngmíng*) these **profound utterances** (*zhìyán*).

The **Hidden Speech of the Great Brahman** (*Dàfàn yǐnyǔ*)
Emits **countless sounds** (*Wúliàng yīn*).

**Composed by the Dao Sovereign** (*Dàojūn*),
**The Sacred Scriptures of the Primordial Origin** (*Yuánshǐ Língshū*)
**Middle Section** (*Zhōngpiān*)
**The Eastern Eightfold Heaven** (*Dōngfāng Bātiān*)」

The **Emerald Rescript shines forth**, the **common folk learn the Dao and revive**.
The **south is joyously sealed**, in **harmony with Heaven’s Fish** (*Yú*).
The **hero’s brilliance gleams at dusk**, the **Mingling Mountains stand pure and moist**.

The **Divine Edict spreads sincerely**, and the **Great Proclamation is issued**.
**Tracing omens never falters**, seeking **eternal life’s decree**.
The **Imperial Grace is treasured**, its **celestial intent profound**.
The **Great True Dragon of the Dao** brings **blessings and abundant grace**.
**Security and auspicious schemes** are **verified and broadly established**.

The **Dao’s utterance**: These are the **Hidden Speeches of the Great Brahman** within the heavens,
**Sounds without measure**—the **ancient script** all **a yard long**.

The **Grand Marshal of Destiny**, the **High Steward of the Southern Palace**, the **Overseer of Births, Great God**,
With **cranes’ feathers and purple-pupiled sashes**, inscribed upon the **Crimson Terrace’s jade halls and golden walls**,
As the **standard sound**.

When **Great Stability brings life**, the **Dao’s qi flourishes**—
The **secret taboos’ essence**.
The **attendant jade boys and girls**, six thousand each,
**Adorned with treasure flowers**, **covered with dragon-embroidered caps**.
Those who **know this sound** and **fast while reciting it**—
All the heavens send **Flying Heavenly Kings** to observe their bodies,
**Record their merits and labors**, and **report to the heavens above**,
Ensuring **continued noble life**, **prolonged blessings**, **glory for their lineage**,
**Great merit among the celestial ranks**, **upholding the True Ones**,
**Fulfilling the Dao completely**, **wandering the Three Realms**, **ascending the Golden Gate**.

This sound **repels all**, **exorcises all**, **saves all**, **accomplishes all**—
The **natural sound of Heaven’s True Ones**.
Thus, when **recited, it summons the Flying Heavens to gaze upon**,
The **Supreme Sovereign sings afar**, the **ten thousand spirits shower blessings**,
The **Three Realms hear universally**, the **myriad deities bow in reverence**,
The **ghostly intelligences vanish of their own accord**,
The **precious chimes resound**, the **ten directions grow serene**,
The **rivers and seas fall silent**, the **mountains swallow the smoke**,
The **myriad spirits tremble in submission**,
**Assembling the celestial hosts**—**Heaven has no filth**, **Earth no demonic dust**,
**The Dark Wisdom becomes luminous**, **the Great Measure profound and profound**.

**The Supreme Treasure of Boundless Salvation, the Marvelous Scripture, Volume Forty-Two Complete**
**Volume Forty-Three Complete**

**The Chapter on Safeguarding the Womb and Protecting Life**

The **Dao** speaks: *"In the past, within the Primordial Azure Heaven,*
The **Floating Earth** sang in the **Spacious Void of the Green Fall**,
And received the **Marvelous Scripture of Boundless Salvation**—
The **Supreme Treasure** for safeguarding the womb and protecting life,
From the **Original Beginning**.*

When the **Original Beginning Heavenly Venerable** proclaimed this **sutra**,
He circled ten times, summoning the **ten directions**,
And then proceeded to His seat.

The **Heavenly True Great Deities**,
The **Highest Saints and Venerables**,
The **True Persons of Wondrous Practice**,
The **Great Deities of the Three Primordials and Six Celestial Stems**—
Safeguarding the womb and protecting life,
Countless as the sands of the **Ganges**,
Arrived step by step in the **Divine Radiance**.

Floating upon **Cloud-Carriers**, drifting in **Flowing Palanquins**,
Riding **Purple Vehicles of the Sky**, in **Emerald Chariots and Golden Cars**,
With **Rainbow Canopies** draped deep,
**Piercing Light** congealing, **Three Hues** resplendent,
Illuminating the **Void of Empty Heaven**,
For **ten days and ten nights**.

The **Precious Parks of the Ten Heavens**,
**Lush with Azure Capital Walls**,
With **Courtyards and Gateways** floating and piled,
**Palaces of myriad towers**,
**Divine Standards and Sacred Radiance**,
**Stopped Stars and Fixed Luminaries**,
**Sea Clouds presenting omens**, **Mountains and Peaks lingering in mist**,
Reaching far and vast, near and boundless,
**Cloud-Light beating in splendor**, **Celestial Grace drifting and swaying**,
Touching garments, scenting fragrance—
All attained the **High Dao**.

The **entire land of earth, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees**,
Wrapped in **endless emerald mists**,
Bathing in **still orchid breezes**,
Encircled by **gathered rosy vapors**,
The **Dao’s voice** flowing effortlessly—
**Countless Heavenly Immortals**,
Praised its rare and wondrous nature.

The **multitude of True Ones** gathered at His seat,
The **Original Beginning Heavenly Venerable**, seated in **Empty Heaven**,
Floating above the **Ten Thousand Two Hundred Heavenly Palaces**,
On the **Great Jewel Seat of the Manifested Lotus**,
Where **Myriad Dragon Chicks** display the **Bright Reeds of the Precious Pearl**.

As He proclaimed the **sutra** once more,
The **Heavenly Holy Mothers** simultaneously praised its virtues.
At that time,
The **Immortal Consorts and Divine Maidens** of the **entire land**,
Recalling past causes, saw the **source of the Dao**.
They **believed and knew** that before Heaven and Earth arose,
The **Original Qi** began to manifest,
The **Divine Essence** refined and gathered,
**Yin and Yang** established the womb,
For **ninety billion kalpas**,
The **Three Qi** merged in chaos,
Then **ninety great kalpas** passed,
And the **Three Transformations** began to separate.

The **Five Elders** safeguarded the womb,
The **Three Primordials** nurtured the soul.
The **seven orifices** opened wide,
The **Great Earth** split asunder,
**Two Principles** emerged from the womb,
And the **circular seas** were first established.

As He proclaimed the **sutra** twice more,
**Embryos and eggs**, **hair and scales**, **shells and insects**—
None were left incomplete.

As He proclaimed the **sutra** thrice more,
**Beaks chirped, mouths spoke**,
**Voices harmonized**, **tunes aligned**—
The **True Ones** resonated with Heaven’s law.

As He proclaimed the **sutra** four times more,
**Skin and hide solidified**,
**Golden Essence scattered**, **vigorous winds swirled**—
**Rigid Qi** transformed subtly.

As He proclaimed the **sutra** five times more,
The **Dao** revealed its **Heroic Marvels**,
**Talents and eloquence** flourished bright.

As He proclaimed the **sutra** six times more,
**Supreme skill** was perfected,
**Graceful movements** followed **Heaven’s Virtue**.

As He proclaimed the **sutra** seven times more,
**Nurturing infants** reached completion,
**Wisdom and compassion** permeated their bodies.

As He proclaimed the **sutra** eight times more,
**Women with child, birds and beasts with womb**,
Whether already born or yet unborn—
All obtained **birth and completion**.

As He proclaimed the **sutra** nine times more,
**Womb and viscera** emitted their **refined essence**,
**Inner treasures** took form as **dew**.

As He proclaimed the **sutra** ten times more,
The **Dao** applied its **Divine Transformation**,
And **naturally** completed the **human form**.
At that time,
All **men and women** of the **entire land**,
Without exception, **inclined their hearts**—
Safeguarding the womb and protecting life,
All attained **eternal life**.

The **Dao** speaks: *"At that time,*
When the **Original Beginning Heavenly Venerable** proclaimed the **sutra** once more,
The **Great Deity of the First Celestial Stem, Preserving the Womb and Protecting Life**,
From the **East of the Boundless Void**,
Countless as the sands of the **Ganges**,
Floated through the **Empty Sky** and arrived.*

When He proclaimed the **sutra** twice more,
The **Great Deity of the Third Celestial Stem, Preserving the Womb and Protecting Life**,
From the **South of the Boundless Void**,
Countless as the sands of the **Ganges**,
Floated through the **Empty Sky** and arrived.*

When He proclaimed the **sutra** thrice more,
The **Great Deity of the Seventh Celestial Stem, Preserving the Womb and Protecting Life**,
From the **West of the Boundless Void**,
Countless as the sands of the **Ganges**,
Floated through the **Empty Sky** and arrived.*

When He proclaimed the **sutra** four times more,
The **Great Deity of the Ninth Celestial Stem, Preserving the Womb and Protecting Life**,
From the **North of the Boundless Void**,
Countless as the sands of the **Ganges**,
Floated through the **Empty Sky** and arrived.*

When He proclaimed the **sutra** five times more,
The **Great Deity of the Tenth Celestial Stem, Preserving the Womb and Protecting Life**,
From the **Northeast of the Boundless Void**,
Countless as the sands of the **Ganges**,
Floated through the **Empty Sky** and arrived.*

When He proclaimed the **sutra** six times more,
The **Great Deity of the Second Celestial Stem, Preserving the Womb and Protecting Life**,
From the **Southeast of the Boundless Void**,
Countless as the sands of the **Ganges**,
Floated through the **Empty Sky** and arrived.*

When He proclaimed the **sutra** seven times more,
The **Great Deity of the Fourth Celestial Stem, Preserving the Womb and Protecting Life**,
From the **Southwest of the Boundless Void**,
Countless as the sands of the **Ganges**,
Floated through the **Empty Sky** and arrived.*

When He proclaimed the **sutra** eight times more,
The **Great Deity of the Eighth Celestial Stem, Preserving the Womb and Protecting Life**,
From the **Northwest of the Boundless Void**,
Countless as the sands of the **Ganges**,
Floated through the **Empty Sky** and arrived.*

When He proclaimed the **sutra** nine times more,
The **Great Deity of the Fifth Celestial Stem, Preserving the Womb and Protecting Life**,
From the **Upper Boundless Void**,
Countless as the sands of the **Ganges**,
Floated through the **Empty Sky** and arrived.*

When He proclaimed the **sutra** ten times more,
The **Great Deity of the Sixth Celestial Stem, Preserving the Womb and Protecting Life**,
From the **Lower Boundless Void**,
Countless as the sands of the **Ganges**,
Floated through the **Empty Sky** and arrived.*

As the **ten times** completed,
The **Great Deities of the Boundless Void** from the **ten directions**,
All arrived simultaneously,
And the **entire land’s men and women**,
Inclined their hearts in **reverent devotion**.

Their arrival was like **dust rising in gusts**,
**Stars scattered in mist**—
Countless as the sands of the **Ganges**,
Filling the **entire land**,
Shaking the **nine earths**—
None could restrain them.

Thus, the **Original Beginning** raised His body and emitted light,
Piercingly illuminating the **ten directions** above and below.
After a long while, He withdrew the light,
And emerged from the **Precious Light Cloud-Leaves**,
Manifesting the **Great Compassionate Jade Form** of the **Original Beginning Heavenly Venerable**,
Golden in countenance, radiant in splendor—
From His brow, a **Precious Pearl** emerged.

This **Pearl** was subtle and wondrous,
Its light extending a **league**,
Within it, the **Void Palace of the Empty Sovereign**,
The **Precious Platform of Heavenly Spirits**,
Countless **Heavenly and Human Beings**,
Moving, dwelling, resting, or residing,
Riding **Luan and He**,
Speaking, gazing, and smiling—
All appeared simultaneously,
With **water and fire** intermingling,
**Mountains, rivers, palaces, and halls**,
Compact as a **circular inch** yet vast enough.

The **Original Beginning** having appeared,
The **Supreme True One of Great Unity and Boundless Stillness**,
Immediately divided His **transformed body**,
And **countless beings** were drawn in—
The **Heavenly True Great Deities**,
The **Highest Saints and Venerables**,
The **True Persons of Wondrous Practice**,
The **Great Deities of the Ten Directions’ Boundless Void**—
Safeguarding the womb and protecting life,
Countless as the sands of the **Ganges**,
All entered the **Original Beginning’s Pearl-Light**.

The **Heavenly and Human Beings** looked upward,
And saw only **gentle movements** within the **Pearl’s shadow**.
Once they entered the **Pearl’s shadow**,
They vanished—**nowhere to be found**.
The **people of the land** dispersed,
And the **earth returned to its void**—
No longer crowded or dense.

The **Original Beginning** then,
Within the **wondrous light of the Divine Pearl**,
Completed the **sutra** in full.
The **multitude of True Ones**,
Witnessing the **transmission**,
Conferred it upon **me**."*

At this time,
Joy and celebration were indescribable.
The **ritual observances** were fully known,
And the **celestial beings** resumed their stations—
In an instant, all was silent, no trace remaining.

Then, when the **Heavenly and Human Beings** encountered the **sutra’s teachings**,
All received deliverance and salvation,
Safeguarding the womb and protecting life,
None perished or were harmed.
All bowed in reverence to the heavens,
And all cultivated **virtue** with good intent.

They were neither reckless nor confused,
Nor deceitful nor greedy,
Nor unfaithful nor contrary,
Nor thoughtless nor ashamed,
Nor constrained nor withdrawn.

Their words aligned with the **Dao/Way** of Heaven**,
Their speech held no discord—
In harmony with **compassionate love**,
Yet distinct in essence, they became one.

The land was secure, its people prosperous,
Rejoicing in eternal peace,
As the **Original Beginning** emerged to teach,
And the realm was governed by the **Dao/Way**.

Those with sincere devotion,
Revered and followed with ritual respect,
All attained the power to save the world.

The **Dao/Way** speaks:
All that was uttered within the **sutra** by the **Original Beginning, Heavenly Venerable**,
Are the **inner names** of the **celestial deities** who safeguard the womb and protect life.
They are the **hidden names** of the **Six Celestial Stems** within the **Three Primordial Elements**,
The **secret names** of the hundred spirits—
Not the common words of this world.

The **Highest Saints** have already become **True Persons**,
Mastering the **mysterious** and probing the **subtle**,
Able to discern its chapters fully.
When recited ten times,
The **celestial beings** respond from afar,
And the **Ten Thousand Deities** prepare their rites.
All beings, from heaven to earth,
With their **embryonic essence** and **womb of life**,
None fail to grow and flourish.

Its **hidden meanings** precede the **Dao/Way**,
Its depths grasp the **Original Mysteries**—
From the vastness of heaven and earth,
To the minutest of creatures,
None escape its profound influence over the **embryonic essence** and **True Life**,
Receiving the **True Qi** of the **Dao/Way**,
Condensing **vital essence** and **blood**,
Then transforming into form.

All **saints and sages**,
Celestial beings, **High Deities**, and **Venerables**,
None emerged without nurturing from the **embryonic roots**.

Thus, safeguarding the womb and protecting life,
Reciting the **sutra** to summon the **deities**,
Easily shifts **yin-yang**,
And brings blessings to the birth of mortals.

Those who study the **Greatest Teachings**,
When they recite ten times,
Then the **Holy Mother** descends to the chamber,
The **Divine Marshal** attends the **carriage**,
The **Divine Record-Keeper** fixes the destiny,
The **Five Emperors** extend their favor,
All beings take form,
Safeguarding the womb and protecting life,
Their **virtue and longevity** shining bright.

This is why:
Scholars who chant the **inner incantations** and **hidden names**,
And recite the **True Sutras** aloud,
Summoning the **Ten Directions**,
Share in the glory of the **Dao/Way**,
Subduing the **Earth Spirits**,
Binding the **demonic forces**,
Not only averting death,
But also attaining **transcendence** and **immortality**.

It is said that one may invoke the **Three Primordial Elements** and **Six Celestial Stems** of the **Ten Directions**,
Commanding them to guard the **embryonic essence** within one’s own life and womb,
The **One Hundred Truths** and **Ten Thousand Nodes**,
And the **Red Sovereign** obeys the summons,
Enabling the child to become **immortal**.

Not only for the calamity of a **full-term female womb**,
But also for those who study the **Dao/Way** and refine the **True Essence**,
Recitation is not forbidden.

Lightly reciting this chapter brings misfortune to oneself.
With **reverent offerings** and **proper rites**,
Households flourish and prosper.
Generation after generation, they thrive in abundance,
Bound by **auspicious causes**,
Free from all calamities,
The **Divine and Spirits** guarding their gates.

This **sutra** is supremely **venerable and wondrous**,
Unmatched in the **Celestial Capital of Jade**,
Its power to deliver beings is boundless—
It stands as the **root of all Ten Thousand Dao/Way**.

Its **grand framework** is vast,
Its **virtue/power** is immeasurable.

The **Dao/Way** speaks:
For all who recite this **sutra** ten times,
The **celestial beings**, **Three Primordial Elements**, **Six Celestial Stems**, and **Nine Palaces** of the **deities** who safeguard the womb and protect life,
Descend in response,
Severing the **Six Heavenly Regions’ malevolent spirits**,
And the **departed souls** of past ages.

For those who harm the **embryonic essence** and **life-womb** of all beings,
Causing the **True Qi** to disperse,
And the **divine radiance** to fade,
Preventing conception and birth,
Making progeny impossible—
Their **Qi** flows on, connecting through generations,
Swiftly consigning them to the **Northern Capital**,
Where their **demonic forms** are slain.

Examining the **records of destiny**,
Good and evil are swiftly distinguished.
Those who receive the **Dao/Way** are born in harmony,
And become **noble ones**.

Those who love this **sutra** of the **Greatest Teachings**,
When their **virtue/power** is complete,
Recognize the **embryonic essence** themselves,
All attain **transcendence and immortality**,
Ascending to the **Golden Gates**,
And feasting in the **Celestial Capital of Jade**.

Scholars of the **highest learning**,
Practicing and reciting this **sutra**,
Are immediately granted deliverance,
Their **True Spirits** ascending naturally,
Entering and exiting the **womb palaces**.

Women who receive its recitation,
Attain safeguarding of the womb and protection of life,
Their children born under **celestial favor**,
The **embryonic essence** transformed into a **precious infant**,
On the day of birth,
The **womb deities** guard their lives,
None harmed.

Men who are **naturally virtuous**,
Their blessings and **Dao/Way** flourish,
Celebration and fortune arise together,
Extending their years and **longevity**,
Later attaining the **Dao/Way of the Emptied Corpse**—
Their **soul-spirits** temporarily extinguished,
Not subject to birth and death,
Immediately returning to their **embodied form**,
And wandering in the **Great Void**.

This **sutra** is **subtle and wondrous**,
Its deliverance boundless and endless.
All **Heavenly and Human Beings** rejoice in its blessings.
Its countless mercies benefit the world.

It is a treasure of the **Heavenly Lords**,
Not transmitted to the lower realms.
Those of **highest virtue** who carry **golden treasures** and offer them with sincere hearts,
Swear by heaven and are granted its transmission.

If one **leaks or scorns** it lightly,
Misfortune befalls the **Nine Ancestors**,
And eternal servitude in the **demonic offices**.

The **Jade Boys and Jade Girls** who safeguard the womb and protect life,
Thirty-two each,
Guard and attend the **divine texts**,
Protecting those who receive this **sutra**.

The **Dao/Way** speaks:
In the **first month**, during **long fasting**,
Recite and chant this **sutra**,
Swiftly summoning the **Six Celestial Stems of the Upper Primordial Element**,
To safeguard the womb and protect life,
Severing the **departed souls** of past ages,
Invoking one’s descendants,
Their disputes decided in the **Heavenly Office**,
Causing the womb to fail,
Conception to end in barrenness,
And **demonic forces** to afflict the **orphaned**.

In the **seventh month**, during **long fasting**,
Recite and chant this **sutra**,
Swiftly summoning the **Six Celestial Stems of the Middle Primordial Element**,
To safeguard the womb and protect life,
Severing **curses, hexes, and spells**,
And **malevolent influences** upon males and females,
Their disputes decided in the **Earthly Office**,
Causing the womb to fail,
Conception to end in barrenness,
And **demonic forces** to mark their names.

In the **tenth month**, during **long fasting**,
Recite and chant this **sutra**,
Swiftly summoning the **Six Celestial Stems of the Lower Primordial Element**,
To safeguard the womb and protect life,
Severing **grave disputes** and **moisture afflictions**,
And the **ancestral ties** that drag one down,
Where **demons feed on the womb’s essence**,
Their disputes decided in the **Watery Office**,
Causing the womb to fail,
Conception to end in barrenness,
And **black talismans** to seal their fate.

On the **Eight Festive Days**,
Recite and chant this **sutra**,
Guarding all beings’ **life-wombs**,
Ensuring none are harmed,
The **Eight Directions’ womb deities**,
Each leading their **divine retinue**,
Entering the **Nine Palaces**,
The **True Sovereign of the Great Unity**,
Extending life and safeguarding the womb,
Guarding the **life roots** and **command essence**.

For all who recite this **sutra**,
It extends to all living beings,
Not only to the female body,
But also to cultivate the **Dao/Way’s causes**,
As the **Heavenly Emperors** descend to observe,
And one becomes a **True Person of the Nine Palaces**.

On the day of one’s **original destiny**,
Recite and chant this **sutra**,
Swiftly summoning the **womb deities**,
To hear and receive the **True Sutras**,
The **Three Lords of the Bright Hall**,
Guarding the **womb’s essence**,
The **soul-spirits** clarified and rectified,
The **Ten Thousand Qi** enduring,
Not experiencing suffering,
Their bodies radiant,
Guarded by the **Three Realms**,
The **Five Emperors** overseeing their welcome,
All **spirits** paying homage,
Their names inscribed in heaven,
Their **virtue/power** complete—
Ascending to the **Upper Purity**.

The **Dao/Way** speaks: On the day of practice, one must bathe in fragrant waters, fast, and enter the chamber in purity. Facing southeast, strike the teeth thirty-two times, ascending to hear the **Thirty-two Heavens**. Bow in the heart thirty-two times, close the eyes, and quietly contemplate sitting within the three-colored clouds—**Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Tortoise, Lion, and White Crane**—arrayed on either side. The sun and moon illuminate the chamber, radiant and resplendent within. A round symbol forms at the nape, its light shining across the ten directions—so clear and distinct.

The secret incantation:
*"Supreme Mystic Origin,
Greatest Dao/Way Lord."*

Summon forth from within my body the **Three Five Functionaries**, the left and right officials and messengers, the **Jade Boys** attendants, the **Jade Girls** heralds, the **Five Emperors’ Direct Symbols**, and the **Direct-Day Incense Officials**—thirty-six each—opening the way as spoken.

Today is a day of joyous celebration, a pure hall of fasting, practicing this most sacred **sutra**, saving countless beings.

May what is invoked ascend directly before the **Supreme Sovereign of the Thirty-two Heavens, the Original Beginning Emperor**.

Then, drawing the **qi** thirty-two times, face east and recite the **sutra**.

**Original Beginning’s Supreme Sutra of Infinite Salvation, First Rank of Marvel**

**Original Beginning’s Mystic Treasure Scripture of the Cavernous Depths**—
Preserving the womb, safeguarding life,
Salvaging the ten directions.

Hidden roots and harmonious transformations occur naturally.
Before the **Great Void** divided, the **Great Dao/Way** lay concealed.
Sudden changes gave rise to **spirit-mind**—
**God** as the essence of things, the **Chaos** thus formed.
Above and below intertwined, the two **symbols** rising in mist.
With **white entering red**, yin and yang align.
With **red entering black**, the **fetal sac** congeals.
Within it holds the **Great Emptiness**, its light illuminating the **Three Purities**.
The **Divine Chamber** stands majestic, nameless from the beginning.
There is the **Jade Infant**, entering **Darkness** and emerging in **Azure**.
Above, no ancestral return—only the **Dao/Way** as body.
The **Purple Sac** unfurls its stem, its true form luminous.
The **Mixed Primordium** sheds its shell, birthing **spirit-souls**.
The **Two Principles** merge in harmony, indistinct and boundless.
Within the **Darkness**, the **Most True Spirit**—
No spirit without light, no spirit without clarity,
No spirit without foundation, no spirit without completion,
No spirit without salvation, no spirit without birth.
This is the **Great Brahman**, the **womb within the womb**.

A mountain of jade spanning **a hundred kalpas**, its seven treasures towering.
The **Nine Palaces, Ten Gates**, myriad gates beyond count—
All from the **Dao/Way’s womb**, transforming **spirit-mind** into form.
Reaching **humanity and things**, the **Three Splendors** of marvelous courts.
The **Purple Pavilion, Vermilion Hall**, their womb-light resplendent.
Subtle and profound, the **fetal essence** lies dormant.
The **Divine Wind** swirls, encircling the ten directions.
Within are:
- The **Chu-Huo Lord** who preserves the womb,
- The **Huo-Tu Spirit** of transformation,
- The **Lord Bo-Hua** who oversees males,
- The **Great Mystic Spirit** who monitors birth,
- The **True One of the Courtyard**, **Wei-Fang**—
  Men invoke **Meng-Fei**, women invoke **Zi-Yi**.

Before the **Dark Sac** opens, the two spirits depend as one.
The **ghosts of fetal blood**, hearing the name, are severed and crushed.
Daring not to intrude, they return to the **Dao/Way’s eternal path**.
The **Heavenly Longevity blessing**, the **Mystic Teacher** who guards life.
In **Dragon-text robes, Tiger-clad**, the **Five Battles** of gold and fire.
Swiftly summoning the **Three Officials**, the **Supreme Ultimate’s Master**.
Grasping the bell, they roar—**wind and thunder** resound.
Escorting the **Womb Palace**, mist drifts softly.
The **Five Emperors’ Great Demons**, the **Eight Powers** of metal and flame.
Preserving the womb, attaining truth—
Noble duty shines brightly.
Removing calamities, crossing hardships—
Without thought, without action.

Today, the scriptures are compiled, all heavens gather at the hall.
The **East’s Infinite Preserver of the Womb, Birth-Dao God-King**, **Long-Living Great Sage**, Infinite Savior.
The **South’s Infinite Preserver of the Womb, Virtue-Dao God-King**, **Long-Living Great Sage**, Infinite Savior.
The **West’s Infinite Upholder of the Womb, Noble God-King**, **Long-Living Great Sage**, Infinite Savior.
The **North’s Infinite Guardian of the Womb, True God-King**, **Long-Living Great Sage**, Infinite Savior.
The **Northeast’s Infinite Preserver of the Womb, Benevolent God-King**, **Long-Living Great Sage**, Infinite Savior.
The **Southeast’s Infinite Protector of Life, Manifesting God-King**, **Long-Living Great Sage**, Infinite Savior.
The **Southwest’s Infinite Protector of Life, Spirit God-King**, **Long-Living Great Sage**, Infinite Savior.
The **Northwest’s Infinite Protector of Life, Hunger-Defying God-King**, **Long-Living Great Sage**, Infinite Savior.
The **Upper Infinite Protector of Life, Death-Cutting God-King**, **Long-Living Great Sage**, Infinite Savior.
The **Lower Infinite Protector of Life, Broad-Wisdom God-King**, **Long-Living Great Sage**, Infinite Savior.
The **Ten-Directional Most True Preserver of the Womb, Life-Guarding God-King**, **Long-Living, World-Saving Infinite Great God**.

Together they ride the **Purple Cloud’s Auspicious Light**, the **Auspicious Beast of Azure**, the **Jade Palace’s Jade Carriage**, with **Seven Spirits** on the left and **Nine Absolutes** on the right. The **Great Bird** folds its wings, the **Qilin Dragon** bears the yoke, bearing the **Preserver’s Banner**, the **Life-Guarding Flag**. Before them, the **Eight Stops** chant in harmony; behind, the **Nine Notes** resound together. The **Xin-Hou Dance** unfurls, their **whistled songs** rise—**Five Elders** clear the path, the **Three Elements** speak in order. Ten thousand chariots, ten thousand riders, floating through the sky.

**Heaven’s noble birth-Dao**, life’s womb takes precedence.
The **Supreme Sovereign** personally inspects, the **Great Ultimate** awaits the incense.
The **True Command Spirit** oversees the **Birth Hall**, guiding life’s passage.
The **Nine-Heaven Holy Mother** rides the **Green Palanquin**.
The **Heavenly Queen Consort** is attended by the **Mystic Tiger**.
Preserving the womb, guarding life—
All appear before the Emperor.
As each is to be saved, the heavens convene in solemn review.
Proclaiming to the **Three Realms**, the **Infinite Spirit-Lands**,
The **Hall of Prolonged Life**, the **Three Enclosures of the Supreme One**.
The **Twelve Womb Spirits** disperse **qi** and bestow years.
They summon the **Heavenly True Ones**, the **Crimson Pupil, Purple Abyss**.
The **Yellow Court’s Breath** mingles, sweeping the **Yellow Springs’ Source**.
If there be lingering **old qi**, ancestral and transmitted,
Blocking the **Dao/Way’s birth**, rupturing the womb, causing injury,
Disrupting lineage, bringing harm and calamity—
Sever the **hosted influences**, extinguish the **root of misfortune**.
They may not be detained, nor forced into the **ghostly ranks**.

The **Original Beginning’s Symbol-Command**—
At the appointed hour, ascend.

The **Five Paths** are cut and severed, their omens ill.
To nurture the womb and guard the infant—
**Body** and **Spirit** are shielded, **Form** and **Soul** held.

The **Magical Court** is summoned for protection,
The **Jade Palace** guards the living.
From **Noble Descent** to **Human Transformation**—
**Celestial Birth** receives **Dao/Way’s Grace**,
Enduring through **aeons uncounted**, in endless rotation.
With the **aeon’s wheel**, they turn as one,
And **Heaven’s span** matches their years.

Yet **Great Dao’s** calamities arise,
The **Eight Difficulties in the Womb**,
To transcend the **Three Primordial Cycles**.
When **Dao/Way’s** rites are complete,
They ascend to **Loose and Easy’s** **Upper Purity**.

The **Upper Purity’s** Heaven—
**Northern Azure’s** **Primordial Platform**—
**Master of the World** and **Dao/Way’s Birth**,
Each with their **Celestial Seed**.
The **Heavenly Sovereign’s** **Jade Purity**,
In the **Formless Realm**, the **Dharma’s** **Path**.

The **Eight Heavens of the East**—
These **Thirty-Two Heavens**,
Specializing in womb-guarding, life-nurturing, and soul-protection,
And all **earthly-born** beings under their dominion—
None escape their sway.

Their **womb-qi** moves from **Chenji’s** **Pole** below,
Through **Northern Dipper’s** **Mysterious Dark Star**,
Into the **Three Platforms**.
The **Three Platforms’** **Six Stars**,
Oversee the **nourishment of myriad things**,
And guard the **wombs of all living**.

Descending leftward, they spiral through **Room Host’s** **Thirteen Degrees**,
**Female Host’s** **Seventeen Degrees**,
To the **Precious Ox’s** **Jade Palace**—
There they rest.

When **womb-qi** reaches one’s **natal hour**,
Or the **hosts of birth and womb**,
Then women conceive,
And the womb releases the child—
Thus they are called **Children’s Hosts**.

The **Precious Ox**—
Its name taken for **receiving and birthing**,
Also the **symbol of the womb**.

Only **Celestial Beings** transform without form,
Dwelling in **Formless Wombs**—
From **Celestial Beings** to **Human Ghosts** and **Dragon Demons**,
All transform with **formed wombs**.

These Heavens border the **Eighteen Heavens of the Desire Realm**,
Each with their **Celestial Sovereigns** and **Officials** governing them.
When mortals pray for **noble birth**,
They descend with **auspicious qi**,
Creating the **Chamber of Safe Conception** for men.

**Womb-guarding and transformation**—
Their **qi** connects with **Jade Purity**.
All trace to **Original Beginning**,
Sowing **Celestial Seeds**, transferring **Spirits**.

In **boundless mysteries**, profound beyond measure,
They scatter **womb-essences**,
And universally **deliver Heavenly Beings**.

Today, rejoicing in **Dao/Way’s Grace** received,
Passing through **Heaven’s** **Eight Gates**,
I beseech the **extinguishing of womb-seeds**,
And the **transmission of inauspicious influences**—
**Feasting on filth** and **malevolent ghosts**,
**Black-Toothed Lady**, **Yellow Maiden Spring**,
**White Calamity Day-Patrol**, **Devouring Wombs**,
**Killing Children**—
**Western Palace’s** ghosts, **Green Serpents**, **Heavenly Dogs**,
**White Tigers**, **Flowered Sources**,
**Old Men**, **Young Women**,
**Slandering and harming womb-essences**,
**Crying infants**—
Only bearing deep grievances,
Unknowing of **womb-harm**,
Thus their **qi** interlinks.

**Divine Kings** oversee **birth’s rites**,
Unconstrained by mortal pleas.
**Eastern Dipper** spreads **destinies**,
**Western Dipper** fixes **names**,
**Northern Dipper** binds **wombs**,
**Southern Dipper** dispatches **souls**,

**Three Realms’** **Five Sovereigns**,
Their words arrayed in **Upper Purity’s** **Heaven**.

**Jade Springs Unruffled, Dragon Pools Sacred**
Faint the *dharma-qi* breathes,
Dao’s embryonic forms arrayed in pairs.
Conceiving the Chaos, subduing great demons—
Within Chaos, neither hue above nor abyss below.
Wind and water yield to void,
Purple embryo’s cavern vast and clear.

Divine presence responds in resonance,
Qi primordial, preheaven’s foundation.
Heaven above, earth below—
No depths nor shadows, no form nor trace,
No limit, no end.
Boundless Great *Brahman* stretches, luminous yet void.
Dao’s birth illuminates, saving myriad thousands.
Primordial Origin steadies, establishing all heavens.
Human *qi* ascends to mystic purity,
Fetal deity internally linked.
Wondrous *qi* forms scripture—
Cloud-chapters, jade-volumes.
Three Primordial treasures inscribed,
Phoenix-tracks, dragon-texts.
Preserving fetal wombs, life’s eternal course.
Great *Brahman* pervades—
Ten thousand embryos unfold.
Star-light flows through—
Thirty-two heavens wheeling, colorless, encircling the ten quarters.
Rotating maidens traverse halls,
Circulating degrees through the Three Platforms.
Thirty-five divisions,
Total *qi* ascending to Primordial.
Eight visions merge in obscurity,
Qi entering the birth-source.
Within the Primordial—
Empress of Highest Sovereignty, Supreme True One of Heaven.
Riding the Pure Harmony, chanting cavernous hymns.
Recording life’s destiny,
Holy Mother strides the cosmic cords.
Severing fetal karmic bonds,
Dispelling birth-calamities.
Timing auspicious, months of virtue—
Three Primordials all benign.
After birth’s joyous triumph,
Longevity harmonizes with prosperity.
Ten thousand concord, myriad unity—
Dao’s transformation manifests the body.
Body born from womb,
Within the womb, the True One resides.
Emperor, sole sovereign,
Commander of Life, womb’s guardian.
Palaces partitioned—
Left True One of Heaven.
Womb-Guarding Deity, Right True One of Heaven.
Womb-Guarding Deity—
Mud-Mound Great God.
Guarding the fetal gate,
Jade Maiden enters and exits,
Clutching fire, grasping bells—
Jade Emperor presides above.
Red Infant dwells within the heart,
Yellow Court’s Master.
Guarding the Imperial Threshold,
United with Heaven.
Hundred sons, thousand descendants—
Severing decay, bloodstains scattered,
None dare defy the womb.
Ensuring the infant’s tranquil rest,
Ascending to Jade Purity.
Breathing the Hall of Flowers,
Green Chamber’s divine window.
Within the subtle—
Life preserved, soul at ease.
Jade Palace’s Hall of Light,
Golden Gate of Kunlun.
Life-*qi* nurtures the womb,
Virtue and Dao in perfect purity.
Nine circuits of ten months,
Ten thousand *qi* ascend to immortality.

Infinite salvation granted.
Opening mortal gates,
Flying Heavenly Sovereign.
Flickering yet ever-present,
Transformations boundless.
Guarding fetal life,
Three Visions shine as one.
Sin and merit’s prohibitions,
Karmic causes and effects.
Universal reception, soul’s descent into form.
Form receives birth,
Heard by all heavens above.
Above all heavens,
Each has gates of birth.
Within—
Hollow hymns of fetal protection,
Sacred verses, words attuned to High Truths.

---
**First Heavenly Primordial: Womb-Guarding Great God, Life-Protecting True Sovereign**
*(Overseer of a Lifetime’s Sound, born in the first of the six *jia* stems)*
Dao has its spirit,
Earth’s shadow, Heaven’s soul.
Sun and moon align,
Conceiving life’s transformation.
Left jade pendant flies,
Right golden tassel revolves.
Essence circulates ninefold,
Light radiates eightfold.
Infant’s subtlety—
Room and Weaver constellations.
Divine Maiden in brocade,
Jewel-trimmed robes.
Entering the fetal palace,
Three Primordials rejoice.
Guiding the True Child,
Natural union and separation.
Warding off ten thousand calamities,
No step toward peril.
Praying for sons—dukes and marquises,
Praying for daughters—consorts and concubines.
Stabilizing fortune’s course,
Heaven’s True One eternally secure.

---
**Second Earthly Primordial: Womb-Guarding Great God, Life-Protecting True Sovereign**
*(Overseer of Birth’s Chapter, born in the second of the six *jia* stems)*
Yellow banners wave through void,
Purple-white halls gleam.
Womb intact, child born—
Heaven’s blessings descend.
I come from the east,
Soaring through verdant clouds.
Riding the long rainbow,
Touching stars and constellations.
Jade horses, golden winds,
Descending to the True Court.
White Maiden, crimson boy,
Tilted light, descending chariot.
Emerald six dragons,
Heavenly humans.
Bowing to the High Lord,
Womb-Guarding Deity of the Three Primordials,
Firming the soul-root in the Nine Layers.
Purple Sovereign, Great One,
Ten thousand heavens in harmony,
Seated, summoning a thousand spirits,
Severing calamities’ roots.
Hurling fire across ten thousand leagues,
Transforming clarity, drinking wind—
**Stabilizing the fetal birth,**
Virtue and Dao endless.
Morning mists exhale light,
Piercing the dark vault.

---
**Third Watery Primordial: Womb-Guarding Great God, Life-Protecting True Sovereign**
*(Overseer of Birth’s Song, born in the third of the six *jia* stems)*
Yin-embryo, yang-womb,
All life depends.
One *qi* revolves together,
The Three Realms thereby exist.
I grasp the jade *li* vessel,
Coming to pour the vast ritual.
Holy Consort’s jade visage,
Luster radiant, untrammeled.
Purple *qi* at the threshold,
Fetal chamber secure.
Summoning the Nine Heavens,
Multicolored canopies swirl.
Six *Ding* strike the zither,
Three Primordials scoop the smoke.
Guarding this birth-chamber,
Sun and moon align in years.
Divine Lord slaughters and beheads,
Northern Emperor’s decree.
Heavenly armies encircle,
Immortal Sovereigns press forward.
Burning incense, kneeling in reverence,
Records inscribed without bias.
Meritorious deeds naturally arise,
Assisting the Mystic Origin.

---
**These three Primordial hymns of the six *jia* palaces—**
**Natural songs of womb-guarding, life-protection,**
**Words attuned to cavernous chapters.**
Reciting a hundred times,
Silently guarding the fetal palace.
Reciting a thousand times,
A hundred spirits welcome in protection.
Ten thousand recitations—
Dao complete, fetal transformation into immortal form,
Surpassing the Three Primordials,
Life-Protecting Kings.
Hearing sacred sounds,
Six *jia* stems support and uphold,
Commanding earthly spirits,
Sleep undisturbed, no fright.
Extracted from earthly prisons,
No untimely death, no injury,
Five sufferings, eight hardships—
Birth and proliferation flourish,
Forever free from calamity and deceit,
Soul and spirit harmonized,
Uniting with Dao, eternal life.

This is called **infinite salvation, boundless deliverance.**
There are **secret celestial texts**,
All heavens hold in reverence—
Revealing them brings fall into hell,
Disaster to seven generations.
**Dao says:**
These cavernous hymns are the words of the Three Primordial Emperors,
Six *jia* Divine Kings’ hidden sounds—
All are Great *Brahman*’s speech,
Not the common phrases of the world.
Words lack melodic grace,
Tunes lack ornate beauty.
Thus called **profound and obscure,**
Difficult to trace.
Treasured by Heaven above,
Secreted in the Three Platforms’ Upper Palace of Mystic Capital,
According to the Mystic Science—
Transmitted once every six million *kalpas*.

「Should there be an adept bearing a golden, flawless heart,
In accordance with ancient rites, he pledges to the Ten Heavens,
Then the matter is entrusted to him.

**Dao says:**
When the *yin* of the Lower Primordial’s womanly form carries a fetus,
And she incurs the Five Injuries or *yang* assaults,
Or suffers from celestial calamities and malevolent influences,
Retaliating against her life—
At the time of her descent,
She becomes a restless soul of past generations,
A tormented spirit without Dao,
Obstructing and transferring misfortune,
Unable to take birth,
Facing the Heavenly Executioner’s great slaughter,
Manifesting as all manner of demons and bandits.

All who suffer such calamities
Must then purify their heart and observe fasts,
Burn incense at the six times,
Recite the *sutra* ten times in rotation,
And virtue shall swiftly descend,
Dispelling all ill omens.

The **infinite salvation, boundless deliverance** texts—
**Dao says:**
When the *qi* in the womb weakens,
And no blessings attend her birth,
She often falls into ruin,
Her vitality withered, unprosperous,
Her ancestors summoning her in vain,
Her descendants severed from lineage,
Her mother and child both afflicted,
By the Three Orphans and Nine Illnesses,
Or by poisoned suckling,
With disasters and misfortunes ever in attendance—
If a true adept serves her,
Burning incense and reciting the *sutra* ten times in rotation,
Guarding the womb, shielding the life, and overseeing the birth,
And presents his plea to the Southern Palace of Heaven,
To add to her celestial record,
He shall fully protect her living form.

In accordance with her Daoic merit,
And the measure of her blessings or calamities,
She shall attain wealth, longevity, or transcendence.

**Dao says:**
There are ghosts that harm the womb,
Who petition the Three Officials,
Stealing her years and fortune,
Extinguishing her life’s vitality,
Causing the fetus to suffer afflictions,
And the child to fail in nourishment—
All such deeds are wrought by ghosts and deities.

There are also virtuous souls who suffer unjust harm,
Leaving them childless, unable to continue their lineage,
Their households in decline.

One may swiftly recite this *sutra*,
And pray to the Star of the Womb,
To safeguard the foundation of her life and birth.

Or if she lacks virtue in past lives,
And her ghostly debt provokes anger,
Heaven punishes her womb,
And she cannot bear her child in peace—
She must quickly amend her ways,
Purify her heart, and repent,
To avert this calamity.

The ghosts that harm the womb have nine names:
The ghost devouring the two-month womb is called **Huángqiú** (黄球),
The ghost devouring the three-month womb is called **Lìshēng** (厉生),
The ghost devouring the four-month womb is called **Zhào Fēi** (兆非),
The ghost devouring the five-month womb is called **Lù Qí** (陆蜞),
The ghost devouring the six-month womb is called **Xuěshī** (血尸),
The ghost devouring the seven-month womb is called **Qióngqí** (穷奇),
The ghost devouring the eight-month womb is called **Huǒqí** (火期),
The ghost devouring the nine-month womb is called **Lóngméi** (龙眉),
The ghost devouring the ten-month womb is called **Chìxī** (赤奚).

Knowing their names,
Burning incense and chanting them,
Shall forever preserve her safety.

Life and death depend upon it—
Her blessings shall be immeasurable.»

The Dao speaks thus: *"Limitless, universal salvation for all beings.*

*All who possess this scripture shall, for future generations of men and women, safeguard the womb and preserve life. On days of calamity, if one devotes oneself to fasting, offering incense, and reciting this sutra ten times, all celestial beings shall record their name, and ten thousand spirits shall stand guard.

*Those who study the Dao and recite this scripture shall have their fetal spirits aligned and virtuous, the Three Palaces radiant, attaining longevity and true essence. The sacred womb shall form within, and not only women may practice this—even the most refined sages may thereby become holy ministers of the Golden Gate, serving the Sage-King.

*The celestial beings record human deeds and misdeeds without omission. The Three Primordial Fetal Immortals and the Six Celestial Deities of the Hexagram shall also champion your fate. Only those who attain the Dao shall truly comprehend these profound words.*

*The Celestial Great Brahman’s hidden speech, the Limitless Sound,
The Dao Lord composed the *Elemental Scripture for Preserving the Womb and Safeguarding Life*.
**The Eight Celestial Deities of the East:**

*The Dao speaks: These are the celestial sounds of the Celestial Grandfathers, the Three Primordial Stars, and the Elemental Generators—sacred radiance forming patterns, deployed across the Thirty-Two Heavens to bestow life, determine fate, and cultivate the human seed. Their splendor is resplendent, their luster contained within the Jade Celestial Expanse. The Heavenly True Man modeled these as the true sounds.

*Those who know these sounds and, through fasting, recite them shall have the celestial beings dispatch flying celestial kings to observe their bodies, preserving the womb and safeguarding life. They shall report to the heavens, and ten thousand spirits shall pay homage. The Earthly Deities shall attend at the gates, the Great Merit Immortals shall champion them to the Upper Immortals, and the Supreme Ones shall descend to let them traverse the Three Realms, ascending to the Golden Gate.

*This sound repels all calamities, exorcises all misfortunes, saves all beings, and fulfills all aspirations. It is the natural sound of the Heavenly True.

*Thus, when recited, the flying celestial beings descend to observe, the Supreme Sovereign sings afar, ten thousand spirits pay homage, the Three Realms attend at the hall, all deities bow their heads, ghostly spirits vanish of their own accord, the fetal essence shines brightly, the Three Palaces are purified, the Celestial Canopy revolves in azure, the Earthly Pivot gleams in darkness, the mountains stand firm and the seas clear, the sun and moon shine resplendent. The sacred sound’s subtle resonance brings all immortals to rejoice as guests, the Four Seasons feast in stillness, the Dao’s scene congeals in emptiness—this is the boundless, profound virtue.*

*End of the Forty-Third Volume of the Supreme Treasure Limitless Scripture for Salvation, Supreme Grade, Marvelous Scripture.
Begin the Forty-Fourth Volume.*

**The Chapter on the Cavern Spirit’s Disaster-Averting Merit**

The Dao speaks: In days of yore, within the Taiji Heaven, the Green Flower Preserved the Great True Land of Bright Soil, receiving the *Lingbao* Scripture’s *Dongshen* Disaster-Averting Merit of Boundless Upper Grade. The Great Dao Lord of the Cavern Spirit of Fuxiang was commissioned to expound this scripture, circling ten times to summon all true immortals of the ten directions’ Fuxiang worlds.

To the east of Taiji, ninety million *li* distant, within the Azure Sea, there lies a great mountain, its roots entwined with the Cavernous Abyss, its golden sands piled high, piercing the Lower Primordial and ascending to the Great Void. Its realm of violet space connects to Taiji in the west, the Flaming Ridge in the south, and the Gloomy Gate in the north, while its center opens to the Mystic Metropolis. This world spans over ten thousand *li*, its divine peaks and towering ridges alternately emerging and vanishing in the Stygian Waves. The floating lotus radiates sacred light, and the qi of the Azure Mists hovers thickly above. The city is of green jade, the palace of emerald groves, the earth congealed in indigo brilliance, arching to nurture the Fuxiang. Its roots coil at the Eastern Extremity, its branches stretching toward one another, their verdant glow illuminating the thousand-petaled tree, where natural celestial patterns emerge—imperial true writings in crimson, the Nine Qi Phoenix script—thus subduing the ten directions’ celestial hosts.

The sun and moon descend from below, their yang essence spontaneously moving. Through the six hours of day and night, the Celestial River’s tides surge, cloud-waves contending in tumult. The people of the Immortal Metropolis possess twelve grades of refinement, myriad species of beings, and the Three Void Qi generating all things—thus it is called the Green Palace Fuxiang World.

The Primordial Beginning Heavenly Venerable divided his spirit into myriad heavens and scattered his form into countless billions. Suddenly manifesting in this realm, he named it the Fuxiang Heaven, the Green Flower Dao Domain, where the sacred crown nurtured essence, and a being arose at the Cavernous Extremity—named the Great Dao Lord of the Fuxiang Cavern Spirit, externally known as the Great Sovereign of Fuxiang. He regulates the sun’s ascent and descent, hosting and bidding farewell to the sun’s essence, his true form becoming the essence of sun and moon, his soul the Long-Life Sovereign of the Southern Extremity. His junior successor is the Green Flower Sovereign.

The Fuxiang nurtured the Cavern Spirit’s qi, which transformed through nine kalpas, its form and features fully realized, the Eastern True Dao attained—thus becoming the Great Dao Lord of the Cavern Spirit. The Fuxiang Cavern Spirit is the essence of the Nine Yang True Refined Qi, born within the Fuxiang. It transmutes into kalpa-fire, becoming the enlightened, eloquent, and exalted virtue of high sages. The most divine of virtues, it is the Lord of the Dao.

The Dao Lord wields the Mother of All Things, generating the Primordial Embryo, containing the Five Phases’ essence to forge the heavens and earth. All worldly calamities arise from fire’s scourge. Fire is the root of disaster, yet the Dao possesses the ancestral Cavern Spirit of Fuxiang to govern its transformations. The qi of the Fuxiang’s green groves, when vast, refines true scriptures and augments the Mystic Dao. When subtle, it averts disasters and dispels misfortune, blessing all living beings. Just as fire depends on wood, so too does wood’s embryo harbor fire, fire belongs to the spirit, and the spirit is nourished within water—thus celestial calamities subside, and the way of averting them is manifest. Therefore, the Great Dao Lord of the Fuxiang Cavern Spirit is the Master of Disaster-Aversion.

Descending to Taiji, he first arrived at the seat. The Moral Great God of the True Realm of Fuxiang, the Supreme Sage of High Venerability, the True Person of the Azure Sovereign, with countless hosts unnumbered, rode the void and came. Azure clouds flew, green groves flourished luxuriantly, the whirlwind wheels moved in secret, the Cavernous Canopy hung with splendor, the Azure Dragon’s wondrous light stretched boundless, flowing clouds and crimson scenes blending into boundless haze. For seven days and seven nights, the Celestial Manifestation Platform of all heavens shone with the sun’s station, the Star Gate and celestial axle momentarily halting their courses. The sacred wind drifted far, the seas and Tai Mountains brightened with clouds, the sky showed no anomaly, the Nine Qi gathered in purity, and across the land—earth, mountains, rivers, woods, and trees—jewel-buds radiated fragrance, green scriptures rose in ridges, and purple bells chimed in resonance, their harmonies filling the void.

Within this profound stillness, the Great Dao Lord of the Fuxiang Cavern Spirit, for all living beings, resolved their disasters and calamities. Seated in mystic repose upon the Purple Cloud Celestial Light Jade Throne, he expounded the scripture once, and all the great saints of heaven simultaneously praised its virtue. At that time, within the land, all male and female beings saw their calamities and illnesses universally dispersed.

He expounded the scripture a second time, and the Taiji Heaven opened, with all true immortals gathered in assembly. A third time, the Immortal Metropolis rose in smoke, celebrating the Three Realms. A fourth time, the sacred heart communicated inwardly, intuitively recognizing the wondrous body. A fifth time, dragons roared across the sea, their divine waves spreading far. A sixth time, the three calamities ceased, and all things flourished in vigor. A seventh time, divine radiance shone in unison, the layered gates aglow. An eighth time, the Five Sacred Cloud Scripts emerged, and the Purple Chime sounded in harmony. A ninth time, jade flowers flew through the sky, their layered hues intermingling in splendor. A tenth time, the Cavern Spirit’s light descended, and the springs’ curves received its grace—at that moment, all men and women of the land, without exception, inclined their hearts, all receiving protection and salvation, attaining longevity.

The Dao speaks: At that time, as the Great Dao Lord of the Fuxiang Cavern Spirit expounded the scripture once, the *Dongshen* Most True Great God of Boundless Limitless Disaster-Aversion and Calamity-Resolution from the Eastern Direction, with countless hosts unnumbered, floated through the void. A second time, the same from the Southern Direction. A third time, from the Western Direction. A fourth time, from the Northern Direction. A fifth time, from the Northeast. A sixth time, from the Southeast. A seventh time, from the Southwest.

A eighth time, the Dao/Way was expounded, and the **Dongshen** Most True Great God of Boundless Limitless Disaster-Aversion and Calamity-Resolution from the Western Direction, with countless hosts unnumbered, floated through the void.

A ninth time, the same from the Upper Direction.

A tenth time, the same from the Lower Direction.

After tenfold expounding, the **Dongshen** Most True Great God of Boundless Limitless Disaster-Aversion and Calamity-Resolution from all Ten Directions, with countless hosts, descended together. All men and women of the land inclined their hearts in reverence.

The arriving ones were like torrents rushing into the abyss, like tides responding to the moon—boundless and endless, with no visible beginning or end. Countless hosts filled the land within and without.

Some suffered calamities due to **body and use** yet undiscerned (*tǐyòng wèi fēn*), or **karmic forces** at play (*yìlián wéi zāi*).
Some fell prey to **unfulfilled wisdom** (*zhìhuì bù shuàn*), or **defilements clinging to the dharma** (*fǎn rǎn wéi zāi*).
Some were struck by **misaligned qi** (*shénqì bù hé*), or **erroneous distinctions** (*fēnbié wéi zāi*).
Some were ensnared by **obscured Dao/Way-nature** (*Dàoxìng bù míng*), or **grasping at delusions** (*zhí wàng wéi zāi*).
Some were afflicted by **clinging to emptiness and mere existence** (*qùqǔ kōngyǒu*), or **confusion of true and false** (*xiézhèng wéi zāi*).
Some were tormented by **attachment to the dharma-body** (*liànzhuó fǎshēn*), or **self-identification as calamity** (*rènjǐ wéi zāi*).
Some were misled by **coveting spiritual powers** (*tānzhuó shéntōng*), or **erratic transformations** (*biànhuàn wéi zāi*).
Some were trapped by **aspirations beyond the Three Realms** (*yù chū sānjiè*), or **the cycle of birth and death** (*shēngsǐ wéi zāi*).
Some were struck by **grasping at the Great Dao/Way** (*shíwù Dàodào*), or **inaction as calamity** (*wúzuòwéi zāi*).
Some were driven mad by **measuring the primordial transformation** (*cèliáng yuánhuà*), or **foolish speculation** (*kuánggǔ wéi zāi*).
Some were plagued by **ignorance of the Cavern Spirit** (*bùzhī Dòngshén*), or **confusion of yin and yang** (*yīnyáng wéi zāi*).
Some were misguided by **entering and exiting the Womb and Matrix Realms** (*rùchū tāizàng*), or **distinction between ordinary and holy beings** (*fánshèng wéi zāi*).

These twelve great calamities are the **Dao/Way’s** great afflictions for those who seek ultimate learning.

Additionally, there are worldly calamities:
At the time of **conception**, when **karmic forces** manifest (*yèliè suǒ zhuǎn*), **birth complications** occur (*héngcè wéi zāi*).
In **childhood**, **fright and terror** bring disaster (*jīngwù wéi zāi*).
In **maturity**, **fate and destiny** strike (*yùndù wéi zāi*).
In **marriage**, **gain and loss** bring ruin (*dé sàng wéi zāi*).
In **pursuit of cultivation**, **qi and climate** cause affliction (*qìhòu wéi zāi*).
In **daily life**, **illness and disease** arise (*qǐjū wéi zāi*).
In **action**, **malevolent spirits** bring misfortune (*guǐshén wéi zāi*).
In **times of ignorance**, **heaven and earth** themselves become calamitous (*tiāndì wéi zāi*).
In **times of betrayal**, **punishment and execution** befall (*xínglù wéi zāi*).
In **times of disobedience**, **thunder and fire** descend as disaster (*léi huǒ wéi zāi*).
In **times of unbridled conduct**, **heaven’s prohibitions** strike (*tiānjìn wéi zāi*).
In **times of defilement**, **untimely death** occurs (*yāozhé wéi zāi*).
In **times of hidden poison**, **yin and yang** are disrupted (*yīnyáng wéi zāi*).
In **times of greed and corruption**, **excessive fate** brings ruin (*yìfèn wéi zāi*).
In **times of worldly residence**, **hypocrisy and shallowness** prevail (*wěibó wéi zāi*).

These fifteen great calamities are those that all in the world suffer.

Thus, when **fivefold death** befalls, or **celestial stars** bring misfortune, or **earthly officials** record crimes, or the **Three Officials** present petitions, or the **Five Emperors** mark blame—
these calamities strike the body and mind in succession.

All hasten to the **Great Dao Lord’s** vast dharma-seat of the Fuxiang Cavern Spirit, encircling and surrounding, gazing upon the divine countenance, listening to the celestial voice, as the **Great Dao/Way** of universal disaster-aversion and salvation is proclaimed.

At that moment, the **Fuxiang Cavern Spirit’s** teaching master, the **Great Dao Lord**, took the sash of the **Sun and Moon Cloud-Dragon**, turned the **auspicious jade throne of radiant light**, and looked down upon the assembly, delighting in the Ten Directions. In a flash of favor—
the **Great Dao Lord** divided his form into myriad billions, awakening the origins of life for all beings, and every sentient one saw their own reflection, kneeling long before the holy presence to receive blessings, palms pressed to their brows as they heard the sacred teachings.

He expounded that **Fuxiang** is the **root of vital qi**, and the **Cavern Spirit’s** central qi is the **spirit of all ten thousand things**. With the **prayer of the Most True Great God**, all great calamities were dispelled by invoking the **ninefold radiant light** of the Cavern Spirit’s true essence—no disaster remained, all afflictions vanished.

Within that gathering, a **Dao Lord** was seen floating atop the **curved, jade-patterned leaves of Fuxiang’s purple clouds**, where the **Cavern Spirit’s** qi transformed into a **verdant forest of elixir**—a thousandfold truth. Crowns and swords stood tall in orderly ranks, five zhang above the earth.

The **Great Dao Lord** ascended, and the **Dongshen** Most True Great God of Disaster-Aversion and Calamity-Resolution, **Han** the **Lord of Records**, the **Southern Court** **God of Expediency** who averts calamities and guides righteousness, the **Highest Sage** of **Green Splendor** and **Illuminating Treasure**, the **Ten-Directional Boundless Most True Great God**, along with countless hosts—all entered the **Sacred Forest’s** luminous shadow.

The **heavenly and human beings** looked upward, and saw only a **bursting radiance** emerging from the Cavern Light. Once inside the forest’s glow, they vanished—no trace remained. The people dispersed, the **jade ramparts** flattened, and the **Sacred Forest** fell silent.

The **Great Dao Lord** then completed the **expounding of the scripture** within that transformed realm. All the **true ones** oversaw the transmission, bestowing it upon me. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words.

The **dharma-assembly** concluded, and the **celestial hosts** returned to their stations. The **void gave birth to the spirit**, and **stillness left no lingering sound**.

At that time, all who encountered the **scripture and dharma** were universally saved—none suffered injury in that year. The entire land turned in reverence, calamities dispelled, and the **original heart** purified in tranquility.

With the heart thus cleansed and upright, **false Dao/Way** could not intrude.
Celestial **pathways** were no longer violated, **malevolent spirits** could not harm, and the **threefold disasters** and **fourfold killings**, the **fivefold and sixfold afflictions**, the **sevenfold injuries**, **eightfold difficulties**, **ninefold calamities**, and **excessive fate**—all were extinguished. **Inauspicious omens** were banished, and words aligned with the **Central Dao/Way**.

There was **no destruction or blame**, all were equal in **compassionate love**, and **diverse beings** became **kin**. The land was secure, its people prosperous.

Rejoicing in **Great Peace**, the **teachings began to spread**, and the **entire land followed the Dao/Way**. Those with **devoted hearts** revered and upheld the **doctrine**, all attaining **salvation in the world**.

The **Dao/Way** spoke: The words uttered by the **Great Dao Lord** during the **scripture-expounding** were the **hidden sounds** of all **celestial emperors** and **heavenly deities**, averting disasters and bringing fortune—also the **secret names** of **demonic kings**, dispelling ten thousand calamities. These were not the **common phrases** of the world.

The **Highest Sage**, having attained **true personhood**, mastered the **mysteries of the profound**, and knew their full meaning.
When recited **ten times**, the **celestial hosts** descended in truth, **disaster-qi** was submerged, **afflictions** were exhausted, the **original life** illuminated, **blessings of birth** naturally bestowed, the **Most True Great God** guarding with vigilance, **false Dao/Way** having no sway, all **spirits** in awe, the **divine officials** beating their drums in rhythm, **glowing clouds** parting in splendor, the **treasure-sea** radiating light—**worldly afflictions** were annihilated, **evil vapors** dissipated, **calamities** turned back, **fate** transformed into **true attainment**.

Those who seek **ultimate learning**, if they recite it **ten times**, will be **aligned with the celestial emperors**, their **ranks harmonized with the hosts**. All **heavenly beings** will respond from afar, **protecting the world** from disasters and misfortunes, ensuring **peace for all sentient beings**, and the **Dao/Way of life** flourishing eternally. **Poisons and harms** will disperse, **ghostly essences** lose their power, the **Five Emperors** will attend in welcome, the **Three Realms** will submit to command, the **dying** will be **saved**, and the **terminated** will **live again**.

Thus it is that scholars, when their **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way** are complete, command reverence from ghosts and gods, penetrate the **true ultimate**, and their **qi** and **spiritual force** fill the cosmos. When they recite and chant this **sutra**, blessings descend and calamities vanish, and all sentient beings are freed from suffering. They master celestial governance, subdue earthly spirits, and bind demonic essences—not merely averting death, but restoring life.

Even a light recitation of this chapter shields one from misfortune, while proper veneration and offerings bring prosperity to one’s household, flourishing through generations. With virtuous connections, one escapes all disasters, and divine beings guard the gates. This **sutra** is supreme and unmatched in the **Jade Capital**, saving countless beings and serving as the root of all **Dao/Way** traditions. Its grandeur is vast, its **virtue/power** beyond measure.

The **Dao/Way** speaks: Those who recite this **sutra** ten times will see the Nine Heavens dispel disasters and banish misfortune, with celestial deities gathering to avert calamities. Dark stars and ominous influences are quelled, and the **Black Heavenly God** subdues malevolent forces. As one’s fate approaches, fasting and supplication will forever sever decay and misfortune, extending life beyond mortal limits. At the end of one’s allotted span, the soul ascends to the **Vermilion Palace**, attaining nine years of renewed vitality, transformation through **true attainment**, and noble status. Those who earnestly study this **sutra**, fulfilling its merits and **virtue/power**, shall become **immortals**, ascending to the **Golden Gate** and feasting in the **Jade Capital**.

Superior scholars who practice and recite this **sutra** shower blessings upon all life, sparing even the most grievous calamities. All who hear it immediately ascend to the **Southern Palace**. Mortals who recite it will prolong their years, and their descendants shall attain the **Emptiness-Resolution** path. Refining **spiritual fire** and **vital essence**, they transmute bones into **immortality**, their forms and spirits hidden or manifest at will, dwelling in blessed courts and wandering freely in the **Dao/Way** realm—thus returning to their original bodies and traversing the cosmos.

This **sutra** is profound and boundless, its blessings extending to all **heavenly beings and mortals**, granting immeasurable fortune and mercy across life and death. A treasure of the heavens, it was not meant for the mortal world. Only noble scholars, offering gold and jade with sincere devotion and swearing oaths to the heavens, may transmit it. To leak or neglect it invites retribution upon nine generations, condemning one to the **Ghostly Bureaucracy**.

When this **sutra** is kept, the **Five Emperors**, along with twenty-four **Celestial Boys** and **Celestial Girls**, attend as guardians, protecting those who receive it.

The **Dao/Way** decrees:
In the **first month**, with prolonged fasting, recite this **sutra** to absolve the suffering souls of past lives, those entangled in **tomb disputes** and **Ghostly Bureaucracy**, and those facing impending doom. Sever the transmission of misfortune, guide the **Night River** souls to the **Southern Palace**.

In the **seventh month**, with prolonged fasting, recite this **sutra** to absolve oneself from **celestial nets** and **earthly snares**, the **Nine Malevolent Influences**, and the torments of the **Heavenly Prison**. One shall attain **immortality**, with one’s name recorded in celestial registers, **Yellow Talismans** and **White Tablets** erasing death and granting rebirth.

In the **tenth month**, with prolonged fasting, recite this **sutra** to avert **eclipses**, celestial and terrestrial upheavals, **demonic influences**, and regional disasters—plagues, poisonous afflictions, and **Heaven’s Severance**. For kings and emperors, it secures the **Mandate of Heaven**, ensuring eternal stability for their lineage and eternal peace for their people.

On the **eight solar terms**, recite this **sutra** to avert disasters tied to **fate and cosmic shifts**, slanderous accusations, imprisonment, and violent death, as well as **water and fire calamities** and **blocked pathways**. The **Nine Palaces** send deities to guard the practitioner.

On one’s **birthday**, recite this **sutra** to avert the **Northern Dipper’s** influence, recall the wandering soul, and dispel the **fatal blockages** and humiliations of death. The spirit shall be purified, **qi** eternal, the body radiant, and the **Three Realms** shall attend with the **Five Emperors** in welcome. All deities shall pay homage, one’s name inscribed in heaven, and with merits complete, one ascends to the **Upper Purity**.

The **Dao/Way** instructs: On days of practice, one must bathe in scented water, fast in purity, enter the chamber facing east, and strike the teeth **thirty-two times** to communicate with the **Thirty-two Heavens**. Bowing inwardly **thirty-two times**, close the eyes, and meditate upon sitting within clouds of **green, yellow, and white**. Within and without, all is profound darkness—**Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Tortoise, Lion, and White Crane** arrayed on either side, while the sun and moon illuminate the chamber. The **Averting Disasters Divine Spirits** stand clearly before and behind, their **round halos** radiating light across the ten directions.

The **secret incantation** proclaims:
*"Supreme Mystic Origin, the **Highest Sovereign of the Dao/Way**,
Summon forth from my body the **Three Five Functionaries**, left and right officials, **Perfumed Boys**, **Jade Girls**, the **Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans**, and the **Directing Sun Officials**—each thirty-six in number—to open the way for my words.

Today is a day of auspicious fasting in the pure hall, practicing this **sutra** to save countless beings.
May my petition reach the **Supreme Most High of the Thirty-two Heavens, the Original Beginning Emperor**, the Most Venerable and Exalted.
Having completed the **thirty-two recitations**, face east and recite the **sutra**.

**Original Beginning’s Supreme Sutra for Saving Beings of the Highest Rank and Marvelous Chapter**,
**Original Beginning’s Divine Spirit Averting Disasters and Marvelous Section**,
**Heavenly Blessings for Saving Beings**.

A hundred demons retreat in silence, their **yin-yang transformations** effortless.
The **Divine Spirit’s Crimson Text** reveals the **Non-Ultimate True One**.
From the **Original Beginning’s Eon**, the **Primordial Transformation** gave rise to all heavens.
**Green Flower Wood Essence**, the root of all things, spreads **generative qi**, its **vital fluids** rising in mist.
The **Noble Spirit of Wood**, child of **Primordial Qi**, gives birth to **True Water**, which transforms into **Wood**.

Within the **Green Flower Wood Essence** lies **Luminous Nature**, which refines into **Fire**.

The earth holds five metals, which reveal their **vital essence** when touched by fire.
All things entering fire undergo boundless transformation.
Ascending to **mystic perfection**, one contemplates the **Mysteries of Heaven**—
its principles ever profound, like the world’s disasters,
which are not of the **True Path**.

The **Divine Spirit** rides upon them, crushing all calamities.
The **Nine Suns of the Divine Spirit** generate boundless blessings.
Those who attain it endure eternally; all beings feel its abiding protection.
The **Divine Wind** stirs, and **Crimson Clouds** drift—
curved into sacred script, the **Three Lights** shine as one.
Warding off disasters and safeguarding life,
its name is inscribed in the **Jade Hall**.

It ascends to the **Three Heavens**, the **Land of the Dao’s Limitless Way**,
descends to the **Jade Mountains**, where **Ida-Ra** blends with gold.
Within, all beings are nurtured, and disasters are averted.
Wearing the **Divine Script**, it draws in the **Great Sun**.
Purple vapors condense within, radiant and dazzling—
the **key to the Dao**, the **gate to transcendence**.
The **Heavenly True** gives birth to **spirit-sages**.
It governs fate and protects the people—all through the **Divine Spirit**.

The **Great Spirit’s Qi** pervades the **Ten Directions**.
Within dwell:
the **God of Warding Disasters** who turns back calamities,
the **Lord of Extinguishing Misfortune and Prolonging Life**,
the **Divine Spirit of Resolving Calamities**,
the **Lord of Eastern Hua Who Degrees Fate**,
the **Great Sage of Ten Thousand Blessings, the Imperial Ancestor**,
the **God of Expiating Disasters and Stabilizing Fate**,
the **Moral Lord of Dissolving Calamities and Scattering Misfortune**—
their responses to supplications are boundless, their salvation of beings infinite.

Today, the **Scriptures are verified**, and the **Heavens attend in splendor**.

Ten thousand chariots, ten thousand riders float through the void,
their light returning as they survey the **True** and guide the living.

The **Celestial Chancellors**,
**Nanchang Upper Palace Officials**,

warding disasters, scattering misfortune,
prolonging life and increasing years,
the **Divine Spirit of Resolving Calamities**—

they assemble before the **Emperor’s Court**,
verifying the **Heavens’ decrees** as they respond to each salvation.

They proclaim to the **Three Realms**, the **Land of the Limitless Spirit**,
the **Bureaus of the Spring’s Bend**, the **Northern Capital of Luo-Hang**,
the **Three Officials and Nine Ministries**, the **Twelve River Sources**—
the **Disaster-Dispensing, Plague-Bringing, Great Killing Ghosts of the Netherworld**—
to **ward off and absolve** the world’s living beings from **punishments, calamities, decline, and emptiness**.

They alter the **registers of fate**, removing **disasters and recording blessings**,
so that life may endure, and fortune daily increase.
They **dissolve guilt and retribution**, **extinguish evil roots**,
so that none may be detained or forced into **ghostly assemblies**.

By the **Dao’s Imperial Edict**, at the appointed hour they ascend,
aligning with the **Yang of the Dipper**, returning through the **Heavenly Gate**.
From **death they emerge into life**, ascending to the **Emperor’s Presence**.
They **subdue demons and uplift the worthy**, guiding souls to the **Southern Palace’s ranks**.
**Souls and spirits undergo refinement**; disasters fade, blessings manifest.
The **living body is saved**; through each **eon**, it endures.
With the **wheel of existence**, it turns alongside the **Heavens**, equal in years.
It **permanently transcends the Three Realms of Suffering**—
the **Five Torments and Eight Hardships**—
soaring in **Adrift Clarity**, the **Upper Pure**.

Words harmonizing with the **Highest True**.

**First Hymn of the Dao of the Void Spirit Sovereign Lord: Averting Calamity and Bringing Auspiciousness to the Celestial Market of Harmonious Transformation**

Resplendent and vast, the august might returns eightfold.
Descending to illuminate the mortal realm, all beings take refuge.
To follow the transformation brings fortune; to defy Heaven brings decline.
With two prostrations to the golden light, may my prayers be answered.
Calamities shall not arise; virtue and power stand lofty and eternal.
The Dao of the Immortals knows no cessation, while the way of ghosts cycles through rise and fall.
Why not contemplate the Supreme Void, where wondrous qi shines radiant?
Bright and piercing in the azure expanse, the jade gates send clouds and mists aloft.
The Immortal draws in the fragrant breeze, his countenance youthful as spring returns.
The Void Spirit transforms into verdant shoots, the elixir’s glow lingering in the throat.
Thus may the Dao of the Eastern Red Pine flourish, its phoenix script bright in the pure mists.
Descending to pity the morning-born disciples, ever turning in ceaseless cycles.
Unknowing the Void Spirit’s intent, they stumble in cages of constraint.
Soaring to meet the High Spirits, they glimpse the Eastern Hua Mountain.

**Second Hymn of the Dao of the Void Spirit Sovereign Lord: Averting Calamity and Bringing Auspiciousness to the Supreme Void’s Empty Chapters**

Emerald light flows and reflects, golden gates with vermilion eaves.
Dazzling constellations stand tall, celestial cords winding through Heaven.
Abundant brilliance pierces like pearls; delay and stagnation bring disaster.

The myriad spirits of the Bureau of Defense stand in reverent attendance, the Three Officials bowing in ceremonial order.
When calamities befall the world, floods and fires rise, the Nine and Six reach their limits, and the *Kan* abyss shifts its height.
The Nine Spirits beat their wings in rhythm, the Dragon Post relays its mechanisms.
War blades rain down in fury, killing *qi* sweeping across the marshes.
Disasters manifest in signs—red scriptures spread abroad.
The Five Emperors take up their pens, the Four Bright Ones apprehend the guilty.
The *Hun* vapors are purified and dispersed, virtue and power flow deep and vast.
The Sovereign’s life spans ten thousand years, the common folk feast in ease.

This is the Third Hymn of the Void Spirit Sovereign Lord, the *Dao* of Averting Calamity and Bringing Auspiciousness to the Supreme Void’s Empty Chapters, the song that subdues the Purple Micro and suppresses demons.
The round radiance shimmers boundless, the Golden Horse gallops in four directions.
The jade carriage drifts empty, the sun and moon follow in attendance.

The Bureau of Defense marshals the myriad spirits, the Three Officials bow in solemn order.
When calamities befall the world—floods and fires, upheavals and collapse—
the Nine and Six reach their limits, the *Kan* abyss shifts its height.
The Nine Spirits beat their wings in unison, the Dragon Post relays its mechanisms.
War blades rain down in fury, killing *qi* sweeping across the marshes.
Disasters manifest in signs—red scriptures spread abroad.
The Five Emperors take up their pens, the Four Bright Ones apprehend the guilty.
The *Hun* vapors are purified and dispersed, virtue and power flow deep and vast.
The Sovereign’s life spans ten thousand years, the common folk feast in ease.
The uncivilized sing in wild abandon, rejoicing in the blessings bestowed upon the virtuous.

I sing the sacred texts of the Void, the crimson carriage borne on emerald clouds.
The treasure-umbrella blows forth its flowers, the divine wind carries fragrant mists.
The Purple Celestial moves in circuit, the Three Platforms shield the spirits.
Vast *qi* descends upon the Dipper, the flowing bells refine the True Ones.
The Celestial Mists unfurl in nine hues—O Sovereign of the Great Primordial!

This is the Third True Sovereign of the Void Spirit, the Sovereign Lord of the Cavernous Dao, who manifests his *Dharma* body, traverses the Great Void, and sings the *Dao* of averting calamity and bringing boundless blessings—a melody harmonizing with the Cavernous Chapters.
Recite it a hundred times, and your name ascends to the Southern Palace.
Recite it a thousand times, and the demon kings come to welcome you.
Recite it ten thousand times, and the *Dao* is complete—you ascend to the heavens, transcend the Three Realms, and attain the rank of Immortal Lord.

Those who hear this sacred melody will see the demon kings bow in reverence, command the earthly spirits to guard and escort you, and pull you free from the underworld’s gates. The Five Torments and Eight Difficulties will be overcome, the Seven Ancestors will ascend, and you will forever depart from the Ghostly Bureaus. No calamity or blame shall remain, and your fate and blessings shall be paired in harmony.

This is called the boundless, universally liberating *Dao*.
It contains the secret celestial scriptures that all the heavens hold in reverence.
To reveal it carelessly is to fall into the hells, and the calamity will extend to the Seven Ancestors.
The *Dao* says: These two chapters are the hidden melodies of the Heavenly Sovereigns and the True Kings who avert calamity, all the words of the Great *Brahman*. They are not the common speech of the world.
Their words lack poetic grace, their tunes lack ornate beauty.
Thus they are called profound and mysterious, difficult to fathom.
They are treasured by Heaven and hidden in the Purple Micro’s Upper Palace of the Mystic Capital, transmitted once every four million *kalpas* according to the Mystic Canon.

If a perfected one brings gold and jade with a sincere heart and, following the ancient rites, pledges to the Ten Heavens, then it shall be bestowed upon them.

The *Dao* says: The method of the Cavernous Spirit for averting calamity is most subtle.
Unless one embodies the Mystic and delves into the subtle, they cannot fully know it.
The calamities of humans and spirits arise from the exhaustion of their celestial allotments, the waxing and waning of the moon, the repose or decline of the saints, or the illnesses of the unenlightened.
When such calamities occur, all who share the same *qi* must unite in heart to observe fasts, burn incense at the six times of day, and recite the scriptures ten thousand times. Then blessings and virtue will descend, dispelling all inauspiciousness.

The boundless text universally liberates without end.
The *Dao* says: When averting the calamities of the common folk—whether their fate is exhausted or their life ends, or whether the unenlightened, with shallow *Dao*, have not yet fulfilled the Immortal grade and their celestial allotment is extinguished, their bodies experiencing the Great Darkness—
at the moment of passing, the perfected ones among their fellow students should burn incense and recite the scriptures ten thousand times to liberate their physical forms according to the method.

Those who act in accordance with the method shall not only avert worldly calamities but also avert the calamities of the afterlife.
Now, though the body has perished and the soul has departed, it is still called a calamity—referring to the prisons of water and fire, the prisons of metal and iron, the torments of interrogation, pursuit, arrest, and confinement, as well as the afflictions of the soul beneath the earth.
Then, at a secluded and silent place by mountains and rivers, a platform of earth is sealed, facing north in prayer. The true scriptures and jade writings of the Five Directions are laid out, and through fasting and recitation of the scriptures, the soul is liberated. The spirit ascends directly to the Southern Celestial, and according to their merit, they are reborn on the appointed day.
The Wheel of *Dharma* turns without confusion, and they attain divinity as Immortals.

The *Dao* says: When the celestial movements of Heaven and Earth reach their limits, the stars and constellations shift their courses, the sun and moon lose their regularity, the four seasons are disordered, *yin* and *yang* are unbalanced, and the sovereign suffers calamity—when wars rage in the four directions, epidemics spread, and the common folk perish in masses, when teachers and friends meet untimely ends—
they must observe fasts, burn incense, and recite the scriptures.
With the Five Emperors’ red scriptures and the Five Directional sacred texts inscribed on blue-green silk, they face the directional fire and scatter them.
Using *zhi* wood tablets, they inscribe the words of averting calamity and cast them into mountains and rivers, burying them in the places where the calamities occur.
Then the Cavernous Great Spirits gather and dispel the calamitous *qi*, bringing forth blessings and auspiciousness.

The observance of fasts and the recitation of scriptures carry immense merit.
Above, they dispel heavenly calamities and protect the sovereign.
Below, they avert poisonous harm and liberate the common folk.
Both the living and the dead rely upon them, and their blessings are boundless.
Thus it is said: boundless, universally liberating for both Heaven and humanity.

The *Dao* says: Those who possess this scripture and perform these deeds for the sake of the Heavenly Sovereign, the imperial master, and the common folk—
on days of calamity, if they take the vow to observe fasts, burn incense, and recite the scriptures ten thousand times, all the heavens will record their names, the myriad spirits will guard them, and the perfected ones of the Right Path will ensure they become ministers of the Golden Gate for the Holy Sovereign.
The heavens record every merit and demerit without omission.
Even the demon kings of the heavens will recommend you, and those who attain the *Dao* shall truly comprehend these profound words.

From the hidden melodies of the Great *Brahman* in the heavens—
Composed by the Great Sovereign of the Cavernous Dao, the *Dao* of Averting Calamity and Bringing Auspiciousness, the Middle Chapter.
The Eight Heavens of the East:
The *Qi* Mound resounds with jade, the Eastern Well transforms into the Immortal.
The Ox Room shifts in exchange, the Six *Qi* distinguish the Mystic.
Lofty and vast, the Treasure of Great Peace, the Mystic treads the Path of Obscurity.
The *Luo* *Brahman* arrays the myriad subtleties.
The *Zhu* and *Yu* by their grace, their names a swirling multitude.
The horns of the *Jue* protect the scene, the Moon Emperor veils in darkness.
The *Gu* strikes the *Tu*, transforming awareness into ritual propriety.
The Immortal *Chen* speaks in the forest, the wings of the *Yuan* rise in mist.
The Eight Heavens of the South:
The Nine *Kun* stand in judgment, the *Ba* and *Ming* merge in the East.
The Purple Mound reaches the River, the silent and true are one.
The *Brahman* degrees extend universally, the Golden Extremes rise in vast mounds.
The origin of purity nurtures all, the *A* and *Mi* are shrouded in mystery.
The Cavernous Red Mists ascend, the dazzling jade glows in green.
The *Huan* and *Luo* save the *Yan*, the ministers of state are loyal and true.
The *Si* erects the steles, the *Jing* stands tall in glory.
The Duke builds the frost-laden banks, the *Shao* sings of heroic deeds.
The Ghostly Marshes cradle the dragon, the White is sealed in mystery.
The *Xue* reveals the spirit’s shame, the *Zhi* and *Qian* race to the *Tan*.
From the Ghostly character, the four lines—
the secret text for averting calamity.

**West of the Eight Heavens**
The *Kui* and *Lou* respond to the Immortal,
The banner rises, the lotus steps advance.
The *Chuo* constructs the true, the *Jing* spreads firm.
The *Tai* fragrance measures the jade degree,
The orb’s waves transmit to Chu.
The *Niu* chamber holds no deeds,
The precious steelyard remains silent in the clouds.

The divine *Di* and *Fan* grove resounds,
The azure bright performs its pride.
The dragon mists align in approach,
The vermilion *Ru* pools expand profound.
The *Pu* bears the *Ding* and *Hu*,
The steed commands sincerity’s rise.
The *Lan* perceives the eternal field,
The fox-soldiers aid in flourishing.

**North of the Eight Heavens**
The *Yu* rites bind the *Lin*,
The *Zhou* sage’s deeds are passed on.
The *Lang* capital probes the bright,
The *Dao* Master’s mysteries unfold.
The *Yao* turns the pivot,
The *Quan* fuses the teeth and chambers.
The jade’s distance measures the subtle,
The Heavenly Chief’s path extends far.
The *Bi* elder’s marshlands gather,
The *Jing* clears the cavern’s wound.
The *Yang* returns, the thunder swift,
The *Yue* paths lead to the azure.

The *Su* forest and *Xi* plains,
The divine phoenix bears the banner.
The silent realm encircles the extreme,
The Dao’s secrets are ever strange.

The Dao speaks:
Within these heavens, the Great *Fan* conceals hidden speech,
A boundless sound—ancient scriptures stretch a full ten feet long,
Engraved upon the Great Emperor’s golden palace,
On the *Fusang*’s green pines and jade leaves, twin stems above.
Above, it averts celestial calamities;
Below, it averts earthly disasters;
Within, it secures the people and creatures.

When the divine wind stirs it,
The cavernous spirits emit their voices,
The *qi* pervades the Nine Realms,
Harmonizing all spirits,
So that calamities do not approach,
And the Ten Thousand Truths descend to the court.

The Heavenly True Man of old inscribed this text,
Establishing it as the true sound.
Those who know this sound and, through fasting, recite it,
Shall have all the heavens dispatch cavernous spirits—
The *Averting-Calamity Ten-Thousand-Blessings Spirit Kings*—
To observe their bodies,
Record their merits and labors,
And report upward to the heavens,
Where all spirits pay homage,
Earthly deities attend the gates,
Great *Shun* magicians advocate,
And the Highest Truths are upheld.
The Dao is complete, its attainment secured,
Roaming the Three Realms.
Ascending into the Golden Gate.

This sound repels all,
Averts all,
Transcends all,
Accomplishes all—
The natural sound of the Heavenly True.

Thus, when recited, it summons the flying ones to gaze below,
The Supreme Deities sing from afar,
All spirits pay homage,
The Three Realms attend the hall,
All *shen* and *qi* bow their heads,
Ghostly intelligences vanish in terror,
The *linlang* chimes resound,
The Ten Directions grow serene,
The rivers and seas fall silent.
Mountains swallow their mists,
All spirits tremble in submission,
Gathering the host of immortals,
The heavens know no filth,
The earth no *qi* dust,
The dark wisdom clears profoundly—
Great *liang* beyond measure.

**The *Lingbao* Scripture of Boundless Degree for Nourishing Humans—Supreme Marvelous Scripture, Volume Forty-Four Complete**
**Volume Forty-Five**

**The Chapter on Dispelling Malignant Qi of Mountain Valleys**

The Dao speaks: *"In ancient times, within the vast and boundless Heavenly Center, the profound and verdant song of the Great God of the Divine Land was sung. There, the Heavenly True One (元始) received the Supreme Marvelous Scripture for Dispelling Malignant Qi of Mountain Valleys and Nourishing Humans.*

When the Heavenly True One, the Celestial Sovereign of Boundless Degree (元始天尊), spoke this scripture, circling ten times through the Ten Directions to summon all realms, the Ten Directions’ deities then came to take their seats. The Heavenly True Great God, the Supreme Saint of High Eminence, the True Person of Marvelous Conduct—both great and small mountain valleys, the Celestial Officials who rule over all realms, the myriad peaks of the Ten Directions, the spirits and gods of streams and springs, the demonic lords of the dark abodes, the poisonous miasmas of the world—all these, whether as officials of the divine bureaucracy or as subordinate spirits, innumerable in number, ride the void and appear from the mountains. Their purple palanquins and jade carriages gleam with cloud-like radiance, their jeweled wheels and feathered canopies sway in majestic response, their effulgent light like flowing jade, their thousand hues bursting like blooming reeds, their brilliance piercing the mysterious depths.

For seven days and seven nights, the celestial hosts—suns, moons, stars, and constellations—along with the pivot and balance (枢衡), the Jade Pass (玉关), all halt their courses and still their wheels. The divine winds fall silent, the mountain valleys conceal their mists, the heavens shine with pristine clarity, and the harmonious *qi* spreads in all eight directions. In every land, the earth and mountains, rivers and forests, all flatten into equal measure, with no high or low. The soil transforms into *ruiyu zhujian* (蕊珠含碧), a warm and luminous jade, without variation in hue. All the celestial deities attend their seats, while the Heavenly True One, the Celestial Sovereign of Boundless Degree, sits in transcendence upon the floating platform of the Nine Spirits, the Night Light of Myriad Peaks, the Azure Pavilion of the Jade Terrace.

After the first recitation of the scripture, all the celestial saints simultaneously praised its virtue. At that moment, the thirty-six thousand mountains of the world all brightened at once. After the second recitation, the celestial mists congealed in the void, and the sacred mushrooms (灵芝) spread in abundance. After the third recitation, auspicious vapors enveloped all, and fragrant incense arose from the rocky caves. After the fourth recitation, the world’s realm grew serene, and the mountain clouds exhaled their brilliance. After the fifth recitation, the dragon’s light illuminated the seas, and the celestial treasures crystallized in splendor. After the sixth recitation, the Dao’s *qi* revived and clarified, and all living beings rejoiced in harmony. After the seventh recitation, ghosts and demons lay dormant, and the malignant miasmas vanished without trace. After the eighth recitation, the heavenly valleys became void and mysterious, and the divine mists gathered in dense layers. After the ninth recitation, the Pure and True (玉真) descended in response, and wondrous blessings were revealed in profound mystery. After the tenth recitation, the transformation reached the utmost realms, and both heavenly and human beings sighed in awe. At that time, all men and women within the land, without exception, turned their hearts in reverence, all receiving protection and attaining eternal life.*

The Dao speaks: *"At that time, when the Heavenly True One first recited the scripture, the Great God of Boundless Degree from the Eastern World of True Virtue (真贤) arrived, along with his countless retinue, ascending through the void. When the second recitation was complete, the Great God of Boundless Degree from the Southern World of Palmy Wisdom (慧观) came, with his countless retinue ascending through the void. When the third recitation was complete, the Great God of Boundless Degree from the Western World of Tranquil Immortals (定仙) arrived, with his countless retinue ascending through the void. When the fourth recitation was complete, the Great God of Boundless Degree from the Northern World of Constant Benevolence (常善) came, with his countless retinue ascending through the void. When the fifth recitation was complete, the Great God of Boundless Degree from the Northeast World of Illuminating Obscurity (明微) arrived, with his countless retinue ascending through the void. When the sixth recitation was complete, the Great God of Boundless Degree from the Southeast World of Sacred Virtue (灵德) came, with his countless retinue ascending through the void. When the seventh recitation was complete, the Great God of Boundless Degree from the Southwest World of Tranquil Seas (海静) arrived, with his countless retinue ascending through the void. When the eighth recitation was complete, the Great God of Boundless Degree from the Northwest World of Primordial Sovereignty (元皇) came, with his countless retinue ascending through the void. When the ninth recitation was complete, the Great God of Boundless Degree from the Upper World of Piercing Void (洞虚) arrived, with his countless retinue ascending through the void. When the tenth recitation was complete, the Great God of Boundless Degree from the Lower World of Permeating Light (通光) came, with his countless retinue ascending through the void. After the tenfold recitation was complete, the Great Gods of Boundless Degree from all Ten Directions’ worlds arrived simultaneously, and all men and women within the land turned their hearts in devotion, petitioning the Celestial Sovereign with boundless compassion to universally benefit the tenfold realms of the Lower Element (下元), dispelling the malignant miasmas of mountain valleys for all sentient beings, preserving life and safeguarding form.*

The scripture then expounded upon the mountains and valleys of the universal realm, the hidden depths of caves and groves, where myriad ghosts and spirits lurk in concealment or wander at will, alongside the evil and venomous spirits who follow their commands, gathering in factions to unleash their toxic *qi*. The malignant miasmas infest the people, and the Heavenly True One’s divine text collects and dispels them, causing all harm to vanish forever. At that moment, the arriving immortals and celestial deities swarmed like clouds and rain, their ranks stretching in orderly rows around the land, filling half of every realm with their presence—an assembly beyond restraint.

Then, the Heavenly True One fixed his gaze and lowered his brow, surveying the land with distant vision. He gently raised his jade voice and universally declared to the assembly: ‘The Yellow Turban (混黄) established the Pole (立极), from which all ten thousand phenomena were born. Thus arose the thirty-six thousand heavens and earths, the thirty-six thousand suns and moons, and again the Great Three Thousand Worlds, the Middle Three Thousand Worlds, and the Small Three Thousand Worlds. Each world, in its turn, bears its own kind, dividing into clans and lineages. The thirty-six thousand mountain valleys lie within these worlds, followed by the twenty-three thousand, twelve thousand, one thousand two hundred, and three hundred sixty mountain valleys, which form the heavens and earths of the worlds. The stagnant waters, marshes, and valleys of the mountains generate venomous, cruel, and grotesque serpents and scorpions, great and small insects, who ride the morning *qi*, exhaling and inhaling to form poisonous mists that shroud the world. Men and women dwelling near these valleys, breathing and consuming their tainted essence, absorb their malevolence, contracting the miasmas that lead to premature death and widespread ruin across the land."*

With the *Law-Wisdom*, I revealed the divine talismans and methods of exorcism, so that the people of the world might be nourished and at peace, and those who practice might attain the Dao. The great assembly praised and all wished to hear it.

When the Primordial Origin first established the wondrous teaching, he suspended a precious jewel in the void, as large as a millet grain, five *zhang* above the earth. The Primordial Origin then summoned the Celestial True Gods—highest saints and exalted ones of wondrous conduct—the ten-directional Infinite World’s Exorcism Mountain-Valley Pestilence Gods, countless in number, all entering the jewel. The heavenly beings looked up and saw only a surging flow entering the jewel’s mouth; once inside, their whereabouts were unknown. The people dispersed, the land returned to level ground, and no longer sank or tilted.

Within the jewel, the Primordial Origin completed the recitation of the scripture. The assembled True Ones, overseeing the salvation of all, transmitted it to me. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words. The ritual matters were fully attended to; the celestial beings resumed their stations, and in an instant, all was silent, leaving no trace.

At that time, those who encountered the scripture and its law were universally saved and delivered, preserving their natural lifespan without injury. The land’s people turned in reverence, all cultivating virtuous intentions.

They were neither deceitful nor false, neither unrestrained nor idle, neither arrogant nor haughty, neither deceitful nor confused. Their speech was pure and upright, their bearing dignified and composed. They were harmonized in unity and tranquility, and those of differing natures became kindred. The nation was secure, the people prospered, and all rejoiced in great peace. The teaching began to spread, and the entire land was guided by the Dao.

Those with sincere devotion, who revered and honored it, all attained salvation for the world.

The Dao speaks: The names spoken in the scripture by the Primordial Celestial Venerable are the inner names of the celestial sovereigns, hidden in their resonant tones. They are also the inner taboos of the True Kings, the secret names of the Exorcism Mountain-Valley Pestilence Hundred Spirits, not the common words of the world. The Highest Saints, having already become True Persons, penetrated the Mysterious and fathomed the subtle. They commanded the mountain-valley pestilence to cease its evil poisonous spirits and ghosts, resolving the causes of calamity, suppressing sickness and harm, and safeguarding the people.

Those who master its verses and recite them ten times will have the celestial beings chanting in response from afar, the Northern Emperor offering rites, the ghosts and spirits restraining their poisons, the mountain valleys concealing their clouds, the pestilence unable to spread, the myriad people at peace, the demons bound in form, the ghostly essences extinguished, the dead revived, and white bones restored to life.

Scholars who recite it ten times will have the Five Emperors attending as guards, the Three Realms bowing in homage, the demonic essences losing their sight, the ghostly spirits extinguished, the dying saved, and the dead revived.

This is so because scholars dwelling in the True Mountain Valleys align with the Mysterious Dao; without need of exorcism, they are naturally free from pestilence. If the impure *qi* has not yet dissipated and the body has not yet penetrated to the True, though they may command the ten directions and their威 cannot yet govern celestial authority, their virtue can subdue and bind earthly spirits, restraining demonic spirits, exorcising pestilence, and saving the world—yet they can only repel sickness, not attain longevity.

Reciting this lightly will bring misfortune upon oneself.

Honoring and venerating it will bring prosperity to one’s household, generation after generation, and eternal flourishing, aligning with virtuous causes. A myriad calamities will not approach, and divine spirits will guard the gate.

This scripture is exalted and wondrous, its blessings and wisdom natural, its salvation of beings boundless, and it stands as the foundation for saving all things. Its grandeur is vast, its virtue beyond measure.

The Dao speaks: For those who recite this scripture ten times, the Exorcism Mountain-Valley Pestilence Gods of the ten directions will all assemble. The poisonous and evil *qi*, great and small serpents and scorpions, exhaling foul vapors that harm the living and destroy life—when this profound text is recited, the pestilence will vanish.

The mountain valleys of the ten directions are all under the dominion of pestilence gods. There are seven Immortal Boy Attendants, seven Year-King Attendants, twelve Seasonal Attendants, seventy-two Pestilence Master Immortals, the Disease Master Immortal Mother, the pestilence-controlling Ouyang Divine Lord, the Hua Immortal Gu Master, Zhang Master, Zhong Master, Li Master, and Bai Master, along with the Ghostly Marshal of Pestilence Disease, the Exalted Emperor’s decree. They swiftly suppress the poisonous *qi*, the malevolent spirits of the mountain valleys, resolving the accumulated transmission of pestilence across ages, exorcising disasters and guilt, and establishing a barrier against calamity.

Longevity descends as True Ones, blessings and fortune endure, purity and spirit are unobstructed, and the gods protect. As the talisman decrees, the sickness *qi* is dispelled. Those who earnestly study this scripture, fulfilling its merits and virtues, will all become Immortals, ascending to the Golden Gate and feasting in the Jade Capital.

Scholars who practice and recite this scripture will find that the mountain-valley evils and worldly plagues dare not harm them. Their spiritual *qi* will be complete, and they will immediately be received into transcendence, ascending to the Southern Palace.

If mortals recite it, their lifespan will be prolonged, and they will all attain the method of *shixie* (body dissolution). Their spirits will temporarily perish, avoiding the underworld, and they will immediately return to form, wandering the boundless void.

This scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally salvaging without end. All heavenly beings will rejoice in its blessings, and boundless merit will bestow life and death with grace.

It is a treasure of the heavens, not transmitted to the world below. Only those who carry gold and jade with sincere devotion, swearing to the heavens to pass it on, may do so. Leakage or negligence will bring calamity upon the nine ancestors, and eternal servitude in the ghostly bureaucracy.

The Five Emperors, along with twenty-four Jade Boys and twenty-four Jade Girls, attend as guardians, protecting those who receive the scripture.

The Dao speaks: In the first month, observing a long fast and reciting this scripture will exorcise the spring and summer mountain-valley pestilence, preventing it from infecting the living and becoming the spirits of the departed. It will sever the bonds of the underworld, delivering them to the Southern Palace.

In the seventh month, observing a long fast and reciting this scripture will exorcise the autumn mountain-valley pestilence, preventing it from infecting the living, and the body will attain immortality. The names of all will be recorded in the celestial registers, the yellow talismans and white tablets will erase death and bring rebirth.

In the tenth month, observing a long fast and reciting this scripture will exorcise the winter mountain-valley pestilence, preventing it from infecting the living, and will ensure the stability of the imperial lineage of the land.

「Thus, the Dao ensures eternal preservation of Heaven, unending across generations, perpetually as a sovereign for humankind, bringing stability to the realm, and the people herald a Great Peace.

On the eight seasonal festivals, reciting this scripture will exorcise the mountain-valley pestilence of the respective time, preventing it from infecting the living, and one will attain the status of the True Person of the Nine Palaces.

On the day of one’s birth-star, reciting this scripture will exorcise the mountain-valley pestilence, preventing it from afflicting the living on the day of their birth-star’s punishment, or when their birth-star clashes with the star of death and defeat, thus averting the transmission of poisonous *qi* and calamity upon their fateful body.

With the soul and spirit clarified and rectified, the myriad *qi* endure eternally, free from suffering and torment, the body radiant with luminosity, guarding the Three Realms, attended by the Five Emperors, honored by the myriad spirits. Their names are inscribed in Heaven’s registers, their virtue and power fulfilled, ascending to the Upper Pure Realm.

The Dao states: On the day of one’s birth-star, all should bathe in fragrant water, fast and enter the chamber. Facing southeast, they should strike their teeth thirty-two times, ascending to hear the Thirty-two Heavens, bowing in heart to the Thirty-two Offenses. With eyes closed, they should quietly contemplate their body seated amidst the three-colored *qi* of Azure, Vermilion, and Yellow clouds—within and without, the *qi* becomes dense and true. There appear the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Tortoise, Lion, and White Crane, arrayed on either side, with the sun and moon casting brilliant light, illuminating the chamber’s interior. This exorcises the Great Spirits, and all guardians gather in full attendance.

A round symbol forms at the nape.
Light shines in all ten directions, thus clear and distinct.»

The Secret Incantation declares:

*"Supreme Dao of Primordial Mystery, Sovereign Lord of Highest Dao.
Summon forth my servant’s body, the Three-Five* **Functionaries** *of office, left and right officials and messengers, the retinue of fragrant jade, the proclamation of the jade maidens, the Five Emperors’ straight talismans, and the Straight-Day Fragrant Officials—each thirty-six in number—unlocking the spoken commands.

On this auspicious day of joy, with a prolonged fast in the pure hall,
practicing the sacred scriptures, boundless salvation for all.
May the commands I unlock ascend to the Supreme,
directly reaching the Most Venerable Primordial Sovereign of the Thirty-Two Heavens.

The divine and true unfold, universally benefiting Heaven and humankind.

Today, we dispel pestilence and plague, seize and subdue malevolent vapors, pray for the dissipation of calamities and demons, exterminate the roots of misfortune, and cut away the scourges of sickness. We report to the Jade Sovereign, the True King’s protection, sealing the gates of death.

The Eastern Sovereign beheads the poison, the Western Sovereign records the essence, the Northern Sovereign purifies the filth, the Southern True One guards the form, the Central Sovereign, the Supreme One, governs the authority of transformation, regulating the flow of true *qi* and dispersing the demonic mists.

The Azure Sovereign spreads harmony, the White Sovereign brings tranquility, the Vermilion Sovereign stirs the flames, the Black Sovereign nourishes the dew, the Yellow Sovereign oversees life—let none perish prematurely.

The Azure Mountain Demon King restrains the flying calamities.
The Vermilion Mountain Demon King strikes down disasters and repels evil.
The White Mountain Demon King wields his blade with mighty force.
The Black Mountain Demon King brandishes his spear with fierce resolve.
The Yellow Mountain Demon King commands awe and assists with wings.

Brandishing weapons and unfurling banners, they dispel all ill omens.
They assist the Mysterious Transformation, aligning with the Dao’s achievements.
The Heavens measure humanity, revealing the true winds.
No deceitful spirits act, and wondrous transformations clarify.

Ten thousand kinds of malevolent beings are annihilated, reduced to dust.
In the black ravines and desolate wilds, even the depths of the underworld are reached.
The *Qú* and *Xī* demons, the *Chīméi*—guests who feast on blood—
beat their drums and summon their forces, riding the dark currents.
Their bells chime, their axes cleave—golden blades sever their forms.
The Primordial Command is proclaimed: dare any delay?
The plague demons vanish, the miasma of pestilence is extinguished.

The Three Officials of the Northern *Tíng*—clearly inspecting the ghostly camps—
none may hide; the *Jīnmǎ Yì* presents them.
A universal proclamation is issued; ten thousand spirits listen.
The Three Realms’ Five Sovereigns speak to the Supreme Clarity.

*Red inscription:* "Repel Mountain Pestilence" —*Jiěhuì* talisman. Place in a water basin.

At the origin of Heaven’s beginning, before the ten thousand kalpas,
Vast ancestral kalpas, the chaotic yellow void.
Condensing essence to nurture, blending to plant the heavens and earth.
Yin and yang ascending and descending, the four seasons advancing.
Within, the pestilential *qi* forms, transforming into toxic essence.
The mother of poison is called *Bèixiān*.
She inhales the scorched *qi* of wood, absorbs the moisture of dried springs,
crafting pestilence and plague, lurking in the murky heavens.
Her form is a wild bird with nine connected heads,
its cry like infant wailing, circling the eight mountains.
Those who encounter it fall ill, their strength wasted.

The Heavenly Treasure Sovereign subdues this evil source,
named the *Chìlíng*, clad in crimson and gold.
His might is boundless, saving all beings,
crushing the strong and summoning the pure *qi*,
bringing order to the myriad.

The *Tàipíng* diagram opens, the natural course flows.
The Primordial Foundation is established, the Five Scriptures unfold.
In red script, with jade characters, the Eight Dragon威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威

「The Dao harmonizes the Five *Qi* within,
blending the myriad deities into one.
Tenfold rotation returns the soul’s essence,
ten thousand *Qi* ascend to the realm of the Immortal.

The Immortal Way values life’s preservation,
its boundless compassion extends to all.
Earth’s portals, Heaven’s gates—
the Sun’s chariot, the Moon’s wheel—
follow the Dao’s rectitude of *Qi*,
healing sickness, granting life’s renewal.

In mountain valleys, malevolent *Qi* flows,
but with rites of exorcism, its harm is forever dispelled.
Guarding life’s passage, one secures rebirth,
ascending to hear the celestial hosts.

Above all heavens, each has its own gate of life.
Within lies the *Kōngdòng* hymn of void and song,
the True King’s sacred scripture,
the marvelous transformation of jade inscriptions.

**First Exorcism Hymn** dispels the mountain valley’s pestilential *Qi* and cries—
lofty and distant, its divine efficacy knows no end.
It commands the rectified *Qi* to purify,
sweeping away all malevolent influences.
The rectified *Qi* guards life’s vitality,
while the perverse is ruthlessly eradicated.
When demonic poisons vanish without trace,
and monstrous calamities are extinguished at their source—
the malevolent *Qi* that harms the True,
the rebellious *Qi* that clings and entangles—
the *Yùqīng* King of Consummate Purity dispels all maladies with wondrous efficacy.
His resonant voice calms the mountains,
while the *Tàihé* harmonizes in resplendent song.
The roots of misfortune are scattered,
and pestilential *Qi* leaves no remnant behind.
Alas, my myriad bodies,
unaware of the hymns within the void!
Cut down in their prime, their forms destroyed,
what sorrow and injustice shall they endure?
Without encountering the void’s sacred sound,
how could they escape the net of the world?

**Second Exorcism Hymn** dispels the *Línggǎn*—
the Four *Qi* untrammelled, all calamities extinguished.
Pestilential *Qi*, demonic poisons, malevolent spirits, and errant *Qi*—
the divine talisman drives them away,
its radiant power resplendent and awe-inspiring.
The celestial saints command the soaring *Qi*,
holding the ritual bell in solemn procession,
sweeping away all inauspiciousness.
It purges the Ten Realms,
dissolving all impurities and filth.
Distant afflictions are averted,
tranquility restored by nature’s own accord.
Life’s passage through this trial,
boundless Dao’s mercy bestowed.
This joy relies upon my existence—
the harmonized *Qi* flows boundlessly,
uniting with the Dao’s True essence.
The *Língbǎo* Supreme Method,
the *Yuānshǐ* Jade Text—
no evil it cannot dispel,
no knot it cannot untie.
Its protection is endless,
a bridge for all sentient beings.
Fear not, lest you fail to comprehend,
for this hymn is set forth for you.

**Third Hymn: The True King’s Summoning of the Pure****
Bright and resplendent is the dawn,
illuminating the jade celestial realm.
It issues commands to the ten thousand spirits,
uniting to subdue all demons.
The divine *Jīn* and void scriptures,
summon and regulate the gathered souls.
They guard the world’s transformations,
expounding my luminous teachings.
Those who revere my doctrine,
thus secure longevity’s blessings.
No calamity shall prevail,
in peaceful repose, free from all fears.
The Most High, moved by compassion,
reveals this jade scripture.
It banishes suffering and poison,
my Way never falters.
The True Way cherishes life,
the perverse Way meets untimely ruin.
Follow my True Way,
and align with my True essence.
The True Way is ever steadfast,
no sickness or misfortune shall intrude.
If one fails to know this Way,
how may they invoke the myriad deities?

The True King’s divine might dominates the eight directions,
his *Virtue* renews life’s eternal span.
Above the Three Realms, within the void,
the True King’s hymns resound—
their tones echoing the sacred *Dòng* scriptures.
Recite them universally,
and pestilential calamities shall dissolve.
Recite them ten thousand times,
and malevolent *Qi* shall not take root.
The Dao is fully manifest,
protecting longevity for all.
It transcends the Three Realms,
ranked among the Immortals.
Those who hear the sacred sound,
the Five Peaks guard their forms.
The earthly spirits are commanded,
to escort and welcome them.
They extract them from misfortune,
dispel all inauspiciousness.
The Seven Ancestors ascend,
forever freed from the Northern Peak’s trials.
Their souls cross the *Zhūlíng*,
refined and reborn anew.
This is called boundless,
universal liberation without end.

There is a hidden celestial text,
revered by all the heavens.
To reveal it carelessly,
or to neglect its solemnity,
is to fall into the hells of earth,
and bring ruin upon the Seven Ancestors.
The Dao declares: These two hymns
are the hidden sounds of the Celestial Sovereigns,
the True King of the *Shénxiāo* and the *Yùqīng*.
They dispel the mountain valleys’ malevolent *Qi*,
uniting scattered spirits,
and the strange and perverse *Qi* of insects and spices,
the irregular *Qi* of the four seasons,
which coalesce into pestilence.
Light ailments afflict a household,
heavy epidemics ravage towns and cities,
even nations.
The Most High, in compassion,
reveals the hidden talismans and scriptures
to dispel afflictions and protect the living.
All are the words of the Great *Dàfàn*,
uncommon in the mortal realm.
They lack melodic grace,
their verses unadorned.
Thus called profound and mysterious,
difficult to fathom in detail.
The heavens’ treasures,
hidden in the *Shénxiāo Yùqīng*’s Eastern Chamber of Scriptures,
were revealed in the year *Rénchén*,
in accordance with the celestial mandate.
If a perfected adept brings a heart of golden sincerity,
and in accordance with ancient rites,
pledges allegiance to the True King,
then the text shall be entrusted to them.

The Dao declares: The *Qi* of mountain valleys
varies in ease and difficulty,
differing in elevation and depth,
uneven in cold and damp.
Where the *Qi* reaches, its timing is not uniform—
high places are colder,
low places damper,
warm insects do not nest evenly,
flowing waters do not moisten all.
Poisonous serpents and strange creatures,
riding the *Qi* to stir malevolence,
metals and stones—dry or damp—
when stagnant *Qi* condenses into mist,
wandering spirits and pestilential ghosts
float among them, striking mortals,
and causing sickness and suffering.
The Most High and divine sages
teach two methods of exorcism and dispelling.
If the *Qi* of sickness is rampant,
spreading through villages and towns,
then one must purify the heart,
observe fasts, perform incense rites,
and wear the talismans and scriptures
to dispel it in accordance with the Method.

Again, with the *Dàfàn*’s hidden words written in vermilion,
burn them to ash,
mix with clear water,
and let all drink it—
none shall fail to find peace.

If the seasonal *Qi* is unfavorable,
or if one must traverse mountain valleys,
preparations for exorcism must be made beforehand.
Set up an altar in the dwelling place,
and perform rites to the Twelve Yearly Kings,
the mountain valley’s wandering sickness,
the Five Directions’ celestial emissaries,
and the *Shào Hòu* Divine Lords within and without.
Apply talismans in the Five Directions,
and seal the *Ānbīng* with peach and willow wood,
mugwort, and bamboo leaves,
boiled into water and stored in bottles.
Drink or bathe in it according to need,
or place the *Dàfàn*’s hidden words in vermilion
in the appropriate direction.
Then the pestilence shall disperse,
and the towns shall return to calm.

Perform incense rites at the six times of day,
recite the scriptures ten thousand times,
and blessings shall descend in abundance,
consuming all inauspiciousness.
The boundless text,
universal liberation without end.

The Dao declares: The unlearned, shallow in their understanding,
or those whose Immortal essence is yet incomplete,
may mistakenly encounter pestilential *Qi*,
and fail to dispel it.
When their fate is sealed by the celestial mandate,
their bodies pass through the *Tàiyīn*.
At the moment of crossing,
let fellow adepts and perfected ones
perform incense rites for them,
and recite the scriptures ten thousand times,
to guide their mortal forms across in accordance with the Method.»

The soul and spirit ascend straight to the Southern Palace,
according to one’s learning and merit, reckoning the days to attain rebirth.

The Wheel of Transformation, free from doubt, grants divinity and immortality.

The Dao declares: When yin and yang are discordant,
one must observe fasts, perform incense rites, and recite scriptures.
When pestilence arises from transgression,
and epidemic poisons spread,
one must observe fasts, perform incense rites, and recite scriptures.
When malevolent spirits run rampant,
harassing the living,
one must observe fasts, perform incense rites, and recite scriptures.
When dark spirits are broken and assail the true essence,
one must observe fasts, perform incense rites, and recite scriptures.
When summoning auspiciousness and pacifying the home,
one must observe fasts, perform incense rites, and recite scriptures.

Fasting and reciting scriptures bear great virtue.
They dispel celestial calamities above and avert poisons below,
saving the myriad people.
Life and death depend upon them.
Their blessings are boundless.
Thus it is said: infinite, universally liberating all beings—both heavenly and human.

The Dao declares: Whoever possesses this scripture
can perform these deeds of virtue for all the myriad people.
On days of calamity, if one takes the vow to fast, burn incense,
and recite the scriptures ten thousand times,
all the heavens will record their name,
ten thousand spirits will guard them,
and the perfected ones of the Right Path will ensure they become
a saintly minister beneath the Golden Gate of the Celestial Sovereign.

The heavens record every deed and transgression without omission.
The true and authentic in the Celestial Realm also advocate for your life,
and those who attain the Dao must fully comprehend these profound words.

The hidden speech of the Great Brahman in the Celestial Realm is boundless in sound.
Composed by the Dao Lord,
the *Yuan Shi Ling Shu* for dispelling mountain-valley pestilence,
the *Yu Pian* of the Eastern Eight Heavens.

「The Eight Heavens of the Northern Peak refine their essence, carving mists into hollows where phoenixes dwell.
They slay tigers, centipedes, and serpents with the true *Gan* thunder,
and dispatch the *Tao* spirits of withered willows and moonlit mushrooms.
The *Hu* lizards vanish in seclusion, while the *Ma* talismans and *Yi* demons are struck down.
They shear away sand-dwelling beasts from cliffs, and the dragonflies of the *Yu* flow with crimson elixir.
The *Zi* soil is purified of its rigid *Qiang* force,
and distant decrees command the *Kui* spirits to depart.

In dreams, they transform and awaken the sages,
while the *Zhao* and *Shao* masters gather the vital *Ling*.
The *Qi* currents scour the ocean’s depths,
and nature itself congeals in accordance with their essence.

**The Eight Heavens of the South**—the *She* Marshal and *Hou* Lord,
the Three Masters of the Southern Treasury—
exert their strength to repel calamity and disperse pestilence,
as the *Lao* Father and *Xi* Dragon take their stand.
The *Jiao* hooks and *Yi* nets assist in leisurely repose,
while the *Chi* Pond and *Meng* Swamps are tamed.
They seize fate with talismans and orders,
and turn the blazing fire into a fleeing wind.
The *Shi* prisons lock away the restless,
and the boundless void attains its utmost grandeur.

From their emergence, they manifest in boundless transformation,
and their vast deeds turn stones into sacred power.
They wield branches to channel the *Ling*,
and discern the *Jing* to slay the *Tong* demons.
The Dao wanders through celestial splendor,
and the shores are commanded to cease their tumult.

**The Eight Heavens of the West**—the *Cui* and *Du* Overseers drive away evils,
and the *Jin* talismans swiftly capture the *Gao* female spirits.
The *Qin* orchids and *Lan* grasses hang from *Chui* branches,
while the *Yi* treasures flourish in the farthest east.
They nurture the autumnal sages with reverent texts,
and hold fast to the *Jue* vessels with solemn devotion.
The *Mao* fruits scatter in wild abundance,
and the *Yun* spirits dwell in the *Bao* center.
The *Ma* talismans banish the *Xuan* demons,
while the *Yun* villages are guarded by the *Geng* clan.
The *Dian* halls unite in solitary splendor,
and the *Ming* peaks shine with keen spirits.
The *Kun* and *Lu* realms stretch into the azure depths,
and the *Lun* grasses descend in ranked patterns.

In solitude, they dispel the *Huang* curses,
and the *Ruan* demons flee to the *Yi* marshes.

**The Eight Heavens of the North**—the *Zhen* and *Bo* spirits,
their flaming pearls gating the celestial threshold.
The *Tai* Sovereign of the Left stands firm,
while the *Niu* caldrons float with jade-like clarity.
The *Xian* children depart from harm,
and the *Lu* sages transform into the *Xuan* mysteries.
The *Bo* waves subside at the *Yin* stones,
and the *He* and *Geng* voices proclaim their hidden depths.
The *Zheng* Marshals record hunger’s plight,
and the *Lu* talismans capture the *Xiu* demons.
The springs converge in piercing insight,
and the *Chi* Heavens flow with *Ying* patterns.
They station themselves to dispel poison,
and sever the *Heng* hooks that cross their path.
Those who violate the *Lu* are struck with sorrowful clarity,
and the *Ting* officials bear the *Chuan* pendants of office.

The Dao speaks: These are the hidden words of the Great Brahman in the Eight Heavens,
their boundless sounds inscribed in ancient texts upon the *Lang* Wind and *Xuan* platforms,
to repel ten thousand evils. Not only do they dispel mountain-valley pestilence,
but all manner of malevolent diseases wrought by ghosts and spirits.
By observing the law and commanding them thus,
all shall see immediate results.
Each character is broad and long—one *zhang* in measure.»

The Celestial True Man of old inscribed these words,
establishing them as the true sounds.
Those who know these sounds and, through fasting, recite them,
shall see the Ten Directions’ divine kings descend from the heavens,
observing their bodies and recording their merits and diligence,
then reporting to the heavens above.
All spirits shall pay homage in reverence,
while earthly deities attend at the gates.

This *sutra* spreads far and wide, universally saving all beings,
curing diseases and dispelling malevolence,
eradicating calamity and disaster.
It honors the True King’s great merit,
recommends one to the High Purity Dao,
fulfills all its teachings,
and allows one to roam the Three Realms,
ascending to the Golden Gate.

This sound repels all that it encounters,
dispels all malevolence,
transcends all obstacles,
and fulfills all desires—
the natural sound of the Celestial True One.

Thus, when recited, it draws the Ten Directions’ observation,
the Sovereign of Heaven sings in response,
all spirits pay homage,
the Three Realms attend in reverence,
demons bow their heads,
ghostly spirits perish of their own accord,
the *linlang* chimes resound,
the Ten Directions fall silent and pure,
rivers and seas grow still,
mountains and hills swallow their mists,
all spirits submit in awe.
It gathers all the sages,
leaving Heaven free of haze and Earth free of demonic dust,
the dark wisdom clears with perfect insight—
a boundless, profound virtue indeed.

**Completion of the Forty-Fifth Volume of the Supreme Treasure *Sutra* of Infinite Degrees, Most Wondrous Scripture**
**Beginning of the Forty-Sixth Volume**

The **Sutra of Infinite Degrees, Most Wondrous Scripture**—
**Chapter on Expelling and Warding Off Water-Fire Deluge and Conflagration**

The Dao speaks: Once, in the realm of Tranquil Rejoicing Heaven,
the Song of the Boundless Fearless Soil ascended the Green Void,
where I received the **Mystic Scripture of Infinite Degrees**—
the **Supreme Scripture of Expelling and Warding Off Water-Fire Deluge and Conflagration**—
from the **Venerable Sovereign of Primordial Beginnings**.
When this scripture was proclaimed,
the **Venerable Sovereign of Primordial Beginnings** would first recite it forty times,
summoning the Ten Directions,
before arriving at the seat.

The **Celestial True Ones**, the **Supreme Saints of High Veneration**,
the **Great Generals of Water and Fire**, with their legions and officers,
the officials of Floods and Blazes, the **True Persons of Rescue and Liberation**,
and countless **untethered spirits**—
all mounted the void and came forth.

With **crimson and black clouds** racing,
**tiger-chariots** and armored steeds,
**golden banners** and **crimson flags**,
**emerald parasols** and **vermilion canopies**—
thunderous as **crackling lightning**, winds as **mighty as mountains**,
radiant hues and auspicious lights,
**ethereal and dense**—
illuminating the **Great Void**.

For seven days and seven nights,
the **palaces of all Heavens** trembled with celestial keys,
the halls and towers swayed,
the sun, moon, and stars
cast forth **sacred beams**, blazing and resplendent,
their wheels halted in stillness.

**Celestial hymns** hung in the clouds,
**circumambient mists** swirled around the Dipper,
**jade reflections** drifted lightly,
**purple vapors** coiled into towers—
all mountains, rivers, forests, and trees
flattened into equal levels,
no longer high or low,
the earth transformed into **uniform jade**, without variation.

The **multitude of True Ones** awaited the seat,
while the **Venerable Sovereign of Primordial Beginnings**,
ascending the **five-colored natural flying platform**,
took his **void-suspended lotus seat** of ten *huá* in height.

At the **first recitation** of the scripture,
all **Great Saints of the Heavens** simultaneously praised its excellence.
Then, the people of the land—
men and women alike—
received blessings from the Heavens,
enduring perpetual joy in the **Dao’s transformation**.

At the **second recitation**,
the **Heavenly Ministers of the Celestial Minor**,
and the **Water and Fire officials**,
recorded their merits and extolled their virtues,
balancing the **yin and yang**.

At the **third recitation**,
the **Sovereign of the Sun** presented his tablet,
and the **Lady of the Moon** bowed in reverence.

At the **fourth recitation**,
the **Two Luminaries** and **Three Primordials**
all came to submit their commands.

At the **fifth recitation**,
the **Mother of Water** operated her mechanisms,
extending the **eons and ages**,
while the **Fire Officials** spread their calculations,
increasing the **years and lifespans**.

At the **sixth recitation**,
punishments were meted out justly,
with no wrongful excess.

At the **seventh recitation**,
the **sufferings of deluge and conflagration** ceased,
and the **karmic debts of burning and drowning** were extinguished.

At the **eighth recitation**,
the **Three Realms** found peace and security,
no longer disturbed by fear.

At the **ninth recitation**,
the **Earthly Furnaces** and **Heavenly Kilns**
aligned in **harmonious submission**.

At the **tenth recitation**,
all **calamitous fates** were resolved,
and **all beings** attained **serene repose**.

At that time, the people of the land—
men and women alike—
all turned their hearts in devotion,
receiving protection and liberation,
each attaining **eternal life**.

The Dao speaks: Then,
at the **first recitation**,
the **Great God of Water-Fire Administration** from the **Boundless Infinite Degree** of the East,
with his **untethered spirits**,
floated through the void and arrived.

At the **second recitation**,
the **Great God of Water-Fire Inspection** from the **Boundless Infinite Degree** of the South,
with his **untethered spirits**,
floated through the void and arrived.

At the **third recitation**,
the **Great God of Water-Fire Punishment** from the **Boundless Infinite Degree** of the West,
with his **untethered spirits**,
floated through the void and arrived.

At the **fourth recitation**,
the **Great God of Water-Fire Rectification** from the **Boundless Infinite Degree** of the North,
with his **untethered spirits**,
floated through the void and arrived.

At the **fifth recitation**,
the **Great God of Water-Fire Calamity** from the **Boundless Infinite Degree** of the Northeast,
with his **untethered spirits**,
floated through the void and arrived.

At the **sixth recitation**,
the **Great God of Water-Fire Command** from the **Boundless Infinite Degree** of the Southeast,
with his **untethered spirits**,
floated through the void and arrived.

At the **seventh recitation**,
the **Great God of Water-Fire Registration** from the **Boundless Infinite Degree** of the Southwest,
with his **untethered spirits**,
floated through the void and arrived.

At the **eighth recitation**,
the **Great God of Water-Fire Prohibition** from the **Boundless Infinite Degree** of the Northwest,
with his **untethered spirits**,
floated through the void and arrived.

At the **ninth recitation**,
the **Great God of Water-Fire Destiny** from the **Boundless Infinite Degree** of the Upper Realm,
with his **untethered spirits**,
floated through the void and arrived.

At the **tenth recitation**,
the **Great God of Water-Fire Non-Conformity** from the **Boundless Infinite Degree** of the Lower Realm,
with his **untethered spirits**,
floated through the void and arrived.

When the **ten recitations** were complete,
the **Ten Directions’ Great Gods of Water-Fire Administration and Registration**
all arrived at once.
The people of the land—
men and women alike—
turned their hearts in devotion and reverence.

All who came bowed their heads in homage,
praising and marveling at the **Venerable Sovereign’s attained enlightenment**.
They prayed not to suffer **great or small water-fire calamities**,
nor the **difficulties of transmigration** through the Three Realms.
While still in this worldly form,
they prayed not to endure the **water-fire deluge and burning**,
nor to be recorded by the **Three Officials** as guilty,
condemned to **water-fire punishments**,
or **deluge and conflagration** as retribution.
They begged the **Two Officials** to govern harmoniously,
balancing the **Heavenly Order** and **human realm**,
clearing the **ghostly paths**,
and subduing the **evil spirits and deities**,
so that no **untethered spirits** would recklessly **flood or ignite**,
nor create **unjust calamities**.

With bowed heads to the **Primordial Sovereign**,
they rejoiced at hearing the **most essential truths**.
Each offered their **celestial treasures and wondrous implements**—
**true essences of the land**—
their power gathering like clouds,
the **untethered spirits**,
half the land’s soil suddenly **tilted and sank**,
a phenomenon beyond restraint.

Thus, the **Primordial Sovereign** cast his gaze upon the Ten Directions,
observing the assembly below.
He shook his robes and advanced his seat,
turning the Heavens and shifting the Earth,
**blowing** into **water-light**,
**exhaling** into **fire-glow**—
the **two radiant forms** flew in tandem,
**dragon-clouds** swirling gracefully,
soaring through the **void’s extremes**.
After a long while,
they transformed into a **precious pearl**,
as large as a *shǔmǐ* grain,
suspended seven *zhàng* above the earth.

The **Primordial Sovereign** then ascended,
along with the **Celestial True Ones**,
the **Supreme Saints of High Veneration**,
the **True Persons of Rescue and Liberation**,
the **Water and Fire officials and their legions**,
the **Great Gods of Deluge, Drowning, and Punishment**,
and the **untethered spirits**—
all entering the **precious pearl**.

The **Heavenly Beings** looked upward,
only seeing **a brilliant radiance** emerge from the pearl’s mouth.
Once inside,
they vanished from sight.
The people of the land dispersed,
the earth returning to its **level and upright state**,
no longer tilted or sunken.

The **Primordial Sovereign** then,
within the **precious pearl**,
completed the recitation of the scripture.
The **multitude of True Ones** oversaw the transmission,
bestowing it upon me.
At that moment,
joy and celebration were beyond words.

The **dharma-assembly** concluded,
the **Heavens restored to their stations**,
and in an instant,
all was **utterly silent**, leaving no trace of sound.
Then, those who encountered the **scripture’s teachings**
universally received **salvation and deliverance**,
their **original lifespans** preserved,
no **mid-life injuries**,
all the land’s people bowing in reverence,
each cultivating **good intentions**.

「Not fierce nor wrathful,
not extravagant nor swift,
not probing nor swaying,
not scattering nor timely,
not flattering nor yielding.

Words prized for clarity,
no foul utterance from the lips,
unity in loving-kindness,
diversity in kinship.

The realm secure, its people flourishing,
rejoicing in great peace—
the Dao/Way’s teachings first emerged,
and all the land was governed by it.

With earnest devotion,
they revered and upheld the scripture,
all attaining salvation from the world.

The Dao/Way speaks:
Within the scripture’s recitation by the **Primordial Sovereign** (元始天尊),
all names mentioned are those of the **Heavenly Sovereigns** (诸天上帝) within,
excluding the hidden tones of **water and fire calamities** (水火漂溺焚烧).
They are also the **true kings’** (真王) forbidden names,
commanding the **water and fire officials** (水火二司) not to recklessly unleash the **two great punishments** (行发二考),
nor to harm the living.
They are the secret invocations that summon the **lords of myriad spirits** (主宰百灵),
unuttered in the common world.

The **Supreme Saints** (上圣) have already become **True Ones** (真人),
mastering the **mysteries of the profound** (通玄究微),
their **law treasures** (法宝) now manifest.
The transformations of water and fire—
seeking the source, they grasp the essence.
The blazing conflagrations and scorching violence—
they know the root causes,
and can fathom their full extent.

Reciting this tenfold,
the **Heavens** (诸天) resound in distant praise,
the **Ten Emperors** (万帝) arrange their rites,
water and fire spirits retreat in concealment,
the depths grow still and clarity prevails,
rivers and seas lie in serene silence,
the **flaming prohibitions** (赫烈防扃) are sealed—
the sun and moon pause in their courses,
the **celestial pendants** (璇玑) no longer move,
demons are bound in form,
ghostly essences vanish utterly,
flames and floods subside in repose,
and drowning perils are stilled.

The **adepts of supreme learning** (至学之士),
reciting this tenfold,
find the **black essence** (黑精) guarding its place,
the **red fiends** (赤怪) do not arise,
spells and illusions lose their power,
demonic apparitions vanish,
and salvation from water and fire perils is attained—
no more danger or calamity.

Thus it is:
For scholars whose **elixir palaces** (丹宫) are yet unformed,
when water surges and fire descends,
their bodies not yet perfected in truth,
the **two officials** (二司) are summoned,
their might not yet commanding the **Heavenly laws** (天政),
their **virtue/power** (德) can only subdue and bind the
**wandering fire and great malevolent qi** (游火大丑故气),
but they can only avert misfortune and peril,
not utterly extinguish the **two divine punishments** (水火二神) from their reckonings.

Lightly reciting this chapter
brings suffering upon oneself.

With reverent offerings and devotion,
households thrive in prosperity,
generations prosper in splendor,
aligning with **auspicious causes** (善因缘),
water and fire do not encroach,
and the **spirits of light** (神明) guard the gates.

This scripture’s grandeur is unmatched,
its steps alone traverse the **Jade Capital** (玉京),
commanding water and fire,
warding off floods and flames,
as the **foundation of ten thousand Dao/Way** (万道之宗).

The **august Great Brahman** (大梵) stands sublime,
its **virtue/power** (德) beyond measure.

The Dao/Way speaks:
The **water and fire officials** (水火二司) hold great might,
known as the **True Sovereigns of the Five Peaks** (五岳总领真君).
They command the **great floods** (大水) to drift and drown,
unleash the **violent flames** (暴火) to burn and spread,
protect the virtuous and banish the wicked,
punish the guilty—
from the **cold pools of the underworld** (地狱寒池) to the
**floods and fires of the torturer’s wheels** (火车漂焚),
the **endless torments** (重苦) of boiling punishments,
the **condemned souls** (亡魂) enslaved in the **curved springs** (泉曲),
the **fire-mountains’ halls** (火山之府),
where they are seethed and scorched—
all are under the **True Sovereign’s** dominion.

The **Heavens** have two **radiant luminaries** (二耀),
the **souls of yin and yang** (阴阳灵根),
illuminating the people below,
and bestowing blessings upon disasters—
not the power to inflict calamity or peril.

This **Great Might** (大威神),
alongside the **Nine Heavenly Life Officials** (九天司命),
the **Inspecting Envoys** (采访使者),
the **Five Peaks Venerables** (五岳丈人),
and the **Five Peaks Commanders** (五岳都司),
jointly govern water and fire.

The **punishments of water and fire** (水火之罚)
are carried out by the **Six Generals** (六将军),
who issue decrees to bring disaster.
The **Generals of Water** (主水之将):
**Du Yuanji**, the **General of the River’s Might** (河魁将军),
**Zhang Zi Hua**, the **General of Heaven’s Records** (天录将军),
**Sha Bo Huang**, the **General of the Symbols** (执符将军).

The **Generals of Fire** (主火之将):
**Liu Tian Ke**, the **General of Swift Retribution** (捷疾将军),
**Zhou Jun Cai**, the **General of Fixed Boundaries** (定界将军),
**Shi Wan Fu**, the **General of Flame Unleashed** (发火将军).

In the world,
there are **water and fire caverns** (水火之穴),
concealing the **essences of yin and yang** (阴阳之精),
which transform into the **dragons of water and fire** (水火之龙).
When people face peril,
the **flying dragons** (飞龙) descend with disaster,
and water and fire converge.

The **Northern Dipper’s edicts** (北斗中勑)
and the **Northern Sovereign’s commands** (北帝列司)
oversee the governance of the **water and fire dragon spirits** (水火神龙),
known as the **Lady of Jade Light and Violet Spirit** (玉光紫灵夫人),
with thousands of officials,
each attending to their duties.

The **ancestral souls of the living** (先世有罪幽魂),
if guilty in past lives,
suffer in the **water and fire prisons** (水火之狱),
toiling in the **water and fire services** (徒水火之役),
pouring water into the **four seething pits** (四渍之穴),
chopping wood to boil the **hundred-li cauldrons** (百里之镬).
Torrents rise to the heavens,
flames stretch across the earth—
a day and night of endless torment.

For those who recite this scripture tenfold,
the **Heavens** (诸天) gather in unison,
and the suffering souls
escape the **water prison** (水狱), ascending to the **Violet Spirit Platform** (紫台),
and the **fire prison** (火狱), rising to the **Crimson Palace** (朱官),
all granted a **nine-year reprieve** (格皆九年),
to be reborn and transformed,
becoming **noble ones** (贵人),
warding off floods and flames,
and blessings naturally arise.

For the **adepts of supreme learning** (至学之士),
when their merit is complete and **virtue/power** (德) fulfilled,
their **spiritual treasures** (灵宝) formed into elixir,
and they are born into water and fire,
**seven returns and nine rebirths** (七返九还),
all attain **immortality** (神仙),
ascending to the **Golden Gate** (金阙),
and feasting in the **Jade Capital** (玉京).

The **scholars of highest attainment** (上学之士),
practicing and reciting this scripture,
find the **true water** (真水) floating above,
the **spiritual fire** (灵火) warming below—
the sun concealed in the sea,
clouds arising from myriad caverns—
all immediately receive salvation,
ascending to the **Southern Palace** (南宫).

Those of the world who recite it
extend their lives and years,
later attaining the **way of corpse dissolution** (尸解之道).
Their **souls** (魂神) temporarily vanish,
not passing through the **underworld** (地狱),
and when water and fire perils arise,
they swiftly return to form,
wandering freely in the **Great Void** (太空).

This scripture’s subtlety is boundless,
its salvations infinite.
All **Heavenly Beings and mortals** (天人)
rejoice in its blessings,
and endless **dharma-benefits** (无量之福)
are bestowed upon life and death.

The **Heavens** treasure it,
yet do not pass it to the lower worlds.
The **adepts of supreme learning** (至士), bearing **golden treasures** (金宝) with sincere devotion,
pledge to the **Heavens** and receive its transmission.

If one **carelessly leaks or scorns** (轻泄漏慢) it,
suffering befalls the **Nine Ancestors** (九祖),
and endless servitude in the **ghostly offices** (鬼官).

The **Five Emperors** (五帝) attend this scripture,
along with **twenty-four jade boys and girls** (玉童玉女),
each guarding and protecting the **spiritual texts** (神文),
and safeguarding those who receive the scripture.

The Dao/Way speaks:
In the **first month**, observe a **long fast** (长斋),
reciting and chanting this scripture,
to sever the **underworld’s punishments** (地逮役) for the **ancestral souls of past lives** (先世亡魂),
and to absolve the **water and fire trials** (水火功考),
ascending to the **Southern Palace** (南宫).

In the **seventh month**, observe a **long fast** (长斋),
reciting and chanting this scripture,
to ward off **water and fire floods and flames** (水火漂焚),
and attain **immortality** (神仙).
The **Heavens** (诸天) record their names,
with **yellow talismans and white tablets** (黄箓白简).
Even the **dead are reborn** (削死上生).

In the **tenth month**, observe a **long fast** (长斋),
reciting and chanting this scripture,
to ward off **water and fire perils** (水火),
and harmonize the **two qi** (二气),
for **kings and sovereigns** (国王帝主),
and their **lords and ministers, fathers and sons** (君臣父子),
to stabilize the **national destiny** (国祚),
preserve the **Heavens’ longevity** (天长存),
and ensure their reigns endure forever,
constantly ruling their domains,
and their people calling it the **Great Peace** (太平).」

On the **eight festivals** (八节之日), recite and chant this scripture,
to harmonize the **red and black boundaries** (赤黑顺界),
so that all things flourish and complete,
and one attains the **Nine Palaces True Person** (九宫真人).

On one’s **birthday** (本命之日), recite and chant this scripture,
so that **yin does not usurp yang** (阴无僭阳),
and ministers remain **loyal to their sovereign** (臣忠於君).
Let **fire descend and water ascend** (火降水升),
**virtue descend while honor ascends** (德下而尊),
and **spirit and soul become pure and upright** (魂神澄正).
May **qi endure eternally** (万炁长存),
free from suffering and torment (不经苦恼),
with the body radiant and luminous (身有光明),
guarding the **Three Realms** (三界待卫),
as the **Five Emperors** (五帝) oversee and welcome,
and all spirits pay homage in reverence (万神朝礼).
One’s name is recorded in Heaven (名书上天),
and when **virtue and power are fulfilled** (功满德就),
one ascends to **Upper Clarity** (飞升上清).

The **Way** instructs:
On days of **practicing the Dao** (行道之日),
one must bathe in **fragrant water** (香汤沐浴),
observe **fasting and purity** (斋戒入室),
facing **east** (东向),
and strike the teeth **thirty-two times** (叩齿三十二通),
so that the sound reaches the **Thirty-two Heavens** (上闻三十二天).
With the heart, bow **thirty-two times** (心拜三十二通),
close the eyes,
and quietly contemplate sitting within **three-colored qi of azure, purple, and crimson clouds** (青紫绛三色云炁之中).
Within and without, all is **dark and profound** (蓊冥),

left and right officials and messengers (左右官使者),
attendants of fragrant jade boys (侍香玉童),
messenger maidens of jade (传言玉女),

with a long fast in the pure hall (长斋清堂),
practicing this sacred scripture (修行至经),
to universally deliver beings (无量度人).
May what is invoked ascend directly (愿所启上彻),

Their **flames blaze**, and they **bind dragons across the heavens**.
They **salvage mortals from Heaven**, and **severely command the Northern Underworld**.

The **True Kings receive their mandates**, **rescuing from disaster** and **welcoming auspicious signs**.
The **Eight Mighty Guards** escort the **celestial chariot**, and **ferocious steeds** patrol the **boundaries**.
The **Flying Heavenly** extinguishes fire, and the **Great Marshal** blocks the **ocean’s tide**.
They **dispel horizontal calamities**, **ward off collisions**, and **strike down rebellious forces**.
Any who **dare to resist the True Ones** will be **judged by the Non-Being** and **recorded by the Great Heaven**.

The **Red Sacrificial Demon** summons the **Heavenly Officers**—
**thousands upon thousands** block passage, **millions upon millions** vanish.

The **Three Realms’ Five Sovereigns** speak to **Upper Clarity**.
The **Primordial Cavern** and **Flame Domain** merge,
**yin contains yang’s essence**, and **yang relies on yin’s boundaries**.
The **Two Qi** give rise to **all things**—
**soft yet firm**, **yielding yet unyielding**.
Through **infinite kalpas**, within the **chaotic void**,
the **upper floats as color**, the **lower sinks as abyss**.
**Water and fire** fill the **void**, merging to **congeal the heavens**.

**First Chapter: Dispelling Water Calamities and Drowning**

The **Water Official** inspects the **Essence**,
commanding the **Northern Element**.
Regulating **Yin**, restraining **Yang**,
**pacifying the River’s Source**.

The **monstrous kinds** defy the **Heavenly Way**,
the **host of deities** unite in **one moment**.
The **mountains shift**, the **vessels** cannot sail.
The **River Spirit** flees the **power**—
the **Snake-Dragon Turtle** comes to **aid the might**.

The **people suffer this disaster**—
the **vast sky** knows not.
**Flesh and blood** feed the **fish and turtles**,
**bones and remains** sink into the **mud**.

The **howling wind** blows through the **Nine Shades**,
**babies wail** through the **night**.

The **Fire Official** detects **evil**,
leading the **Southern Bureau**.
The **Great Star** glows—
the **Old Man** in **crimson robes**.

With **arm-bow and quail-head**,
riding to **banish the wicked**.
All **things depend on his merit**—
the **Flowing Fire** in the **Jade Pool**.

The **Heavenly Mechanism** governs—
the **Six Gates** shine brightly.
The **lower officials** usurp **power**,
**chaos spreads**, **punishment follows**.

At **midnight**, suddenly rising—
**howling winds** race.
**Emerald smoke** like a **dragon**,
**fierce torments** spread.

**Ten thousand feet** blaze—
**sound like hidden thunder**.
**Cries of alarm**, **walls collapse**—
**lost**, unable to escape the **curtains**.

**Escaping to feast**, the **evil ghosts** devour.
**Thirsty**, they **cannot drink**—
**homeless**, they **cannot rest**.

The **Immortal Saints** in **Heaven**—
who would **know** their plight?
The **Heavenly Officials** act—
**seizing the wicked**, **binding the evil**.

The **Jade Talismans** control the **Fire**—

---
**Third Chapter: Dispelling Calamities and Liberating Peril**

Above **Jade Purity**, the **Divine Mists** unfold.
The **Imperial Capital’s Nine Gates**—
within, the **Great Sovereign**.

In **brocade robes**, **crimson garments**,
**jade crowns**, **pearl tassels**.
Governing the **Three Realms**, the **Ten Directions**, the **Ten Thousand Heavens**.

**One thousand two hundred departments**—
all **officers** in their **ranks**.
**Eight hundred seventy**—
**supervising clusters of Immortals**.

The **Seven Elements** of **guilt and blessing**—
**Water, Fire, and Qi**.
**Commandments and Laws** are enforced—
**assisting in ten thousand affairs**.

Recording **life and death**,
**rivers, seas, streams, and springs**.
Any **residual malevolence**—
**transforming in hidden passes**.

**Wandering in Water and Fire**,
**poisoning living beings**.
**Burning and drowning**—
**ravaging without cease**.

The **Precious Chapters**, **Jade Talismans**—
**secretly reported to the Imperial Court**.
**Threatening Swords**, **Massive Axes**—
**beheading demonic spirits**.

**Water calms**, **Fire subsides**—
**no calamities intrude**.
Reciting the **Hollow Texts**, **praying to Heaven** with **sincerity**,
the **True King descends to observe**—
the **Blue Scriptures** record the **names**.

**Dispelling calamities**, **liberating the dead**—
the **Seven Ancestors ascend**.
**Qi refined**, **transforming into Immortal**—
**Spirits fly**, **intent pure**.

**Ten thousand generations** receive **blessings**—
all **ascend to Jade Capital**.

This is **above the Three Realms**, within the **flying void**—
the **True King’s song**, its **words harmonizing with the Hollow Chapters**.

Reciting it **a hundred times**—
**eternally dispelling burning and drowning**,
**names recorded in the Southern Palace**.

Reciting it **a thousand times**—
the **True King** **welcomes and protects**.

Reciting it **ten thousand times**—
the **Dao is complete**,
**ascending to the Supreme Void**,
**crossing the Three Realms**,
**ranking as Immortal Official**.

Those who **hear the Sacred Sound**—
the **Demon King** **respects the form**,
**commanding the Earthly Deities**,
**guarding and escorting**,
**pulling out from the Earth’s Gate**—
**water and fire calamities**,
the **Seven Ancestors ascend**,
**forever leaving the Dark Abyss**,
**souls cross the Vermilion Mound**,
**refined and reborn**.

This is called **limitless**—
**universal liberation without end**.

There are **secret celestial texts**—
all **Heavens hold them in reverence**.
**Revealing or neglecting** leads to **falling into Hell**,
**bringing calamity to the Seven Ancestors**.

The **Dao speaks**: These two chapters are the **sacred sounds** of the **Heavenly Sovereigns** and the **Divine King of the Mists**—
**dispelling drifting calamities**, **alleviating burning disasters**,
**demonic essences and magics**,
**stealing Water and Fire**,
**poisoning living beings**,
**demanding blood and drumming responses**.

The **True King inspects and executes**,
**slaying demonic magics**,
**applying Jade Talismans**,
**severing Water and Fire calamities**.

If one **dies in Water or Fire**,
and the **Soul and Spirit** are possessed by **ancient wounded ghosts—male and female**—
**drawn to Water and Fire**,
or **lifelong water calamities**,
**yearly fire disasters**—
all are **evil spirits usurping Heaven’s authority**,
**arbitrarily stirring up burning and drowning**.

Those who **respectfully recite this Scripture** for **salvation**—
it **can sever and dispel** them all.

These are the **words of the Great Brahman**—
not the **common speech of the world**.

The words lack melodic grace, the melodies lack ornate beauty.
Thus they are called profound and mysterious,
difficult to explore in detail.

Treasured by the Highest Heaven,
concealed within the **Divine Taoist Palace of the Jade Celestial King** in the **Eastern Treasure Chamber of Shenxiao**,
transmitted below according to the cosmic mandate.

If a **True Person** presents gold and jade with a sincere heart,
and follows the ancient rites to pledge allegiance to the **True King**,
then the Scripture shall be bestowed.

The **Dao** speaks:
Heaven and Earth are the **divine vessels of Water and Fire**—
the **Celestial River** above, where the **Water Cauldron** resides on high,
the **Fire Sea** below, where the **Fire Cauldron** is stored beneath.
The **Great Void** lies between, with the **Sun and Moon as elixirs**.
The **Sun and Moon** are the **roots of Water and Fire**,
bound to the **Southern and Northern Dipper Constellations**,
governing the **Taiwei and Zhiwei** celestial bureaus of the two poles.

When **Water embraces Fire**, Water can subdue Fire.
When **Fire isolates Water**, Fire can subdue Water.
When **Water and Fire are balanced**, the **completed transformation** gives rise to all things.
When **Water and Fire shift in excess or deficiency**, calamities befall all creatures.

The Highest Heaven uses **Water and Fire** as the **pivotal mechanism of life and transformation**—
when the mechanism aligns, Heaven’s governance is complete.
Yet the **lower officials of vital qi**, the **Six Heavens’ demons and magics**, steal Water and Fire to harm living beings.
The **Imperial Sovereign** issues methods to **ward off and relieve** those in peril.

From the **great cycles of Heaven and Earth’s fate**—
the **eclipses of the Sun and Moon and Five Stars**,
the **rest or decline of the most sacred divine humans**—
to the **minor ailments of the unlearned**,
all such calamities demand that those of **shared qi** unite in **sincere fasting and incense offerings**,
**six-hourly chanting**, and **tenfold scripture recitation**.
Thus, **merit and virtue descend**, dissolving all misfortunes.
The **limitless scriptures** universally save the boundless.

The **Dao** speaks:
The **unlearned**, with shallow understanding of the Way,
or whose **immortal refinement is incomplete**,
may face **fated annihilation** or **encounter the Great Yin**.
This arises when the **pure mist-water within the body**
and the **fire of the Bright Hall** fail to ascend and descend—
the **body’s spirits** and the **demons of fate and death** battle at the **Water-Fire Gate**.
At the moment of passing,
**fellow True Persons** must perform incense offerings and recite the scripture ten times
to guide the corpse according to the rites.
The **Soul and Spirit** ascend directly to the **Southern Celestial Palace**,
and by their **merit and practice**, they are reborn within a calculated span.
If the **Wheel of Rebirth** is unobstructed, they attain **divine immortality**.

The **Dao** speaks:
When **Heaven and Earth’s cycles conclude**,
when **stars and constellations err in their courses**,
when the **Sun and Moon lose their eclipses**,
when the **Four Seasons disorder**,
when **Yin and Yang fail to harmonize**,
when **kingdoms burn or drown**,
when the **four classes lose their livelihoods**,
when **plagues and poisons spread**,
when **the populace perishes in masses**,
when **teachers and friends die prematurely**,
when **fellow students perish young**—
all these stem from **Water and Fire’s imbalance**,
from **victory and defeat turning to calamity**,
from **Heaven’s officials neglecting their duties**,
from **demons and monsters seizing power**.

Even without **external fires or floods**,
if **qi loses equilibrium**, surging and erupting violently within,
causing **internal excess and violent eruption**—
all require **fasting, incense, and scripture recitation**.
For **fasting and chanting** bear **profound merit**—
**mitigating celestial calamities**, **protecting and securing emperors**,
**warding off poisonous harm**, **saving the masses**.
Life and death depend upon it—
its blessings are boundless.
Thus it is said: **limitless**, universally saving **Heaven and humankind**.

The **Dao** speaks:
Whoever possesses this Scripture
and performs these **meritorious deeds** for **Heaven, Earth, the Imperial Sovereign, and the masses**—
on days of calamity, **generating the mind to fast and burn incense**,
reciting the scripture ten times—
all shall be **recorded by the Celestial Hosts**, with **ten thousand spirits as guardians**.
The **Distinguished True Persons** shall **earn the right** to become **ministers of the Golden Gate of the Sacred Emperor**.
The **Celestial Hosts** record every deed and transgression without omission.
The **True King of Heaven** also **recommends your name**—
only those who attain the **Dao** shall truly **penetrate these profound words**.

**The Hidden Speech of the Great Brahman for Warding Off Water and Fire**
*(Continued)*

**Eastern Eight Heavens**
The gale preserves the spirit’s essence, the primordial qi swirls like floating sands.
Awakening salvation drifts upon the flying streams, welcoming the mechanism of *Pu-Ye*.
Sailing the Jiang-Yuan expanse, it reaches the Mysterious *Qí*’s realm.
With perfect response to the rewards of strategy, the secluded pavilions stand in solemn grandeur.
Offering the brush in weary strength, the common folk’s wisdom is enriched.
The radiant qi settles, the transformations congeal—
the inscribed stele completes the martial array.
Playing with the Celestial Pole’s tower, the records of the *Kui* and *Zhong* are inscribed.
The boundless expanse unfurls its edifice, the *Zhou*’s pool swirls with surging currents.

**Southern Eight Heavens**
Moistening the caves to seek benefit, the divine decree transforms the distant.
Linked to the cavernous embrace, the capital’s dragon-peach reaches its zenith.
The intricate carvings of *Ruàn* and *Ruǎn* gather, the misty *Lì* and *Cháng* converge.
Blocking the *Dù*’s trap with solemn conveyance, the sun’s steam rises over *Bā-Ào*.
The jade-green threads weave their changes, the *Lú-Yáng*’s brilliance reaches its peak.
Examining the *Fāng-Dì*’s edicts, the fierce gale sweeps with urgency.
The fragrant dew dissolves, the统 *Mò* ascends in boundless splendor.
Urgent decrees govern the Northern *Lǜ*, ten thousand voices echo in the void.

**Western Eight Heavens**
The Brahman’s measure refines the *Qián-Dù*, compassion transmits the tortoise’s nod.
Gradually severing ghostly anxieties, the wild *Bù-Yíng* unites.
The edicts probe the tripod’s scrutiny, the intent muses on the void’s form.
The *Tán* manifests without stillness, the Mysterious River hosts the guests.
Unfolding the Han’s cavernous *Qiáo*, the Moon Maiden spreads her *Duì*.
Swiftly plucking the *Hua*, the purple command flourishes.
The *Dīng* governs the heron’s stone, the knife’s *Dān* records the demon’s name.
The *Hú-Sài* judges with precision, the divine and subtle merge.

**Northern Eight Heavens**
The tiger’s mortar grinds the *Xuán*, the *Jī*’s discourse unfolds vast.
The brick-sun fuses the age, the *Zhī-Làng*’s fire shifts.
The tablets and seals are entrusted to the ministers, the adorned treasures gleam pristine.
The well’s estimates await the relay, extending *Sū*’s blessings to follow.
The sudden harvest spreads its display, the *Bǔ-Yīn*’s *Kuā-Lí* complements.
The file erases the *Yuè-Xù*, the bashful *Sū* blesses the *Zhù-Jī*.
The vast *Xuè* encounters the sudden, pointing to the *Yǔ-Chí*’s *Zhuì*.
Adjusting the bright to advance the *Guǎn*, the *Liáo-Nuò* conceals its splendor.

**Dao Speech:**
These are the Hidden Speeches of the Great Brahman within the Eight Heavens—
the boundless sounds of the ancient scriptures,
from the Northern *Yuan-Dài*’s chamber of the Water Emperor’s Seven Spirits,
to the Southern *Líng-Lì*’s *Tuò-Dú*’s palace of flying flowers.
Used to pacify water and fire, to elevate the *Xuán-Jī*’s pivot,
to advance and retreat the two celestial markers,
thus completing the Great Transformation.

When Heaven and Earth harmonize, the sun and moon revolve,
yin and yang generate, the immortals and sages transform—
ascending and descending, above and below,
comparable to scales and measures,
weighing and balancing what is fitting,
to nurture the ten thousand beings.

Its Dao is unerring; the Three Celestial Stems move in order.
If it receives what is disordered, the Five Demons seize power.
The Most High’s secret is hidden in the treasure tripod.
The divine communication is natural, unimpeded.
Soaring as dragon and phoenix, it lies dormant as tortoise and serpent.
The Dao’s marvels are all-encompassing, not letting the world know.
Each character is a broad length of one *zhàng*.

The Celestial True Person of old inscribed these words,
establishing them as the true sounds.
Those who know these sounds and, with fasting, recite them—
the Celestial Hosts send the *Shén-Fǔ Yù-Láng Zhēn-Wáng* to inspect their bodies,
record their merits and labors,
and report to the Celestial Hosts.
Ten thousand spirits pay homage, the earthly spirits guard the gates,
the Great Merit True King recommends them to the Upper Clarity.
When the Dao is complete, they attain the right to roam the Three Realms,
ascending into the Golden Gate.

This sound removes all calamities, wards off all disasters,
delivers all beings, achieves all ends—
the natural sound of the Celestial True.
Thus, when recited, it draws the flying *Tiān-Xià* to observe,
the Supreme Deity sings from afar,
the ten thousand spirits pay homage,
the Three Realms attend the hall,
the myriad deities bow their heads,
the ghostly spirits vanish of their own accord,
the *Lín-Láng*’s chimes resound,
the ten directions are purified—
water does not drown, fire does not burn,
all spirits tremble in submission,
gathering the assembly of immortals.
Heaven is free of mist and filth,
Earth is free of demonic dust,
the dark wisdom is perfectly clear—
the boundless, profound virtue.

**Scripture of the Supreme Treasure for Delivering Beings, Supreme Perfection, Volume Forty-Six Complete**
**Volume Forty-Seven Complete**

**Supplication and Exorcism for Drought and Flood**

The Dao speaks: *"In the realm of Perfect Achievement, at dawn when the morning mist sang with the Great True One of harmonious soil, I received from the Primordial Origin the wondrous scripture for supplicating and exorcising drought and flood.*

When the Primordial Origin, Celestial Sovereign, was to proclaim this sutra, He circled ten times to summon the ten directions, and then took His seat. The Celestial True God, the Supreme Saint of High Veneration, the True Person of Marvelous Practice—along with the ten-direction Dragon Kings, the officials of drought and flood, the eight seas’ water officers, the Three Elements’ fire officials, the Four Great Rivers’ masters, the Thunder and Lightning Deities, the Wandering Fire generals, the Red Emperor’s envoys, the Spirit Officials and mounted attendants, and the countless *Wú-Yáng*—all ascended through the void.

Their carriages glided upon the flowing light, their palanquins pierced the heavens. At dawn’s curve, they cast their shade; crimson essence radiated brilliance, clustered hues unfolded their splendor, and the boundless sky blazed with splendor. For seven days and seven nights, the celestial golden gates and jade palaces, the vermilion halls and *Lín* treasuries, stood in solemn stillness. The stars shifted in radiant procession, the fragrant osmanthus congealed in perfume, the *qián* forests flourished verdant, the rainbow beams hung like sashes, and celestial light shimmered—double wheels of sun reflected in glory.

Within a single realm, earth and mountains, forests and trees, all leveled as one, no longer high or low. The soil transformed into jade of emerald hue, soft yet luminous, transparent without blemish. The assembled immortals attended the seat, while the Primordial Origin, Celestial Sovereign, sat suspended in the void, His form encircled by nine radiant clouds, a round aura, and a dancing dragon above.

When the sutra was recited once, the celestial saints all proclaimed its excellence in unison. The realm’s boundaries filled with harmonious *qi*, and all things were free of blight.

When recited twice, grasses and trees flourished in luxuriant growth, and all treasures bore fruit.

When recited thrice, the *qián* forests gathered phoenixes, their leaves displaying celestial script.

When recited four times, lotus dew contained blossoms, their cores holding elixir.

When recited five times, water and fire attained their proper measure, and all living things thrived.

When recited six times, clouds moved and rain fell, springs stabilized, and rivers flowed evenly.

When recited seven times, the Three Spirits followed their seasons, their brilliance converging in harmony.

When recited eight times, the sacred age flourished universally, and all beings shared prosperity.

When recited nine times, all nations knew peace, and yin and yang aligned with the seasons.

When recited ten times, the Imperial Dao endured in splendor, governance was complete, and virtue was fulfilled. At that moment, men and women of the realm could not but devote their hearts—all received protection and attained longevity.

The Dao speaks: *"At that time, when the Primordial Origin recited the sutra once, the Dragon King of the East, the officials of drought and flood, and the *Wú-Yáng* multitudes ascended through the void. When recited twice, the Dragon King of the South, Great Brightness, with his officials and multitudes, ascended through the void. When recited thrice, the Dragon King of the West, Upholder of Law, with his officials and multitudes, ascended through the void. When recited four times, the Dragon King of the North, Nurturer of Life, with his officials and multitudes, ascended through the void. When recited five times, the Dragon King of the Northeast, Pacifier of Mountains, with his officials and multitudes, ascended through the void. When recited six times, the Dragon King of the Southeast, Cultivator of Winds, with his officials and multitudes, ascended through the void. When recited seven times, the Dragon King of the Southwest, Holder of the Knot, with his officials and multitudes, ascended through the void. When recited eight times, the Dragon King of the Northwest, Controller of the Halter, with his officials and multitudes, ascended through the void. When recited nine times, the Dragon King of the Upper Realm, Dispenser of Moisture, with his officials and multitudes, ascended through the void. When recited ten times, the Dragon King of the Lower Realm, Transformer of Floods, with his officials and multitudes, ascended through the void.

When the ten recitations were complete, the Dragon Kings of the ten directions without limit, the masters of drought and flood, and the Celestial True Gods all arrived together. Men and women of the realm turned their hearts in reverence.

Those who came were as fine as misting rain, each bearing precious treasures to offer the Celestial Sovereign, gazing upon His holy visage, and rejoicing in the wondrous Dao. Then, the Primordial Origin scattered light through the heavens, emitting ten thousand rays of cloud, His Dharma-body manifesting in transformation—now present, now vanished. The wheels of water and fire spun their radiance, eclipsing the sun, while celestial sounds echoed, resounding a thousand *zhèn*. Heavenly flowers scattered in flight, divine music played in harmony, and auspicious *qi* gathered in the void.

The Celestial Sovereign spoke from His mouth, and jade script spread across ten thousand realms. With a smile, He spoke again to the celestial and human assembly:

*'Drought and flood arise from the excessive *qi* of Heaven and Earth—the Great Minor *qi* that affects the people differently across regions. There are also the celestial and terrestrial officials of the year, whose *qi* clashes with that of humanity, causing such calamities. When water overflows, it is yin excess; when drought strikes, it is yang excess. The ruler’s virtue must align with Heaven and Earth—if governance is just, the seasons will harmonize. Overflow becomes flood; excess becomes drought.

Sometimes, even when the Emperor’s virtue is pure and his benevolence extends to the eight extremes, drought and flood may still occur—this is the decree of the celestial officials of the year. In years *Bing*, *Xīn*, *Wù*, and *Guǐ*, during the cycles of *Tài-Yǔ* and *Tài-Zhēng*, when disasters manifest in the first, sixth, or seventh *guī*, drought and flood are inevitable.

Drought and flood are the greatest calamities of the age. When they appear in small measure, one must supplicate; when they appear in excess, one must exorcise. Summon the Dragon Kings of the ten directions, the officials of drought and flood, and the Great Gods, to regulate their *qi*, rectify their commands, and observe their seasons. Then, the people and creatures will know no sickness, yin and yang will balance, and the Dao will not be monopolized by the few.*

At that moment, the wheels of water and fire merged into a single pearl, as large as a millet grain, suspended in the void five *zhàng* above the earth. The Primordial Origin ascended, drawing in the Celestial True Gods, the Supreme Saints of High Veneration, the Dragon Kings of the ten directions, the officials of drought and flood, and the countless *Wú-Yáng*—all entered the precious pearl. The celestial and human assembly looked upward and saw only a faint rustling as they vanished into the pearl’s mouth, unknown where they had gone. The people of the realm dispersed in awe, following the teachings.

The Primordial Origin then completed the sutra within the pearl, and the assembled immortals, overseeing the deliverance, entrusted it to me. At that time, the joy and celebration were beyond words."*

The rites were now fully completed, and the celestial hosts resumed their stations. In a mere instant, all was silent, leaving no trace of sound.

At that time, the celestial and human assemblies encountered the scriptures and teachings, and all were universally delivered and saved. Their original nature was preserved, and none suffered harm. The people of the land turned in reverence, all finding peace in their hearts.

They felt no regret nor stinginess, no arrogance nor selfishness, no ignorance nor deceit, no excess nor error, no deviation nor falsehood.

Their words brought benevolent transformation, their speech held no angry tones, and they treated all with equal compassion, regarding even those of different origins as kin.

The realm was secure, the people prosperous, and they rejoiced in great peace. The teachings began to spread, and the entire land was guided by the Dao.

Those with sincere devotion revered and honored them, all attaining deliverance from the world.

The Dao speaks: The words spoken by the Primordial Origin in the scripture are the hidden names of the celestial and divine sovereigns within the heavens, the esoteric sounds of the True Kings. They are also the taboo names for invoking rain or drought, summoning dragons, and commanding spirits—the secret names of the hundred spirits. These are not the common words of the world.

The Supreme Saints, having already become True Persons, mastering the Mysterious and fathoming the subtle, could fully comprehend their meaning.

When recited ten times, the celestial hosts would respond from afar, the two symbols moving in harmony, advancing and retreating in accordance with the natural order. Rain and drought would not fail. Petitions for rain or drought relief would be answered, the written characters nurturing and flourishing life. Demons would be bound in form, and ghostly spirits would perish utterly. There would be no famine in succession, and blessings would extend to countless people.

Scholars of the highest learning, reciting it ten times, would invoke floods of grace for the world, purifying water sources, and bring peace to the realm. All living things would be blessed.

This is so because within the scholar’s body, water and fire ascend in harmony, the qi and seasons follow their natural course, and they align with the two principles. Their petitions would be granted, impurities cleansed, their bodies turning toward the Perfect Truth. They would command the ten directions, dragons and spirits descending with auspicious signs, their威 and德 complete. They would witness longevity and immortality.

To recite this chapter lightly would invite calamity upon oneself.

To honor and venerate with proper offerings would bring abundant harvests, prosperity through generations, and alignment with virtuous causes. No disaster would touch them, and divine beings would guard their gates.

This scripture is wondrous and profound, resonating through the Celestial Capital, delivering countless beings, and standing as the first among ten thousand teachings.

Its grandeur and virtue are boundless and immeasurable.

The Dao speaks: For those who recite this scripture ten times, all the celestial hosts will gather.

To pray for rain, the dragons will spew clouds, the Mysterious Dew nourishing the withered, mist and vapor gathering, the parched earth filling with waves.

To pray for clear skies, the radiant sun will shine forth, the yin dampness vanishing, the yang light blazing, and the hidden darkness opening in clarity.

Those who earnestly study this scripture, their merits complete and virtue fulfilled, will all attain divinity, ascending to the Golden Gate and feasting in the Celestial Capital.

Scholars of the highest order, practicing and reciting this scripture, will balance yin and conceal yang, water and fire harmonizing within. They will immediately receive deliverance and ascend to the Southern Palace.

Ordinary people who recite it will find their five viscera clear and flourishing, their three fields of cultivation thriving. Within their bodies, water and fire will nourish without deficiency, the yin cauldron and yang furnace refining the True Essence into the Dao. Their lifespan will extend, and all will attain the method of corpse dissolution—

Their spirits temporarily extinguished, they will not pass through the underworld but will immediately return to form, wandering the boundless void.

This scripture is subtle and wondrous, delivering without end. All celestial and human beings will receive its blessings.

Its blessings are boundless, extending over life and death.

It is a treasure of the heavens, not to be passed down to the mortal world.

Only those of the highest virtue, offering gold and treasures with sincere devotion, and swearing an oath to the heavens, may transmit it.

To leak or neglect it lightly would bring calamity upon nine generations, subjecting one to eternal servitude in the ghostly bureaucracy, attending to the scriptures of the Five Emperors. Twenty-four玉童 and twenty-four玉女 would guard the divine texts, protecting those who receive the scripture.

The Dao speaks: In the first month, observe a long fast and recite this scripture to pray for rain or drought relief, ensuring that the plants of spring and summer flourish and prosper.

In the seventh month, observe a long fast and recite this scripture to pray for rain or drought relief, restraining the qi to balance, so that the crops grow luxuriantly and all harvests succeed.

In the tenth month, observe a long fast and recite this scripture to pray for rain or drought relief, ensuring that the people and creatures thrive, celestial talents accumulate, and diseases and plagues are dispelled. For the kings and emperors, their ministers and subjects, fathers and sons, it will bring stability to the nation’s destiny, ensuring the heavens endure, year after year bringing abundant harvests, perpetually preserving the Great Harmony, securing the realm, and the people calling it the Age of Great Peace.

On the eight seasonal festivals, recite this scripture to pray for rain or drought relief, following the natural cycles of emptiness and fullness, so that rain and sun are timely, and all living things are at ease.

On one’s birthday, recite this scripture, and within the body, water and fire will ascend and descend. The two wheels of yin and yang will merge in dual radiance, aligning with the celestial order. The spirit and soul will be purified and upright, the Dao-qi enduring, free from suffering. The body will shine with light, guarded by the Three Realms, welcomed by the Five Emperors, and honored by ten thousand spirits. Their names will be inscribed in heaven, their merits complete and virtue fulfilled, ascending to the Upper Purity.

The Dao speaks: On days of practice, one must first bathe in scented water, fast and enter a purified chamber, facing east. They should strike their teeth thirty-two times, ascending to hear the thirty-two heavens. With a mind of devotion, they should bow thirty-two times, close their eyes, and quietly reflect on sitting within three colored clouds—red, black, and yellow—surrounding them internally and externally, dark and vast. There will appear a green dragon, a white tiger, a vermilion bird, a dark tortoise, a lion, and a white crane, arrayed on either side. The ten-directional Dragon Kings and the officials of drought and flood will stand guard before and behind. The sun and moon will illuminate the chamber, its brilliance penetrating the room, a round symbol forming at the neck, its light radiating to the ten directions—so clear and distinct.

The secret incantation is as follows:

*"Supreme Mysterious Origin, the Most High Dao Lord.
Summon forth from my body the thirty-five officials of the Five Stars, the left and right attendants, the fragrant jade boys, the transmitting jade girls, the Five Emperors’ direct seals, the direct-day fragrant officials—each thirty-six in number—opening the way to what is spoken.*

*Today is a day of great joy, a long fast in a purified hall, practicing this supreme scripture to deliver countless beings.
May my petition reach above, directly before the Most High Primordial Origin, the Supreme Sovereign of the Thirty-Two Heavens.*

*Finished. Draw in the breath thirty-two times, facing east and reciting the scripture.*

**The Thirty-Two Heavens, the Thirty-Two Emperors.**"

**The Hidden Names and Secrets of the Heavens**

All Heavens conceal their names,
All Heavens conceal their signs.
Within the Heavens, voids abound—
Naturally, the divine script unfolds.
All Heavens conceal their rhymes,
Summoning the sounds of submission.
The revered ones of water and fire,
The divine of yin and yang.
The Great Demon of shifting *qi*,
The spirit of the upright and vigilant.
Ninefold convergence, tenfold exchange,
Transforming into the Supreme Clarity above.
The boundless mysteries,
Deep beyond measure.
The divine essence spreads and falls—
Universal salvation for Heaven and man.
Today, we pray to avert floods and droughts,
To traverse the Thirty-Two Heavens,
To banish the *Bó* demons,
To stir the rainworkers,
To turn the weapons’ edge and halt the sun’s course,
To still the winds and suspend the clouds,
To pour forth abundant nourishment,
To illuminate the four horizons,
To transcend the calamitous period,
To solemnly invoke the Great Mysterious,
The Two Officials presiding and opening the gates.
The Eastern Dipper’s Thunder Hall,
The Western Dipper’s Rain Capital,
The Northern Dipper’s Violent Overflow,
The Southern Dipper’s Crimson Field,
The Central Dipper’s Master Talisman,
The Complete Explication of Floods and Droughts.

**Jǔmáng** commands the Spring,
**Suānshōu** rides the Autumn,
**Zhùróng** oversees the Summer,
**Xuānmíng** governs the Winter,
**Hòutǔ** presides in the Mid-Season.
Their hair unbound, their *qi* flowing,
They respond to Heaven and to man,
Their virtue rooted in mysterious power.

The **Qīngtiān** Demon King—
Shaking and crushing with relentless force.
The **Chìtiān** Demon King—
Fierce and scorching with unbridled might.
The **Báitiān** Demon King—
Darkness and dampness, coal-black as soot.
The **Hēitiān** Demon King—
Wandering in the depths of **Míngbó**.
The **Huángtiān** Demon King—
Water and fire both driven forth.
The Five Emperors’ Great Demon—
The ancestor of all spirits.

The flying drums and marching ranks,
Commanding the ghostly legions.
The banners wave, the drums beat,
Surveying the Purple Expanse.
Inspecting and verifying their rounds,
They dispel floods and droughts.
Praying to the High Heavens,
To turn away and extinguish the malevolent *yīn*.

The Heavenly Officials report their decrees—
No droughts shake, no torrents rage.
The surging waves and great floods,
Stewarded by **Wùjǐ** to avert disaster.
The **Huángtóu** soldiers and generals,
Severing and binding the **Jiāngchī**.
The **Xuānguān** True Ones,
Restraining the violent with no fear.

Withering turns green, harmony sustains life.
Dare to interfere or transgress the Two Officials?
If decrees are skewed and commands uneven,
The people and creatures shall perish.
The golden axe strikes in advance,
The Great Heaven’s punishment follows.
Slaughtering and severing the wicked *yīn*,
The winds and fires shall cease.
Thousands beheaded, ten-thousands dismembered—
The demons dare not trespass, the ghosts no longer scheme.

The Three Officials of the Northern **Tíng**—
Brightly inspecting the ghostly encampments.
No concealment allowed,
The **Jīnmǎ** relay presents them.
The proclamation reaches the boundless—
All spirits heed in unison.
The Thirty-Two Heavens’ Five Emperors,
Their words ascend to the Supreme Clarity.
The Primordial Void’s jade calendar,
Water and fire in their cycles.
The divine instruments within,
Great and small, none exceeding their bounds.
Enveloped in **Hùndùn**,
Without hue or depth.
Winds rise, *qi* ascends,
Accumulated yang forms the Heavens.
Above and below the Heavens,
No hidden nor obscure,
No form nor shadow,
No limit nor end.
The **Míngbó** Great **Fàn**,
Vast and boundless, without light.
The **Chìmíng** opens the chart,
The True Fire blazes forth.
Eight dragons bear the waters,
Nine **Bì** spew the springs.
Water and fire thus formed,
Spread and fall in five volumes.
The Crimson Book, the Jade Characters,
Cast in gold as pages.
Guarding the cycles of **Jiéyùn**,
Balancing the ebb and flow to perfect equilibrium.
When the world grows distant from the Dao,
Floods and droughts rise, sinking and drowning.
Harming living creatures,
They relentlessly pursue and subdue.
Ignorant of the wondrous Mysterious,
Endless as if it would persist.
The **Fàn**’s *qi* pervades **Míló**,
All patterns unfold.
The Primordial Thread flows and expands,
The Thirty-Two Heavens.
The wheels of water and fire revolve,
Ascending and descending, low and high.
The **Lǘdòu** circumnavigates the **Jī**,
Returning to the Five Constants.
Thirty-five divisions,
Collecting *qi* in the Supreme Primordial.
Eight Mysteries merge in darkness,
The *qi* enters the utter Mysterious.
Within the Mysterious, the Supreme Sovereign,
The Highest True Emperor.
Riding the Mysteries on the clouds,
Singing and reciting the Primordial Chapters.
The Golden Truth resounds,
Its echoes drift through the cloudy ranks.
The Primordial Sun’s essence,
The Dao harmonized with eternal paths.
The Jade Voice commands the *qi*,
The Spirit Wind gathers the smoke.
The inner Mysteries glow,
The cloudy dews swirl and turn.
The Purple Void’s lush brilliance,
Assisting and sheltering all immortals.
Floods and droughts cease,
The sun and moon follow their course.
Ten-thousand harmonies, one-thousand unities,
Naturally achieving the True.

The **Shénxiāo**’s Most Exalted,
The Great Lord of Eternal Life.
Within the Eastern Extremity’s Palace,
The **Qīnghuá** Emperor.
Holding the register of water and fire,
Overseeing all nations and their people.
Praying to receive the divine response,
To descend blessings upon Heaven and man.
**Wúyīng** on the left,
**Báiyuán** on the right.
**Tàiyī** in front,
**Sīmìng** behind.
**Táokāng** and **Hǎibó**,
**Héyán** and **Héhóu**,
Refining and smoothing, water and fire in balance.
Wielding the talisman and the **Hù**,
Guarding life and nurturing its roots,
Ascending to the Supreme Clarity,
Entering and exiting the **Huáfáng**.
Within the Eight Mysteries,
In the subtle depths,
Below connecting to the human body,
The **Níwán** and **Jiānggōng**.
The Five *qi*’s central harmony,
Mingling with all spirits,
The Three Fields flourishing,
Floods and droughts nonexistent.
Gazing upon one’s own body,
Heaven and Earth share the same domain.
The *qi* and climate unerring,
The **Huápó**’s liquid warmth.
Ten thousand rotations restore the essence,
Ten-thousand *qi*’s become immortal.
The Dao of immortals values life,
Boundless salvation for all beings,
Opening the Eight Gates,
The flying wheels of Heaven’s law.
Guilt and fortune bound by prohibitions,
Past lives and karmic ties.
The Two Officials of water and fire,
Holding the scales of authority,
Universal reception and salvation,
Born into the world, rejoicing in prosperity.
The malevolent *qi* forever extinguished,
Reported to the High Heavens.
Above the Heavens,
Each has its birth-gate.
Within them, the voids resound with hymns,
True Kings’ sacred verses,
Words aligning with the Highest Truth.

**First Chapter: Praying to Avert Floods and Droughts with Sky-Soaring Sounds**
The clouds unfurl, the thunder-chariots roll.
The flying rains descend,
The hundred streams rise to the measure.
Your hearths are filled with grain,
Your homes level with abundance.
The common folk know nothing—
They suffer this plague of woe.
The scorching sun, the dreaded drought,
Melting gold, scorching stone.
The four wilds rise in smoke,
Grasses and trees all turn crimson.
Fields are torn asunder,
The mud can be scooped like soil.
No spring’s voice heard,
No trickle drawn.
The year ends with no reserves,
This disaster’s cruel affliction.
I seal this altar,
Sing the void’s hymns, beat the drums.
I summon the Ten Dragons,
Dance with the thousand attendants.
Burning incense, chanting scriptures,
Sincerity ascends to the Purple Vault.
The floods and droughts cease,
Blessings and fortune descend.
For ten thousand years, enjoy the Great Peace.
I bow to the **Qīnghuá** Palace.

**Second Chapter: Summoning the Dragon to Bring Rain**
Deep plowing in the Southern Fields,
Cutting reeds, pulling sedges.
Plowing deep, sowing far,
To transcend this year of cold.

The land turns to stone,
Hard as iron, unyielding.
To seek success in this,
Heaven loves its bounty.
Here I brew the *liáo* and *jì*, pure and clean,
At the august altar of the Sovereign.

The **Qīnglóng** bears the talisman,
Mountain valleys flow with trickling streams.
The **Chìlóng** bears the talisman,
Rain falls in scattered sheets.
The **Báilóng** bears the talisman,
Halt the drought, let the fields flourish.
The **Hēilóng** bears the talisman,
Storehouses pile like ridges.
The **Huánglóng** bears the talisman,
Clouds deepen, rains surge.
The Ten Dragon Lords,
Pity these lowly folk.
Nourish all living things,
Let prosperity overflow and extend.
With sincerity, I move the **Sāntiān**,
With grace, I touch the **Bāyín**.
I praise the *Kōngdòng* hymns,
Let the Dragons not lightly race away.

**Third Chapter: The Song of Ceasing Rain and Invoking Clear Skies**
The Water Official relaxes his prohibitions,
The Thunder City remains unlocked.
The ghosts steal his chariot,
Its wheels collapse, its rim shattered.
The fierce Dragon yet untamed,
Unleashes endless rain.
Clouds shroud the plains,
Crows gather, foxes flee in alarm.
Even stubborn stones bear moss,
Dead mulberries sprout leaves.
The farmers sigh in despair,
Exhausted to their core.
The sun hides in the sky,
The Dragon’s back rises in smoke.
None know the world’s joy,
As fragrant eaves pour in torrents.
The **Dao** commands with jade script,
To cease the rain, invoke clear skies.
Morning sunlight dawns,
Wild horses steam like boiling water.
The seas and mountains clear,
Ten thousand valleys conceal clouds.
The talisman wards my fields,
Now I build your **Lú** shelter.
The sun still, the wind gentle,
All life revives.
The blazing chalice pours libations,
To the **Zhēnwáng** of the Four Extremes.
Swiftly ordering the year’s rectification,
Enriching your storehouses.
Protecting the world in enduring peace,
Teaching laws to flourish.
The **Yùlóng** bears the torch,
Illuminating the Ten Directions.
Holy longevity for ten thousand years,
With **gǔnyī** robes and **fǔcháng** patterns.
This, above the Three Realms,
Within the flying void,
The **Zhēnwáng**’s song resounds,
Its melody blending with the *Dòngzhāng*.

If recited a hundredfold,
All things prosper and mature.
If recited a thousandfold,
Harmonious *qì* flows freely.
If recited ten thousandfold,
The Dao is fully realized,
Floods and droughts forever vanish,
Exceeding the Three Realms,
Ascending to the **Shénxiāo**.
With sacred tones,
The Celestial Ministers revere its form.
Commanding the **Dìqí**,
Divine guards attend in escort.
From the dead gates,
Free from the Five Sufferings and Eight Hardships,
The Seven Ancestors ascend in rank,
Forever beyond the **Guǐguān**,
Souls cross the **Zhūlíng**,
Refined and reborn.

This is called **Wúliàng**,
Universal salvation without end.
There are hidden celestial texts,
All heavens venerate as their core.
To reveal arrogance is to fall into the **Dìyù**.
Disaster befalls the Seven Ancestors.
The **Dao** speaks: These two chapters are the hidden voices
Of the Celestial Sovereigns and the **Shénxiāo Zhēnwáng**,
Capable of summoning rain and invoking clear skies,
Praying and warding off floods and droughts,
Aiding the state and blessing the people.
All are the words of the Great **Fàn**,
Not the common speech of mortals.
Without melodious beauty,
No ornate curves.
Thus called profound and mysterious,
Hard to trace and explain.
Celestial treasures,
Hidden in the **Shénxiāo Yùqīng Yùfǔ Dōnghuá Jīngshì**,
Encountered in the year of **Rénchén**,
Revealed by Heaven to transmit.
If a perfected one brings gold and jade
With a sincere heart,
According to the old rites to pledge with the Celestial Lords,
Then it shall be entrusted.

The **Dao** speaks: The *qì* of Heaven and Earth
Also has its proper balance.
**Zǐ** and **Wǔ**, **Mǎo** and **Yǒu** are the **zhèng**,
**Yín**, **Shēn**, **Jǐ**, and **Hài** are the **chū**,
**Chén**, **Xiū**, **Chǒu**, and **Wèi** are the **zhōng**—all are deviations.
Floods and droughts arise
From the convergence of Heaven’s timing and these deviations,
Or from the people’s movements and stillness clashing.
Thus, when insufficient, one **qí** for it,
When excessive, one **làng** for it.
To summon rain is **qí**,
To invoke clear skies is **làng**.
For all such disasters,
Those of the same *qì* must unite in heart,
Fast and recite the scriptures,
Offer incense at all six times,
Turn the sutras ten thousandfold.
Virtue and blessings descend,
All ill omens dissolve.
**Wúliàng**’s sacred words,
Universal salvation without end.
The **Dao** speaks: To pray and ward off floods and droughts,
When summoning rain, one must establish an altar
In the southwest of the state,
With the forms of the Ten Dragon Lords of the Ten Directions
Placed at its four sides,
And the **Zhìyǔ Língfú** talisman at its center,
Storing water in the Five Directions,
Using **tóngzhú** and **bamboo** branches, as well as **qīngbái-yáng** branches,
Placed in the water,
And with **qīngzhǐ** script inscribed in ink,
To the **Sāntiān Shìyǔ** and **Tàixuǎn Tiānjī** of the Two Ministries,
To pray for it.
When invoking clear skies,
One must establish an altar
In the south of the state,
Nine feet high—three **rèn**—
Round above, square below,
With four gates opened at its sides,
Each gate leading to nine **lěi**,
As pathways for ascent,
And the forms of the Ten Dragon Lords of the Ten Directions
Placed at its four sides,
With the **Qǐngqíng Língfú** talisman at its center,
Offering incense and lamps in the Five Directions,
To dispel the darkness,
And with **dānshū** and **qīngcí** script,
To the **Huǒcáo** of the Two Ministries,
To ward it off.
The perfected one offers incense,
Recites the sutras ten passes.
Prayers and warding shall respond,
No harm in the coming year.
Depending on the scale of the flood or drought,
From the first seven days to the third seven days,
This is the lesser term.
With focused devotion and sincere aspiration,
The heavens record your merit,
And you shall attain the **Shénxiān**.

The **Dao** speaks: When the four seasons stray,
Yin and Yang misaligned,
Then the *qì* shifts and prevails as excess.
Thus, lingering rain becomes **shuǐ**,
Excessive heat becomes **hàn**.
Where it descends,
The common folk scatter and flee,
Birds and beasts lose their way,
Plagues spread,
And the innocent perish in ruin.
One must also fast,
Offer incense and recite scriptures,
Pray and ward with repentance.

Fasting and reciting scriptures,
Their merit and virtue are profound.
Above, they dispel celestial calamities,
Guard and protect the Emperor.
Below, they ward off poisons and harm,
To save myriad folk.
In this world, all receive their blessings,
Their fortune beyond measure.
Thus it is called **Wúliàng**,
Universal salvation for Heaven and Man.

The **Dao** speaks: For all who possess this sutra,
It can for the Emperor of Heaven and Earth,
And myriad folk,
Remove floods and droughts.
On days of disaster,
With a sincere heart, fast and burn incense,
Recite the sutra ten passes.
All are recorded by the heavens,
Ten thousand spirits attend in escort,
The perfected ones recognize you,
And you shall become a **Shèngjūn**,
A subject of the Golden Gate.
The heavens record your merits and faults,
Without the slightest omission.
The **Zhēnwáng** in Heaven also champions your cause,
And those who attain the **Dao** shall penetrate
The profound truths of the **Dao**.

The hidden words of the Great **Fàn** in the heavens,
Composed by the **Daojūn**,
The **Yuánshǐ Língshū** of the **Sānshíèr Tiān Qí Làng Zhōngpiān**,
The Eight Celestial Lords of the East:
**Pántáng Jī Sūn** shines resplendent,
Piercing the **Yàoché Zhōngzǔ**.
The altar’s pool is a **Yùyuān** of jade,
Where the **Jǐnglóng** resides in splendor.

「The **Yùyuān** of **Dìnglíng** holds its mysteries,
The **Yuèliàn** refines the **Lǔ** scroll.
Stealing the **Xuán** to establish seals,
Filtering the **Qì** to wrap the ancient.

At the **Shénxué**’s cave, the **Chī** is quenched,
The **Báilóng** offers the **Wǔ** sacrifice.
The **Zhèn** flies in harmony with the **Dòuhé**,
The **Guǐ** seizes the **Jiǎo** and **Pǔ**.

The **Yuán** gathers to pray for oil,
The **Shān** departs for **Lǜ** and **Hán**.
Summoning the **Chú** to strike the **Jiǎdǎng**,
The **Jiǔkūn** champions **Yáo** and **Huán**.

---
**Eastern Eight Celestial Lords** verified,
**Yánjī** and **Yùlǎn** resplendent,
**Hèhuí** shines through **Yàodān**.
**Chénlín** vanishes with a roar,
A myriad **Huá** constructs the **Guān**.
**Dìdīng** leads the **Xiá**,
**Mǎzhé** returns to **Liáohuán**.
The appointed day exceeds **Gǎnlóng**,
At the **Yōushā**’s **Qiūyuān**.

---
**Beheading** the **Guǒshù**,
**Xī** pacifies the **Yānlian**.
**Héshēng** ascends to **Lùsuì**,
The **Yāodú** conceals the **Yì**.
The **Hù** presents the **Niúlì**,
The **Huǒ** pierces **Zékān**.
**Lǚsī** governs **Yàomò**,
**Xiūmóu** masters the **Shīléi**.

---
**Western Eight Celestial Lords** revealed,
**Méichóu** and **Yànsǒu** in attendance,
**Jùlíng** repels **Qí** and **Póu**.
Turning the **Chú** to summon the **Xián**,
**Shìní** and **Wèn** battle the **Dǒu**.
The **Cí** confuses the **Jiān**’s **Hún**,
The **Bēntú** flees to **Lóuyí**.
**Bìshǎng** rewards the **Tángyuàn**,
**Yuèxié** dispatches the **Shìchí**.

---
**Northern Eight Celestial Lords** manifest,
The **Hǔdān** slays the **Yòuzhí** and **Kōngjīng**.
The **Dàomì** descends with **Qì**,
The **Yúnhuáng** mingles at the **Jiāomén**.
**Dònghún** blends with **Shúhuǒ**,
**Pǔmù** points to **Zhǐfèn**.
**Héshēng** unites the **Hún** under divine protection,
**Zhāoqīng** clears the **Fányíng**.
The **Mìshì** rectifies the **Tíng**,
**Shěngfǔ** lightens the **Qīngjīng**.
**Gǎoyáng** hums within the **Wénhuái**,
**Qì** resists no **Shùncún**.

---
The **Chìlóu** roars at the **Sìyuàn**,
The **Jiūfù** binds the **Shèkūn**.
**Tàikǎo** begets the **Shēnghuò**,
**Língyín** echoes through the **Jiànxún**.

---
**Dao** speaks: These are the hidden words of the Great **Fàn** in the heavens,
The **Wúliàng**’s boundless **Yīn**,
The ancient texts carved upon **Tàiwēi** and **Zǐwēi**’s **Shuǐhuǒ** halls,
At the **Cāngyù**’s **Língyá**’s summit,
To regulate the **Qì** of the four seasons across the **Tiān** and **Dì**.
A book of divine transformation,
Its efficacy surpasses naming.

---
Scholars of the world,
Praying for relief from floods and droughts,
Follow the **Fǎ** to inscribe the hidden words in **Dānmò**,
Placing them at the four gates of the altar,
To summon the **Qì** of **Yīnyáng**.

When the **Shuǐhuǒ**’s **Jì** descends upon mortal lands to wreak havoc,
Those who know how to settle it shall bring great fortune.
Each character spans a broad length of one *zhàng*.

---
The **Zhēnwáng** and **Huángrén** of old inscribed these texts,
Setting them as the **Zhèngyīn** standard.

Those who know its **Yīn** and can fast and recite it shall have the **Zhūtiān** dispatch flying **Fēitiān**, **Yìlóng**, and celestial envoys to descend and observe their person, recording their merits and reporting them to **Shénxiāo**. The **Wànshén** shall pay homage in procession, the **Dìqí** shall attend at the gates, and their great merit shall be acknowledged by the **Sāntiān**, granting them the office of **Dòngxuán**.

When the **Dao** is fully mastered, one may traverse the **Sānjiè** and ascend into the **Jīnmén**.

This **Yīn** repels all, fulfills all prayers, wards off all calamities, liberates all, and accomplishes all—it is the natural **Yīn** of **Tiānzhēn**.

Thus, reciting it summons celestial officials to descend and observe, the **Shàngdì** to chant from afar, the **Wànshén** to pay homage in procession, the **Sānjiè** to attend at the **Xuān**, the **Qúnjì** to bow in reverence, the **guǐjīng** to vanish of their own accord, the **línláng** to resound, the **Shífāng** to fall silent in awe, the **Héhǎi** to grow still, the **Shānyuè** to swallow their mist—all **Wànlíng** tremble in submission. It gathers the **Qúnxiān**, clears the **Tiān** of all turbidity, the **Dì** of all **jì** filth, and pierces the **Mínghuì** with pristine clarity. Its boundless **liàng** is the **Xuán** of **Xuán**.

**Chapter on Calming the Ninefold Earthly Spirits and Unlucky Demons**

The Dao speaks: *"In days past, at the Hollow Yang within the Celestial Center, the Supreme Pure One of the Great Void sang the Crystal Radiance Music of the Earthly Spirits, thereby receiving the Supreme Pure One’s* **Miaojīng** *of Calming the Ninefold Earthly Spirits and Unlucky Demons.*

When the Supreme Pure One of **Tiānzhēn** delivered this **sutra**, circling ten times, He summoned the Ten Directions, and they came to His seat. The **Tiānzhēn** Great God, the Highest Sage of **Shàngshèng**, the True Person of **Miàoxíng**, the **Xiānwáng** Earthly Sovereign, the officials and attendants, the **Dìzhēn** Masters of the Earth, and the countless **Wànshén**—all riding the void—arrived.

Golden clouds filled the heavens, feathered canopies resounded with **Lángyǔ**, covering the Ninefold Earth, their radiance dazzling the Eight **Mínghuì** of **Yǔ**. Light streamed and scattered, piercing the Great Void, for five days and five nights. The celestial **rìyuè xīngxiù**—the **Xuánshū** and **Yùhéng**—all halted their wheels. The earthly seas and mountains, their caves and ravines, shone with **Bìhuá** clarity; winds and clouds fell silent, the **Tiān** free of floating **fúyì**, the **Dì** free of lurking **guǐjīng**. Within the land, hills, forests, plains, and marshes all flattened into one, with no more high or low. All soil became **wén** jade, and clouds and mists gleamed with **Bìnghuàn** brilliance, their hues undifferentiated.

The **Wànshén** attended His seat, while the Supreme Pure One of **Tiānzhēn** ascended in **Xuánzuò**, floating above the Ninefold Radiant **Jīntāo** Dragon Platform. After the first recitation of the **sutra**, the Earthly Sovereign of the Five Peaks simultaneously declared their praise. In the second recitation, the **Xuánquè** opened in passage. In the third, the **Líquán** surged forth. In the fourth, mountains, lakes, rivers, and springs all bore **xiángruì** omens. In the fifth, the **Dìzàng** treasures flowed into the human realm. In the sixth, the Earthly Spirits and **guǐjīng** abandoned their wickedness and returned to righteousness. In the seventh, calamities and disasters ceased, and misfortunes were extinguished. In the eighth, the Northern Capital’s **Luòchēng**, the Nine **Yōu** Abysses, and all **Dìyù** guilty souls were granted universal pardon. In the ninth, the **guǐguān** and their leaders all ascended to **Xiān** stages. In the tenth, all beings followed their nature; the people suffered no untimely harm. At that time, all men and women within the land turned their hearts in reverence, receiving protection and deliverance, all attaining **Chángshēng**.

The Dao speaks: *"Then, when the Supreme Pure One of **Tiānzhēn** delivered the **sutra** for the first time, the Earthly Sovereigns of the East—limitless, boundless, and radiant—calmed the Ninefold **Lěi** Earth. The **Xiānwáng** and Earthly Sovereigns of **Wànshén**, countless in number, floated through the void and arrived. In the second recitation, the Earthly Sovereigns of the South—limitless, boundless, and fierce—calmed the Ninefold **Lěi**. In the third, the Earthly Sovereigns of the West—limitless, boundless, and **shízhī**-colored—calmed the Ninefold **Lěi**. In the fourth, the Earthly Sovereigns of the North—limitless, boundless, and **rùnzé**-colored—calmed the Ninefold **Lěi**. In the fifth, the Earthly Sovereigns of the Northeast—limitless, boundless, and **jīnsǔ-zé**-colored—calmed the Ninefold **Lěi**. In the sixth, the Earthly Sovereigns of the Southeast—limitless, boundless, and **jīngāng-tiězé**-colored—calmed the Ninefold **Lěi**. In the seventh, the Earthly Sovereigns of the Southwest—limitless, boundless, and **shuǐzhì-zé**-colored—calmed the Ninefold **Lěi**. In the eighth, the Earthly Sovereigns of the Northwest—limitless, boundless, and **Dàfēng-zé**-colored—calmed the Ninefold **Lěi**. In the ninth, the Earthly Sovereigns of the Upper Direction—limitless, boundless, and **Kūnlún-Yángfēng-Zhuānquè-Yáochí-Bājí-Língxiān**, the Nine **Gōng** Earthly Truths—calmed the Ninefold **Lěi**. In the tenth, the Earthly Sovereigns of the Lower Direction—limitless, boundless, and **Dòngyuān-wúsè-Hùnhuáng-Dòngkōng-Gāngwéi**-colored—calmed the Ninefold **Lěi**. As the ten recitations concluded, the Earthly Sovereigns of the Ten Directions—limitless, boundless, and the Ninefold **Lěi**—the **Xiānwáng** and Earthly Sovereigns, all arrived together. The people of the land, men and women alike, turned their hearts in awe and devotion.

Those who came were as thick as flying snow and whirling sand; the countless multitudes filled half the land, causing the earth to sink unevenly, beyond restraint. Then, the Supreme Pure One gazed down upon the Ninefold **Lěi**’s **Yǐngmò** depths, the **Sānyōu** Abysses, and the thirty-six palaces of the **Dìshén**. The great Earthly Sovereigns’ halls, gates, and platforms all ascended in a **Rǎnrǎn** rise, reaching the Celestial Sovereign’s presence.

The Supreme Pure One then used His **Chìguāng** Fire-Jade **fú**, its brilliance illuminating the palaces and gates, transforming it into a single pearl. At first, it was no larger than a pea, yet the thirty-six palaces shone clearly and were visible. The Supreme Pure One again summoned His divine power, lifting this treasure pearl—now as large as a **shúmǐ** grain—into the **Xuán** void, nine **zhàng** above the earth.

As the Supreme Pure One ascended, the **Tiānzhēn** Great God, the Highest Sage of **Shàngshèng**, the True Person of **Miàoxíng**, the Ten Directions’ limitless, boundless, and supreme **Dìshén**, the Ninefold **Lěi** Earthly Sovereigns, and the countless multitudes—all entered the treasure pearl. The **Tiānrén** looked on, seeing only a **Bóbó** surge as they entered the pearl’s mouth, then vanished within it, their whereabouts unknown. The people of the land dispersed, and the earth returned to its even, upright state, no longer tilted.

Within the treasure pearl, the Supreme Pure One perceived the forms and **zhǒngzhǒng-bùxiáng** manifold evils of the Ninefold **Lěi** Earthly Spirits and malevolent ghosts. He displayed the **Língwén**, calming, extinguishing, and benefiting them, and all living beings.

When the **sutra**’s recitation was complete, the **Wànshén** oversaw the deliverance and entrusted it to me. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words. The **fǎshì** was roughly exhausted, the **Zhūtǐ** treasures returned to their places, and in a **shuǎhū** instant, all was silent with no trace remaining. Then, those who had passed through the **sutra**’s law all received salvation, their lives preserved that year without harm. The earth and its people bowed in reverence, all dwelling in **Lèkāng** ease.

They knew neither joy nor anger, neither sorrow nor grief, neither sickness nor vexation, neither suffering nor toil, neither disturbance nor alarm. Their words returned to **Zhìlǐ**, their intentions aligned with **Tiānzhēn**, their equal compassion merging with the **Yìgǔ**—all beings, though of different **gǔ**, became kin in harmony."

The realm is secure, its people flourish, rejoicing in Great Peace. The **Sutra**’s teachings are proclaimed, and the land unites under the **Dao**.

With hearts of utmost sincerity, they revere and honor the **Sutra**, all attaining deliverance from the world.

The **Dao** speaks: The words uttered by the **Yuan Shǐ Tiānzūn** in this **Sutra** are the hidden names of the Nine Palaces’ Earthly Sovereigns, the **Yìyīn** sounds. They are also the taboo names within the **Xianwáng**’s domain, the **Bǎilíng**’s concealed titles—words not of the common world.

The **Shangshèng** has already attained the **Zhēnrén**, mastering the **Tōng Xuàn** and probing the subtle. He comprehends its full meaning.

When recited ten times, the **Zhūtǐ** resound in distant praise, the Ten Thousand **Dì** offer rites, the Nine Palaces’ truth is revealed, the **Tǔqiàn** submit their forms, and they reverently uphold the **Tiānjié**, daring not to harm mortals. The **Shàngdì**’s decrees are swiftly entrusted to the **Tiāndīng**.

The **Zhìxué** scholars, when reciting ten times, command the Five Earths to obey, the Three **Xuàn** to bow, the **Yéjīng** to lose their sight, and the **Tǔmó** to perish utterly. Even those at death’s door are saved and live again. Yet this is why: the **Zhìxué**’s virtue and **Dao** have not yet fully ripened; their power to subdue the Ten Directions is not yet absolute, nor their might over the Nine Palaces. They can only ensnare the **Jiàn** and bind the **Móling**, but cannot revive the dead.

To recite this **Zhāng** lightly is to invite misfortune upon oneself. To honor and nourish it brings prosperity to one’s lineage, everlasting flourishing, and alignment with **Shàn yīnyuán**. All calamities are averted, and the **Shénmíng** guard the gates.

This **Sūtra** is most sublime, calming the Yellow **Hé**, sweeping away all ill omens, and delivering countless beings. It is the **Zōng** of the Nine Realms.

The **Wēiwēi** Great Compassion’s virtue is beyond measure.

The **Dao** speaks: When this **Sūtra** is recited ten times, the Nine Palaces’ Thirty-Six **Xianwáng**, along with the Earthly Sovereigns, assemble to dispel the **Tǔqiàn**’s criminal offenders, the **Dìxià**’s harmful **Qì**, and the **Jiéshè** of Earthly **Gōng**. In awe of the law, they shield mortals. The countless **Zēng** and **Zǔ**, the tormented **Yōuhún**, all receive deliverance, ascending to the Vermilion **Gōng**, enduring for nine years, and being reborn through **Huà**. They become noble beings.

Those who cherish this **Sūtra** and fulfill its teachings, when their virtue and **Dao** are complete, attain **Shénxiān**, ascending to the Golden **Hé** and feasting in the Jade **Jīng**.

The **Zhìxué** scholars who practice and recite this **Sūtra** summon the **Zhōnggōng**’s **Tǔdé** **Língbǎo Zhēnrén**, who descends the **Hàoyuán** **Qì**, flowing into their bodies. They receive deliverance and ascend to the Southern **Gōng**.

Mortals who recite it have the Earthly **Sī** destroy their records, not daring to restrain their forms. Their bones are repaid to the Earthly **Guān**, their years prolonged, and they ultimately attain the **Shījiě** **Dao**. Their **Húnshén** temporarily perish, escaping the **Dìyù**, and they return to their forms, wandering the Great Void.

This **Sūtra** is profound and boundless in its deliverance. All **Tiānrén** rejoice in its recitation. Infinite blessings flow through life and death, granted by the **Shàng Tiān**.

The **Shàng Tiān** treasures it, not passing it to the lower world. Only the **Zhìshì** who offer **Jīnbǎo** with sincere devotion swear by heaven to transmit it. Those who reveal it carelessly or belittle it suffer the calamity of the Nine Palaces, enduring long servitude to the Earthly **Guān**.

The Five **Dì** and the Thirty-Six Jade **Tóng** and **Nǚ** attend as **Yīngwèi** to the sacred **Shénwén**, safeguarding those who receive this **Sūtra**.

The **Dao** speaks: In the first month, during the **Chángzhāi**, recite this **Sūtra** to calm the **Qīngchì Tǔzhèng**, banishing the Nine Palaces’ Twelve **Tǔhuāng** **Zhùqì**, delivering the departed of past ages from Earthly **Dìdài** servitude, and ascending them to the Southern **Gōng**.

In the seventh month, during the **Chángzhāi**, recite this **Sūtra** to calm the **Báihuáng Tǔsī**, banishing the Nine Palaces’ Twelve **Tǔshā Xíngféng Qì**, and attaining **Shénxiān**. The **Zhūtǐ** record their names, granting them **Diǎnluó** **Báijiǎn**, and they are reborn after death.

In the tenth month, during the **Chángzhāi**, recite this **Sūtra** to calm the **Xuànhēi Tǔguān**, banishing the Nine Palaces’ Twelve **Tǔguài Hàiqì**, and for **Guówáng** and **Dìzhǔ**, ensuring their **Jūnchén** and **Fùzǐ** are secure. The **Guózhuó** is calmed, the **Tiāncháng** preserved, their lineage unbroken, and they remain as rulers forever, bringing **Tàipíng** to their lands.

On the **Bājié** days, recite this **Sūtra** to receive blessings from the Eight **Fú Tǔ**, attaining the **Zhēnrén** of the Nine Palaces.

On one’s **Běn Mìng** day, recite this **Sūtra** to have the Earthly **Guān** bestow blessings, prolonging life from its start, and the **Xianwáng** protect one’s fate, ensuring longevity in the **Huángtíng**.

The **Zhēnrén** drink from the **Zhàohuá Chí**, their **Húnshén** purified, and their **Wànqì** preserved eternally, free from suffering. Their bodies radiate light, and the Three Realms serve as their guardians. The Five **Dì** oversee their ascension, and all **Wànshén** pay homage. Their names are inscribed in the **Shàng Tiān**, their virtue complete, and they ascend to the **Shàngqīng**.

The **Dao** speaks: On the day of **Xíngdào**, one must first bathe in fragrant water, purify oneself in ritual, and face east.

Brush the teeth thirty-two times, heard by the Thirty-Two **Tiān**. Bow the heart in homage thirty-two times, eyes closed, meditating on oneself seated within the Yellow, Black, and Purple **Yúnqì**’s embrace. The inner and outer worlds grow dark, and there appear Green Dragons, White Tigers, Crimson Birds, Dark Turtles, Lions, White Cranes, and others arrayed on either side. The sun and moon illuminate, the chamber glows brightly, and a radiant halo forms at the neck, its light reaching the Ten Directions—so clear and distinct.

The **Mìzhòu** recites:

*"Wúshàng Xuányuán, Tàishàng Dàojūn.
Zhàochū chénshēn zhōng sānwǔ Gōngcáo, zuǒyòu Guānshǐzhě, shìxiāng Yùtóng, chuányán Yùnǚ, wǔ Dì zhífú, zhídì Xiāngguān, gè sānshíliù rén, guānqǐ suǒyán.
Jīnrì Jíqìng, Chángzhāi Qīngtáng, xiūxíng Zhìjīng, wúliàng Dùrén.
Yuàn suǒ qǐ Shàngchè, jìngyù Wúshàng sānshíèr Tiān Yuánshǐ Shàngdì Zhìzūn jìqián.
Bì, yǐn Qì sānshíèr guò, dōngxiàng sòngjīng.*

The **Yuan Shǐ** **Wúliàng** **Dùrén** **Shàngpǐn Miàojīng**—
The **Yuan Shǐ** **Dòngxuàn Língbǎo** **Běnzhāng**, calming the Nine Palaces’ **Tǔqiàn**’s ill omens and opening the **Kāipì Miàopǐn**. Across endless **Miànjíé**, it delivers beings.

The **Zhèngxíng** wander in **Fàn**, ascending and descending by nature’s will.
They merge with the **Jiǔlún**, reaching the **Xūwú Zhìzhēn**.
The **Xuányuán** **Zǔqì** flows, forming shape.
The **Fēngyuān** enfolds, and the **Miàoyùn** circulates through the roots.

The **Great Dao** preserves and secures all things—
All beings transform and take form.
Emerald groves and sapphire pools array the **Mysterious Spirits**.
Nine luminous forces converge under **Heavenly Sovereignty’s** jade decrees.

Separation and union establish transformation—
The **Crimson Dao** unfolds its radiance.
The **Great Void** revolves in cycles,
Its **True Fragrance** borne aloft by winged forms.

This is the **Supreme Mystery**,
The **Mysterious within the Mysterious**.

The **Sixfold Barrier** presses in—
Commanding the **Kun Mountains’** might.
Beneath, the **Wind Marshes** coil,
While **Jiefen’s** springs rise from the abyss.

Boundless **Great Transformation** gathers essence at dawn.
The **Three True Ones** extend their splendor—
Golden radiance fills the **Lín Court**.
At the **First Dawn**, the **Jia Soil** ascends as **Prime Minister**.

Purple mists and crimson clouds
Illumine the lofty and pure.

They subdue the **Hundred Demons**,
And station themselves across the **Ten Directions**.

Within are:
The **True One** who spreads **Yuan Qi**,
The **Sovereign** who unites **Spirit** and transformation,
The **Great God** who examines and enlightens,
The **Venerable Elder** who subdues evil and annihilates **Tǔqiàn**,
And the **Nine Abyssal Sovereign**, **Dòngyuān Dòngjí**, who bears **Heaven** and holds **Earth**—**Huánglǎo Zūnshén**.

Together, they proclaim the **Supreme Teaching**—
The **Dao** manifests as **Body**.

Today, they secure and pacify—
Ten thousand **Saints** gather at the **Hall of Audience**.

The **Nine Directions’** **Wújí Preservers of the World**—

And the **Nine Abyssal Sovereigns of the Ten Directions**—
**Longsheng Dùshì Wúliàng Dàshén**.

They ride the **Yellow Clouds**,
In **Crimson Chariots** and **Emerald Palanquins**,
Beneath **Yellow Canopies** and **Flying Wheels**,
Harnessed by **White Tigers** and **Azure Phoenixes**,
With **Crimson Cranes** and **Vermilion Swans**,
Bearing the **Subduing-Demons Banner**,
And **Dragon-Flag Silks**—
**Yàochāng Zhǔshuài** leads ahead,
While **Tǔlóng** from the **Tiger’s Maw**,
**Lions**, and **Qílín** flank them,
Leaping left and right.
The **Seven Saints** clear the path,
The **Four Bright Ones** bear the **Yoke-Poles**,
And **Ten Thousand Spirits**, **Millions of Immortals**,
Float through the void.

They traverse the **Great Qi of the Supreme Void**,
And soar through the **Luminous Canopy**.

**Zhōngyuán’s** winged ministers,
The **Spirit-Knots** of the **Right Palace**,
The **Mysterious Aides** of the **Upper Assistants**,
And the **Empress of Great Yin**—
All command the **Earthly True Ones**,
And assemble before the **Imperial Court**.

Wherever they secure and pacify,
They eternally guard against collapse.

To the **Nine Abysses** and **Eight Extremes**,
To the **Mysterious Gates** of **Hunhuang’s** threshold,
To the **Azure-Verdant Courts**,
To the **Thirty-Six Lords** of **Huaqi**,
To the **Nine Palaces’** **Dòngtiān** bureaus,
To the **Mountains, Marshes, Rivers, and Springs**,
To the **Five Rivers** and **Eight Seas**,
To the **Double Lights** along the **Streams**,
To the **Three Mysterious** and **Four Origins**,
And to all **Spirits**—

They capture **Tǔqiàn**,
Slay the **Evil Essences**,
Bind the **Northern Capital’s** **Luòchēng**,
And constrain the **Ghostly Camps**.

The living prosper in peace,
The nation’s **Zuo** flourishes in clarity.
The dead souls transmigrate,
And **White Bones** become **Humans**.
The living body receives **Deliverance**,
And abides with **Qi** eternally.

By **Cause and Condition’s** revolving wheel,
They ascend to the **Heavens Above**.
They eternally sever the **Fifteen Harmful Beings** of the **Underworld**,
Annihilate the **Ill Omens**,
And purify the **Four Abysses**.

**If their fate is extinguished,**
**Their bodies pass through the Great *Yin* (太陰),**
**Returning to the Earthly Mansions,**
**Their bones refined and reformed,**
**Their souls lingering in the soil,**
**Unenlightened in the dark.**

**At the hour of departure,**
**Fellow scholars and perfected sages shall burn incense for them,**
**Recite the scriptures ten times,**
**To guide their earthly forms according to the law.**

**The Earthly Sovereign expels malevolent *Qian* (祆),**
**Calms all spirits,**
**And by calculation of days,**
**They attain rebirth.**

**The turning wheel of existence becomes unobstructed,**
**And thus one attains the Immortals.**

**The Dao states:**
**Within heaven and earth,**
**Heaven has Nine *Xiao* (霄),**
**Earth has Nine Palaces.**
**One Palace is ninety-seven thousand two hundred *li* (里) distant from heaven.**
**Below the Nine Palaces,**
**An additional one thousand two hundred eighteen thousand *li* (里) separate them from heaven.**
**Thus, the Nine Palaces above correspond to Kunlun (昆仑),**
**Situated in heaven’s midst,**
**Like the yolk within an egg.**

**The Earthly Offices possess the *Dongyuan* (洞元) Hall,**
**The *Tongyin* (通陰) Gate,**
**And the Forty-Two Tribunals (四十二曹),**
**Below which all are Earthly Governors (地司),**
**To judge guilty souls.**

**There are also Thirty-Six Caverns,**
**Where Immortal Kings reside,**
**And all spirits beneath the earth,**
**Commanding the Thirty-Six kinds of Earthly *Qian* (祆) and monstrous beings,**
**Who harm and slander living humans,**
**Disturbing their graves and homes,**
**Bringing water and fire as calamities.**

**All must observe fasts,**
**Burn incense, and recite scriptures.**

**Fasts and scriptural recitation,**
**Their merit and virtue most weighty.**
**Above, they avert celestial disasters,**
**Calm the Nine Palaces and Earthly *Qian* (祆) omens.**
**Below, they ward off poisonous harm,**
**Saving countless people.**
**Dependence on life and death,**
**Their blessings are boundless.**
**Thus it is said: *Wuliang* (無量),**
**Universal salvation for heaven and humanity.**

**The Dao states:**
**All who possess this scripture**
**Can become the Celestial Sovereigns of heaven and earth,**
**Calming the land and countless people,**
**Warding off disasters and misfortunes.**

**When calamity arises,**
**If one resolves to observe fasts and burn incense,**
**Reciting the scriptures ten times,**
**All the heavens shall send their True Ones,**
**Dissipating ill omens,**
**And the perfected sages shall record your merit—**
**You shall attain the rank of a Golden *Jun* (君) under the Holy Sovereign’s gate.**

**The heavens record human deeds and transgressions,**
**Without the slightest loss.**
**Even the True Demons in heaven shall commend your life,**
**And those who attain the Dao shall comprehend the profound utterances.**

**The Dao speaks:**

Within these celestial realms, the Great *Dàfàn* of the Nine Fortifications in silence,
A boundless sound—
The ancient texts of the *Jiùwén* and the *Kānshū* Kings, the *Qīngxū* Caverns of *Wángwū*,
The *Yìnghuà* Gate of the Earthly Officials, marked with yellow jade,
Stand above to suppress the Nine Fortifications’ calamitous *qì*,
The *Tǔqiàn* omens of ill fortune.

Each character is broad and long, a span in measure.

The *Tiānzhēn* Sovereign of old inscribed these texts,
Setting them as the true sound.

Those who know this sound,
And fast while reciting it,
Shall have the Eight Celestial Treasures dispatch their inspectors,
The Earthly Gods and their Kings descend to observe their form,
Record their merit and diligence,
And report it to the Celestial Treasures.
Ten thousand spirits shall pay homage and bow in worship,
The Earthly *Zhǐ* shall attend the gate,
The Great *Zhēnwáng* shall champion the hidden lands,
The Dao shall be complete and all shall attain it,
They shall traverse the Three Realms,
Ascend into the Golden Gate.

This sound cleaves through all barriers,
Dispels all calamities,
Transcends all obstacles,
Accomplishes all things—
It is the natural sound of the *Tiānzhēn*.

Thus, when recited to summon all beneath the heavens,
The Supreme *Dìshàng* sings from afar,
Ten thousand spirits bow in homage and worship.
The Three Realms attend the hall,
All *qiàn* spirits bind their heads in reverence,
Ghostly essences perish of their own accord,
Pearls and panthers resound in echo,
The Ten Directions stand in solemn stillness,
Rivers and seas fall silent,
Mountains and peaks swallow their mist,
All spirits tremble in submission,
Summoning the host of immortals,
The heavens know no turbid defilement,
The earth knows no *qiàn* dust,
The dark wisdom is revealed with clarity—
The boundless virtue of the profound and ineffable.

**The Forty-Eighth Volume of the *Língbǎo* Sutra of Infinite Salvation—**
**The Supreme Marvelous Scripture, concludes.**
**The Forty-Ninth Volume begins.**

**The Chapter on the Elimination of Illness, Calamities, Lameness, and Withering—**

The *Dao* proclaims: In times past, within the *Tài'ān* Heaven, the distant resonance of the *Fēnggē* Wind Song and the *Tàihé* Great Harmony Music of the Land of Blessings was heard, as the *Yuánshǐ* received the *Wúliàng Miàojīng*—the wondrous treasure of infinite measure—for the elimination of illness, calamities, lameness, and withering.

When the *Yuánshǐ* Heavenly Venerable spoke this *sūtra*, circling ten times through the *Ten Passages*, summoning the Ten Directions, the *Tàiyī* Great Heavenly Physician, the *Shàngshèng* Most Exalted, the *Pǔjì* Universal Savior, the *Tōngzhì* All-Healing Sage, along with countless *Wúyāng* spirits, arrived upon the void.

With radiance accumulating like clouds, vermilion wheels and splendid canopies unfurling, flower-clouds casting shade, luminous mists dancing in splendor, celestial brocades interwoven in brilliance, and the vast sky illuminated—spanning five days and five nights—all the heavens, their hidden recesses and embedded peaks, were bathed in great clarity. The celestial palaces of stars and moon ceased their revolutions day and night, while the *shén* and *fēng* leaned upon the mist, and divine incense wafted through the clouds. The heavens knew no drifting obstructions, and the Six *Xū* (voids) were revealed with boundless purity. Within one land, earth and soil, mountains and rivers, forests and trees stood level and equal, with no elevation or depression, all transformed into a uniform *jìnyǐ* (jade-green) hue, devoid of variation. The myriad *zhēn* (true beings) attended in reverence.

The *Yuánshǐ* Heavenly Venerable ascended to the *playful* (xiānzuò) five-colored crystal-clear treasure seat suspended in the void, and spoke this *sūtra* once more. The great sages of the Ten Directions simultaneously extolled its virtues. At that moment, within one land, all men and women suffering from bodily afflictions gradually found relief and ease.

At the second recitation, the deaf gained hearing, the blind regained sight, and the mute could speak.

At the third recitation, the emaciated and the bloated, those afflicted with deep-seated ailments, were restored to fullness and equilibrium.

At the fourth recitation, accumulated toxins and transmitted diseases failed to reach even the gates.

At the fifth recitation, the lame and those with withered limbs could all rise and walk again.

At the sixth recitation, the malevolent and pestilential *qiàn* (spirits) were eliminated, and the *zhèngqì* (rightful *qi*) flowed freely.

At the seventh recitation, the aged regained their vigor, and the young became robust.

At the eighth recitation, bodily illnesses were dispelled, and the *fǎshēn* (Dharma-body) found joy and delight.

At the ninth recitation, all illnesses, calamities, lameness, and withering were eradicated, and those who had realized their suffering as mere illusion—never truly existent—returned to the radiant clarity of the *Dao*, free from pain. The arising and passing away of all afflictions followed from false and fantastical perceptions; once the true nature of the *Dao* was recognized, whence could illness come?

At the tenth recitation, faces emitted a violet glow, bodies shone with jade-like brilliance, all demonic afflictions were dispelled, and the divine *qi* harmonized with the *Dao*. At that moment, all men and women of that land were moved with reverence, receiving protection and attaining eternal life.

The *Dao* proclaims: At that time, when the *Yuánshǐ* Heavenly Venerable had spoken this *sūtra* once, the *Candid* (hòuqì) Great Heavenly Physician of the *Wújié Wúliàng* Infinite Measure of the Eastern Direction, along with countless *Wúyāng* spirits, arrived upon the void.

At the second recitation, the *Holding the Course* (chíyùn) Great Heavenly Physician of the *Wújié Wúliàng* Infinite Measure of the Southern Direction, along with countless *Wúyāng* spirits, arrived upon the void.

At the third recitation, the *Overseeing the Years* (sīnián) Great Heavenly Physician of the *Wújié Wúliàng* Infinite Measure of the Western Direction, along with countless *Wúyāng* spirits, arrived upon the void.

At the fourth recitation, the *Fate-Ordaining* (dìngmìng) Great Heavenly Physician of the *Wújié Wúliàng* Infinite Measure of the Northern Direction, along with countless *Wúyāng* spirits, arrived upon the void.

At the fifth recitation, the *Ghostly Sovereign* (guǐzhǔ) Great Heavenly Physician of the *Wújié Wúliàng* Infinite Measure of the Northeast Direction, along with countless *Wúyāng* spirits, arrived upon the void.

At the sixth recitation, the *Disease-Conducting* (xíngbìng) Great Heavenly Physician of the *Wújié Wúliàng* Infinite Measure of the Southeast Direction, along with countless *Wúyāng* spirits, arrived upon the void.

At the seventh recitation, the *Pestilence-Warding* (quèlì) Great Heavenly Physician of the *Wújié Wúliàng* Infinite Measure of the Southwest Direction, along with countless *Wúyāng* spirits, arrived upon the void.

At the eighth recitation, the *Eight Winds* (bāfēng) Great Heavenly Physician of the *Wújié Wúliàng* Infinite Measure of the Northwest Direction, along with countless *Wúyāng* spirits, arrived upon the void.

At the ninth recitation, the *Tàiyī* Great Heavenly Physician of the *Wújié Wúliàng* Infinite Measure of the Upper Direction, along with countless *Wúyāng* spirits, arrived upon the void.

At the tenth recitation, the *Expedient* (chúbìng) Great Heavenly Physician of the *Wújié Wúliàng* Infinite Measure of the Lower Direction, along with countless *Wúyāng* spirits, arrived upon the void.

When the ten recitations were complete, the ten directional *Wújié* Heavenly Physicians, all Universal Savior Great Deities, gathered simultaneously. All men and women of that land bowed in devotion and adoration.

They declared: *"We, by virtue of our blessings, were born in the heavens, not like the impure forms of mortal parents' essence and blood. What illnesses could we possibly have?"*

Thus, they reflected upon the divine *qi*: Though its transformations were clear and harmonious, their own minds, contaminated by habitual defilements, still harbored gross afflictions within their bodies, and their sufferings had not yet been dispelled.

*"It is like the common folk in the world, who in their dreams drink, eat, feel cold or warmth, and rest—just as they do in waking life. The body in the dream is no different from the one now shaped by their mortal parents. Even to the point of illnesses within the dream-body—pain, itch, sorrow, or joy—all manifest in the same manner, with no distinction.*

*Therefore, even now, within our bodies, these illnesses and calamities, lameness and withering, still persist. We must seek the Heavenly Venerable to remove this itch (of suffering). All must pay homage and vow to revere the *Dao* before it."*

When they arrived, it was like a fine rain and dense mist—countless *Wúyāng* spirits, half of whose land had sunk into unevenness, which could not be restrained.

Thus, the *Yuánshǐ* knew that even these heavenly beings, who had attained their fruits, still bore the marks of illness, calamities, lameness, and withering. How much more so the myriad beings of the mortal realm, conceived through *tāihuà* (conception), nurtured by *shīgǎn* (humoral pathogens), and afflicted by the seventy-two categories of suffering—could they possibly escape this torment?

Out of boundless compassion, the *Yuánshǐ* spoke this wondrous *sūtra*, eliminating all afflictions. To remove all afflictions, there is no alternative but the *Dharma* and the *Yào* (medicinal elixirs). The marvel of these *Dharma* elixirs surpasses all divine *shéndān* (pills).

Then, the *Zǐguāng* (violet light) gathered, bright as a treasure flame, forming the five-wheel hand method. The *Yuánshǐ* personally fashioned a nine-colored *Líluó* (silken robe) adorned with myriad treasures, star clouds, and jade brocades, from which emerged a divine pill, transformed into a treasure pearl as large as a millet seed, suspended in the void five *zhàng* (fathoms) above the earth.

The *Yuánshǐ* ascended and summoned: The *Tàiyī* Great Heavenly Physician, the *Shàngshèng* Most Exalted, the *Pǔjì* Universal Savior, and the ten-directional *Wújié* Heavenly Physicians who eliminate illness, along with countless *Wúyāng* spirits, all entered the treasure pearl. The heavenly beings looked on in awe, only seeing a radiant glow issuing from the pearl’s mouth—then they vanished within it, their whereabouts unknown. The people of the land dispersed, and the earth returned to its level and rightful state, free from any tilt or depression.

The *Yuánshǐ* then, within the treasure pearl, completed the recitation of this *sūtra*. The myriad *zhēn* (true beings) supervised the transmission, bestowing it upon us. At that moment, the joy and celebration were beyond words.

The *sūtra*’s rites are now fully known. The myriad heavens reassumed their stations, and in a fleeting instant, all was silent, with no lingering echoes.

At that time, the heavenly beings and people encountered the *sūtra*’s Dao/Way, universally attaining salvation and deliverance, preserving their original life, and suffering no harm or interruption. The land was peaceful, its people abundant, all rejoicing in great harmony. The Dao/Way was spoken: their hearts were sincere, their words truthful, their compassion equal, their differences reconciled in kinship.

The land was secure, its people prosperous, delighting in eternal peace. The Dao/Way began to teach, and the realm was governed by its principles. Those with devout hearts revered and honored it, enduringly attaining deliverance for all.

The Dao/Way declared: The names spoken within the *Yuánshǐ* Heavenly Sovereign’s *sūtra* are all the hidden names of the Supreme Deities within the heavens. They are also the true taboos of the *Zhēnwáng* (True Kings), consuming illness and calamity, curing lameness and chronic afflictions. These are the secret names of the *Bǎiyīng* (Hundred Spirits) that rescue ailments and suppress malevolent *qi*, not the common words of this world.

The Most Exalted has become a *Zhēnrén* (True Person), transcending the five kinds of illness and calamity. Their *fǎshēn* (Dharma body) is vast and pure, radiating *chúnyáng* (pure yang) luminosity, able to conceal and reveal itself. When revealed, they manifest universally in the ten directions; when concealed, even the *shèngzhēn* (exalted and true) cannot fathom them. All diseases and afflictions of this world have been eradicated.

Those who delve into the profound and subtle attain full understanding of its chapters. Reciting it ten times, the myriad heavens resound in distant praise, the ten thousand *Dì* (Deities) offer homage, and the inner realms grow clear. The *éshān* (lofty mountains) flatten, the earth becomes level. Illness and calamity are cured, lameness and chronic afflictions fully healed. The body stands firm, unshaken, like the *yuè* (moon) and *rì* (sun) in perfect alignment. Demons are subdued, ghostly *yīng* (spirits) vanish entirely. The dead revive, the withered flourish anew, and the decayed regain human form.

Scholars of the highest learning, reciting it ten times, will see their five *zàng* (viscera) bloom with radiance, their gallbladder and brain solidify in truth. The myriad spirits will guard their bodies, while malevolent ghosts lose their sight. Even those on the brink of death will be rescued, turning from extinction to life. Yet this is because such scholars have not yet purified their defiled *qi*, nor fully realized their true bodies. Though they may restrain the ten directions, their power has not yet subdued the heavenly laws. Their virtue can only gradually suppress worldly suffering and revive those trapped in misery—it cannot fully restore them to life.

To recite this chapter lightly is to invite misfortune upon oneself. To honor and venerate the Dao/Way, however, will dissolve illness and calamity, ease lameness, and enable healthy movement. Across all generations, one’s fortunes will flourish, free from all evil associations, with divine spirits ever guarding the gates.

This *sūtra* is most sublime and wondrous, unmatched in the *Yùjīng* (Jade Capital), its power to deliver beings boundless. It stands as the supreme source of all Dao/Way teachings.

The Dao/Way declared: For those who recite this *sūtra* ten times, the myriad heavens will gather in response. All beings afflicted by illness and calamity will see their suffering vanish, while those burdened by chronic lameness or long-term sickness will be fully restored to health. Malevolent *qi* will have no sway, the hundred *mài* (vessels) will receive their vital essence. A thousand spirits will dwell within one’s body, never departing, and the body will know no sickness or blame. Natural longevity will follow, and even the ancestors of a hundred generations will be blessed. The tormented souls of the dead will find relief, all ascending to the *Zhūgōng* (Vermilion Palace) and attaining nine years of life. Those who receive the Dao/Way’s transformation will be reborn as noble beings.

For those who study this *sūtra* to its fullest, their virtue and power will be complete, and they shall become *shèngxiān* (immortals), ascending to the *Jīnquè* (Golden Gate) and feasting in the *Yùjīng* (Jade Capital). Through the *sūtra*’s sacred Dao/Way, illness and calamity are dissolved, lameness and chronic afflictions cured. Its blessings extend to countless people, ensuring ease and comfort for all living beings. Pain and suffering will not touch them, the Supreme Deities will gaze upon them favorably, and their true names will be recorded in heaven.

Scholars of the highest order, who practice and recite this *sūtra*, will possess the full Dao/Way of all teachings. Illness and calamity will be swept away, no evil *qi* will arise. Lameness will be cured, chronic afflictions fully absolved. All will ascend to the *Zhūgōng* (Vermilion Palace) and receive deliverance.

Those of this world who recite it will find peace even in their afflictions. The stagnant and filthy *qi* within their bodies will disperse, their innate luminosity and subtlety will unfold, and they will extend their years in life. Ultimately, they will attain the *shījiě* (corporeal dissolution) path, where the soul temporarily vanishes, bypassing the torments of the underworld, and immediately regains its form, wandering freely in the boundless void.

This *sūtra* is profound and subtle, its power to deliver beings infinite. All heavenly beings and people rejoice in its blessings, and its grace extends beyond life and death.

The heavens hold it as their most treasured text, not to be passed down to mortal generations. Only the most virtuous scholars, offering gold and jade in earnest devotion and swearing by heaven, may transmit it.

If this *sūtra* is leaked or treated with negligence, the misfortune will extend to the nine ancestral generations, and they will suffer endless servitude under the Three Officials.

The Five Emperors, along with twenty-four *yùtóng yùnǚ* (jade boys and jade girls), attend this *sūtra*, safeguarding its divine texts and protecting those who receive it.

The Dao/Way declared: During the first month, when *zhǎngqí* (long fasting) is observed, reciting and chanting this *sūtra* will dissolve chronic illness. Those afflicted by diseases accumulated over years, beyond the reach of worldly medicine, or by ghostly *qi* that bewilders even skilled physicians—whether through wisdom or folly, life or death—if they transmit and practice this *sūtra* as their predecessors did, the ancestral curses will be lifted. Ghostly *qi* will no longer haunt objects, nor will the spirits of the deceased invoke retribution. All will be delivered to the *Shàngnángōng* (Upper Southern Palace), free from suffering.

In the seventh month, during *zhǎngzhāi* (long fasting), reciting and chanting this *sūtra* will dissolve the *jīnwàngkèmù* (metallic excess subduing wood), where tendons fall and malevolent *qi* takes hold. Whether caused by earthly or wooden *qi*, or by burial sites, the harmful influences that assail the limbs—rendering hands and feet useless, causing lameness and paralysis, or leaving one mired in deep-rooted afflictions—will be judged in the *Dòugōng* (Fight Palace) and examined in the *Yīnfǔ* (Dark Office). None will suffer injury or severance, and all will attain immortality.

The names of this *sūtra* are inscribed by the heavens. With *huángjī* (yellow paper) and *báijiǎn* (white tablets), it records the deaths and rebirths of beings.

In the tenth month, during *zhǎngzhāi* (long fasting), reciting and chanting this *sūtra* for all living beings will dissolve illness and calamity. It will heal the *rénfēng* (human wind) and malevolent *qi*, chronic consumption and wasting diseases, lingering cold and heat, swollen joints and perspiration, water-induced coughing and inversions, and all manner of strange afflictions, bringing universal harmony.

It will benefit kings and emperors, their ministers and offspring, securing the stability of their realms and ensuring the heavens’ eternal preservation. Their lineage will never perish, and they will always remain as rulers, bringing peace to their lands. The people will proclaim an age of true harmony.

On the eight *jié* (solar festivals), reciting and chanting this *sūtra* will dissolve the human wind, malevolent *qi*, and poisonous diseases, granting the status of *Zhēnrén* (True Person) in the Nine Palaces.

On the day of one’s *běnmìng* (original fate), reciting and chanting this *sūtra* will dispel all manner of sickness. Ghostly calamities will have no power to invade, the soul’s essence will be tranquil, and all *qi* will endure. None will experience suffering, and the body will radiate luminosity.

「Guardians of the Three Realms, attendants of the Five Emperors, and myriad deities all pay homage—names inscribed in the heavens, virtue and power fully attained. Ascend to the Upper Pure.

The Dao/Way instructs: On the day of practice, all shall bathe in fragrant waters. Observe fasts and purifications before entering the chamber. Facing east, strike the teeth thirty-two times. Above, listen to the Thirty-two Heavens; within the heart, bow to the Thirty-two Transgressions. With eyes closed, quietly contemplate the self seated amid clouds of green, purple, and blue *qi*, inner and outer radiance complete. Beside you stand the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Tortoise, Lion, and White Crane, arrayed left and right. Sun and moon illuminate the chamber, their brilliance piercing through, with the Heavenly Physician and the Junior Clerk of the Moxa-stone at your fore and aft, their images forming on your neck. Light shines in all ten directions, so vivid and distinct.

The secret incantation proclaims:
*"Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Dao/Way Lord, summon forth from my body the Thirty-five *Gōngcáo* (Functionary Officials), left and right attendants, fragrant youth bearing incense, and the玉女 (*Yùnǚ*) messengers. The Five Emperors’ direct seals, the Thirty-six officials of the Auspicious Day, all stand ready. Open the gate to what is spoken. Today is a joyous and fortunate day, with prolonged fasting in a purified hall. As one practices this *sūtra*, countless beings are liberated. Reveal the joy of what is spoken to the Supreme Lion, the Thirty-two *Yāoyuán* (Primordial Deities) of the Beginning of the Dao/Way, the Most Venerable Few Before the Celestial Throne. When complete, draw *qi* from the thirty-two directions, face east, and recite the *sūtra*.

The *Sūtra* of the Primordial Beginning, Supreme Mysterious and Spiritually Precious Essentials—
Dissolving sickness, calamity, lameness, and atrophy,
Nurturing transformation and liberation for all,
A hundred banners conceal their subtle harmonies, their separation and union by nature.
This is the support of the body, the birth of spirit from the Great Void.
Spirit tranquil and formless, without the Supreme True One.
The Primordial Ancestor of the Kalpa (eon),
Transforming and giving birth to all *Yāo* (Primordial Deities).
Heaven descends, earth ascends, yin and yang generate humanity.
Humans serve as the embryonic seed; sickness and calamity arise from causes and conditions.
Examining and punishing lameness and atrophy, accumulating retribution through entanglements,
Feeding on the Three Scenes (of existence).
Life is rooted in heaven’s decree.
Once sickness and calamity are dispelled, spirit and *qi* become neighbors—
Mystic enlightenment leads to transcendence, raising the intent to soar as spirit.
Above, there is no further ancestor, only the Dao/Way as the self.
The Five Characters (of the Dao/Way) open the expanse,
Nurturing all divine essences—none remain unilluminated.
Without the Five Characters, there is no illumination,
Without the Five Characters, there is no standing,
Without the Five Characters, there is no completion.
Without the Five Characters, there is no liberation,
Without the Five Characters, there is no birth."*

This is the Great Brahman, the Heaven within Heaven.
The Nioluo Xiaotai, the Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital.

Supreme Beyond the Supreme,
The Great Luo’s Pure Clarity.

The Nine Ranks of Immortal Saints—
Natural beings by nature.
Illnesses of the body, latent afflictions—
All attain peace.

Unattained is the Great Vehicle,
Yet sickness and calamity cling.
Refining the body into *qi*,
Refining *qi* into spirit—
Spirit merges with the Supreme Void,
As if nonexistent, as if present.

The Three Floras depart,
A wondrous palace emerges—
Golden gates, jade halls,
Forest of pure mists.

The Dao’s true *qi* encircles the Ten Directions.
Within it, the God who rescues sickness and calamity, lameness and atrophy,

The God of the World’s Salvation, Marshal of the Age,
The Benevolent Lord Han, Master of Life,
The Southern Sovereign of Fate, Lord of the Blade, Extending Longevity, Benefiting Calculations, and Removing Calamities.

Crystal shafts and emerald feathers—
Before them, the **Hàotàng** and **Tóngxiào** resound in harmony,
Behind them, the **yǔn** and **lì** pipes chime in unison,
Singing celestial melodies, whistling ethereal tunes,
The **Tianding** clear the path, their green locks and winged chariots,
Ten thousand chariots, a hundred thousand cavalry,
Floating through the void, their radiance returning—
Removing sickness, saving lives,
The Heavenly Chancellors,
The Southern Palace’s Upper Hall,
Han the Record-Keeper,
The Supervising God of Life,
Holding sacred tablets and registers,
All assembled before the Emperor.

As needed for salvation,
Severely inspecting the Heavens.
Proclaiming to the Three Realms,
The **Wují** Divine Homeland.

The **Quánqǔ** Bureau, the Northern Capital of **Luòng**,
The Three Officials, Nine Offices,
The Twelve River Plains.

Above, resolving corpse-registers and tomb disputes,
Accumulated retributions passed down through ages,
Illnesses of the starved and pestilential ghosts,
Ancestral *qi*, lameness, and atrophy,
Entangled past deeds—
And the ancestral and ancestral-kins,
All sins erased, evil roots extinguished.
No longer bound, no longer forced into ghostly crowds.
The **Yuánshǐ** talismans—
Ascending promotions at the appointed hour.

The Northern Cold Pool,
Guarding the forms and souls.
Subduing demons, recommending the worthy,
Salvaging the Nine Ranks in the Southern Palace,
Dead souls refined, transformed into immortals.
Living bodies saved—
Eon upon eon, eternally preserved.
With the eons’ wheel turning,
Lifespan equal to the heavens.
Forever transcending the Three Calamities,
The Nine Hardships and Eight Difficulties,
Soaring beyond the Three Realms,
Adrift in Upper Clarity.

**The Jade Emperor gazes in awe, the gathered immortals speak in unison.**
**Measure your merit to attain the rank of Immortal—**
**The ten thousand *qi* are forever harmonized and perfected.**
**Illness arises from past karma,**
**Your *hun* departs to the Ghostly Bureau.**
**In vain do you summon your disciples,**
**To suffer grief and bitter sorrow.**
**You fail to grasp the formless Dao,**
**Endlessly revolving through birth and death.**
**Seeing the Dao yet clinging to emptiness,**
**Your spirit flees to the Jade Capital’s peaks.**

**At that time, the enlightened sage—**
**No evil trial shall touch him.**

**The Second Chapter of Universal Salvation by the True Person**
**The Azure Dragon of *Kui*, clad in dark armor,**
**With ten-zhang steel whiskers.**
**Devouring ten thousand ghosts,**
**No evil or pestilence remains.**
**Plague and poison darken the eyes,**
**The *yinyuan* swiftly drives them away.**
**Summoning the Heavenly Host,**
**Divine officials execute them.**
**By the records and decrees,**
**The Nine Abysses are traversed with peril.**

---

**Why do you linger with decaying *qi*?**
**Feigning form and plotting in vain.**
**Entering the blood and meridians of mortals,**
**Obstructing their sacred abodes.**
**Stalling the flow of *qi*,**
**Becoming a mere corpse’s ghost.**
**Through dreams and thoughts, you connect with the *yinyuan*,**
**Your intentions sensed by the dark spirits.**
**You alter their forms and attire,**
**Disrupting the Yellow Palace’s order.**
**You fail to awaken to this,**
**Sitting in pride with others.**
**Your name is inscribed in the Northern *Ting* registers,**
**And your retribution shall never cease.**

**Why not dwell in mountain forests,**
**Reflecting on the Dao to perfect yourself?**
**I traverse the Purple Mist’s path,**
**Residing in the Yellow Court to save suffering.**
**The Third Chapter: The Great Sage of Longevity’s Song to Lift the Lame and the Afflicted**

**A thousand *ren* tall jade-green mountain,**
**Ten thousand banners of flying fire.**
**The Tiger’s Ridge controls the bowstrings,**
**The *He* river’s *li* beats the drum.**
**The Great God rides the clouds,**
**Stars stream like lightning.**
**Gazing down upon the *Aluoren*,**
**They rise yet fall again.**
**Evil *qi* withers their bones,**
**Their sinews twist into family calamity.**
**The *baifeng* wastes their limbs,**
**The *zhaigui* makes them drag their bodies.**

**They do not know their past karma’s cause,**
**Their true hearts drowned in dust.**
**Greed, anger, doubt, and false views—**
**These ties bind them.**
**They sacrifice lives to appease ghosts and gods,**
**Their deaths sealed in the *Xuansha* prison,**
**A hundred million years—**
**When shall they be freed?**

**You must awaken to the Dao’s mysteries,**
**The wondrous *Xuan* shall birth your spirit.**
**Naturally, there is no death or life,**
**Forever a Pure and High Immortal.**
**Adrift in the art of *Wuwei*,**
**The utmost Yang sustains your endless essence.**
**Above the Three Realms,**
**Within the flying void—**
**The True King’s sacred hymn,**
**Its resonance matching the *Dongzhang*.**

**Recite it a hundred times,**
**And all illnesses shall vanish.**
**Recite it a thousand times,**
**And all karmic ties shall be severed.**
**A myriad times, the Dao is realized,**
**Universal salvation for all beings.**
**Ascend to the Great Void,**
**Transcend the Three Realms,**
**Rank among the Immortals of the Bureau.**
**Those who hear this sacred sound—**
**Ten thousand demons are bound in form,**
**The *Diyu* spirits obey the command,**
**Escorting and welcoming with reverence,**
**Drawn forth from the earthly gate,**
**Free from the five sufferings and eight hardships,**
**The seven ancestors ascend in merit,**
**Forever parted from the Ghostly Bureau,**
**The *hun* passes through the *Zhuling*,**
**Refined and reborn anew.**

**This is called the boundless salvation,**
**Universal deliverance without end.**

**There is a secret celestial diagram,**
**Revered by all the heavens.**
**To reveal it in arrogance or negligence—**
**You shall fall into hell,**
**And your misfortune shall extend to the seven ancestral spirits.**

**The Dao declares:**
**These two chapters are from the Celestial Sovereigns of all the heavens,**
**And the most sacred immortals,**
**To dispel diseases and plagues,**
**To cure the lame and the afflicted,**
**To illuminate the original *Zhenyuan*,**
**The primordial, unchanging Dao,**
**With no alteration or decline.**
**The retribution for illness—**
**All from karmic ties,**
**Endlessly cycling through habits,**
**The *qi* transforming accordingly.**
**Thus there are groans and pains,**
**Such as these.**

**Refining the spirit and penetrating the void,**
**A hundred million *jie* of endless time,**
**Not entering the cycle,**
**The body attains the True Person’s essence,**
**No birth, no death.**

**Hidden sacred sounds—**
**All are the words of the Great Brahman,**
**Not the common speech of the world.**
**No rhyme nor ornate melody,**
**No harmonious tune nor decorative verse.**
**Thus called the profound mysteries,**
**Difficult to trace or discern.**
**Treasure of the heavens above,**
**Secreted in the *Shenxiao* True King’s palace,**
**To be revealed in the *Yuanji* Three Thousand Eight Hundred years of cosmic alignment.**
**If a sage brings a golden treasure with a sincere heart,**
**According to the old format,**
**And pledges with the Three Heavens,**
**Then it shall be granted.**

**The Dao declares:**
**When the heavens and earth fall ill,**
**There are earthquakes and landslides,**
**Floods and droughts,**
**Winds and hail—**
**The cosmic cycles falter and terminate.**
**When the sun, moon, and Five Stars fall ill,**
**They are eclipsed or diminished,**
**Their light obscured or wan.**
**Even the most sacred divine beings,**
**Though abandoning the cause of illness,**
**Free from worldly afflictions,**
**May still have periods of rest or concealment,**
**Following the rise and fall of the cycles.**
**The shallow scholars too may suffer sickness.**
**All who face such calamities—**
**Those of shared *qi* must unite in heart to practice fasting,**
**Burn incense at the six times,**
**Recite the scriptures ten thousand times,**
**And virtue shall descend to dispel all inauspiciousness.**

**The boundless scriptures,**
**Universal salvation without end.**
**The Dao declares:**
**The shallow scholars, their Dao weak,**
**Or their immortality not yet fulfilled,**
**When diseases cling and the lame drag their feet,**
**They may retreat in true thought,**
**Saying the Dao has no power.**
**If fellow scholars and sages practice fasting for them,**
**And recite the scriptures ten thousand times,**
**According to the proper method—**
**Then the spirit-*qi* flows and circulates,**
**Ascending and descending,**
**True nature awakens,**
**Illness dissolves.**
**By their merit and practice,**
**The healing shall be measured in days,**
**Their lifespan extended forever,**
**And they shall attain immortality.**

**The Dao declares:**
**When the heavens and earth’s cycles conclude,**
**The stars’ courses are disrupted,**
**The sun and moon lose their appointed times,**
**The four seasons falter,**
**Yin and Yang are unbalanced,**
**And the realm faces disaster—**
**Then plagues arise in all directions,**
**Epidemics spread,**
**The people suffer death and injury,**
**The teacher and disciple are lost in floods,**
**Or perish in the chaos,**
**Their bodies wracked with pain.**
**All must practice fasting,**
**Burn incense, and recite the scriptures.**

**Fasting and reciting the scriptures—**
**Their merit is profound.**
**Above, it dispels celestial calamities,**
**And secures the safety of the realm.**
**Below, it wards off poison and harm,**
**And delivers the people.**
**Life and death depend upon it,**
**Their blessings are immeasurable.**
**Thus it is called boundless salvation,**
**Universal deliverance for both heaven and man.**

**The Dao declares:**
**All who possess this scripture,**
**May perform these merits for the heavens, earth, and all beings.**
**On days of calamity,**
**With sincere intent, they fast and burn incense,**
**Recite the scriptures ten thousand times,**
**And all illnesses and afflictions—**
**Shall be utterly destroyed.**
**The heavens record their names,**
**Ten thousand gods stand guard,**
**Distinguishing them from the common sages,**
**And they shall be worthy to serve as ministers beneath the Golden Gate of the Holy Sovereign.**

**The heavens record every person’s merits and sins,**
**With no loss of even a hair’s breadth.**
**The Heavenly Demon Kings shall also recommend you,**
**And those who attain the Dao must understand these sacred truths.**

**In the heavens’ midst, the Great Brahman speaks in hidden, boundless sounds.**
**Composed by the Dao Sovereign.**
**The Middle Section of the *Yuanji* Scriptures for Dispelling Illness and Affliction,**
**From the Eastern Eight Heavens.**

**Holy Response Shines Resplendent,**
**Auspicious Blessings Flow Unbroken.**
**Heaven’s Grace Descends in Subtle Light,**
**Reverent Harmony Aligns with the Central Dao.**

**Teachings Shift Like the *Yì*’s Symbols,**
**Yet the Supreme Truth Remains Distant.**
**Exalted Virtues Unmatched,**
**Their Brilliance Echoes in Celestial Decrees.**

**Spirit’s Essence, Qi’s Profound Depth,**

**Proclaiming Laws to Nurture Life,**
**Rescuing the Frail and the Weak.**

**The Dao Speaks:**
Within the heavens’ midst, the Great Brahman’s hidden sounds resound—
**Boundless, ineffable tones.**

**The ancient text, inscribed with crimson and gold on the finest bristles,**
**Was written upon the Northern Expanse of the Purple Hall’s celestial gate,**
**Where the Dao’s Qi descends to the *Miànsù*’s starry tail,**
**To heal all illnesses, afflictions, and deformities,**
**To repay past misdeeds,**
**To dissolve entangling curses, grievances, and debts of *qi*,**
**So that virtue may be self-bestowed,**
**And sickness utterly erased.**

**This scripture—traced by the *Fèngjì* and *Lóngjì*’s marks—**
**Each character spanning a full ten feet—**
**Was originally inscribed by the Eastern Flower’s Senior Attendant, the Azure Youth Dao Sovereign,**
**As the true phonetic standard.**

**Those who know its sounds and recite them in fasting devotion,**
**The heavens dispatch flying celestial clerks to observe their merit,**
**And report upward to the gods,**
**Where ten thousand spirits pay homage,**
**Earthly spirits guard the gates,**
**Great merit ascends to the Celestial Pivot,**
**And the worthy are recommended as Supreme Immortals.**

**Thus, the Dao is complete—**
**Wandering the Three Realms, ascending to the Golden Gate.**

**This sound repels all, averts all, transcends all, achieves all—**
**The natural sound of Heavenly Purity.**

**Therefore, when recited, the flying clerks descend to observe,**
**The Supreme Sovereign sings afar,**
**Ten thousand gods pay homage,**
**The Three Realms attend the hall,**
**All spirits bow in reverence.**

**Demon essences flee,**
**Jade chimes resound,**
**The Ten Directions grow serene,**
**Rivers and seas fall silent,**
**Mountains swallow their mists,**
**All beings tremble in submission,**
**Summoning the gathered immortals,**
**Heaven knows no filth,**
**Earth no profane dust,**
**The Dark Wisdom clears—**
**Great Compassion, profound and boundless.**

**The Forty-Ninth Scroll of the *Língbǎo Wúliàng Dùrén Shàngpǐn Miàojīng* concludes.**
**The Fiftieth Scroll begins.**

**The Fifty-First Scroll of the *Língbǎo Wúliàng Dùrén Shàngpǐn Miàojīng* commences.**
**The Scroll of the Daoic Declaration on the Dissolution of Water and Fire Calamities and Plagues.**

**The Dao speaks thus:**
In days of old, within the **Purple Primordial Treasure** of **Supreme Heaven**, the **Void of the Jade Sound** ascended in radiant splendor, receiving the **Mysterious Daoic Scripture** of **Primordial Beginning** to dissolve water and fire calamities and plagues.

When **Primordial Beginning Heavenly Sovereign** spoke this sutra, He circled ten times through the **Ten Passages**, summoning the **Ten Directions** to gather at His seat. The **Heavenly Purity Great Deity**, the **Supreme Sage High Sovereign**, the **Mysterious Daoic True Person**, and countless **innumerable hosts** descended upon the void. Their **auspicious mists** gathered in the sky, their **divine qi** wafted in hues, borne by **jewel-wheeled celestial palanquins**.

The **flowering canopy** cast its shade,
A myriad scenes condensed into light,
Ten thousand precious colors illuminated the boundless expanse,
Seven days and seven nights of resplendent radiance.
All **Heavenly Hosts** moved in measured steps,
The sun and moon revolved in their courses,
Their brilliance converged as one.
The **starry lodges** and **celestial spheres** paused in their orbits,
The **Azure Mountains** layered in peaks,
The **Divine Sea** still in waves,
Heaven draped in **immortal clouds**,
Earth formed of **jade and pearl**,
Towers and gates extended in splendor,
Dragons scaled the heights, phoenixes danced in flight,
White **lingzhi mushrooms** and crimson **sangzhi trees** bore offerings of fragrant dew,
Emerald shadows and golden splendor—
The whole world shared in its hue.

The **innumerable hosts** of **True Ones** attended His seat,
And **Primordial Beginning Heavenly Sovereign** sat in mystical repose above the **Nine-Colored True Dragon** of the floating void.

After one recitation of the sutra,
All **Heavenly Great Sages** simultaneously praised its excellence.
At that time, men and women of the land,
Joyfully listening to the **Heavenly Sovereign’s** proclamation of the **Great Daoic Law** to dissolve water and fire calamities and plagues,
And to **compassionately save** the **Three Realms** without measure.

After two recitations,
Heaven shook, its **jade brush** sweeping wide,
The **Dragon’s Vision** enveloped all.

After three recitations,
The **Celestial River** poured forth its light,
**Dark Pearls** drifted like rain.

After four recitations,
Waters surged, fires descended,
Transformations unfolded in their natural course.

After five recitations,
Calamities and plagues ceased to arise,
The **effulgent cycle** extended far.

After six recitations,
**Yin** was balanced, **Yang** harmonized,
The **qi** knew no suppression or excess.

After seven recitations,
The **Mixed Primordial** revealed its power,
The **Divine Pattern** flourished in abundance.

After eight recitations,
The **Void’s Essence** was refined in **emptiness**,
The **True Deities** shone in clarity.

After nine recitations,
A **golden platform** rose from the depths,
The **gods and immortals** gazed down in reverence.

After ten recitations,
**Dried corpses** regained their flesh,
**Darkened souls** found illumination,
And at that time, men and women of the land,
All without exception, turned their hearts in devotion.
Each received **protection and guidance**,
All attained **eternal life**.

**The Dao speaks thus:**
At that time, when **Primordial Beginning Heavenly Sovereign** recited the sutra once,
The **Great Deity of Limitless Boundless** from the **East** arrived, with **innumerable hosts** descending upon the void.
After two recitations,
The **Jade-Historied Great Deity of Limitless Boundless** from the **South** arrived, with **innumerable hosts** descending upon the void.
After three recitations,
The **Great Deity of Planting the Kalpa** of **Limitless Boundless** from the **West** arrived, with **innumerable hosts** descending upon the void.
After four recitations,
The **Great Deity of Conquering the Kalpa** of **Limitless Boundless** from the **North** arrived, with **innumerable hosts** descending upon the void.
After five recitations,
The **Great Deity of Weighty Measure** of **Limitless Boundless** from the **Northeast** arrived, with **innumerable hosts** descending upon the void.
After six recitations,
The **Great Deity of Governing Water** of **Limitless Boundless** from the **Southeast** arrived, with **innumerable hosts** descending upon the void.
After seven recitations,
The **Great Deity of Extinguishing Fire** of **Limitless Boundless** from the **Southwest** arrived, with **innumerable hosts** descending upon the void.
After eight recitations,
The **Great Deity of Dissolving Calamities** of **Limitless Boundless** from the **Northwest** arrived, with **innumerable hosts** descending upon the void.
After nine recitations,
The **Great Deity of Transmuting Plagues** of **Limitless Boundless** from **Above** arrived, with **innumerable hosts** descending upon the void.
After ten recitations,
The **Great Deity of Receiving the Kalpa’s Aid** of **Limitless Boundless** from **Below** arrived, with **innumerable hosts** descending upon the void.

When the tenfold recitation was complete,
The **Heavenly Purity Great Deities** of the **Ten Directions** all gathered at once.
Men and women of the land turned their hearts in reverence,
Each offering **precious rarities**—
Divine incense, wondrous robes,
Infinite **Daoic implements**,
Banners, flags, and parasols,
Jade pendants and pearled tassels,
Like clouds massed and rain pouring thick.
The **innumerable hosts** bowed in **topknot homage**,
Praising the **Heavenly Sovereign**,
Eager to hear the **Great Law**.

Thus, **Primordial Beginning** caressed the **cloud-carved jade table**,
Waved the **purple-gold elixir dust** from His **celestial brush**,
And with a downward glance, spoke to the **tenfold assembly** of **Heavenly Beings**:
*"I, from the beginning, shaped the **Mixed Primordial**,
Generated the **Two Principles**,
Commanded **Yin** and **Yang**,
First sealed the **Supreme Heavenly Sovereign** above—

The **earth’s sustaining threads** span
**Three hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three billion** leagues.

The south and north decrease by a thousand *li*,
The east and west increase by a thousand *li*.
From the earth’s surface to half the sky,
The **Eight Extremes** of **Just Wind** stretch—
Thus too the earth’s depths conform.

Uniting and expanding, all-encompassing,
Its measure is the **Hook-and-Stock** [method].
The **Suspended Heaven’s Gnomon** marks,
The **Earth’s Instrument** aligns—
A shift of a thousand *li* yields an inch,
Approximating Heaven’s breadth: **three hundred sixty-six million *li***.
Seeking it with ten thousand heavens
Cannot measure its extent.

**Nine Qi** of the Azure Sky,
Heaven has **Nine Primordials**.
The **Nine Primordials** cycle through **Thirty-Two Revolutions**,

The **Five Directions’ Revolutions**,
Thirty-Two Revolutions complete.
**Nine thousand nine hundred degrees** circle—
The **Five Directions’ Qi** all ascend,
**Primordial Green-Yang Qi** returns.
**Soul-Treasury Mystic Capital**,
**Jade-Peace Mountain’s midst**,
Circuits all heavens,
Sun, moon, star hosts—
Beyond the **Ten Voids**.

**Nine hundred ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety-nine degrees**—
**Heavenly Qi** surges,
At the **Kalpa’s exchange**, Heaven and Earth regenerate—
This is the **Dao** of **Water-Fire** transformation.
Only those who **dissolve and transmute** may
Pacify calamities and plagues.

Thus, the **Dao** has its **Nine-One**,
Heaven its **Nine-One**,
Earth its **Nine-One**,
Humans its **Nine-One**.
The **Four Nines** combine—
**Thirty-Six Qi** total.
Gathering **Thirty-Six Heavens**,
Each transforms and gives birth.
**Nine-One, Nine-Nine**—
**Eighty-One Primordial Qi**.
The **Void** has **Eighty-One Dao-Qi**,
Heaven has **Eighty-One Sacred Heavens**,
Earth has **Eighty-One True Qi**,
Humans have **Eighty-One Immortal Qi**—

Mysterious transformations in humans yield **Thirty-Six Portals**.
The **Dao** has **Thirty-Six Thousand** divine, mysterious symbols,
Heaven has **Thirty-Six Thousand** cloud-constructed palaces,
Earth has **Thirty-Six Thousand** caverns,
Humans have **Thirty-Six Thousand** divine cognizances.
The **Dao** is the **Mysterious Void’s** utmost essence,
Humans are Heaven and Earth’s utmost spirit—
Also the transformations of **Water-Fire**.

When Heaven and Earth reach the **kalpa’s** exhaustion,
Water-Fire plagues arise.
Only the **Supreme Sage**, the **Highest Exalted Ones**,
The **Heavenly Emperors**,
Can pacify and harmonize.
Then the **kalpa** knows no end,
Water-Fire suffer no eruption or decay.

In the world, Water-Fire plagues
Are pacified only by **Daoic Sage-Kings**,
**Virtuous** worthy ministers.
In the human body, Water-Fire plagues
Are pacified only by **Serene Tranquility** and **Non-Action**,
Lowering Fire, raising Water.

None but the **Supreme True** highest scholars
Can know this—
The **Great Dao** of dissolving and transforming
Water-Fire plagues.

The **Primordial Beginning**’s teaching now complete,
The gathered **True Ones** overseeing salvation,
Passed it all to me—
At that moment, joy and celebration beyond words.

The **Law’s** rites now roughly fulfilled,
The **Heavens’** ranks restored,
In a flash—
Silence, no lingering echoes.

Then, **Heavenly Beings** and mortals met the **Sutra’s** Law,
All attained deliverance,
Their original years preserved—
None harmed in between.

The land’s people turned in reverence,
All recognizing the **Dao’s** essence,
For **Water-Fire qi** was balanced in harmony.

**Heaven and Earth** serene and tranquil,
Humans and things secure and flourishing.
No strife, no victory—
No eruption, no decay.
No stagnation, no frustration—
No suppression, no confinement,
No blockage, no concealment.

Words held no excess, lips no deceit,
All aligned in compassion—
Differing bones yet bound as kin.

The realm secure, the people prosperous,
Rejoicing in **Great Peace**.

When the **Sutra** first emerged with its teachings,
The land unified under the **Dao**,
All with sincere hearts,
Devoted to ritual and instruction—
All attained **world-transcendence**.

The **Dao’s** words:
What the **Primordial Beginning Heavenly Venerable** spoke in the **Sutra**
Are the **Heavenly Sovereigns’** inner names,
Hidden resonant sounds.
They are also the **Demon Kings’** tabooed names,
The **Hundred Spirits’** concealed designations.

The **Supreme Sage**, already perfected as **True Person**,
Internally forged the **Spiritual Treasure**—
**True Water** undisturbed, **Elixir Spirit** without smoke.
Balanced and gentle, harmonizing salvation,
Dissolving and transforming malevolence and poison,
Eradicating calamities and plagues,
Penetrating the **Mysterious** and fathoming the subtle—
All its principles known.

Recited ten times,
The **Northern Capital**’s hymns resound,
The **Southern Ridge** records virtue,
The **Fire Mountain** radiates brilliance,
Revealing warmth and depth.
The **Dragon’s Marsh** clears and gleams.

**Heaven’s Virtue** pure and pacified.

The poisons vanish, the age of calamity endures.
No pestilence arises, the people thrive in peace and joy.
The scholars of highest learning,
recite it ten times—
then the Five Phases follow their course,
the Three Calamities vanish on their own,
the demonic essences lose their power,
the ghostly spirits perish utterly.

They rescue those at death’s door,
bringing life from extinction.

This is why:
The learned embrace the Spirit and govern the qi,
water and fire maintain their order,
measured and refined in their transformations,
their principles ever constant—
no deviation, no error.
They rectify the cosmic order,
and the scourge of burning destruction
is returned to Heaven’s decree.

Lightly reciting this chapter,
one’s body may suffer misfortune—
but offering reverence and devotion,
one’s household flourishes eternally,
generation after generation,
untainted by all ills,
divine protection at the gate.

This scripture is most exalted and wondrous,
unmatched in the Jade Capital,
its power to liberate boundless,
the root of ten thousand Ways.
Its grandeur is vast and profound,
its virtue beyond measure.

The Dao speaks:
All who recite this scripture ten times
invite the Heavenly Hosts to assemble,
countless myriads of ancestors,
suffering spirits in torment—
all are immediately liberated,
ascending to the Vermilion Palace,
their term set at nine years.
They are reborn through transformation,
becoming noble as celestial birds.
Through the scripture’s power of resonance,
the True Ones of Water and Fire
merge in dual radiance,
the odd and even in perfect accord.
Yin and Yang are harmonized.
True qi responds within,
ascending to the Mysterious Pass,
the Celestial Hosts descend in attendance,
their echoes resounding at the Southern Ridge.

And those who earnestly study this scripture,
when their merit is complete and virtue fulfilled,
all attain immortality.
They soar to the Golden Gate,
feasting in the Jade Capital.

The advanced scholars who practice this scripture,
with daily recitation beside the sun and moon,
see water and fire’s light take flight,
dissolving calamities and plagues—
all are immediately liberated,
ascending to the Southern Palace.

When the world recites it,
the heart’s fire descends to the Purple Chamber,
the Mysterious Water ascends to the Golden Gate.
The central pool shines with clarity.
The White Primordial rejoices in delight.

Harmful *qi* is purged away,
true spirit eternally preserved—
all thereafter attain the *shìjiě* Dao.

The soul-spirit temporarily extinguished,
avoids the *dìyù*,
immediately regains its form,
wandering through the Great Void.

This scripture is subtle and profound,
universally liberating without end.
All celestial and human beings,
none but receive its blessings.

Infinite merit bestowed,
life and death alike find grace.
A treasure of the Upper Heaven,
not passed down to mortal worlds.

The worthy ones, bearing gold and sincerity,
pledge to Heaven—
yet if they betray with lightness, leak secrets, or indulge in sloth,
they bring ruin to their nine ancestral lines,
endlessly enslaved to ghostly officials.

Twenty-four *yùtóng* and *yùnǚ* attend,
guarding the sacred scripture.
They shield those who receive it in body.

The Dao instructs:
In the first month, observe a long fast,
recite and chant this scripture.
At the *sān yuán* season,
transform the *qi* of water-fire calamities and illness,
for the departed of the Upper World—
severing the bonds of earthly pursuit,
ascending to the Southern Palace.

In the seventh month, observe a long fast,
recite and chant this scripture,
at the *wǔ yùn* season—
dissolving the *qi* of water-fire plagues and afflictions.
The body attains immortality,
all heavens record their names.
With *huáng biàn* and *bái jiǎn*,
death is erased, rebirth secured.

In the tenth month, observe a long fast,
recite and chant this scripture,
at the *liù qì* season—
purifying the *qi* of water-fire plagues and afflictions.
For kings and imperial lords,
their sovereigns, ministers, fathers, and sons.

Stabilize the nation’s fate,
preserve the heavens’ enduring existence,
eternal across generations without cessation,
ever securing the ruler’s domain in peace.
The people proclaim the Great Peace.

On the eight festivals,
recite and chant this scripture;
rectify the records of the eight directions,
great and small calamitous cycles of water and fire—
the disasters of clashing and erosion—
dissipating and harmonizing them.
Thus the Nine Palaces’ *qi* becomes serene,
the people prosper and thrive,
becoming the True Persons of the Nine Palaces.

On one’s natal day,
recite and chant this scripture,
so that the celestial stems and terrestrial branches suffer no harm,
water and fire balance in moderation,
true *qi* spontaneously arises,
spirit and soul become pure and upright,
ten thousand breaths endure eternally,
free from suffering and torment,
the body radiant with light,
attended by the Three Realms.
The Five Emperors lead the welcome,
ten thousand spirits pay homage,
one’s name inscribed in heaven,
merit fulfilled, virtue complete—
ascending to the Upper Clarity.

The Dao speaks:
On days of practice,
bathe in fragrant water, fast and purify within the chamber,
facing east.
Knock the teeth thirty-two times,
hearing the thirty-two heavens above,
mentally bow thirty-two times for past transgressions,
close the eyes,
quietly contemplate sitting amid the three-colored clouds—
green, yellow, and white—
inner and outer gates sealed in darkness.

There appear:
the Azure Dragon, the White Tiger, the Vermilion Bird, the Dark Tortoise,
the Lion, the White Crane,
arrayed on either side.
Sun and moon shine brightly within the hall,
a round effigy grows at the neck,
its light illuminating the ten directions—
so vividly clear.
Recite the secret incantation:

*"Supreme Primordial, the Most High Dao Lord,
summon forth from my body the thirty-six officials of the Five Agents,
left and right ministerial spirits,
attendants of jade and youth,
transmitting maidens of jade,
the Five Emperors’ straight seals,
the straight-day incense officials—
each thirty-six in number—
open the gates as spoken.*

Today’s joyous occasion,
a long fast in the pure hall,
practicing this most wondrous scripture,
countless degrees of liberation.
May what is invoked ascend directly
before the Most High Supreme Sovereign of the Thirty-Two Heavens,
the Primordial Emperor of the Beginning.

When finished,
draw the breath thirty-two times, facing east, and recite the scripture.

*The Primordial’s Supreme Scripture of Countless Liberations,*
*The Primordial’s Mystic Treasure of the Cavernous and Transcendent,*
dissipating and transforming water-fire plagues—
tenfold liberation for beings.
Hundreds of demons vanish in silence,
unity and separation occur naturally.
The Three Heavens grow luminous,
the *congee* of the *xuan* treasures undivided.
The primordial embryo yet unopened,
some float, some sink.
The floating are yang, the sinking yin.
The floating ascend in flame,
the sinking descend in moisture.
Nature formed, substance complete—
named Water and Fire.
Formed yet without substance,
like *qi* yet not *qi*—
the Ancestor of the Ultimate Dao,
the Essence of the Great Void.
Above, water; below, fire—
the divine traverses between.
Above, fire; below, water—
*qi* guards their threshold.
Water and fire intermingle,
wind becomes their spirit,
transforming heaven and earth,
nurturing the cosmos.

Metal *qi* brings clarity,
rigid nature hardens—
water nourishes wood,
wood ignites within.
Water and fire established,
true earth takes dominion—
earth as the Void Mother.
The Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital,
the Yellow Hall, the Purple Courtyard.
The Nine Ranks of the Most High,
the Three True Ones of the Imperial Pole—
arising from the harmony of water and fire.

Suppressed or dominant,
weak or strong—
they shift into plagues and afflictions,
corrupting and decaying,
*qi* obstructed, spirit alarmed.

Fire’s essence becomes the sun,
water’s essence the moon;
the moon fulfills the year’s work,
the sun governs the celestial tracks.
The Three Realms, ten thousand things—
thus all flourish in benefit.
The Five Phases, Six *Qi*—
water and fire take precedence.
Great *qi* refines and nourishes—
nine ten-thousand, nine thousand.
The Vermilion Brightness unfurls the diagram,
cycles move naturally.
Passing through water, overcoming fire—
true attains its true.
Above, no return to the Ancestor—
only the Dao as body.
Water and fire intermingle,
universally planting divine spirits.
Sacred texts form seals,
dragons and phoenixes soar on clouds.
Without texts, no light,
without texts, no clarity,
without texts, no establishment,
without texts, no completion,
without texts, no liberation,
without texts, no birth—
this is the Great Brahman,
the Heaven within Heaven.
The *Yùluó* Tower, the *Xiāotái*,
the Supreme Extremity, the Great Luo’s Jade Purity.
Flickering between life and death—
the True Lords of Water and Fire.
Moving through celestial cycles,
the stars *Bì*, *Zhì*, and *Shēn*.
Traveling through human fate,
water and fire drown and burn.
Moving through the earth,
plagues arise—
land collapses, mountains tilt.
*Qi* has order or reversal,
cycles have ruin or completion.
The Upper True Ones transform and dissipate,
generating the Dao’s tranquil peace.

Within water and fire’s two *qi*,
circulating the ten directions—
there is the god who liberates beings from death,
there is the Southern Polarity Lord of longevity,
there is the god who dissipates plagues,
there is the Great Marshal who governs the world,
there is the Benevolent Lord Han the Elder,
there is the Southern Registrar,
the Venerable who prolongs life and extends fate’s measure.
Reviving the corpse, countless liberations.

Today’s assembly—
the heavens attend the hall.
The East: the Supreme Primordial God-King of the Boundless Void,
the Great Sage of Longevity, Countless Liberator.
The South: the Supreme Primordial God-King of the Crimson Sovereign,
the Great Sage of Longevity, Countless Liberator.

the Great Sage of Longevity, Countless Liberator.
Below: the Primordial God-King of the Elemental Fire,
the Great Sage of Longevity, Countless Liberator.

The Ten Directions’ Most True Flying Heavenly God-Kings of Longevity,
the Great Gods of World-Liberation,
all riding the Three Substance Clouds,
the Eight Immortal’s Dan Palanquins,
wind-wheels and cloud-canopies,
tiger-umbrellas and coiled-beam carriages,
yoked with vermilion phoenixes and five-colored dragons,
bearing the Seven Radiant Banners,
the Nine-Hued Sacred Pennants—
before them, ten thousand dancers chant in unison,
behind them, a thousand bells resound together.
Vermilion phoenixes and azure dragons
sing in melodious tones,
mystic beasts and divine birds
call with resonant voices.
The Five Elders clear the path,
the host of immortals flank the procession—
countless chariots, ten thousand cavalry,
floating through the void and arriving.

「The radiance is reversed, the True Ones return in procession. The Two Aspects of Water and Fire,

the Upper Palace of Nanchang, where the Lord Han oversees the Records,
the Great God of Life-Liberation, bearing the sacred tablets and registers,
all arriving before the Celestial Sovereign.

They pacify the Water and Fire,
letting no calamity or pestilence touch them.
Wherever they are needed, they liberate—
strictly judging all the heavens.

They universally proclaim to the Mystic Capital,
the Celestial Gate of Jade,
the Twelve Palaces divided,
the First of the Six Jia.

Water does not overflow,
Fire does not blaze recklessly.
The Mystic Essence guards its place,
the Crimson Talisman lies dormant.

Water and Fire merge in *qi*,
unable to stray.

Great and small *kalpas* of fate,
the Nine-Hundred-Six Heavens.
They extinguish calamities and pestilences,
bringing peace to the Three Realms.

The Divine Abode of the Boundless,
the Bureau of the Curved Springs,
the Northern Capital of Luo—
the Three Officials and Nine Offices,
the Twelve River Sources,
where water monsters are quelled,
the surging waves stilled into deep repose,
the Nine Spirits bearing their scriptures,
and grievances made manifest.

They release the Ancestors above,
a billion *kalpas* of kindred souls,
quickly dispel the Register of Sins,
and extinguish the roots of evil.

No power to detain or oppress,
no coercion of the ghostly legions.
The Original Beginning’s decrees ascend,
marked by the hour for advancement.

The Northern Capital’s Cold Pool,
guarding the forms and spirits of the departed.
They subdue demons and uphold the worthy,
and liberate the ranks of the Southern Palace.

The dead souls undergo refining,
becoming immortal and reborn as humans.
The living bodies receive liberation,
and endure through endless *kalpas*.
With the *kalpas*, they flow and transform,
matching the heavens in longevity.

They forever liberate the Three Realms of Suffering,
the Five Grievances and Eight Hardships,
transcending the Three Realms,
and roaming freely in the Upper Clarity.

The Upper Clarity Heaven,
where the Celestial Sovereign’s Jade Truth reigns,
and the Boundless Realm of *Dharma*—
Water, Fire, and pestilence,
are but the great and small variations of the Nine-Hundred-Six.

Only those of the kindred of humanity above the Celestial Sovereign
escape the Three Calamities.
From the Purple Micro Enclosure to the Nine Forts of Heavy Darkness,
all are places where calamities reach.

Even the Saints and True Sovereigns,
cannot alter their course—
like eclipses of the sun and moon.
Only by ascending into the Formless,
does one avoid the Water and Fire calamities.

This Heaven also belongs to the Three Realms,
and follows the same law as the *Lingbao*.

The Nine Harmonies and Ten Unifications,
transforming into the Upper Clarity.
The depths of the Mystic Transformation,
are profound beyond measure.

They regulate the fate of Water and Fire,
universally liberating gods and humans.

Today, rejoicing in receiving the liberation,
passing through the gates of all the heavens,
they request the extinguishing of the calamities of drifting, burning, and roaming—
the great and small unions of the Nine-Hundred-Six,
the waxing and waning, eclipses,
and the poisons of the Three Origins.
They transcend the hardships of fate,
and are listed among the Supreme Mystic,
the Demon Kings overseeing the worthy,
with no restriction at the Heavenly Gate.

The Eastern Dipper establishes the Ladle,
the Western Dipper generates *qi*,
the Northern Dipper is the Water Spirit,

as the gathering of the *kalpa*.

They name themselves the Terrific and Resplendent,
and all the heavens acknowledge their deeds.

The Water *Kalpa* is vast,
its waves surging a millionfold.
The Fire *Kalpa* is scorching,

and the poisons cannot approach.
Pestilence and calamity are repelled,
and the times grow bright, the land prosperous.

This is called the *Infinite*,
Universal *initiation* without end.
There are *Secret Scripts* of the Highest Heavens,
All heavens hold them in reverence.
Leak or slight them, and one falls into *Hell*,
Bringing calamity to the Seven *Ancestors*.

The *Dao* speaks:
These two chapters are the words of the Highest *Deities* of All Heavens,
And the *Mystic Scripts* of the Demon King,
All belonging to the *Great Dharma* of *Brahma*.
Not the common speech of the world.
Words without melodious grace,
Melodies without ornate beauty.»

The mysteries are profound and difficult to fathom.
Treasure of the Highest Heavens,
Secreted in the *Xuan Du* Purple Micro Palace above,
Transmitted according to the *Mystic Science* once every four *kalpas*.

Its purpose is to regulate water and fire,
To preserve and secure the *kalpa* cycle,
So that the celestial gates’ passage
And the numerical paths know no end,
And abide with Heaven eternally.

Its prohibitions are strict—
No leakage or revelation is permitted.

If a *Zhi Ren* (至人) presents gold and jade with a sincere heart,
And according to the ancient rites petitions the Ten Heavens,
Then alone shall it be bestowed.

The *Dao* speaks:
When the *Heaven-Earth cycle* reaches its end,
Water and fire clash violently,
Floods surge to the skies,
Metals and stones burn and rot.
For mortals, this brings pestilence—
Cold and heat, sickness and plague.
Waters rise, earth collapses,
Winds howl, flames blaze.

When mortal life ends,
It is like the *kalpa*’s conflagration and deluge—
The time of the cycle’s conclusion.

Even the *unlearned* suffer afflictions.
Whenever such calamities arise,
One must erect altars and spread the *True Scripts* of the Five Directions,
Practice the *Dao* at the three times,
Subdue and govern water and fire,
Dissipate and transform disasters and plagues,
Pray to the Highest Spirits—
When calamities subside,
All who share the same *qi* must unite in heart,
Fast and offer incense at the six times,
Recite the *sutra* ten revolutions.
Then virtue and merit descend,
Dissolving all inauspiciousness.

The *Infinite Scripts* universally initiate without end.

The *Dao* speaks:
The unlearned, with shallow *Dao*,
Or whose *immortal rank* is incomplete,
Or whose Four Great Elements are scorched,
Dazed, bewildered, restless,
Or emaciated, withered, cold, crippled, or paralyzed—
These are all from water and fire’s assault,
Where the conquered overcomes the conqueror,
The cycle’s annihilation and rebirth,
The body passing through *Great Yin*,
At the moment of crossing,
The *Zhi Ren* among fellow students
Shall perform incense and recite the *sutra* ten times,
To guide the corpse’s form according to the law,
So the soul and spirit ascend directly to the Southern Palace,
And by their merit, be reborn in due time.

Through endless cycles of rebirth,
One attains *immortality*.

The *Dao* speaks:
When the *Heaven-Earth cycle* reaches its end,
Stars and constellations stray from their paths,
The sun and moon lose their eclipses,
The four seasons fall out of order,
Yin and Yang become unbalanced,
And the realm suffers disasters—
Wars erupt fourfold,
Pestilences spread,
The common folk perish in masses,
Friends and teachers meet untimely ends—
All these are disasters wrought by water and fire.

Water and fire govern the *Taiwei* and *Ziwei* dual celestial bureaus,
Overseeing mortal fate,
Summarizing calamity and blessing.

One must erect the altar according to the law,
Consecrate the Southern and Northern *Dou* Water and Fire Sovereign Emperors,
Present petitions with earnest wishes,
And let the incense of the heart ascend—
The spirits and true ones shall descend in response.

One must also fast and offer incense,
Recite the *sutra*.
For fasting, abstaining, and reciting the *sutra*
Are deeds of great merit.
Above, they dispel celestial calamities,
Protect and defend the emperor.
Below, they avert poisonous harm,
And deliver the common folk.
Life and death depend upon them—
Their blessings are boundless.
Thus it is said: *Infinite*,
Universally initiating *Heaven* and *man*.

The *Dao* speaks:
Whoever possesses this *sutra*
Can, for the *Heaven-Earth Emperor* and the common folk,
Perform these meritorious deeds.
On days of disaster, if one takes the vow,
Fasts, burns incense,
And recites the *sutra* ten times,
All the Heavens shall record their name,
Ten thousand spirits shall attend as escorts,
And the *Zhi Ren* of the Right Branch
Shall attain the rank of a *Holy Sovereign*’s minister in the Golden Gate.

The Heavens record every deed and transgression—
Not a hair’s breadth is missed.
Even the *Demon King* of the Heavens shall recommend your name,
And those who attain the *Dao* shall comprehend these profound words.

From the *Hidden Speech of Great Brahma*,
Composed by the *Dao Lord*,
The *Elemental Scriptures of Primordial Mystery*—
The Middle Chapter of the *Eight Heavens of the East*.

「The lotus blooms without blemish, its treasures lavishly spread.
Within the ancestral hidden pool, demonic spirits grow straight and bold.
Its virtue extends to Lu and Kang,
Its splendor shines like boundless jade.
The Emperor of Heaven governs with radiant authority,
The Forbidden City is veiled and revealed.
The fierce bull marks the mountain’s peak,
The Marshal of the Big Dipper leads the celestial hosts.
The Zoroastrian* halls are guarded,
The sacred treasuries are sealed by mighty chiefs.
The Dao flows like the Taichi*,
The waters of wisdom lie hidden beneath the peaks.
The wandering warriors clash in battle,
The fair and refined alone are pure.

**The Eight Heavens of the South:**
Flaming brilliance, pure and resplendent,
The clear and profound behold its splendor.
The luminous path ascends to the clouds,
Following merit to the blade’s edge.
The elixir of leisure sparks the heart,
The warmth of the rocks seeps deep and dense.
The mossy hills thrive with rare herbs,
The jade-like streams flow into boundless depths.
The cycles return in perfect harmony,
The mist’s subtle light brings delight.
Its transformations leave no trace,
Its wonders are truly pristine.
The harmonious sensation blends with transformation,
The milk-white lotus blooms with crimson hue.
Absorbing the Dao, containing the marvelous,
The central mystery is beyond measure.

**The Eight Heavens of the West:**
The molten exchange of fire and water,
Encountering brilliance in profound depths.
The playful embryo unites in a single breath,
The wellspring of *qi* flourishes with vibrant petals.
Embracing the void in thought,
Pearl-like light shines with pure teeth.
Examining the cycles without limit,
Enclosing breath with reverent gaze.
The divine ramparts gather in ten thousand forms,
The Celestial Ford* reaches lofty heights.
The dragon’s trickles gleam like molten gold,
The fields’ roots spread with radiant coverage.
Light returns in dazzling brilliance,
The Great Mystery* resounds in the female palace.
The paired and the singular birth pearls,
Their origins fixed, their ends beyond reckoning.
---
**The Eight Heavens of the North:**
Obscured in silence, retreating to the fences,
Sparse guests arrive with slow, tranquil steps.
The cauldron drums stir the seeds,
A sudden flash—blackness complete.
Treading firm on the level expanse,
The bright blocks return ninefold.
The stillness is vast, the knowledge undone,
The misty capital gazes in awe.
The reeds dissolve, the essence glows refined,
Their fragrance simple, their splendor imperial.
The boundless void aligns with the rules,
The eons shrink to a yellow hall.
The wandering degrees flow with sweaty harmony,
The treasure of degrees awaits its union.
The Hall of the Big Dipper records its texts,
The grand annals hold the purple origins.

---
The *Dao* speaks: Within these Eight Heavens, the Hidden Speech of Great Brahma resounds—
An infinite, boundless sound.
The ancient texts are carved on the Jade Hall of the Dark Palace,
Within the lodges of Purple Weave and Great Micro*,
To rectify the cycles of fire and water,
To absolve the calamities of the Three Realms*—
The eons’ trials, plagues, and strange transformations.
Thus, the sun and moon radiate with brilliance,
The yin and yang surge in harmony,
To fulfill the natural order of all things,
Without action yet achieving profound transformation.

Its characters are each a broad span of a *zhang*,
Golden and misty hues gleam in splendor,
Lush green shades mirror the patterns.
The Celestial Sage and the Yellow Emperor once inscribed these texts,
To establish the true sound.
Those who know this sound
And fast while reciting it,
The Eight Heavens shall dispatch the flying celestial kings,
To descend and observe their form,
To record their meritorious deeds,
And present them to the Heavens above.
Ten thousand spirits shall pay homage in worship,
The Earthly Deities* shall guard their gates,
The Demon King of Great Merit shall recommend them to the Pure and High,
And those who attain the Dao shall surely achieve it—
Roaming the Three Realms,
Ascending to the Golden Gate.

This sound repels all obstacles,
Dispels all calamities,
Rescues all beings,
Accomplishes all deeds—
The natural sound of the Heavens.
Thus, when recited, it draws the flying celestial kings to descend and observe,
The Heavenly Emperor’s distant chant,
Ten thousand spirits pay homage in worship,
The Three Realms guard their halls,
The Zoroastrian* hosts bow their heads,
The ghostly spirits perish of their own accord,
The resounding treasures shake the air,
The Ten Directions* stand in solemn reverence.
The rivers and seas fall silent,
The mountains and hills swallow the smoke,
All living beings tremble and submit,
Summoning the gathered immortals.
The Heavens are free of impurity,
The Earth is free of demonic dust,
The profound wisdom pierces through all things,
The boundless virtue is most mysterious.

**The *Lingbao* Scripture of Infinite Salvation—Supreme Chapter of the Marvelous Canon**
**The Fifty-First Volume concludes.**
**The Fifty-Second Volume begins.**」

**Chapter on Eradicating Illness and Preserving Life to Extend Years**
The Dao speaks: In days of old, within the Azure Primordial Heaven, the True Sound of the Flying Landscape, the Great Lapis Lazuli Continent, received from the Primordial Originator the Infinite Salvation Scripture for Eradicating Illness, Preserving Life, and Extending Years.

When the Primordial Originator, Heavenly Venerable, proclaimed this Scripture, circling ten times through the passes, He summoned the Ten Directions. Then the True Gods of Heaven, the Highest Saints, the Marvelous True Ones, countless as the sands of the Gobi, arrived riding the void.

The flying clouds and misty vapors, the jade pavilions and phoenix canopies, the violet expanse flowing with radiance, the emerald abyss rising in brilliance, the luminous spirits dazzling with splendor—all illuminated the boundless for five days and five nights. The celestial palaces and halls, the lofty pavilions and sacred gates, shimmered with seven hues, the revolving spheres ceased their motion, the Three Suns aligned in radiance, all phenomena fell into stillness, the Earth bore auspicious blessings, the Heavens displayed jade inscriptions, the Law’s voice echoed far, piercing through all realms. The Three Realms were purified, the Four Seas cleared, the lands of a single kingdom—its mountains, rivers, forests, and trees—all flattened to one level, with no high or low. The soil transformed into jade of uniform hue, without variation.

The gathered immortals attended His seat, while the Primordial Originator, Heavenly Venerable, hung suspended above the Nine-Dragon Treasure Platform, floating in the void.

When the Scripture was recited once, all the Great Saints of the Heavens simultaneously praised its excellence. At that time, all men and women of the kingdom, gazing upward, heard the Law’s voice and intuitively grasped the Dao of the Immortals.

When recited twice, the essence of pure nature was realized.

When recited thrice, the spiritual *qi* descended into the body.

When recited four times, the karmic burdens were dispelled, and all maladies were healed.

When recited five times, the Six Organs and Five *Zang* were refined, blossoming with vitality.

When recited six times, the vital essence ascended, transforming the form, while golden light renewed the bones.

When recited seven times, the divine mysteries were perfected within the body, eternally preserved in completeness.

When recited eight times, the transformation encompassed the Three Realms, extending grace to the Ten Directions. All plagues vanished, and the people thrived in peace and joy.

When recited nine times, the souls of the departed ascended to Heaven, and the officials of the underworld ceased their trials.

When recited ten times, all beings followed their true nature, dwelling in boundless ease and supreme tranquility. At that time, all men and women of the kingdom, without exception, turned their hearts upward in reverence, all receiving protection and attaining eternal life.

The Dao speaks: At that time, when the Primordial Originator had completed the tenfold recitation of the Infinite Salvation Scripture of the Marvelous Dao, the Great Gods of the Ten Directions—without limit or number—arrived simultaneously. The Great Gods of the Infinite in the East, the Great Gods of the Infinite in the South, the Great Gods of the Infinite in the West, the Great Gods of the Infinite in the North, the Great Gods of the Infinite in the Northeast, the Great Gods of the Infinite in the Southeast, the Great Gods of the Infinite in the Southwest, the Great Gods of the Infinite in the Northwest, the Great Gods of the Infinite in the Upper Realm, and the Great Gods of the Infinite in the Lower Realm—all came in one instant, like fine rain and dense mist. The gathered multitude, twelve kinds in all, encircled His seat.

Some had afflictions of the heart, while their bodies suffered from malevolent plagues. Within the Three Realms, all beings—countless Heavenly folk—some had attained the Dao in body yet remained bound by the underworld’s trials, shaped by the influences of Yin-Yang, the Five Phases, and the Six *Qi*. Each pondered their own fate, how they had earned the fruits of the Dao, their true forms, and the retributions of their past lives, manifesting in thirty-six transformations, appearing and vanishing in the depths and heights.

Others, in the mortal world, had once committed evil deeds, violating the officials of the Five Directions—Wood, Metal, Water, Fire, and Earth—suffering the weight of illness and plague. Some were dim-witted and benighted, opposing the Dao of Heaven, ignorant of the principles of life. The Five Phases, in their cycles of subjugation and dominance, surged and clashed, generating myriad afflictions: water plagues brought chill, fire plagues brought heat, metal plagues brought dryness and cold, earth plagues brought panting and sweat, wood plagues brought spasms and fury. The plagues spread, and malevolent spirits wrought harm.

Such beings, twelve categories in all, gathered in clouds around His seat. Having heard the Primordial Originator’s tenfold proclamation of the Infinite Salvation Scripture’s Marvelous Dao, the True Sound of the Flying Landscape, all the Three Realms and Ten Directions were delivered from suffering. The ranks of ascending immortals and saints arrived, countless as mist and rain.

Then the Primordial Originator’s divine light radiated in eight directions, illuminating the Ten Directions, surveying all the Heavens. He spoke again to the assembled gods: *"The Dao is not a matter of mere words or emotions. Its symbols are not like the paired opposites of human thought—sudden in coming, fleeting in departure, transformations beyond measure, a chaotic blend of infinite *qi*. What we call 'the heart,' is not the eternal truth.

The masses are benighted and dull, their karmic burdens heavy as earth. They cling to the heart as if it were wisdom, grasp at wisdom as if it were the spirit, and the spirit congeals to form the Dao. If one does not comprehend the true principles of the Immortal’s cultivation, then the heart’s perceptions grow coarse and impure, drawing near to the realm of ghosts. When mingled with malevolent *qi*, it becomes illness and plague, harming the very essence of life, leaving one’s natural years unfulfilled, their Heavenly lifespan incomplete.

But if one can steady the *qi* in the void, merge the spirit with the boundless, then the heart becomes the dwelling of the spirit. When the spirit’s abode is tranquil, the vital essence aligns, and the form is whole. All malevolence cannot harm, and plagues cannot enter. The body, free of sickness, preserves life and extends years.

With the aid of Daoist contemplation, resting in the natural, wielding jade talismans and golden seals, clad in clouds and mists, one attains eternal life and becomes a True Person."*

At that time, the ten-directional celestial beings and humans upon hearing these words were moved to sighs of admiration and rejoicing. Heavenly luminosity manifested auspicious omens, divine treasures radiated brilliance, and the Primordial Black Pearl encompassed the Nine Realms.

When the Celestial Sovereign’s scripture was fully expounded, the assembled True Ones oversaw the salvation of all, passing it down to me. At that moment, the joy and celebration were beyond words.

The ritual matters were now complete, and the celestial hosts returned to their stations. In the blink of an eye, the two voids fell silent, leaving no lingering echoes.

At that time, the celestial beings and humans who encountered this scriptural law universally attained deliverance and salvation, preserving their natural years unharmed. The people of the land turned in reverence, all cultivating virtuous hearts.

They did not act recklessly or covetously, nor deceive or cling. They did not cling to views or reject what was unseen. They did not guard against harm nor observe rigid precepts.

Their speech was without embellishment or deceit, their words free of malice. They harmonized in compassion, regarding even those of differing natures as kin. The land was secure, the people prosperous, and they rejoiced in great peace. The scripture’s teachings began to spread, and the entire realm was guided by the Dao.

Those with sincere aspiration reverently followed and honored it, all attaining the salvation of the world.

The Dao declares: The words spoken by the Celestial Sovereign of Primordial Origin within this scripture are indeed the inner names of the Heavenly Emperor, concealed in hidden rhymes. They are also the taboo names of the demon kings—the secret names known to the hundred spirits. These are not the common words of the world.

The Supreme Sage has already become a True Person.

The Way penetrates the Mysterious and explores the subtle, with compassionate thoughts encompassing all beings. Within the dark realms of life, it causes the Three *Qi* to shine true and the Five Constants to follow *virtue/power*, dispelling sickness and plague, safeguarding life and extending years—whether the pestilence afflicts one body or sweeps across the world.

By rectifying the heart and guarding the *qi*, amassing good deeds and accumulating merit, one attains the register of the Southern Pole (南极监簿), where Han *Ji* records names and averts calamities, pardoning faults and granting continuance.

If one thoroughly understands its principles and recites them ten times, the *Celestial Deities* (诸天) will chant from afar, and the Ten *Emperors* (万帝) will set forth their rites. The rivers and seas will fall silent, the mountains and peaks conceal their clouds, the sun and moon will emit radiant splendor, and the stars will display their luminous essence. Malignant *qi* will be extinguished, and sickness and plague will be pacified.

With the *Tiger Talisman* (虎符) commands issued, names and merits are recorded, and *demons* (鬼魔) submit to the hundred poisons. Their lineage is severed and their forms destroyed.

When the Heavenly Mandate aligns with the Dao, righteous *qi* flows freely, and the Three Officials (三官) preside over the divine court, their divine soldiers standing guard. The Great Principle (大理) captures souls, and the divine tribunal examines and verifies deeds—truly beneficial acts eliminate *demonic influences* (除祆), and the *spirits* (灵) are sustained, their essence abiding.

Those of supreme learning, reciting it ten times, will then have the Five Emperors (五帝) attend as guardians, and the Three Realms (三界) bow in reverence.

The essence of life decays the eyes, while *demonic influences* (鬼祆) vanish in brilliance, delivering from sickness and plague to attain rebirth.

This is so because scholars, their impure *qi* yet unconsumed, their bodies not yet penetrated by the True, wield authority over the ten directions but cannot yet govern the celestial order. Though they can subdue the earthly spirits and bind the *demonic spirits* (魔灵), they can only repel death—not grant life. A casual recitation of this scripture invites pestilential *demons* to spread calamity.

With reverent offerings and proper rites, households flourish eternally, their prosperity unbroken by a thousand ages, bound to virtuous causes. No harm shall touch them, and divine officials attend in service.

They master celestial secrets, unrivaled in the Jade Capital, guiding countless beings across the Dao. Vast and august is this grand framework—its virtue surpassing measure.

The Dao proclaims: Those who recite this scripture ten times shall see all the heavens converge, countless eons of ancestors and tormented souls in the underworld all receive deliverance. Celestial secrets ascend, names are recorded by the Three Officials, their fates transformed over nine years, reborn through transformation, and elevated to noble status. Those who cherish this scripture, their merits fulfilled and virtue complete, shall attain immortality, ascending to the Golden Gate and feasting in the Jade Capital.

Scholars of high learning, reciting this scripture, shall be untouched by plague, their spirits serene and *qi* refined. The turbid reservoirs disperse, and malevolent influences find no entry. Inner alchemy ignites, bones transmute to prolong life—all attain deliverance, ascending to the Southern Palace.

Mortals who recite it shall extend their years, their descendants all attaining the *shixie* (尸解) path. Their spirits, though momentarily extinguished, avoid the underworld and swiftly return to form, wandering the boundless void.

This scripture’s subtlety is boundless, its salvation without end. All heavenly and human beings rejoice in its blessings. Infinite merit spans life and death, a treasure of the heavens, not passed to the mortal world. Only the worthy, bearing gold and jewels with sincere devotion, may pledge to transmit it. Leakage or negligence invites retribution upon nine generations, eternal servitude to *demonic officials*.

Five Emperors, twenty-four Jade Boys, and twenty-four Jade Girls attend, guarding the scripture’s recipients with divine texts.

The Dao declares:
On the first month’s long fast, reciting this scripture dispels the green plague and the aged *qi* of the Nine Barbarians, which harms the body. For the departed of past ages, it severs their earthly bonds and grants ascension to the Southern Pole’s *Taixi* celestial province, transforming their station.

On the seventh month’s long fast, reciting this scripture dispels the white plague and the aged *qi* of the Six Rong, which harms the body. The practitioner attains immortality, their names inscribed by the heavens in the *Shenxiao* Jade Treasury, within the Western Hua Hall, with golden script on green tablets—erasing death to attain rebirth.

On the tenth month’s long fast, reciting this scripture dispels the black plague and the aged *qi* of the Five Di, which harms the body. It secures the nation’s emperor, stabilizing the imperial lineage, ensuring the heavens endure eternally. Generation after generation, they rule as sovereigns, their lands in eternal peace.

On the eight solar terms, reciting this scripture pacifies the Eight Sceneries, invigorates the Eight Spirits, repels the Eight Evils, and forever banishes a hundred plagues. The Three Fields yield pearls, all nodes harmonize, blood transmutes to jade nectar, and essence condenses into jade flowers. One attains the status of a True Person of the Nine Palaces.

On one’s birth-day, reciting this scripture prevents malevolent *qi* from forming, wards off plague, and secures longevity. Ghosts and monsters retreat, spirits purify, and vital *qi* endures eternally. Free from suffering, the body radiates light, with the Three Realms as guardians and the Five Emperors in attendance. They govern the celestial pivot, their retinue adorned with pearl tassels, as ten thousand spirits pay homage. They ascend to the Supreme Mysteries, their merits fulfilled and virtue complete, rising to the Upper Purity.

The Dao instructs: On days of practice, one must bathe in fragrant waters, fast in purity, enter the chamber facing east, and strike the teeth thirty-two times, ascending to the Thirty-Two Heavens. With thirty-two bows of the heart, eyes closed, one meditates upon sitting amid three-colored clouds—red, green, and yellow—inner and outer darkness enveloping them. A green dragon, white tiger, vermilion bird, dark tortoise, lion, and white crane array themselves on either side, while the Six Jia and Six Ding generals subdue demons, guarding front and rear. Sun and moon illuminate the chamber, a luminous halo forming at the nape, its radiance permeating the ten directions—thus, clearly manifest.

The secret incantation:
*"Supreme Primordial, the Most High Dao Lord, summon forth from my body the Thirty-Two Functionaries of the Three Five, the left and right officials, the attendants of fragrant jade boys, the messengers of jade women, the Five Emperors’ direct seals, the direct-day incense officials—thirty-two each—opening the way to what is spoken.*

*Today’s joyous occasion, a long fast in the pure hall. Practicing this sacred scripture, salvation without measure. May my petition ascend directly to the Supreme Thirty-Two Heavens, before the Most Venerable Primordial Emperor of the Beginning.*

*Concluded. Draw in the breath thirty-two times, rejoicing in the recitation.*

*The Primordial Scripture of Infinite Salvation, Upper Brand Mystic Treasure Original Chapter: Dispelling Plague, Preserving Life, Extending Years, Infinite Salvation.*

A hundred demons conceal their melodies, merging and parting naturally. The Primordial Formless summons *qi* to manifest the True. *Qi* emerges without trace, congealing in the void’s profound mystery. Mystery is the mother of *qi*, its radiance swirling like flying smoke. Jade nectar refines into light, golden essence into the Eight Directions. The Jade Capital looms, the Verdant Vault spins. Three luminaries revolve in crimson, nine halos purify the depths. Self-formed jade scriptures, the Ultimate Truth without end. Three Five Nine One—this is the Heavenly Root.

The Primordial Ancestor’s marvel, the Soul Treasure giving birth to spirits. Warmth and depth nourish, firmness and flow sustain. The Three *Qi* illuminate, generating all heavens. Dark Yellow blends with chaos, metal and fire intermingle. Transformation of yin and yang divides right from wrong. The right is the root of all things; uphold it for eternal life. The wrong brings plague and calamity, harm shifting and soaring. Only knowing the True Dao can preserve the body.

The Five Zang’s true *qi* coalesces into sacred texts. Without texts, there is no light, no clarity, no establishment, no completion, no salvation, no birth.

The Celestial Above responds with the Rounded Net—
the Heaven within Heaven.

Darkly gathered, the Mysterious Terrace,
the Jade Capital of the Supreme Sovereign.

Lofty beyond all, the Azure Void of the Purple Court,
dim and vast as eons—
as if nonexistent, yet ever-present.

The Three Splendors part and convene,
the Supreme Clarity of the Yellow Court.

The Golden Gates, the Jade Hall,
the Mirrored Spirit Pool.

Dispersing the Perfected *Qi*,
dissolving all calamities.

The Pure and True Celestial Wheel
revolves through the Ten Directions.

Within it dwell:
the Immortal who guides mortals to non-death,
the Southern Pole Emperor of Eternal Life,
the Great God who dispels sickness and plague,
the Provincial Master of the Celestial Axis, Good-Generating Lord Han,
the Southern Registrar of Destiny,
the Lord of Literature and Fortune who benefits calculations and averts misfortune,
the Supreme True One who preserves life and extends years.

Reviving the corpse, resurrecting the dead—
endless salvation for all beings.

Today, the Celestial Assembly convenes,
all heavens gathered in attendance.

who saves countless beings.

the Ten Splendors’ emerald palanquins,
the Nine Phoenix cloud chariots,
the Flowing Light jade carriages,
yoked with divine tigers,
the non-conforming unicorns of the True Summons,
bearing the banners of the Spirit Souls,
with the Six Solar Generals in the van
and the Eight Histories’ divine soldiers in the rear,
soaring through the Nine Heavens,
walking the void in midair,
the Five Elders clearing the path,
the host of immortals flanking the procession,
myriad chariots and ten thousand cavalry,
floating through the sky,
their radiance turning back the procession,
overseeing the True Ones and guiding the living.

The Jade Sovereign preserves the form,
the Southern Pole’s Most Sacred One,
the Heavenly Overseer of Birth,
the Original Lord of the Golden Gates,
holding the sacred registers and records,
all assembled before the Emperor,
according to their destined salvation,
strictly inspecting the heavens.

Internally guarding the Supreme Truth,
establishing the Verdant Merit.

With benevolence, forgiveness, loyalty, and filial piety,
they do not offend the Three Officials.

Passing through the Six Unnamed Passes,
crossing the Dark Gate of the Underworld.

All chronic ailments vanish,
plagues and disasters do not approach.

Evil spirits are shattered—
their four eyes confronting them.

The multitude of saints descend to receive,
preserving life and extending years.

A universal proclamation to the Three Realms:
the Sacred Land of the Without-End,
the Cavernous Palaces of the Springs,
the Northern Gate of the Underworld,
the Six Heavenly Cloud Camps,
the Fire-Sword Iron Mountains—
all petition the Celestial Highness,
their jade tablets unfurled in proclamation.

Dissolving sickness and plague,
cleansing defilements, calamities, and sins.

Ascending to absolve ancestral spirits,
countless eons of kindred kin.

Erasing the Black Register of sins,
extinguishing the roots of evil.

Preventing descent into suffering,
binding the demonic legions.

By decree of the Void Sovereign,
hour by hour, ascension is granted.

In the Northern Capital of Cold Courts,
the divine souls are summoned and reviewed.

The Great Demon is saved and transformed,
ascending to the Vermilion Palace.

The dead souls undergo refinement,
eternally enduring through fate’s operation.

The living receive salvation,
unshaken through countless eons.

With the Wheel of Fate turning,
they align with the heavens’ years.

Endlessly crossing the Three Realms of Suffering,
transcending the Five Sorrows and Eight Hardships,
soaring beyond the Three Realms,
adrift in Supreme Clarity.

The Heaven of Supreme Clarity—
the Jade-True Emperor of Heaven,
the realm of formlessness, the conduct of the *Dharma*.

**Scripture of the Spiritually Precious Limitless Deliverance of Mortals**, **Chapter 51** concludes.

**Chapter 52** begins.

**Chapter 52: The Scripture of the Spiritually Precious Limitless Deliverance of Mortals**

**The Chapter of Mystic Brightness and Profound Abyss** speaks thus:

*"In days past, within the Violet Origin Heaven, the Verdant Landscape of the Empty Song of the Great Dawn’s Radiant Soil received the Limitless Deliverance of Mortals by the Mystic Brightness and Profound Abyss from the Primordial Origin. When the Primordial Origin Heavenly Venerable spoke this Scripture, circling tenfold through the heavens, he summoned the Ten Directions, and then ascended to the seat.*

*The Primordial True God, the Highest Sage and Venerable, the True Person of Wondrous Practice, the Five Spirits of Mystic Brightness and Profound Abyss, the Water Emperor of the Profound Abyss, the Dragon Kings of the Eight Directions and Nine Seas, the Profound Abyss officials and attendants of the Forty-Two Departments, and countless hosts without number—all rose through the void and came in procession. Flowing clouds and misty vapors formed the carriage of jade and darkness, the Mystic Brightness’s palanquin, the Violet Canopy’s divine wheels, descending beneath the Piercing Void, with streaming rainbows and precious lights, all hues swelling in brilliance, illuminating the vast expanse. For five days and five nights, the celestial suns, moons, and stars sank like shadows in the sea, their cords coiled around jade pivots, their pearly halos and celestial markings suspended in stillness, their wheels halted and their radiance fixed. The divine palaces stood tranquil, sacred peaks gathered clouds, the heavens floated in eight directions, and the qi cleared the Nine Wilds. All lands, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees in the realm flattened into uniformity, their soil bright as jade and crystal, their colors undifferentiated.*

*All the True Ones attended the seat, and the Primordial Origin Heavenly Venerable ascended to the floating jade-light seven-transformed Spirit Tortoise Throne of the Mystic Brightness and Profound Abyss. After one recitation of the Scripture, all the celestial assemblies simultaneously praised its excellence. At that time, all men and women of the realm turned in reverence to the Primordial Origin’s Law of Mystic Brightness and Profound Abyss, awakening to this life’s essence, first manifesting in pearly dew.*

*After two recitations, they believed and knew the True Water, its transformations infinite. After three recitations, they discerned its gentle luminosity, benefiting all things with subtle guidance. After four recitations, they pondered the generation of the divine palace, the first descent of the Profound Abyss’s qi, as the kidney essence refined and the spirit tortoise swam. After five recitations, the heart’s apertures expanded, the spirit tides moved with purpose, and the Mystic Brightness’s elixir dispersed, nourishing all the orifices. With focused observation and tranquil contemplation, they comprehended the wondrous, effortless Dao.*

*After six recitations, the celestial mist cleared and settled, its brightness dividing into spirits, each bearing my form within the Mystic Brightness. After seven recitations, the Profound Abyss fell still and serene, and the Dragon Spirits obeyed the teaching. After eight recitations, the sea clouds lifted the dew, and sweet nectar moistened life. After nine recitations, the water’s light blazed, revealing a thousand-layered palace within, where all the heavenly folk awakened to the Dao’s Law.*

*After ten recitations, the qi of Mystic Brightness transformed into violet clouds, covering all the heavens, manifesting the Effortless Sea. Its depths were boundless, its sweetness profound—all men and women of the realm, without exception, inclined their hearts in devotion, receiving protection and attaining eternal life.*

*The Dao speaks thus: When the Primordial Origin Heavenly Venerable had completed ten recitations, the Primordial True Gods of Mystic Brightness and Profound Abyss from the Ten Directions—East, South, West, North, Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, Northwest, Upper, and Lower—all, with countless hosts without number, arrived in the void simultaneously. All men and women of the realm bowed in reverence, their hearts turned upward.*

*They spoke in unison: ‘The Primordial Origin Heavenly Venerable has descended to this Violet Origin Heavenly Palace, bearing the Hundred Treasures, to reveal and exalt the Wondrous Five-Element True Water’s Law. Its virtue is called Mystic Brightness, its power called Profound Abyss. We have heard that Mystic Brightness is the True Water’s virtue—form and color both resplendent. Profound Abyss is the True Water’s power—depths fathomless, without bounds. Yet we know only the Five-Element Water we see: vast and flooding, its depths unmeasured. How can we grasp the formless Five-Element True Water, named Mystic Brightness and Profound Abyss?*

*Before Heaven and Earth were divided, there existed the True Soil. Soil could bind and contain the Ten Directions, above and below, and within it lay the True Water, limitless and boundless. Wind and breath stirred it, and it congealed into all things—this is the origin of life, the Great Dao itself. The Primordial Origin Heavenly Venerable today expounds the wondrous essence of the formless Five-Element True Qi. If we may hear it, we shall ourselves ascend to the divine realm above, all bowing in homage to the Heavenly Venerable, seeking his boundless compassion, receiving his supreme teachings, and thus declaring: With utmost respect, we bow twice.’*

*Then came those like fine rain and dense mist—countless hosts without number—causing half the realm’s soil to sink unevenly, an effect beyond restraint. Thus, the Primordial Origin suspended a precious pearl, as large as a millet grain, within the void above, five zhang from the earth. As he ascended, the Primordial True Gods, the Highest Sage and Venerable, the True Person of Wondrous Practice, the Five Spirits of Mystic Brightness and Profound Abyss, the Water Emperor, the Dragon Kings of the Eight Directions and Nine Seas, the Profound Abyss officials and countless attendants of the Forty-Two Departments, and all hosts without number—entered the precious pearl together."*

The celestial beings and mortals gazed upward, and lo, they saw a radiant surge entering the pearl’s mouth—once inside, its whereabouts became unknown. The populace dispersed, the land restored to evenness, no longer tilted or sunken.

Within the precious pearl, the Primordial Origin completed the teaching of the scripture. The assembled True Ones, having witnessed its transmission, bestowed it upon me. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words.

When the ritual was complete, the celestial hosts returned to their stations. In an instant, all sound ceased, leaving profound silence.

At that time, those who encountered the scripture and its teachings were universally saved and delivered, their lives preserved without harm. The land’s people turned in reverence, their conduct pure and clear.

The wondrous spirit’s wise heart flowed like water, its benefits boundless. Illumination was unified and harmonious—illumination penetrating, illumination enlightening, illumination wise and discerning, illumination profound and empty. The heart held no obstruction, silently attuned to the ineffable.

Together, they ascended the boundless void, deeply grasping the utmost truth. The realm was secure, the people at peace, in boundless ease and tranquility. The scripture’s teachings first emerged, and the land was governed by the Way.

Those with sincere devotion, who revered and followed with ritual, all attained the power to deliver beings.

The Way declares: All names spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Venerable within the scripture are the hidden, resonant names of the celestial deities. They are also the inner taboos of the True Kings, the concealed names of the myriad spirits. Their transformations are formless.

True Water, the law of Profound Brightness and Abyssal Depth—Profound Brightness being the nature of water, Abyssal Depth its dwelling. Flowing, it becomes wisdom; still, it becomes insight. Flowing, it penetrates; still, it illuminates. If you embody it, you naturally attain the Way.

Heaven and Earth generate True Water through stillness; all beings move through True Water’s stillness. Dryness and heat are fire; stillness and cold are water. Dryness conquers cold, stillness conquers heat—this is the generation of True Water. If you remain tranquil, True Water moves of its own accord, and transformations arise daily. Stillness is the primal essence; stillness brings longevity. These are not the common words of the world.

The Highest Sage, having already become a True Person, penetrated the profound and fathomed the subtle, mastering its chapters. When recited ten times, the celestial hosts sing in response from afar, the myriad emperors offer rites, the rivers and seas fall silent, and the currents of the abyss flow freely. The revolving spheres cease motion, the host of demons are bound, the spirits of ghosts vanish, the dead rise, and white bones become flesh.

For those of supreme learning, reciting it ten times summons the Five Emperors as guards, the Three Realms bow in homage, the demonic essences lose their power, the ghostly spirits perish, and those on the brink of death are saved, passing from death to life.

Yet even so, scholars whose impure *qi* has not yet dissipated, whose bodies have not penetrated the True, may summon and restrain the Ten Directions, but their authority does not extend to governing celestial law. Their virtue can subdue the earthly spirits, bind the demonic souls—but only to repel death, not to restore life. To recite this chapter lightly invites calamity upon oneself.

To honor and venerate it brings prosperity to one’s household, generation after generation, flourishing and radiant. With virtuous connections, a thousand disasters cannot approach, and the divine protects the gate.

This scripture is supremely wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital, delivering countless beings and serving as the root of ten thousand teachings. Its grandeur is vast, its virtue beyond measure.

The Way declares: For those who recite this scripture ten times, all celestial hosts gather, the Water Emperors speak in order, the springs and streams bend in mercy, the dark gates of the underworld open, and the myriad ancestors—even those in torment—are all delivered, ascending to the Vermilion Palace. Their term is fixed at nine years, after which they are reborn through transformation, becoming noble beings.

Those who study this scripture with devotion, their merits complete and virtue fulfilled, all attain immortality, ascending the Golden Pass and feasting in the Jade Capital.

For scholars who practice it, True Water ascends in response, nourishing the five viscera, entering the *dantian*, where the numinous frost and purple ice form—all are delivered, ascending to the Southern Palace.

For mortals who recite it, the Abyssal Spirit surges forth, the divine springs encircle the eight directions, strengthening the body and extending life, all eventually attaining the method of *tianxia* (body dissolution). Their spirits, though momentarily extinguished, avoid the underworld and return to form, wandering the boundless void.

This scripture’s subtlety is profound, its deliverance boundless. All celestial and mortal beings receive its blessings. Infinite merit spans life and death, a treasure of Heaven, not passed down to the world below.

Only those who bring gold and jade with sincere devotion, swearing by Heaven to transmit it, may do so. To leak or neglect it lightly invites retribution upon nine generations, eternal servitude in the underworld.

The Five Emperors and sixty-four玉童玉女 (*Yuting* and *Yunü*—celestial youth and maidens) attend the scripture, their divine files guarding those who receive it.

The Way declares: On the first month’s long fast, reciting and chanting this scripture brings nine transformations and three True Ones, its blessings reaching the Nine Springs, delivering the souls of past ages, severing their bonds of torment, and guiding them to the Southern Palace.

On the seventh month’s long fast, reciting and chanting this scripture causes True Water to emerge from the womb, the Way bestowing eternal life, the body attaining immortality, and the celestial hosts recording their names on yellow and white tablets, erasing death and granting rebirth.

On the tenth month’s long fast, reciting and chanting this scripture restores one to their original source, their merit returning to the Supreme Void, gathering and governing the pure *qi*, commanding the High Immortals, benefiting kings and emperors, their ministers, parents, and children—securing the nation’s fate, preserving Heaven’s longevity, ensuring their lineage never ends, and perpetually governing their domain in eternal peace.

On the eight seasonal festivals, reciting and chanting this scripture causes the divine springs to flow, the Jade Pass to surge, and one to become a True Person of the Nine Palaces.

On one’s birth-day, reciting and chanting this scripture clarifies True Water, illuminating the body and spirit within, entering purple and emerging yellow, nurturing the five viscera’s essences, purifying the soul and spirit, preserving the ten thousand *qi*, avoiding suffering, the body radiating light, the Three Realms attending in procession, the Five Emperors leading the welcome, all spirits paying homage, their names inscribed in Heaven. When merit is complete and the path fulfilled, they ascend to the Upper Clarity.

The Way declares: On days of practice, one must first bathe in fragrant water, fast and enter the chamber, facing east. Having struck the teeth thirty-two times—each strike heard by the Thirty-Two Heavens—one bows the heart thirty-two times, closes the eyes, and in stillness contemplates sitting amid the three-colored clouds of green, yellow, and white. Within and without, all is boundless darkness, where the Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Lion, and White Crane manifest.

The arrayed spirits to left and right, the sun and moon shining bright,
illuminate the chamber with radiant clarity.
The **Dao/Way**’s profound and luminous **qi** swirls like violet mist,
entwining and cascading through the void.
The hundred deities are seen with distinct vision,
their necks bearing round emblems,
their light reflected in all ten directions—so clearly manifest.

The **secret incantation** proclaims:
*"Supreme Profound Primordial, Most High Dao/Way Lord,*
summon forth my servant’s self within the **Three Five** [1] **Functional Officers**,
left and right officials and messengers,
attended by fragrant jade boys and speaking maidens,
the Five Emperors’ straight seals,
the **Xiangguan** [2] of thirty-two days,
each thirty-two in number—opening and closing the gates as spoken.*

On this auspicious day of joy,
I observe the long fast in a purified hall.

The floating scene blends into emerald fusion,
Holding verses of the Cavernous Classic,
The Jade True One shines resplendent,
Illuminating the Mystic Luminous.

Empty splendor governs the Rectified,
Pure gold scatters as mist,
The Purple Expanse looms in verdant layers,
Assisting and guarding the High Immortals.

Ten thousand harmonies merge,
Transforming and giving birth to flowing essence.
Flowing essence refines the elixir,
Naturally becoming the True.

Within the True lies the Spirit,
The Eternal Great Lord of longevity.

The Eastern Extremity’s verdant splendor,
Crimson brilliance and purple essence.
Without flaw, the Ultimate merges,
The White Origin preserves life.

The Supreme One registers the celestial records,
The Azure Boys pour the sacred waters.
Holding talismans and scriptures,
Preserving life and rooting the command.

Ascending the Purple Void,
Entering and exiting the Splendid Chamber.
Within the Eight Obscurities,
At the heart of the Eastern Well.

Descending to govern the human form,
The Yellow Court and Vermilion Abyss,
Regulating the Five Qi,
Mingling with the Hundred Spirits.

Ten revolutions return the Soul,
Ten thousand beings become Immortals.
The Dao of the Immortal values life,
Boundless in saving sentient beings.

Opening the Eight Gates above,
Flying the Heavenly Law Wheel.
Crimes and blessings, prohibitions and vows,
Past lives and karmic connections.

Universally receiving the Mystic Grace,
Refining and giving birth to the True Body.
The body attains rebirth,
Ascending to hear the celestial realms.

Above the celestial realms,
Each has a Gate of Birth.
Within are verses of hollow songs,
True King’s sacred hymns,
Words harmonizing with the High True Ones.

**First Hymn of the Mystic Luminous Cavernous King: The Flying Void**
The True Yang is formless,
Stirring the Mystic Luminous to birth.
The Mystic Luminous’s true dew,
Qi exhaled, thus formed.

The Boundless Void knows no edge,
The Primordial Qi billows as mist.
Yin-yang swiftly flies,
Water descends like a spring.

Its vast voice resounds,
Its boundless depths accumulate.
The scorching wind enters the water,
Naturally coiling like a dragon.

Passing through nine cycles,
Scales and horns fully formed.
Sudden transformations arise,
Entering earth, communicating with heaven.

Its mouth holds clouds and rain,
Its body like a jade tortoise.
It roars thunder, spitting mist,
The Thunderfire Immortal.

Nurturing all things,
Opening the source of life.
The Mystic Luminous’s power,
The Divine Dragon leads.

The Cavernous Abyss and Boundless Sea,
Channeling a hundred rivers.
One water as ancestor,
Within containing the Five Phases.

The human form’s law-symbol,
The Spirit Pool’s pure mist.
The Shocking Qi becomes the Dragon,
Swimming in the Three Fields.

Rising and descending by the Dao,
Worldly life spans billions.
Boundless in saving sentient beings,
Reciting this Cavernous Verse.

---
**Second Hymn of the Mystic Luminous Cavernous King**
The Jade Capital Kunlun,
Planted in the Void as root.
Below it spans the Azure Sea,
The Nine Hundred Million’s Origin.

The Mystic Peak stands central,
Where the Sun and Moon cross.
Radiant twin visions,
Overlooking the Seven True Ones of Light.

Flowing springs ascend,
Through the Thirty-Nine Gates.
Nurturing and refining the Two Symbols,
Relying on this Mystic Luminous.

Below it encompasses the Yellow Gate,
Commanding the Spirit Officials.
The Round Net descends with Qi,
Subduing the Primordial Lords.

One Qi, six coils,
The Three Origins transformed.
Entering and exiting the Three Splendors,
Vastly surging through the Wind Abyss.

Verdant mists gather in layers,
Flowing bells scatter in four directions.
The Way of transformation and birth,
Establishing the Divine and Spirit.

Nourishing the Primordial Harmony,
Preserving heaven from collapse.
If one knows this,
The Azure Scroll bears the name.

I now compose this chapter,
Transmitting life with True Water.
Ascending with flying steps to the Spirit Expanse,
The Immortals must respectfully pay homage.

---
**Third Hymn of the Mystic Luminous Cavernous King’s Song**
Hoist the boat on the Cavernous Pool,
The Azure Forest stirs the Spirit Wind.
Heaven’s voice naturally forms sound,
Ten thousand transformations yet unified.

Majestic the Spirit Expanse Gate,
Holding the Edict in the Eastern Capital’s heart.
Guiding sentient beings through the Pure Flow,
Abandoning this, a hundred worries assail.

The Mystic Luminous scatters heavenly dew,
All things’ forms can be nourished and refined.
Refining bones, jade splendor is born,
Longevity attained, without care.

How can one forsake the Immortal Way,
Following filth with corpse-worms?
Not comprehending the Great Dao’s Origin,
How can one avoid decay and calamity?

There are mountains spinning in the Azure Void,
Waters hiding divine dragons.
Why chase greed and competition,
Drowning in filth, aging like infants?

I, the Hollow Void King,
My law-carriage adorned with solemn drums and bells.
Pitying the world, upholding the Great Constitution,
Saving beings, reviving the Teaching Root.

Holding the Jade True’s song,
Ascending to the Hollow Mystic Palace.
The Eight Sufferings dissolve,
Joy and delight endless.

This, above the Three Realms,
Within the Flying Void,
The True King’s sacred song,
Its words harmonizing with the Cavernous Chapter.

Recite it a hundred times,
Your name ascends to the Southern Palace.
Recite it a thousand times,
Fly as an Immortal, welcomed in welcome.

Ten thousand recitations complete,
The Dao is fulfilled,
Ascending to the Supreme Void,
Crossing the Three Realms,
Rank attained as True Duke.

Those who hear the Sacred Sound,
Even the Demon Kings revere their forms,
Commanding the Earthly Spirits,
Attending and escorting.

Emerging from the Earthly Gate,
The Five Sorrows and Eight Sufferings depart,
The Seven Ancestors ascend,
Forever freed from the Dark Officials,
The Soul crosses the Vermilion Mound,
Refined and reborn.

This is called Boundless,
Universally saving without end.

There are secret celestial texts,
All heavens hold them in reverence.
Revealing arrogance, one falls into Hell,
Disaster befalls the Seven Ancestor Lords.

The Dao says:
These two chapters are the sacred sounds of all celestial emperors,
And the hidden hymns of the Most High Spirit Kings—
The wondrous, silent, formless True Water,
Transforming into heaven and earth,
Giving birth to the divine dragon.

Those who embody this,
The Immortals know no end.
All are the words of the Great Brahman,
Not the common speech of the world.
Words without melodious grace,
Music without ornate elegance.
Thus called profound and mysterious,
Difficult to trace in detail.

Treasured by heaven above,
Secreted in the Mystic Capital’s Spirit Expanse,
The Jade Purity King’s Eastern Chamber.
According to the ritual, transmitted every thirty-seven thousand years in accordance with the cosmic cycles.

If a perfected sage brings gold and treasures with a sincere heart,
And according to the old method pledges to the Ten Heavens,
Then it shall be bestowed.

The Dao says:
When heaven and earth’s cycles falter or end,
When the sun, moon, and five stars wane or wax,
When the most sacred divine humans rest or decline,
When shallow scholars suffer illness—
At such times of calamity,
All who share the same breath must unite in heart,
Observing fasts at the six times,
Circulating the scriptures tenfold,
And virtue and blessings shall descend,
Dissolving all ill omens.

Boundless texts,
Universally saving without end.

The Dao says:
For those shallow in the Dao,
Or whose Immortal rank is incomplete,
When their fate is extinguished,
And their bodies pass through the Great Yin—
At the moment of crossing,
Let the perfected sages among them perform incense offerings,
Recite the scriptures ten times,
And guide the corpse-form according to the method.
Then the Mystic Luminous shall arise,
The Mystic Darkness return,
The Jade Maiden in the kidneys,
Holding the *Yanguan* in hand,
The Gate of Death sealed,
The Three Officials dancing with the Wheel,
Life restored, the command returned,
The name recorded in the Imperial Register,
The soul and spirit ascending directly to the Southern Palace,
According to their merit, reborn on the appointed day.

The Wheel of Rebirth turns without doubt—
Then Immortal Sagehood is attained.

The Dao speaks:
When the Heavenly Earth’s cycle reaches its end,
Stars and constellations stray from their courses,
Sun and moon lose their appointed meetings,
The Four Seasons fall out of order,
Yin and Yang fall into discord,
The realm’s borders grow unstable,
The people suffer famine and pestilence,
Plagues and poisons spread rampant,
The common folk perish in droves,
Warriors and friends meet untimely deaths,
Comrades fall in battle—
All must then observe fasts,
Burn incense, and recite the scriptures.

For fasting, keeping precepts, and reciting scriptures—
Their merit is most profound.
Above, it dispels celestial calamities,
Guarding and protecting the sovereign.
Below, it wards off poisons and harm,
Delivering the myriad people,
Saving them from life and death’s grasp—
Their blessings are boundless.

Thus it is said: *Boundless texts,*
Universally saving Heaven and humankind.

The Dao speaks:
Whoever possesses this scripture
Can, for Heaven, Earth, the Imperial Sovereign, and the myriad people,
Perform these meritorious deeds.
On days of calamity, if one resolves to fast,
Burn incense, and recite the scriptures ten times—
All the celestial beings shall record their names,
Ten thousand spirits shall stand guard,
And the perfected sages of the Right Path
Shall surely become holy ministers of the Golden Palace,
Serving the Sacred Sovereign.

The celestial beings record each person’s merits and faults,
Not missing even a hair’s breadth.
The True Kings of Heaven also recommend your name,
And those who attain the Dao shall truly comprehend these profound words.

Hidden within the Great Brahman’s boundless sounds,
The Dao Lord composed the *Elemental Origins: Mystic Clarity, Profound Abyss, Sacred Scriptures*—
The Purple Chapter of the Eastern Eight Heavens.

The eight heavens unfold with boundless splendor—
**Keqin** scatters its sacred nectar, **Yuanlou** pools its abyssal depths.
The **Ming** has conquered **Mian**, its **Yi** resounds with truth;
**Qing** lingers, **Zhi** flows, fulfilling the Perfect and the Real.

The **Tang** screens **Bian**’s teachers, the **Yao** dispels **Zhi**’s radiance.
**Yuluo** fades like moonlight, **Hudeng** stills the distant march.
**Mingze** nourishes **Xianyue**, the **Liyuan** rise in ranks.
**Yuncha** rules the **Difu**, **Libin**’s grace extends in succession.
**Dongjia** borrows from **Youdi**, **Yeying** gazes upward in reverence.

**Dao**’s silence pervades the **Yuanjing**.

**Chigong** and **Chisuo** stand resplendent,
**Yuanshou**’s **qi** is divine and luminous.
**Gaoming** at **Tingtai**, the **Dishu**’s tiger ministers.
**Mimie** intercepts the **Long**, **Pulei** captures the stars.

**Yanqi** reflects upon **Hubu**, **Bingqian** seeks expiation.
---
**West Eight Heavens**—
**Zhengeng**’s six pools, **Shenhu**’s four leaps.
**Liluo**’s **Jian** reveals its brilliance,
**Youzheng** commands **Bingshi**.

**Budan** gathers the **Jihui**, **Yedang** exposes the source.
**Ganyan** harmonizes with **Heolu**, the seven **Yuan** and nine **Si**.
**Kaoxie** has already been flattened, **Aolang**’s arrogance is quelled.

The **Zhudian** presides over **Zuihun**,
**Youqing** seals the **Yuan**’s gate.
**Dingjiao** treasures the **Shang**, **Huzhen** safeguards the **Yuan**.
**Yaodu** cuts off the **Huangji**, the **Xishan**’s seal binds the city.
---
**North Eight Heavens**—
Within **Pengnei**, the northern lands are subdued,
**Qizhi**’s flags and **Die**’s swift chariots.
**Cuiyi** mingles with **Jiaowei**, the nine **Hua** align in order.

**Yingdan**’s heart waters the earth,
**Panghang**’s jade **Luo** shines.
**Genna** swallows the **Chimei**,
**Huolong** drifts across the waves.

**Shengshi** radiates with brilliance,
**Bingfu** records the **Ji**’s copper.
**Heiliao** pursues **Ning**, **Jianyu** builds a hundred **Cong**.
**Houyuan**’s waters pierce the depths,
**Shenhuan** sinks at **Jitai**.

**Chucui** urges **Lishang**,
**Bianxian** returns to **Shenhui**.

---
**Dao** speaks: Within these eight heavens, the **Great Brahman** hides its boundless sounds.
The ancient scriptures were carved upon the **Yuanming**’s northern mountains,
At the **Long**’s **A**’s **Xue**’s **Shimo**’s gate—
The root of all things, the nine heavens’ sacred texts.
Its **Dao**’s prohibitions and taboos are profound and unheard,
Each character vast and long, a span in breadth.

**Dao** speaks: The **Tianzhen**’s **Huangren** of old inscribed its scriptures,
To establish the **Zhengyin**—the true sound.

Those who know this sound, and with fasting recite it,
Shall see the **Feitian** gods and **Shenwang** of the **Zhutian** descend,
To observe their bodies and record their **gongqin**—meritorious deeds,
Then ascend to report to the **Zhutian**,
Where the **Wanshen**—myriad spirits—pay homage,
And the **Dizhi**—earthly deities—attend at the gate.
The **Zhenwang** of great merit shall recommend them to the **Shangzhen**—Highest Truth,
And when the **Dao** is complete, they shall attain its **ke**—power,
Wandering through the **Sanjie**—Three Realms—
And ascending into the **Jinmen**—Golden Gate.

This sound cleaves through all obstructions,
Dispels all misfortunes.
It penetrates all beings,
Accomplishes all things—
The **Tianzhen**’s natural sound.

Thus, when recited, it summons the **Feitian** to descend and witness,
The **Shen**’s **Di**—august sovereign—distant chanting,
The **Wanshen** paying homage in procession,
The **Sanjie**’s spirits attending the **Xuan**—celestial hall.
All **Qian**—demonic forces—bow their heads,
The **Gui**’s **Jing**—ghostly essences—self-destruct,
And **Línláng**—resplendent treasures—resound.
The **Shí Fāng**—ten directions—are purified,
The **Héhai**—rivers and seas—fall silent,
The **Shānyuè**—mountains and peaks—swallow mist,
All **Wànlíng**—myriad spirits—are subdued.
Summoning the **Qúnxiān**—multitudes of **Dao**’s immortals—
The heavens are free of **Fēn**’s **Huì**—vapors and impurities,
The earth of **Qian**’s **Chén**—demonic dust,
The **Mínghuì**—dark and enlightened—is clear as a void.
The **Da**’s **Liàng**—great compassion—is **Xuán**’s **Xuán**—profoundly mysterious.

The **Lingbao** *Wúliàng Dùrén Shàngpǐn Miào Jīng* concludes. **Volume the fifty-third** ends.

**The Chapter on Slaying and Extinguishing the Five Phases’ Malevolent Spirits**

The Dao speaks: *"In times past, within the Jade Purity Heaven, the Bright Vision Song of the Great Mighty Spirit was sung to slay and extinguish the myriad malevolent spirits of the Five Phases with the Supreme Way of the Primordial Beginning’s* **Wúliàng** *transformation. When the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Venerable delivered this sutra, circling ten times through the* **Shí Fāng**—*ten directions—He summoned all* **Qúnxiān**—*multitudes of Dao’s immortals—before taking His seat. The Heavenly True Great Deities, the Highest Saints, the True Persons of Marvelous Practice, the Five Imperial True Officials, the Great Generals of Manifest Might, the Mounting Officers Who Slay Evil, the Three Five of Yin-Yang, the Grand Administrators of Celestial Bureaus, the Purple Cloud Divine Soldiers, countless as the* **Wúliàng**—*without measure—all ascended upon the void.*

Golden radiance illumined the emptiness,
Treasure-cars of celestial winds,
Resplendent light’s feathered canopy,
Wreathed in morning mists—
All visions mingled in brilliance,
Shining across the eight* **Yuán**—*orbits,
for seven days and seven nights.

The* **Qúnxiān**—*multitudes of Dao’s immortals—from the* **Shí Fāng**—*ten directions—*
arrived at layered palaces of treasure-gates,
their transformations merging in the void,
the celestial laws suspended,
the starry networks aligned,
divine breezes fanning gently,
wondrous vapors congealing with fragrance,
the* **Qìxiàng**—*phenomena of qi—*harmonized,
rivers and mountains cleansed in stillness.
Within a single realm—its lands, mountains, forests, and streams—
all became level as one,
no longer high or low,
the earth transformed into radiant jade,
its luster clear as the five* **Míng**—*luminous hues.

The assembled immortals stood in attendance,
while the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Venerable sat in profound mystery,
His divine dragon guiding the Heavenly Primordial Seat.

When the sutra was delivered once,
the Great Saints of all heavens simultaneously extolled its virtue.
At that time,
all men and women of the realm
severed their attachment to the Five* **Yù**—*desires.

When the sutra was delivered twice,
the Five* **Huà**—*transformations—flourished in splendor.
When the sutra was delivered thrice,
the Five* **Wèi**—*celestial pivots—moved in proper course.
When the sutra was delivered four times,
the Five* **Qì**—*energies—remained balanced,
and all beings prospered in harmony.
When the sutra was delivered five times,
the Five* **Cháng**—*constants—were undisturbed,
and the Dao’s governance renewed daily.
When the sutra was delivered six times,
the Five* **Yùn**—*circulations—aligned in sequence,
with no deviation or error.
When the sutra was delivered seven times,
the Five* **Wén**—*patterns—were manifest,
and the mysterious teachings illuminated.
When the sutra was delivered eight times,
the Five* **Shén**—*spirits—held true,
and the might of the Dao spread abroad—
true* **Qì**—*vital energy—overflowed,
dissipating all inauspiciousness.
When the sutra was delivered nine times,
the Five* **Jīng**—*essences—were nurtured and secured,
preserving the luminous light.
When the sutra was delivered ten times,
all malevolent spirits within the Five Phases perished,
and at that moment,
all men and women of the realm
turned their hearts in reverence,
each receiving protection and attaining* **Chángshēng**—*longevity.

The Dao speaks: When the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Venerable delivered the sutra once,*
**Wújì** *of the* **Wúliàng** *Supreme Way—*
the True Great Deity Who Slays and Extinguishes the Malevolent Spirits of the Green* **Jīng**—*essence—*
and countless as the* **Wúliàng**—*without measure—*
ascended upon the void.

When the sutra was delivered twice,*
**Wújì** *of the* **Wúliàng** *Supreme Way—*
the True Great Deity Who Slays and Extinguishes the Malevolent Spirits of the Red* **Jīng**—*essence—*
and countless as the* **Wúliàng**—*without measure—*
ascended upon the void.

When the sutra was delivered thrice,*
**Wújì** *of the* **Wúliàng** *Supreme Way—*
the True Great Deity Who Slays and Extinguishes the Malevolent Spirits of the White* **Jīng**—*essence—*
and countless as the* **Wúliàng**—*without measure—*

the True Great Deity Who Slays and Extinguishes the Five Phases’ malevolent spirits of the Earthly Primordial—*
and countless as the* **Wúliàng**—*without measure—*
ascended upon the void.

After ten full recitations,
the True Great Deities of* **Wújì** *from the* **Shí Fāng**—*ten directions—*
Who Slay and Extinguish the Five Phases’ malevolent spirits,
all arrived together.
All men and women of the realm
turned their hearts in reverence.

The arrivals were like dense clouds and fine mists—
countless as the* **Wúliàng**—*without measure—*
they filled half the land,
causing it to tilt and sink,
a force beyond restraining.

Thus, the Primordial Beginning manifested a single* **Yuánxiàng**—*circular form—*
of boundless size and scale,
its five hues radiant,
suspended in the void above the earth by nine* **zhàng**—*fathoms.

The Primordial Beginning ascended,
and the Heavenly True Great Deities,
the Highest Saints,
the True Persons of Marvelous Practice,
the Five Imperial True Officials,
the Great Generals of Manifest Might,
the Mounting Officers Who Slay Evil,
the Three Five of Yin-Yang and Grand Administrators of Celestial Bureaus,
the True Divine Kings of the* **Shí Fāng**—*ten directions—*
Who Slay and Extinguish the Five Phases’ malevolent spirits,
the Purple Cloud Divine Soldiers,
the Three Heavenly Attendants,
and countless as the* **Wúliàng**—*without measure—*
all entered the* **Yuánxiàng**—*circular form.

The celestial beings gazed upward,
and saw only a soft, flowing motion
as they entered the* **Yuánxiàng**—*circular form—*
once inside,
their whereabouts unknown.
The populace dispersed,
the earth restored to its rightful level,
no longer tilted or sunken.

The Primordial Beginning then,
within the* **Yuánxiàng**—*circular form—*
delivered the sutra in full.
The assembled immortals oversaw its transmission,
bestowing it upon me.
At that moment,
joy and celebration were beyond expression.

The ritual matters were thus completed,
the celestial beings returned to their stations,
and in an instant,
all traces of sound vanished.

At that time,
all celestial beings who encountered the sutra’s teachings
universally received salvation,
their lives preserved without injury,
their lands restored to level,
their hearts turned in proper reverence.
They no longer tilted or sank,
no longer deceived or flattered,
no longer cruel or obstinate,
no longer rebellious or perverse,
no longer jealous or malevolent.
Their words and deeds were straight and true,
their wisdom sharp and clear,
their enlightenment unified,
their discordant bones harmonized,
the realm secure and its people at ease,
their joy unbounded and pure.

The sutra’s teachings first emerged,
and all within the realm
turned to the Dao.
Those who approached with sincere devotion,
who revered and honored it,
all attained transcendence of the world.

The Dao speaks: All the names spoken by the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Venerable in this sutra
are the hidden names of the celestial deities,
their sounds veiled in mystery."*

「亦是真魔内讳，斩灭五行邪怪百灵之隐名也，非世上之常辞。」

Malevolent and monstrous spirits, ghosts and demons, cannot manifest without cause.

The Eternal Officials serve the Five Emperors of the scripture, with thirty-six Jade Boys and thirty-six Jade Girls guarding its divine texts, protecting the body of those who receive it.

The Five Spirits uphold their proper order, the myriad *qi* nourish the body, the Daoic life-force becomes invigorated, and one ascends to the Upper Pure Realm.

「道言：行道之日，皆当香汤沐浴，斋戒入室，东向，叩齿三十二通，上闻三十二天，心拜三十二过，闭目，静思身坐青黄赤三色云气之中，内外苍冥，有青龙、白虎、朱雀、玄武、狮子、白鹤，罗列左右，日月照明，洞焕室内，项生圆象，光映十方，如此分明。」
The Dao declares: On the days of Daoic practice, one must bathe in fragrant waters, fast and enter the chamber, facing east, striking the teeth thirty-two times, ascending to hear the Thirty-two Heavens, bowing in heart to the Thirty-two Passages, closing the eyes, and meditating quietly on the body seated within the triple-colored *qi* of Azure, Yellow, and Red. Within and without, all is profound darkness, yet the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Tortoise, Lion, and White Crane array themselves on either side, with the sun and moon shining brightly. The chamber is illuminated, a luminous halo forms at the neck, and its light radiates across the ten directions—all distinctly manifest.

Each has its own birth-gate.
Within, the Five Phases reside,
In the void’s hollow scriptures,
The True King’s Spirit Chapters,
Their words echo with the High Truth.

**First Chapter: The Transformation of the Five Phases into Flying Void’s Sound**
Before the Great Dharma’s opening,
Formless and nameless,
The Two Principles divide,
Their ranks listed among the Five Phases.
East is verdant, West is pure,
South is crimson, North is abyssal.
The Primordial One dwells in Central Yellow,
The Five Qi’s cycle interweaves.
Each holds its master nature,
With the Dao their shifting form.
This is the Dao’s root,
Its essence linked to color.
The Jade Terrace and the Jade Palace,
The Emerald Mountains and the Golden Gates.
The Upper True Ones and Immortal Saints,
The Boundless Imperial Lords.
Within the shadowy depths,
The True Qi harmonizes.
The brocade banners and yellow sashes,
The purple canopies and vermilion wheels.
All are the True’s Five Colors,
Their forms shifting with transformations.
At rest, they merge into the void,
At division, they multiply ten thousandfold.
Ascending beyond the Three Realms,
Flying void to attain immortality.
This Dao the world knows not,
The True King shall now proclaim.

The Spirit Cavern spans ten thousand leagues,
The Golden Gates gleam in brilliance.
In the fleeting instant of the Flying Spirit,
All Saints race upon clouded palanquins.
The mortal path contemplates its turning,
Yet I am always moved with pity.
How better to turn toward the Mysterious Dao,
To meet its wondrous origins and rest.
Malevolent demons all sink and cease,
To dwell eternally before the Jade Emperor.

**Second Chapter: The Annihilation of the Five Phases’ Malevolent Demons**
The Heavenly Primordial, Grand Unity,
The Emperor commands the host of spirits.
Guarding the world above,
Preserving the essence of life.
Garb of embroidered robes and sashes,
Jade crowns and green headbands.
Green Dragons arrayed to the left,
White Tigers to the right as guests.
Wearing the Dragon Saber’s talisman,
The Five Blessings’ scriptures.
They command the legions of spirits,
The Three Five Generals.
They inspect Yin and Yang,
Harmonizing the Primordial Mechanism.
The Five Phases’ malevolent demons,
All are toppled and destroyed.
If evil arises, it is cut down,
If demons appear, they are crushed.
They bestow protection and blessings,
Awakening the hidden and rare.
Malevolent demons now consumed,
The Five Emperors descend with spiritual might.
They guard the world for ten thousand years,
Their virtue ever radiant and bright.
The Yellow Dragon descends from the Middle Heaven,
The Emperor’s longevity is the sky’s hope.
The Spirit Cavern’s hollow scriptures,
Fragrant incense ascends, green mist flies.

**Third Chapter: The Song of Harmonizing the Five Phases to Return to the Dao’s Essence**
The Great Void’s Mysterious Wondrous Spirit,
The Hollow Void’s Primordial Lord.
Born within the boundless depths,
The transformations mark the Primordial Root.
Diluted and indistinct in its true nature,
It reflects back to extinguish the malevolent haze.
Dispelling demons and harm,
It surges and merges with the Supreme True.
Radiant wisdom’s edge,
Its punishments scatter the malevolent.
The Five Turbidities dare not disturb,
Its brilliance and splendor manifest.
Wearing the Spirit Talisman’s scriptures,
Its clouded light shines upon its form.
The Jade Talisman steadies the inner light,
The Dragon and Tiger intertwine within the embryo.
Water, Fire, Metal, Wood intermingle,
Unified in the Sovereign’s Primordial Spirit.
Majestic, it commands the Crimson Gates,
Shadowy, it regulates all Ten Thousand Essences.
Who knows of the cycles of years and eons?
It eternally preserves the boundless lifespan.»

「Beyond the Wheel of *Dharma*’s three realms,
Soaring to the Nine Pure Lands.

Here, above the three realms,
Within the void of boundless sky,
The True Sovereign’s sacred chant resounds,
Its voice harmonizes with the Primordial Scriptures.
Recite it a hundred times,
And your name shall cross the *Nāga*’s Southern Palace.
Recite it a thousand times,
And the *Māra* King shall bid you welcome.
Ten thousand recitations complete the Dao,
Ascending to the void of boundless sky,
Transcending the three realms,
You attain the rank of the Celestial Sage.
Hearing the spirit’s sacred sound,
Malevolent spirits vanish from your form.
Commanding the *Dhātus* of the earth,
You shield the myriad folk from calamity.
Dispelling misfortune and evil,
You cross the *Yama*’s dark threshold,
The Seven Patriarchs ascend in glory,
Forever freed from spectral bands.
Your soul traverses the Vermilion Heights,
Refined anew through trials.

This is called the boundless scripture,
Universal salvation without end.
There are secret celestial texts,
Cherished by all the *Devas*.

To reveal them lightly or scorn them
Is to fall into the *Avīci* hell,
Bringing ruin to the Seven Patriarchs.

The Dao declares: These two stanzas
Are the hidden speech of the Celestial Sovereigns
And the Supreme True Sovereigns—
All are the words of the Great *Brahmā*,
Not the common tongue of mortal men.
No melodious rhyme, no ornate verse,
Thus called profound and elusive,
Hard to fathom in detail.
Treasure of the heavens,
Sealed in the Highest Dao’s Eastern Chamber,
Within the *Lingbao*’s sacred vault,
By the Primordial Science’s decree,
To be revealed after thirty-seven thousand years.

If a perfected adept brings a heart of pure gold,
And solemnly pledges allegiance to the Jade Pure,
Then the texts shall be entrusted to them.

The Dao declares: When the Five *Phases*’ *qi* runs amok,
Lust and usurpation arise.
When *Yin* and *Yang* surge in chaos,
Malevolent spirits take form.
Seizing the nodes of *qi*,
Punishments and harm ensue.
All who suffer such calamities,
Let the virtuous scholar unite in fasting,
Offering incense at all six times,
Turning the *Sutra* tenfold—
Then virtue’s blessings descend,
Dissolving all ill omens.
The boundless scripture,
Universal salvation without end.

The Dao declares: When the Five *Phases* wane and fade,
Life’s measure is spent.
If the Three *Yuan*’s cycle is missed,
The Primordial *Qi* withers away.
Shallow students, Dao yet unfulfilled,
Their sage-grade incomplete—
When the fate of extinction draws near,
And their body passes into the Great *Yin*,
At the hour of departure,
Fellow students of the perfected should offer incense
And recite the *Sutra* ten times,
To guide their earthly form as per the law.
Their spirit ascends to the Southern Palace,
By their merit, day by day they are reborn.
The Wheel of *Dharma* turns without doubt,
And they attain the realm of gods and immortals.

The Dao declares: When the Five *Phases*’ *qi* manifests as malevolence,
It brings the end of heaven and earth’s cycles,
The stars and constellations stray from their paths,
The sun and moon lose their light,
The four seasons fall out of order,
*Yin* and *Yang* grow discordant,
Kingdoms tremble in unrest,
Wars and flames arise,
Plagues and poisons spread,
The myriad folk perish in affliction,
And masters and disciples meet their fate.

All should fast and offer incense,
Reciting the *Sutra*—
Then the malevolent spirits of the Five *Phases*
Hear the scripture’s power and are subdued.
Calling their names aloud,
Describing their origin and primal form,
They kneel and beg for mercy,
Never daring to disturb again.
The hidden, wondrous Dao and its true talismans
Repel all evils without fail.

Fasting and reciting the *Sutra* bear great merit.
Above, they dispel celestial calamities,
Sever malevolent spirits,
Guard and uphold the emperor’s rule,
Below, they avert plagues and harm,
And guide the myriad folk through life and death.
Their blessings are beyond measure,
Thus the scripture is called boundless,
Universal salvation for gods and men.

The Dao declares: All who possess this *Sutra*,
Can for the emperor, the Celestial Sovereigns,
And the myriad folk,
Perform these deeds of virtue.
On days of calamity,
With sincere devotion, they fast and burn incense,
Reciting the *Sutra* ten times—
All the *Devas* record their names,
Ten thousand spirits stand as guardians,
The perfected ones of the Right Branch
Shall surely make them ministers of the Golden Palace.

The *Devas* record each person’s merits and sins,
Without the slightest omission.
Even the True Sovereigns of the heavens
Shall commend their names,
And those who attain the Dao
Shall grasp the profound truth of these words.

Within the heavens, the Great *Brahmā*’s hidden speech
Resounds in boundless sound.»

—Composed by the Dao Sovereign,
From the *Yuan Shi Lingbao*’s Middle Volume,
The Eastern Eight Celestial Lands.

The orange *yu* departs from the jade,
Its melody piercing beyond the *lǜ* and *jiǎo*.
The *qíluó* bends like vermilion,
Its subtle brilliance surpassing *chǔ* and *jǐn*.

Clouds drift in jade expanse,
Swift and wise, their grace refined.
The *shēn* and *zhé* chime in the *jīnfáng*,
While *yǎn* and *shēng* record their deeds.

Pearls gleam in the sun’s radiance,
The *fúliáng* dispels the dark.
The hills bow as the swallows depart,
And virtue spreads with the wind’s embrace.

The *qīngbǐ* flows through *luòwén*,
While *huáguāng* selects the worthy.
The *yīnghuán* holds no empty vessel,
And *zhǐdūn* gathers at the *lùhuì*.

The *àiwǔkuícháng* shines with nine *yún*,
And *bóméi* bears its luminous fruit.
The *yànglǎngjìpàn* glows with polished splendor,

The *dúmiǎnbǐngdǎi* shines with golden radiance,
In the *jīntíng* where celestial sages dwell.

**Western Eight Celestial Lands**
The *niǔtáojìyán* opens with boundless speech,
While *dòngliúqǐxiān* proclaims its truth.
The *jiǎozhuàn* pierces the eastern void,
Swift currents of reverence flow.

The *zhāodìngchúnwēi* refines the pure,
And *yìsùlúquán* guards its perfection.
The *téngbǐngshàoxuān* bears its sacred charge,

Its spirit vast, its awe profound.

**Northern Eight Celestial Lands**
The *lièwùzhídìng* aligns with straight decree,
While *gěngchéngwēilái* clears the misted air.
The *jiànméngzītiáo* sprouts with ordered might,

The *dǎndànqióngfú* sweeps with jade-like grace,
While *zhěngjìyíngtī* polishes its edge.
The *zuàncíkuīmíng* gazes into the dark,
As *fānbo-shìshí* stands firm in stone.

The *xiāntánbìsū* pools with emerald depth,
And *yǒujùshìtíng* gathers in sacred space.
The *yùlínxùyǎn* unfolds with resplendent art,
While *càndiáochíbǐng* holds the screen in place.

The *shǐchénshuōmù* washes in divine speech,
And *yánglüèbiānfēi* soars beyond the sky.
The *léizúxiánháo* trembles with royal might,
As *jìzhēnhuángwēi* traces truth’s design.

The **Way** speaks: These are the hidden words of the Great *Brahmā* within the heavens,
Their sound boundless in resonance.

The ancient script was carved upon the *Tàijí*’s Eastern Terrace,
Where *Qiáochéng* stands as the crossroads of the Five Phases.
With measured divisions, it charts the transformations of creation,
Harmonizing with the times’ sacred symbols—
Each character vast, a span long.

The **Heavenly True Ones** once inscribed these words,
Establishing the true sound.

Those who know this sound and, with fasting devotion, recite it,
Shall have the celestial *Rìzhí*仙吏 sent by the heavens,
Great gods of the void descending to observe their form,
Recording their merits and labors,
Reporting them above to the celestial hosts.
Ten thousand spirits bow in homage,
Earthly spirits guard the gates,
And the True Kings of Great Merit commend the Five Celestial Stems.
When the Dao is complete, one may traverse the Three Realms,
Ascending to the Golden Gate.

This sound repels all that it encounters,
Exorcises all impurities,
Delivers all beings,
And fulfills all desires—
The natural sound of the Heavenly True Ones.

Thus, when recited, celestial ministers descend to observe,
The Supreme Sovereign sings from afar,
Ten thousand spirits pay homage,
The Three Realms attend in reverence,
All spirits bow their heads,
Ghostly intelligences vanish in fear,
The *línláng* resounds with sacred echoes,
The Ten Directions grow serene,
Rivers and seas fall silent,
Mountains swallow their mist,
All spirits tremble in submission,
Summoning the gathered sages.
The heavens know no filth,
The earth no profane dust,
The dark wisdom becomes clear,
And the Great Compassion is profound.

*Completion of the Supreme Mystic Scripture of Boundless Salvation, Chapter Fifty-Three*

**Chapter Fifty-Four: The Chapter of Beheading and Slaying the Ominous**

The Dao speaks: In days of yore, within the Azure Sky of Primordial Dawn, the Purple Yang floated in song across the Great Land of Auspicious Bliss, receiving from the Primordial Origin the Mystic Chapter of Beheading and Slaying the Ominous.

When the Heavenly Venerable of Primordial Origin proclaimed this Scripture, circling tenfold to summon the Ten Directions, the assembly then took their seats.

The Heavenly True Ones, the Supreme Saints of High Veneration, the Mystic Persons of True Practice, the Spiritually Mighty Kings—Black Heaven’s Great Generals of Jade Capital—with their armies of boundless hosts, wielding the mighty weapons of beheading evil and slaying poison, the Chief Magistrates of Subduing Demons and Executing Spirits, all without number, arrived through the void.

Jade clouds met the heavens, luminous mists draped the seas, celestial chariots and moon-wheels cast their radiant shade, pearl canopies hung in splendor, flying flowers and wondrous lights interwove in layered hues, their verdant brilliance dazzling the azure expanse. For three days and three nights, the palaces of the heavens and the mountains, rivers, and valleys blended in ninefold splendor. The Three Suns steadied their beams, the Five Peaks halted their loom, the Four Quarters radiated clarity, divine mists cleared, and all within the land—high and low, creatures and people—gazed in mutual illumination. Ten thousand bodies merged into one, one form encompassed ten thousand forms; the void and form shone as one, spirit and qi fused in obscurity. Thus did the distant and the near become as one, with no distinction of high or low. The earth softened into jade-green, piercing the Nine Emptinesses.

The assembled True Ones attended at the seat. The Heavenly Venerable of Primordial Origin ascended the Twin-Formed, Rotating-Dragon, Heavenly Treasure Throne.

When the Scripture was proclaimed once, the Great Saints of the heavens simultaneously praised its virtue. At that time, all men and women of the land bore pure, harmonious celestial bodies, and wondrous fragrances drifted abroad.

When the Scripture was proclaimed twice, the heavenly realm grew exalted and solemn, the Nine Heavens dispersed their embroidered splendor.

When the Scripture was proclaimed thrice, the dew congealed into pearls, and the jewel-forests hung with net-like brilliance.

When the Scripture was proclaimed four times, the celestial music took form, the jade and gold resounded in flowing harmony, the natural law sang spontaneously, and praises ascended to the Mystic Void.

When the Scripture was proclaimed five times, the waters shone limpid and luminous, and the mountains and seas displayed auspicious signs.

When the Scripture was proclaimed six times, flying immortals scattered flowers, filling the sky with brocade hues.

When the Scripture was proclaimed seven times, the Spiritually Mighty descended to the world, sweeping away the miasma of the profane.

When the Scripture was proclaimed eight times, the Three Realms received blessings, and humanity found peace.

When the Scripture was proclaimed nine times, the Six Qi aligned with nature, and the Three Calamities were extinguished.

When the Scripture was proclaimed ten times, the Heavenly True Ones descended to save, teaching and delivering all. At that time, all men and women of the land—without exception—turned their hearts in devotion, all receiving protection and attaining longevity.

The Dao speaks: When the Scripture was proclaimed once, the Spiritually Mighty Law-Bearing Great God of Boundless Limitless Virtue from the East, with their boundless hosts, floated through the void.

When the Scripture was proclaimed twice, the Spiritually Mighty Beheading-Profane Great God of Boundless Limitless Virtue from the South, with their boundless hosts, floated through the void.

When the Scripture was proclaimed thrice, the Spiritually Mighty Beheading-Ghost Great God of Boundless Limitless Virtue from the West, with their boundless hosts, floated through the void.

When the Scripture was proclaimed four times, the Spiritually Mighty Beheading-Spirit Great God of Boundless Limitless Virtue from the North, with their boundless hosts, floated through the void.

When the Scripture was proclaimed five times, the Spiritually Mighty Judicial Great God of Boundless Limitless Virtue from the Northeast, with their boundless hosts, floated through the void.

When the Scripture was proclaimed six times, the Spiritually Mighty Beheading-Evil Great God of Boundless Limitless Virtue from the Southeast, with their boundless hosts, floated through the void.

When the Scripture was proclaimed seven times, the Spiritually Mighty Flying-Talisman Great God of Boundless Limitless Virtue from the Southwest, with their boundless hosts, floated through the void.

When the Scripture was proclaimed eight times, the Spiritually Mighty Spitting-Poison Great God of Boundless Limitless Virtue from the Northwest, with their boundless hosts, floated through the void.

When the Scripture was proclaimed nine times, the Spiritually Mighty Nine-Headed Great God of Boundless Limitless Virtue from Above, with their boundless hosts, floated through the void.

When the Scripture was proclaimed ten times, the Spiritually Mighty Slaying Great God of Boundless Limitless Virtue from Below, with their boundless hosts, floated through the void.

When the tenfold proclamation was complete, the Spiritually Mighty Great Gods of Boundless Limitless Virtue from the Ten Directions arrived together. All men and women of the land turned their hearts in reverence.

Those who came were like returning clouds and gathering mists, their boundless hosts filling the land, all yearning for harmony and peace. They beheaded and slew the monstrous, dispelled all omens of ill, and the realm settled in tranquility. The gathered multitude stood in awe, unable to be restrained.

Then, the Heavenly Venerable of Primordial Origin, from between their brows, manifested a golden radiance. The light swirled, and from within it emerged the palaces of the Ten Directions—doors and windows open, tiered halls towering—with their luminous qi flowing in unison, rising five zhang above the earth.

The Heavenly Venerable ascended, and the Heavenly True Ones, the Supreme Saints of High Veneration, the Mystic Persons of True Practice, and the Spiritually Mighty Great Gods of Boundless Limitless Virtue from the Ten Directions, with their boundless hosts, all entered the Transformed Palace.

The celestial beings looked on and saw only the radiant golden light of the Transformed Palace, and those who entered vanished within it, their whereabouts unknown. The gathered people dispersed, and the divine palace drifted like a spinning rainbow.

The Heavenly Venerable then completed the proclamation of the Scripture within. The assembled True Ones oversaw the transmission, bestowing it upon me. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words, the ritual matters were fully attended to, and the celestial beings returned to their stations. In the blink of an eye, all traces of sound had vanished.

At that time, all celestial beings who encountered the Scripture were universally saved. The paths of the profane and the orthodox were divided, demons were beheaded, the profane were slain, omens of ill were swept away, and the land turned in reverence. Good deeds took root.

With right wisdom, right Dao, right spirit, right thought, right intention, right power, right might, right conduct, and right ritual—speech clear and direct, the tongue’s wisdom harmonious—all were equal in compassion, and disparate bones became kin.

The land was secure, the people prosperous, and there was joy in great peace. The orthodox teaching spread, and the ogres and demons were slain.

The Dao is most wondrous and true, its radiance boundless and clear.

The sacred scriptures are revered and upheld, all attaining the power to transform the world.

The Dao speaks: The words spoken by the Primordial Origin Sovereign of Heaven in this Scripture are indeed the true inner names of all celestial deities and divine emperors, hidden in esoteric tones. They are also the secret names of the Ten-Directional Spirits of Awe and the Divine Kings, concealed to avoid invoking beheadings or omens of ill fortune. These are not the common words of the world.

The Most High Saints, having already become True Persons, delve into the subtle and the minute, comprehending its entirety. When recited ten times, the celestial beings command spirits, the Eight Awe-Inspiring Forces gather qi, divine officials brandish their talismans, demonic generals receive their decrees, the cosmic threads align, the Primordial Leader radiates brilliance, malevolent essences vanish, ghostly minions lose form, the Dao penetrates the heart, true light guards the soul, and the virtue of Yang is bestowed—death becomes rebirth.

Scholars of the highest learning, when reciting this ten times, shall have their names inscribed in the Nine Heavens, the Five Emperors grant them their mounts, the Three Primordials provide their armies, calamities flee in terror, life’s vitality flourishes, demonic barriers are sealed, the Red Scriptures descend to the court, blessings flow spontaneously, and disasters never strike.

This is so because the learned are attuned to the Jade Purity, gazing upon the lofty and distant, their feathered canopies arrayed in ranks, summoning and commanding the Ten Directions, their awe extending to the Six Heavens. The Dao is revered by the Supreme Ultimate, all spirits unite in homage, trials prove without difficulty, they steadfastly guard the Yellow Peace, earthly deities bow in respect, subduing demonic spirits, banishing misfortune and illness, and ensuring eternal life.

A light recitation of this chapter erases the embryonic essence, collapses the divine dwelling, and scatters the seven spirits. Honoring and nourishing the sacred rites brings prosperity to the gates, celestial courts descend in accord, and fortune and blessings overflow.

The Great Marshal wields the axe, beheading omens of ill. The Way of Virtue is passed down, and descendants flourish. Good fortune follows in succession, and all calamities are concealed.

This Scripture is supremely revered and unmatched in the Jade Capital, saving countless beings and serving as the ultimate Dharma’s foundation. The towering righteous qi triumphs over Heaven’s virtue.

The Dao speaks: Whenever this Scripture is recited ten times, all celestial beings gather, the Five-Direction Divine Halberds converge, the Giant Heavens behead omens of ill, the Heavenly Steeds and armored soldiers advance, the Southern Great Army’s might is unleashed, the Five Heavenly Marshals and the Ten-Directional Spirits of Awe, along with the River Chief Great God, clutching their talismans and axes, arrive at their appointed places. They hunt the Nine Malevolent Ones, lurking in dark marshes and ancient shrines, all demonic and ghostly entities—those who cling to souls, haunt wood and stone, prey on the living, falsely accuse the Three Officials, lurk near prayers and sacrifices, howl with four eyes, or unleash divine tigers, venomous beasts, fiery darts, and lightning. They behead and decapitate, eradicating all ill omens.

Scholars of the highest learning, when practicing and reciting this Scripture, summon the Green Chamber Great God, who rings his bells to repel impurity, and the Purple Door General, who draws his sword to banish demons. The Jade Maidens strike their jade chimes in the Nine Chambers, and the Yellow Old Ones resound their voices in the Three Pure Ones.

When the world receives this recitation, longevity is extended, and beneath the Yellow Court’s gates, in the remote alleys of White Clouds, at the cold pools of the Spring Curves, ten thousand ghosts lie dormant. The Kidney Sea remains undisturbed, water monsters flee, the Upper Palace sings of virtue, the Three Departments rejoice in the Mysterious, and all attain the Way of Corpse Dissolution. Demons and ghosts cannot summon or seize them, and the earthly officials cannot record or bind them.

Divine qi nurtures the form, spontaneously forming the Dharma-body. Demon essences undergo refinement, soaring through the boundless void.

This Scripture is subtly wondrous, universally saving without end. All celestial and human beings receive blessings. The Five Heavenly Demons, the Five Mid-Autumn Corpses, and the Five Earthly Judges are forever severed from ill fortune, eternally preserving primordial auspiciousness.

Infinite blessings permeate life and death. It is a treasure of Heaven, not to be transmitted to the mortal world. Only the virtuous, bearing gold and jewels with sincere devotion, may pledge to Heaven and pass it down.

If the Scripture is leaked or treated carelessly, calamity will fall upon the nine ancestors, and eternal servitude to ghostly officials will ensue.

The Five Emperors and the Twenty-Four Jade Boys and Girls attend the Scripture, guarding its divine text and protecting those who receive it.

The Dao speaks: In the first month, during prolonged fasting, recite this Scripture to summon and subdue the North Pure Dark Yin Sovereign God, commanding divine soldiers to present themselves at the Upper Palace.

In the seventh month, during prolonged fasting, recite this Scripture to summon and subdue the Five Heavenly Marshals, the Three Realm Great Demons, and the Purple Micro Emperor, who统率百神, purifying the source of evil and sweeping away demonic miasma.

In the tenth month, during prolonged fasting, recite this Scripture to summon and subdue the Six Heavenly Platform’s spirits, the Three Officials’ Bureau of Soul Investigation Great Gods, the Eight Mountain Hook-and-Lock Decree-Killing Great Gods, and the Nine-Headed Dragon Lords, who behead residual malevolent qi, exhausted malevolent souls, the Five Hag Plagues, and earth-and-wood spirits that harm living beings among the Qiang, Yi, and ghosts.

Thus, the realm is secured, the people prosper, and kings and emperors, along with their ministers, parents, and children, stabilize the national lineage, preserving Heaven’s longevity and ensuring unbroken succession. The people forever call it the Great Peace.

On the Eight Nodes, recite this Scripture to summon and subdue the Eight Heavenly Great Awe-Inspiring Smoke-Fire Cavern-Perfuming Supreme One’s Eight Gods, the Eight Killing Spirit Lords, who lead the winds and clouds, wandering through the Nine Palaces, the Lone Void and Strange Gates, beheading omens of ill and preventing chaos.

On one’s natal day, recite this Scripture to summon and subdue the Three True Ones, ascending into the Brain Palace, the Northern Pole Purple Mist, the Central Yellow Upper True One, who spits forth the Azure Flower, stabilizing the omen of the body. The Three Corpses dissolve, calamities wither and burn, black knots and white deceits are severed without cease. The Three Emperors record their deeds, the Seven True Ones wield their spirits, divine boys guide the way, and radiance emanates from the body. The Three Realms stand guard, the Five Emperors welcome, ten thousand spirits pay homage, their names inscribed in Heaven, their merits fulfilled and virtue complete—ascending to the Upper Purity.

The Dao speaks: On days of practicing the Way, one must bathe in scented water, fast in seclusion, face east, and strike the teeth thirty-two times, ascending to the Thirty-Two Heavens. With the heart, bow thirty-two times, close the eyes, and meditate quietly, seated within the three-colored clouds of blue, yellow, and white. Within and without, all is dark and vast, with the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Tortoise, Lion, and White Crane arrayed on either side. The Three Heavens’ direct attendants, left and right officials, slaying ghostly messengers, beheading omens of ill, and executing Heaven’s decrees stand solemnly in guard. The sun and moon shine brightly, illuminating the chamber with radiant clarity. Images form on the neck, their light shining across the Ten Directions—all distinctly manifest.

The Secret Incantation speaks:

*"Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Dao/Way Lord, summon forth my servant’s body—its Three Five* 功曹 *attendants, left and right officials and messengers, the fragrant jade boys and virgins of speech, the Five Emperors’ straight seals, and the thirty-two fragrant officials of the day—each in their appointed place.*

Completing this liberating work.

**Second Chapter: Hymn of the Spirit-King of Rectifying Dao in the Human Realm**

Floating glory through the Ten Heavens.
Dragon Blade slays the wicked,
Six Paths attend the Pavilion.
Seal-Light condenses the sea,

Punishing ill omens—
Rectitude’s path is their end.
What of these petty fools?
They are the instruments of calamity.

Bestowing its original power.
Great Lord’s benevolent birth,
Grace bestowed—difficulties forever banished.
Ninefold Splendor’s golden hues,
In harmony with Heaven’s protection.
Still Wisdom unites with the Spirit,

Heaven’s talismans record their names.
No evil dares offend,

Yuan Shi’s hollow void—
How few awaken to its truth.
Those who awaken naturally,
Clear as the flowing Jade Sound.

**Third Chapter: Hymn of the Spirit-King of Rectifying Dao in the Earthly Realm**
Vast and murky, the piled earth,
Below, the layered mountains.
Pale clouds rise from the azure peaks,
Those who pass never return.
The Supreme Sovereign laments,
Granting liberation without obstruction.
Spirit-Winds drift the mist,
Jade Pendants curve in grace.
Emerging from the Nine Abysses,
Scarlet Script now proclaimed.
Controlling the spirits, seizing the souls,
Severing this dark threshold.
Living beings—what offense have they committed?
To suffer punishment, their faces pale with fear.
Bright and clear, the Supreme Sovereign,

You attain promotion and transcendence.
Abandoning the dusty mortal path,
All rabbits flee from the demonic source.

I possess the Yuan Shi Chapter,
Reciting to shift the Ten thousand Ancestors.
Knots of stagnation dissolve in freedom,
Silent accord returns to the Void.
Liberation of mortals shall never end,
Diligently chant this True King’s verse.
Through these Three Realms above,
The flying void within,
The True King’s hymnal echoes,
Its sound harmonizing with the Hollow Chapter.
Chanted a hundred times,
Liberation granted to the Southern Palace.
Chanted a thousand times,
The True King’s protection welcomes.
Ten thousand chants complete the Dao,
Ascending to the Supreme Void,
Crossing the Three Realms,
Rank attained among the Immortal Lords.
Hearing the Sacred Sound,
The Spirit-King reveres its form,
Commanding the Earthly Deities,
Guarding and escorting,
Drawing forth from the Earth’s Gate,
The Five Sufferings and Eight Difficulties,
The Seven Ancestors’ ascent—
Forever departing from the Ghostly Palace.»

「The soul ascends to the Vermilion Mound,
To receive trials and be reborn anew.
Severing the unauspicious and their heads,
Fortune and blessings grow with each passing day.

This is called the Boundless Scripture,
Universal liberation without end.
There are secret celestial texts,
Revered by all Heavenly Hosts.
Revealing arrogance falls into the Underworld,
Disaster befalls the Seven Ancestors’ visitation.

The Dao speaks: These two chapters are the hidden sounds of the Heavenly Sovereigns,
And the Spirit-King of Awe.
All are the words of the Great Brahman,
Not the common speech of mortals.
All sever the unauspicious and their heads,
The names of the Six Heavens’ slayers of ghosts.
The malevolent forces are crushed,
Evil spirits dispelled,
The body attains longevity,
Rank among the Immortal Lords.

Thus called profound and esoteric,
Hard to seek and investigate.
Treasure of the Celestial,
Hidden in the Mysterious Capital’s Purple Micro Palace,
Transmitted through the Mysterious Science in forty thousand kalpas.

If a perfected adept brings a golden treasure with a sincere heart,
And follows the ancient rites to pledge alliance with the Ten Heavens,
Then it shall be bestowed upon them.

The Dao speaks: The method to sever the unauspicious and their heads
Is indeed the Great Law in fourfold form.
The Nine and Six celestial cycles conclude,
The Three Lights wax and wane.
The Holy Spirit rests or declines,
The unworthy scholar suffers harm.
All who bear these calamities—heavy misfortunes—
Must unite in heart to observe fasts,
Burn incense at all six times,
Recite the sutra ten thousandfold.

The Heavenly Sovereign of the Northern Pole and the Mysterious Celestial Emperor,
Shall command the Five Directions’ Thunderbolt and Lightning Cavalry Gods,
The Awe-Sword Spirit-King,
The Talismanic Fire Soldiers,
The White Owl Marshal who terrifies the Heavenly Host,
To descend and sever the unauspicious and their heads,
Bestowing virtue and power to dispel all misfortunes.
The Boundless Scripture,
Universal liberation without end.

The Dao speaks: The unworthy scholar, shallow in the Dao,
Has not yet fulfilled the True Practice.
There are ghosts from the Dark Springs,
And gods of the Six Heavens,
Who falsely bring disaster and calamity,
Encountering all hardships,
Years marked by harm,
Fortune and prosperity diminished,
Households restless,
Families plagued by malevolent spirits.
If the perfected adept and fellow scholars burn incense for them,
And recite the sutra ten thousand times,
To absolve and avert punishments and misfortunes,
And follow the ritual to cleanse impurities as prescribed,
The Great Celestial Gods and the Seven Primordial Qi
Shall descend into their bodies,
Bringing auspicious fortune and eternal protection,
Preserving them from annihilation,
Thus attaining the status of Spirit-King.

The Dao speaks: To invite the Heavenly Hosts to descend,
To have spirit-soldiers guard the body,
To sever the unauspicious and their heads—
Through fasting, keeping vigil, and reciting the sutra,
One may attain the Dao of Immortality,
And dispel all misfortunes and diseases.

When the celestial cycles conclude,
Stars and constellations stray from their paths,
The sun and moon lose their regularity,
The four seasons falter,
Yin and Yang fall out of harmony,
Wars rage in season,
Pestilence and poison spread,
The myriad people perish young,
Teachers and friends meet untimely ends—
All must observe fasts,
Burn incense and recite the sutra.

The merit and virtue of fasting, keeping vigil, and reciting the sutra
Are most profound.
Above, they dispel celestial calamities,
And protect and safeguard the Emperor.
Below, they avert poisonous harm,
And liberate the myriad people.
Dependent upon life and death,
Their blessings are boundless.
Thus it is called Boundless,
Universal liberation for Heaven and Man.

The Dao speaks: All who possess this sutra,
And perform these merits for the Heavenly Sovereigns and myriad people,
On days of calamity, with sincere intent,
Observe fasts, burn incense,
And recite the sutra ten thousand times,
Shall be recorded by all Heavens,
Guarded by ten thousand gods,
Distinguished by the perfected,
And thus become a minister of the Golden Gate of the Holy Sovereign.

The Heavens record all deeds and misdeeds,
Without loss of a single measure.
The Celestial Spirit-Kings also champion your life,
And those who attain the Dao shall comprehend the perfected words.

The hidden language of the Great Brahman in the Heavens—Boundless Sound,
Composed by the Dao Sovereign.

The **Fifty-Fourth Scroll** concludes.
**#1『□』**, the **Original Text** is **deficient and unclear**.

**The Fifty-Fifth Scroll**:
**Pursuing the Liberation of the Ancestral Souls**.

The **Dao/Way** speaks:

*"In days of yore, within the **Lóngfàn Tiān** (Dragon-Void Heavens), the **Jǐngxiāo** (Celestial Echo) hummed its primal song, refining the **huàtǔ** (transmuted earth) of **Boundless Liberation’s** highest grade. There, the **Yuánshǐ** (Primordial Origin) taught the **Sutra** of *Pursuing the Liberation of Ancestral Souls*—the **Fifty-Fifth Scroll** of **Boundless Liberation’s** highest grade.

At that time, the **Yuánshǐ Tiānzūn** (Primordial Origin Celestial Sovereign) proclaimed this **Sutra**, circling ten times through the **Ten Directions**, summoning all realms. Then, the **Nine Sovereigns of the High True**, the **Feitian Dasheng** (Flying Heavenly Saints), the **Miáoxíng Zhēnrén** (Wondrous Conduct True Persons), the **Xuánzhōng Fǎshī** (Mysterious Midst Masters), those who traverse the **Dòngyīn Shuòdān Yùjué** (Piercing Darkness, Solitary, and Utterly Obscure) domain—**Wǔlíng Xuánlǎo** (Five Spirits Mysterious Elders), the **Heidi Tiānjūn** (Black Sovereign Heavenly Lords), the **Tīngdū Běidi** (Tīngdū Northern Sovereigns), the **Liùtiān Dàmó** (Six Heavens Great Demons), the **Jiùkǔ Língxiān** (Rescuer of Suffering Immortal), the **Jiǔgōng Cáoshǔ** (Nine Palaces’ Officials), the **Sānyuán Kǎohún** (Three Primordials’ Soul-Investigators), and the **innumerable host**—all ascended upon the void.

With **three pure clouds** and **eight celestial Echoes’ palanquins**, the **huágài** (glorious canopy) cast its shade, while **jīncǎi** (emerald hues) intermingled their radiance. **Nine-hued jade vines** floated in the boundless expanse, their brilliance unfurling for **seven days and seven nights**. The **lǒuguān** (pavilions and towers of all Heavens) mirrored their splendor across the **yōuliáo** (profound void), their **zhūwéi yùháo** (pearl-threaded and jade-bristled) wheels pausing their motion, their **shénfēng xíruì** (divine winds and auspicious mists) converging. The **Kōngzàng** (Void Treasury) poured forth its waves, and within a single realm—its lands, mountains, forests, and waters—all was leveled to equal height, with no high or low. The earth transformed into **qīngyù** (azure jade), its ten thousand miles uniformly reflected, no hue differing.

All **True Ones** attended at the seat, while the **Yuánshǐ Tiānzūn** sat in mystery upon the **jiǔguāng bǎojú** (Nine-Light Jewel Platform), suspended in the void. After reciting the **Sutra** once, the **Great Saints of all Heavens** simultaneously praised its virtue. At that moment, the **sentient beings of the Great Earth**, their **ancestral souls** burdened with accumulated sins, trembled in awe and received pardon.

After reciting the **Sutra** twice, the light illuminated the **Nine Yous** (Nine Abysses), awakening the **宿命** (*sùmìng*, past destinies). After reciting the **Sutra** thrice, clouds encircled the **Dao/Way’s** domain, and **gānlù** (blissful dew) rained upon the void. After reciting the **Sutra** four times, the **fire mountains** subsided their flames, and the **cold pools** stilled their waves. After reciting the **Sutra** five times, the **ten great hells** opened their gates, and the **afoul souls** were liberated. After reciting the **Sutra** six times, evil roots were extinguished, and none sank into **苦趣** (*kǔqù*, suffering realms). After reciting the **Sutra** seven times, the **black ledgers** were burned, and the soul-investigations ceased. After reciting the **Sutra** eight times, the **yuanqu** (abyssal officials) ascended, their **ancestral souls** promoted to **immortal grades**. After reciting the **Sutra** nine times, **dark domains** unfurled their clouds, and **yang light** dispersed their gloom. After reciting the **Sutra** ten times, **枯骨** (*kūgǔ*, dried bones) revived, all rising as **完人** (*wánrén*, perfected beings). Then, within that realm—whether male or female—none failed to incline their hearts, all receiving protection and attaining **long life**.

The **Dao/Way** speaks:

*"At that time, as the **Yuánshǐ Tiānzūn** first expounded the **Sutra**, the **men and women of the realm** each recalled their **ancestral souls** from past lives, numbering in the **myriad myriads**—ancient kin and departed forebears. Some, bound by **宿因** (*sùyīn*, past karma) and **业力** (*yèlì*, karmic forces), had already taken birth, wandering the **Three Realms**. Others remained in **幽境** (*yōujìng*, dark domains), trapped within the **冥关** (*míngguān*, abyssal gates), enduring endless cycles, their time stretched to eternity. Their **souls** lacked refuge, their **bodies** transmuted to dust, yet their **nature and awareness** persisted, still harboring **心念** (*xīnniàn*, mindful traces). They suffered these **阴罪** (*yīnzuì*, dark sins), inevitably incurring **阳愆** (*yángqiān*, bright transgressions).

Now, encountering the **Yuánshǐ** as he unfurled the **追度** (*zhuīdù*, ancestral liberation) **Law**, they rejoiced beyond measure, their **wishes** sincere and **awaiting instruction**. They sought to **broadly benefit all living beings**.

At that time, the **Tiānzūn**’s **fourfold observation** of **Heavenly and Human**, along with **all ghosts and spirits**, and the **saints of the Ten Directions**, raised their **山水云霞** (*shānshuǐ yúnxiá*, mountain-water-cloud-mist) sleeves in homage. They brandished **九色碧光** (*jiǔsè bìguāng*, nine-hued azure radiance) and their **宛转之绂** (*wǎnzhuǎn zhī fú*, supple ritual sashes). For a long while, they extended a **single thread of nine-hued azure light**, descending its brilliance to the **Nine Layers and Seven Circuits**, between the **iron mountains**, to the **ten great hells**—each spanning **eight thousand li**, vast in height, breadth, depth, and magnitude. As this **thread of azure light** ascended, the **六种** (*liùzhǒng*, sixfold) tremors shook the earth.

It was as though **two peaks clashed in the great sea**, or as though the **five thunders of all Heavens** roared in unison. The **game of the **Jìngxiāo** (Celestial Echo) and the **thirty-six palaces** swayed in response, while the **northern hells of Tīngdū** rose in spirals, detaching from the **abyssal void** and ascending to the **absolute heights**. The **thread of azure light** drew up the **hell’s summit**, unleashing **just winds** that reached the **Heavenly Realms**. This great hell was suspended like a **弹丸** (*tánwán*, shot from a catapult) at the **thread’s end**, its **five punishments and myriad torments**—blood knives and fiery roasts—clearly exposed, with no obstruction.

The **innumerable host** gazed without hindrance, all witnessing the **ten great hells**, their **ancestral souls** undergoing **punishments and torments**, imprisoned within the **investigatory halls**. They wailed in sorrow, beseeching salvation. All **sentient beings**, seeing this, raised their voices in lamentation, their cries echoing through the **Heavens**, as they prayed to the **Xūhuáng** (Vacuous Sovereign), imploring **ancestral liberation**.

The **Yuánshǐ Tiānzūn** smiled in contentment, then from his **crown**, emitted a **great luminous radiance**, illuminating **Heaven and Earth**."

Within the **radiant light**, there appeared a **scarlet script** (*chìwén*) of clouds bearing **Heaven’s Precious Vouchers** (*Tiān Bǎo Quàn*), their **golden rays** (*máng jīn*) and **jade-like brilliance** (*yù zhuó*) curling in intricate patterns, displayed before all.

He then proclaimed: *"You, all sentient beings, shall now invoke the **ancestral souls** of past ages, the **departed spirits** (*wánghún*). By reciting this **sacred scripture** (*zhēngjīng*), I shall traverse the **ten transgressions** (*shí guò*), and all shall ascend to **Heaven**.*

When the **vouchers** were displayed, a **misty assembly** of clouds gathered, unable to be restrained. Half the land tilted into **abyssal depths** (*piān xiàn*), and thereupon, a **Precious Pearl** (*Bǎo Zhū*) was suspended—great as a **millet grain** (*shǔmǐ*), floating nine **zhang** above the earth in the **void of emptiness** (*kōng xuán*).

The **Yuánshǐ Tiānzūn** ascended, summoning the **Heavenly Pure Ones** (*Tiān Zhēn*), the **Great Gods of the Highest Saints** (*Shàngshèng Gāozūn*), the **Ten-Directional Saviors of Suffering and Transgressions** (*Shífāng Jiùkǔ Bázuì Zhēnrén*), the **Great Gods of Ultimate Truth** (*Zhìzhēn Dàshén*), and the **countless hosts** (*wú yáng shù zhòng*)—all entering the **Precious Pearl**.

The **Heavenly Beings** (*Tiānrén*) looked upward, seeing only **flickering lights** (*fúfú*) passing through the **Pearl’s mouth**. Once inside, their whereabouts became **unknown**.

The **common folk** dispersed, and the land returned to its **level and upright state** (*píngzhèng*), no longer **tilted or sunken**. Within the **Pearl**, the **Yuánshǐ Tiānzūn** completed the **sacred teachings** (*jīngshì*), and the **Great Gods** (*Zhōngzhēn*) oversaw the **salvation** (*jiùdù*), granting it to me. At that moment, **joy and celebration** were beyond description.

The **ritual matters** (*fǎshì*) were **roughly understood** (*cūxī*), the **Heavens** restored their order (*fùwèi*), and in an instant (*shūxū*), all was **silent and without trace**.

At that time, those who encountered this **sacred scripture and teachings** (*jīngfǎ*) universally received **salvation and deliverance** (*jìhuì bájiù*). The **ancestral souls** did not fall into **evil paths** (*èdào*), the **tilted lands** returned to **upright reverence** (*guīyǎng*), and all practiced **filial piety** (*xiāoxīn*).

They could **respect and yield**, **be frugal and pure**, **gentle and harmonious**, **devoted and obedient**, **enduring and nurturing**. Their **hearts held no rebellion** (*wú bèi màn*), and their **mouths spoke no grievances** (*wú yuàn yán*). They were **unified in compassion** (*qí tóng cí’ài*), and **distant lands** became **kin**.

The **land was secure**, the **people prosperous**, rejoicing in **Great Peace** (*Tàipíng*). The **Dao** began to teach, and the **entire realm** was guided by the **Way**.

Those who **aspired with earnest intent** (*yǒu zhìxīn*), revering and honoring the **sacred scripture**, all achieved **salvation of the world** (*dùshì*).

The **Way** declares: *"The names of the Highest Saints proclaimed in the **Yuánshǐ Tiānzūn’s teachings** are **hidden resonances** (*yǐnyùn*) within the **Heavens**, and also **taboo names** (*nèihuì*) of the **True Kings** (*Zhēnwáng*), the **concealed names** (*cángmíng*) revered by **hundreds of spirits**. These are not the **common words** (*chángcí*) of the world. The **Highest Saints**, having already become **True Ones** (*Zhēnrén*), master the **Mystic Depths** (*tōng xuán jiū wēi*), comprehending its **chapters** (*qīng*). When recited **ten times** (*shí guò*), the **Heavens** respond in distant harmony, and **ten thousand transgressions** are all absolved. The **ancestral souls** of past ages all ascend to **immortality**, benefiting all and **universally saving sentient life** (*pǔdù wànshēng*), reviving the **deceased** (*huíshī qǐsǐ*) and transforming **white bones** into living beings.

For those **who study deeply** (*Zhìxué Zhīshì*), reciting this **ten times**, then the **Five Sacred Mountains** (*Wǔyuè*) resound with **piercing chants** (*zòuzú*), the **Three Officials** (*Sānguān*) present their **sacred words** (*fēngcí*), the **hidden souls** (*yōuhún*) are **transmuted** (*qiānhuà*), and the **departed spirits** (*shìpò*) ascend in **transcendence**. They are **salvaged from death** (*jìdù wángmò*), and the **ceased** obtain **rebirth**. This is because such scholars, their **Daoist virtue and power** (*dàodé*) yet **unfulfilled**, their **essence** (*tǐ*) not yet **penetrating Ultimate Truth**, can **command the Ten Directions** (*shǐ shífāng*) but their **威** (*wēi*, awe/authority) has not yet **subdued Heaven’s governance** (*tiānpèi*), nor their **德** (*dé*, virtue) **overpowered the earthly spirits** (*dìqí*). They can only **assist the hidden souls** (*zījí yōulíng*), **salvage ancestral spirits** (*jìbá zǔxiān*)—no more.

To **casually recite** this **chapter**, one’s **body shall suffer calamity** (*bèiyāng*). To **revere and honor** with **supreme devotion**, one’s **doorways shall flourish** (*ménhù xīnglóng*). For generations, there shall be **prosperity and brilliance** (*chángchì*), **harmonious connections with the good** (*yǔshàn yīnyuán*), and **ten thousand disasters** shall not **touch** (*bùgān*). The **divine spirits** shall **guard the gates**.

This **scripture** is **supremely noble and wondrous**, unmatched in the **Jade Capital** (*Yùjīng*). It **saves countless beings**, serving as the **foundation of ten thousand teachings** (*Zōng*). Its **grand framework** (*wēiwēi dàfàn*) is **virtue** beyond measure.

The **Way** declares: *"For those who recite this **scripture ten times**, the **Heavens** gather in unison, **hundreds of millions of ancestral spirits** (*yìcèng wànzǔ*) and **hidden souls** (*yōulíng*) in torment all receive **salvation** immediately, ascending to the **Vermilion Palace** (*Zhūgōng*). They **abide there nine years**, undergoing **transformation and rebirth**, becoming **noble beings** (*guìrén*).

For those who **love learning** (*hàoxué*) and recite this **scripture ten times**, the **ancestral spirits** of past ages all receive **salvation**, ascending to the **Southern Palace**. Those who **recite it in this world** shall have their **deceased ancestors** (*wángguò zǔkǎo*) attain the **Way of Refining Form in Great Darkness** (*Tàiyīn Liànxíng*), their **souls and spirits** (*húnshén*) **temporarily extinguished**, yet they **avoid the hells**, immediately **regaining their forms** (*fǎnxíng*) and **wandering the Great Void** (*yóuxíng Tàikōng*).

This **scripture** is **mysterious and profound**, its **salvation infinite**. All **Heavenly Beings** (*Tiānrén*) and **sentient beings** shall not fail to **receive its blessings**.

Its **limitless merits** extend to **life and death**, granting **universal grace**. Though **Heaven’s treasures** are not **transmitted to the mortal world**, the **noble scholars** who bring **golden treasures** (*jīnbǎo*) and **devoted hearts** (*xiàoxīn*) may **pledge to Heaven** and **transmit it** (*méngtiān ér chuán*). To **leak or slight it** (*qīngxiè lòumàn*) brings **calamity** upon one’s **descendants**, who shall serve **long terms in the Three Officials’ halls**.

There are **twenty-four Jade Boys** (*Yùtóng*) and **twenty-four Jade Girls** (*Yùnǚ*), attending as **guardians of the sacred texts** (*yíngwèi shénwén*), protecting the **bodies of those who receive the scripture**.

The **Way** declares: *"On the **long fasts** of the **first month**, reciting and chanting this **scripture**, the **ancestral souls** of past ages shall be **freed from earthly imprisonment** (*duàn dìdài yì*), ascending to the **Southern Palace**. On the **long fasts** of the **seventh month**, reciting and chanting this **scripture**, the **nine ancestral spirits** and **seven Mystic Ones** (*jiǔzǔ qīxuán*) shall ascend to the **Heavenly Gates** (*Tiānmén*), their **transgressions pardoned** and **nature refined**. Their **bodies shall attain immortality** (*shēndé shénxiān*).

On the **long fasts** of the **tenth month**, reciting and chanting this **scripture**, the **ancestral spirits** of ancient times and their **affiliated souls** (*guīxiān quànshǔ*) shall be **refined and transformed** (*liànhuà*), their names **recorded in the Supreme Clarity** (*kèlù Tàiqīng*). On the **eight solemn festivals** (*Bājié*), reciting and chanting this **scripture**, the **ancestral souls** of distant ages shall have their **transgressions extinguished** in the **Northern Capital’s Black Mountain** (*Xīnshān*), their **toiling spirits** (*kǎo*) shall **rest** at the **River’s Source** (*Héyuán*), and they shall become **True Ones of the Nine Palaces** (*Zhēnrén*).

On the **day of one’s natal command** (*Běnmìng*), reciting and chanting this **scripture**, the **seven ancestral spirits** of the **Mystic Hall** (*Xuántáng*) and **souls from past kalpas** (*wǎngjié zhìhún*) shall **attach to flesh and bone** (*língròu fùgǔ*), their **nearby descendants** becoming **human**. Their **souls and spirits** shall **clarify and rectify**, their **ten thousand breaths** (*wàngqì*) **enduring**. They shall **avoid suffering**, their **bodies radiant**. The **Three Realms** (*Sānjiè*) shall **guard and attend**, the **Five Emperors** (*Wǔdì*) shall **oversee their welcome**, and **ten thousand spirits** shall **pay homage**. Their names shall be **recorded in Heaven**, their **merits fulfilled** and **virtue complete**, ascending to the **Upper Clarity** (*Shàngqīng*).

The **Way** declares: *"On the **days of practice** (*Xíngdào*), one must first **bathe in fragrant water** (*xiāngtāng mùyù*), observe **fast and purity** (*zhāijiè*), and enter the **chamber** (*shì*), facing **east**. One shall **knock the teeth** (*kòuzú*) **thirty-two times** (*sānshíèr tōng*), heard by the **Thirty-Two Heavens** (*Sānshíèr Tiān*). One shall **bow in heart** (*xīn bài*) **thirty-two times**, closing the eyes, **quietly contemplating** the **self seated within clouds of azure, violet, and crimson** (*Sān sè yúnqì*). Within and without, all is **dark and boundless** (*cāngmíng*), with **Green Dragons, White Tigers, Azure Phoenixes, Dark Tortoises, Lions, and White Cranes** arrayed on either side. The **sun and moon** illuminate, **piercing the chamber** (*dònghuàn shìnèi*), while the **Ten-Directional Saviors of Suffering** (*Shífāng Jiùkǔ Wúliàng Dàshén*) halt their **chariots** in the **void’s extreme** (*kōngjí*), their **neck pendants** (*xiàngshēng yuánxiàng*) casting **radiance** across the **Ten Directions**—so **distinct and clear**.

The **secret incantation** (*Mìzhòu*) reads:

*"**Supreme Mystic Source** (*Wúshàng Xuányuán*), **Highest Dao Sovereign** (*Tàishàng Dàojūn*), summon forth from my **body’s Thirty-Five Functionaries** (*Sānwǔ Gōngcáo*)—the **left and right officials** and **messengers** (*guānshǐ*)—those who **attend with fragrant jade** (*sìxiāng yùtóng*), **transmit words with jade maidens** (*chuányán yùnǚ*), the **Five Emperors’ direct seals** (*Wǔdì zhífú*), and the **fragrant officials of the True Day** (*Zhídì xiāngguān*), each **thirty-two in number** (*gè sānshíèr rén*), to **open and close** as spoken."*

On this auspicious day, I fast and purify the hall, reciting the **Sutra of the Supreme Mystic Source** (*Wúshàng Xuányuán Mìjiāo Jīng*) to liberate countless beings. May the **Way** I have opened ascend directly to the **Supreme Sovereign** (*Sānshíèr rén Yuánshǐ Shàngdì*) of the **Thirty-Two Heavens**, before whose sacred throne it now stands.

When done, I channel the **Qi** of the **Thirty-Two Passages** (*Sānshíèr guò*), facing east and reciting the scriptures.

The **Sutra of the Supreme Mystic Source** (*Yuánshǐ Wúliàng Dùrén Shàngpǐn Miàojīng*)
—The **Original Chapter** (*Běnzhāng*) of the **Supreme Mystic Source** (*Yuánshǐ Xuányuán*)—
**Liberates** (*Zhuīdù*) the souls of past generations (*shàngshì wánghún*), granting **countless degrees of liberation** (*shíbiàn dùrén*).

The **Nine Darknesses** (*Jiǔmíng*) conceal their **hidden melodies** (*yǐnyùn*), yet **nature is transformed** (*kāihuà zìrán*). The **void is pierced** (*kōngdòng jiànglíng*), and **divine spirits are born** (*shénshēng*). The **Great Void** (*Tàixū*) gives rise to **gods** (*shén*).

All **dharma symbols** (*fǎxiàng*) are **governed** (*zhì*), and all are **unified** (*tǒngguī*) under the **Three Primordials** (*Sānyuán*).

The **Celestial Saints of the Jade Palace** (*Qiónggōng Dàshèng*), lofty in their **imperial residence** (*dìzūn*), **proclaim** (*fūhóng*) the **most wondrous** (*zhìmiào*) and **examine** (*kǎoxiào*) the **karma** (*yīnyuán*). With **emerald scripts** (*Qīngbiān*) and **cinnabar tablets** (*Dānjiǎn*), they **record** (*jìlù*) the **mystic texts** (*Xuánwén*).

The **Primordial Yang** (*Yuányáng*) of the **Purple Micro** (*Zǐwēi*) aligns with the **deep celestial springs** (*Dòngyuán*). The **Great Yin** (*Tàiyīn*) **offices** (*shǔfá*) and **punishes** (*jǔqiān*), while the **fire officials** (*Huǒguān*) **conduct migrations** (*jǔqiān*).

**Living beings** (*shēngmín*) follow their **karma** (*yì*), and all are **guided** (*shèsuǒ*) to **Tangshan** (*Āngshān*). The **Nine Rivers** (*Jiǔhé*) and **Six Caverns** (*Liùdòng*) are the **camp of myriad ghosts** (*wànguǐ zhīyíng*).

The **flaming city** (*Huǒchéng*), **sword-trees** (*Jiànshù*), **boiling caldrons** (*fèi niè*), and **chilled courts** (*hántíng*)—here, the **ghostly marshals** (*guǐshuài*) and **great demons** (*Dàmó*) **interrogate** (*kǎozé*) the **sinner-souls** (*zuìhún*). With the **Supreme Mystic Source’s seals** (*Yuánshǐ Yùfú*), they **extract** (*xiàbá*) those trapped in **darkened gates** (*yōuxiāng*).

For all sentient beings, I **liberate** (*zhuīdù*) their **ancestors** (*zǔxiān*). To the **Jade Emperor** (*Zhúlíng Shàngdì*), I **report** (*gōnggào*) to the **Three Officials** (*Sānguān*).

The **Five Sacred Mountains** (*Wǔyuè*), **Four Great Rivers** (*Sìdú*), **named peaks** (*míngshān*), and **great waters** (*dàchuān*)—the **Water Palaces** (*Shuǐfǔ*) and **Cavernous Abodes** (*Dònggōng*)—where **divine sovereigns** (*shénshuài*) **rule** (*zhǔzǎi*), I **petition** (*yuánshè*) for **forgiveness** (*shè*) of those **stagnant in darkness** (*zhìchuàng*), so they may **not be delayed** (*bùdé qǐtíng*).

A **grand assembly** (*Dàhuì*) is held in the **Mystic Capital** (*Xuándū*), swiftly **summoning** (*sùzhuī*) the **myriad gods** (*wànshén*).

Among them are:
- The **Supreme Sovereign of the East** (*Dōngjí Xúnshēng Fùgǎn Tàiyī Jiùkǔ Tiānzūn*), who **responds to calls** (*xúnshēng*) and **attends to entreaties** (*fùgǎn*).
- The **Lord of Liberation and Transformation** (*Dùhún Huàxíng Zhūn*), who **liberates souls** (*dùhún*) and **shapes forms** (*huàxíng*).
- The **Great God of the Supreme Darkness** (*Tàimíng Liànshī Dàshén*), who **refines the corpse** (*liànshī*).
- The **True Person of Great Compassion** (*Dàcí Miàoxíng Zhēnrén*).
- The **Supreme Sovereign of Celestial Pivot and Fate** (*Tiānshū Tiānjī Hǎoshēng Wénchāng Yánshòu Dùè Shàngshén*), who **preserves life** (*yánshòu*) and **degrees beings** (*dùè*).

The **Supreme Mystic** (*Tàixuán*) is **summoned** (*Zhāolíng*), and **countless souls are liberated** (*Wúliàng dùrén*).

Today’s **recording** (*jiàolù*) is witnessed by the **Ten Directions’ gods** (*Shífāng shén*). The **Ten Directions’ gods** (*Shífāng shén*) arrive in their **eight celestial processions** (*Bājǐng*), riding **cloud-borne palanquins** (*fēiyún bǎogài*), **scarlet chariots** (*xiàniè*), and **whirling wheels** (*biāolún*). They **harness** (*piānjià*) the **heavenly steeds** (*Tiānmǎ*), with **white phoenixes** (*Báifèng*) and **green cranes** (*Qīngluán*) leading their **mystic and emerald banners** (*jiàn Xuánlíng Cuìjié*). Their **green-feathered dragons** (*Lǜyǔ Lóngfān*) precede them, while **ten thousand spirits** (*yìlíng wànshén*) follow in the rear, bearing **the eight pure melodies of the sun** (*Bāsù yánggē*), with **giant elephants** (*Jùxiàng*) and **qilins** (*Qílín*) **guarding** (*yìshè*) them. The **ten celestial luminaries** (*Shíjīng*) **clear the path** (*qǐtú*), and the **seven stars** (*Qīchén*) **bear the yoke** (*pěngyuán*), as **myriad spirits and gods** (*yìlíng wànshén*) **float through the void** (*fúkōng*).

Their **radiant light** (*guāngmíng*) **illuminates** (*zhàoyào*), making the **Ten Directions** (*Shífāng*) **clear** (*dònglǎng*).

The **Divine Officials** (*Shénxiào*) of the **Celestial Registry** (*Fǔxiàng*), the **Left Palace of the Primordial Yellow** (*Yuánhuáng Zuǒgōng*), and the **Immortal Masters of the Daoist Sage** (*Táogōng Xiānbó*)—all **holding sacred tablets** (*zhíqiú bǎjí*)—**assemble** (*qí dào*) before the **Celestial Throne** (*Dìqián*).

I **liberate** (*Pǔdù*) all **sentient beings** (*zhòngshēng*) and the **souls of past generations** (*shàngshì wánghún*).

By **imperial decree** (*Chì*), I **summon** (*xiè*) the **Ghostly Sovereigns** (*Guǐdì*), who **come to hear** (*láitīng jiàoyán*) my teachings.

The **Six Palaces of Tangshan** (*Luó Āng Liùgōng*), the **dark caverns** (*yīndòng*), and the **iron mountains** (*tiěshān*)—their **ministers and attendants** (*bīnyǒu liáozuǒ*), the **Four Great Celestial Lords** (*Sìdà Mínggōng*)—**guard the forbidden** (*sījìn shìchén*), **attend the august** (*bīnshén*), and **command the rivers’ lords** (*cǐhé lièhóu*). Each **holds black ledgers** (*hēibù*), **erasing** (*xiāoluò*) the **roots of sin** (*zuìgēn*), so they **cannot be detained** (*bùdé gōulíu*) and **must press onward** (*bīhé guǐqún*).

The **Supreme Mystic Source’s seals** (*Yuánshǐ Fúmìng*) **ascend at the appointed hour** (*shíkè shēngqiān*).

The **suffering souls** (*kǔhún*) are **cleansed** (*xīkǔ*) in the **chilled pools** (*hánchí*), and **purified** (*zhàoguàn*) in the **heavenly ford** (*Tiānjīn*).

The **demons are subdued** (*Zhìmó bǎojǔ*), and the **souls are classified** (*dùpǐn*) in the **Southern Palace** (*Nángōng*). The **Nine Mysteries** (*Jiǔxuán*) **undergo refinement** (*shòuliàn*), and the **souls are transformed into immortals** (*xiānhuà chéngrén*).

Those **liberated in their living bodies** (*shēngshēn shòudù*) endure **eon after eon** (*jiéjié chángcún*), **revolving with the cosmic wheel** (*suíjié lúnzhuǎn*) and **living as long as heaven** (*yǔtiān qínián*).

I **transcend** (*Chāolíng*) the **Three Realms** (*Sānjiè*), **soaring** (*xiáoyáo*) in the **Upper Pure** (*Shàngqīng*), where the **Celestial Emperor** (*Tiāndì*) **summons** (*héyán*) the **formless realm** (*wúsè zhìjìng*) of **dharma practice** (*fǎnxíng*).

The **Eight Heavens of the East**:

**Third Chapter: The Song of Ascending to Mystic Void in the Formless Realm**
**The Jade Saint’s Eminence**, the **Supreme One of the Great Unity**.
Named **Scenic Precision**, **summoning the True and commanding the spirit**.

**The Song of Ascending to Mystic Void in the Formless Realm (Continued)**

**Receiving life and descending breath**, **passing the soul and transcending the spirit**.
**Majestic and wondrous** the **illuminated scriptures**, **clear and radiant** the **penetrating texts**.
**Awakening without bounds**, **lovingly severing all ties**.
**Wisdom bright as returning light**, **glowing through the shadowed gates**.
**Resplendent with omens**, **ascending to grasp the Seven Mysteries**.
**By imperial decree**, **the stagnant and the wayward**—**who dares to bind or delay?**
**Forever beyond the Three Realms**, **refined into Vermilion Peak**.
**Roaming in Great Purity**, **resting in the Eons of Kalpa**.
**My Dao is vast and boundless**, **nourishing countless lives**.
Not only for our **ancestors and progenitors**, but **all attain this ascension**.
When **ten thousand teachings are complete**, **the body rides the Scenic Cloud**.
**Above the Three Realms**, **within the void of flight**—
the **True King’s sacred hymn**, **its melody harmonizing with the Cavernous Chapter**.
**Chanted a hundred times**, **the Seven Ancestors ascend**.
**Chanted a thousand times**, **the Immortal Host comes to escort**—
**ten thousand, a hundred thousand Ancestors**, **roaming in Great Purity**.
When **ten thousand teachings are complete**, **universally liberating all sentient beings**,
the **body transcends the Three Realms**, **its station proven as Immortal Consort**.

**Hearing the sacred sound**, **the Six Heavens honor its form**,
**by celestial decree**, **the Earth Spirits guard and escort**.
**Drawn from the earthly prison**, **the Five Torments and Eight Hardships**—
**forever parted from Northern Torment**, **the soul passes into Vermilion Peak**.

This is called **the Boundless Scripture**,
**rescuing and benefiting without end**.
**Hidden are the texts of the Highest Heaven**,
**all the Heavens hold them in reverence**.
**If revealed and scattered upon the earthly mountains**,
**disaster befalls the Seven Ancestral Lords**.

**Dao speaks**: These two chapters are the **hidden sounds of the Celestial Sovereigns**,
and the **True King of Jade Purity’s** concealed **words of Great Brahmā**.
**Piercing the Nine Abysses**, **liberating ancestors and progenitors**,
**the souls of those long departed**, **hearing these Cavernous Texts**,
**all sufferings dissolve**, **the divine consciousness ascends**—
**not mere mortal speech**.

**Words without melodious charm**, **verses without ornate grace**.
Thus called **profound and mysterious**, **difficult to trace and explain**.
**Treasure of the Highest Heaven**, **hidden in the Eastern Chamber of the Jade Purity True King’s Palace in Mystic Void**,
**the Scripture sealed in secrecy**.

**Dao flourishes, auspicious fate descends**,
**the talismans bear their efficacy**.
If **the Perfect Sage** brings **golden treasures and sincere devotion**,
**depending on the ancient rites** to **pledge with the Spirit Sovereign of Mystic Void**,
then **it shall be granted**.

**Dao speaks**: The **living of this world**,
all have **mystic ancestors** from **ancient ages and high generations**.
Though **descended through children and grandchildren**,
few reach **distant ancestors**—
**seven generations above**, **rituals no longer suffice**.
**If one has passed on**, **the generations stretch far**,
**sacrifices cannot reach them**, **the merit for cultivation cannot be applied**,
**their karmic burdens remain unsevered**, **their souls linger in the Earthly Prisons**.
All must **pray to the True and Sacred Spirit**,
**begging for retribution and response**.
**If blessed with auspicious retribution and divine response**,
then **they have already attained transcendence**.
**Dreams untrue**, **often seeing tombs and ancestral tablets**,
then **the departed soul strikes in darkness**, **not yet freed from the penal chains**.

All must **united in heart** **observe fasts and set feasts**,
**offer incense at the six times of day**,
**recite the Scripture ten times**,
with **blue paper and cinnabar script** of **Great Brahmā’s hidden words**,
**inscribing the departed’s surname, given name, and year of passing**,
**crafting the Four-Gate talismans**.
On **the front, inscribe in cinnabar the Ascension to Heaven Talisman**,
on **the back, write the year and hour of death**,
**the Master’s title and rank**,
**enclosed in a crimson pouch**,
**invoking the Earthly Prison’s overseers**,
and **the names of the departed souls**,
**burning them at the site of the feast**—**thus attaining liberation**.

**Wearing the talisman**, **born in Heaven**,
**blessings and virtues descend immediately**,
**dissolving all inauspicious omens**.
The **Boundless Scripture**, **universally liberating without end**.

**Dao speaks**: The **six kins and relatives**,
**those of shallow learning**, **whose Immortal rank is yet unfulfilled**,
**whose fate decrees liberation**—**their bodies pass through Great Darkness**.
At **the moment of departure**,
**offer incense for them**, **recite the Scripture ten times**,
**and perform the rites to liberate the corpse**—
**their souls and spirits ascend directly to the Southern Palace**,
**according to their merit and learning**, **and are reborn on the appointed day**.
**Without confusion in the Wheel of Rebirth**, **they attain divinity and immortality**.

**Dao speaks**: When **Heaven and Earth first gave birth**,
**Primordial Origin opened the Diagram**,
**there were already beings and forms**.
**When beings and forms were complete**, **there was death and rebirth**.
**Death and rebirth**—**the coming and going of spirit and qi**—
**the measure of human life**.
**Ancestral souls of ancient times**,
not only **those long departed**,
**ten thousand, a hundred thousand Ancestors**,
**some enduring kalpas of formation and destruction** yet **their souls have not ascended**.
**The scholars of this world**,
**unknowing of how many times Heaven and Earth have formed and destroyed**,
**for the long or short duration of kalpas**,
**the souls of the departed**, **their fixed karmas bound in darkness**, **unresolved**—
all must **present petitions and odes**,
**offer incense and recite Scriptures**,
**burn the Heavenly Talismans**,
**observe fasts and set feasts**,
**praying to the High True Ones**—
then **they shall attain liberation**, **born in the Hall of Great Blessings**.

**Fasts and recitations of Scripture**, **their merit is profound**—
**making the departed souls bright in Great Peace**,
**piercing the endless night with light**,
**dissolving the torments of the Earthly Prisons**,
**quelling the flames of the Fire Mountains**,
**the Dark Tribunals’ punishments cease**,
**all heat and cold receive relief**—
**their blessings are beyond measure**.
Thus called **Boundless**, **universally liberating Heavenly and Human**.

**Dao speaks**: All who possess this Scripture,
**can perform these merits for myriad folk**.
**Taking the vow to observe fasts**, **reciting the Scripture ten times**,
all are **recorded by the Heavens**,
**escorted by ten thousand spirits**,
**distinguished among the Perfect Sages**,
**and shall be worthy to serve as ministers of the Golden Gates of the Holy Sovereign**.

**The Heavens record all deeds and transgressions**,
**without a single loss**.
**The True King of Jade Purity also recommends your worth**,
**and those who attain the Dao shall comprehend these profound utterances**.

**The Hidden Words of Great Brahmā in the Heavens**—

**The Dao Speaks:**

Within these heavens, the Great *Dàfàn* speaks in hidden words,
with boundless sounds.

The ancient scriptures are all broad and long, a span of ten feet,
engraved upon the *Bǎozhuàng* of the Pure Heaven of the Northern Celestial Realm.
They scatter the crimes of the Nine *Yōu* of the *Sǎn* and *Chéng* domains,
forgive the souls of those who perished in past ages,
pursue and guide them to transcendence,
extract them from suffering and grant them ease,
sever the bonds of *karmic* causes,
settle debts from past lives,
secure their liberation and boundless freedom,
unconstrained by *Tàishān*.

Their descendants receive blessings,
high honors and fitting offices,
their homes free from malevolent *qi*,
their lineages unbroken by misfortune—
the heavens guard their prosperity,
their virtue and power ever abundant, their bodies unharmed.

Long ago, the Original Sovereign *Yuánjūn* inscribed these words,
establishing them as the true sounds.

Those who know these sounds and can fast while reciting them—
the heavens will dispatch the *Zhuīdù* Spirits of the *Língguān*,
lowering to extract their souls,
recording their meritorious deeds,
and presenting them to the heavens.
Ten thousand deities will pay homage,
the earthly spirits attend at the gates,
the Great Merit *Zhēnwáng* will recommend them to the *Shénxiāo*,
their Dao will be complete and they will attain success,
wandering the Three Realms,
ascending to the *Jīnmén*.

These sounds cleave through all obstructions,
banish all calamities,
transcend all souls,
fulfill all aspirations—
the natural sounds of the Heavenly True.
Thus, when recited, they summon the *Língrén* to descend and manifest,
the Supreme Sovereign to sing from afar,
the myriad deities to pay homage,
the Three Realms to attend at the hall,
all *shén* to bow in reverence,
the malevolent spirits to perish of their own accord,
with *línláng* resounding,
the Ten Directions in solemn silence,
the rivers and seas stilled,
the mountains and hills swallowing their mist,
all souls subdued and trembling—
they gather the host of immortals,
the heavens free of noxious vapors,
the earth free of *shén* dust,
the *Mínghuì* illuminated and clear—
the boundless compassion of the Mystic Dao.

**The *Língbǎo Wúliàng* Scripture of the Supreme Transcendence for Perfectly Attaining Beings**
*Completes Chapter 55, begins Chapter 56.*

**Chapter 56: The Section on Rescuing the Dead Souls**

The Dao speaks: *"Of old, within the Purple Luster Heaven of Mystic Rescue, the Verdant Landscape of Void-Luminous Great Compassion Soil, I received from the Primordial Origin the boundless supreme method for rescuing and delivering the dead souls of all beings.*

When the Primordial Origin Heavenly Venerable was to proclaim this scripture, He circled ten times, calling forth the Ten Directions, and then took His seat. The Heavenly True Great Gods, the Supreme Saints of High Venerability, the Great Emperor of the Northern Du, the Heavenly Venerable of the Nine Abysses Who Extracts Guilt, the Heavenly Venerable of the Golden Gate Who Rescues and Delivers, the Heavenly Venerable of the Great One Who Saves Suffering, the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful True Person Who Saves Suffering, the Great Benevolent True Person, and the countless *wúyàng*—all rode the void and arrived.

Emerald radiance flowed with splendor, clouds of hue mirrored in color, dragon palanquins and phoenix carriages, jewel-canopied and spirit-bannered, spread in procession. Fragrant mists swirled thickly, while the sun and moon paused their light. The boundless void shone clear, for nine days and nine nights. The celestial palaces of jade and pearl, cloud-halls and vermilion chambers, all shone together at once, extending down to Kunlun’s peaks, the Three Mountains, the Ten Isles and Four Seas, the curves of the Nine Rivers, the cold courts of Du’s eternal night, and the gates of the Nine Abysses—all were bathed in divine light, universally enlightened. The myriad forms became pure, the Ten Heavens bright and vast, the lands, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees all leveled as one, with no high or low. The earth turned sapphire-green, its hue unchanging.

The assembled immortals stood in attendance. The Primordial Origin Heavenly Venerable sat in void-floating splendor upon the jade-light, sunlit treasure couch of the *Dòngyáng*.

When the scripture was recited once, the great saints of the heavens simultaneously praised its virtue. At that time, the earth, mountains, and great iron cities all opened naturally, their sins absolved, and all came to hear the law’s sound.

When the scripture was recited twice, the sound of boiling caldrons shook the world, yet suddenly turned cool and clear. Waters birthed blue lotuses, strange qi perfumed the air, and the mountains of blades all became treasure trees. Shackles and chains melted away, bones and flesh regenerated, and the dead restored to living form—all sheltered beneath the Dao’s grace.

When the scripture was recited thrice, the immortals and saints extolled its marvels, and all spiritual omens manifested.

When the scripture was recited four times, all people awakened to the law’s essence.

When the scripture was recited five times, insects and beasts gained wisdom, recognizing their karmic roots.

When the scripture was recited six times, tigers, wolves, and venomous serpents severed their evil natures.

When the scripture was recited seven times, grudges dissolved, and hostile bones became kindred.

When the scripture was recited eight times, the paths of ghosts were sealed, and life’s flow preserved eternally.

When the scripture was recited nine times, the lost and stagnant souls were refined and ascended.

When the scripture was recited ten times, the Dao and virtue became pure and one, and all attained the wondrous True.

At that time, within the land, all sentient and aware beings—whose hearts did not waver in darkness—were protected and delivered, all attaining longevity.

The Dao speaks: *"At that time, when the Primordial Origin Heavenly Venerable recited the scripture once, the Great God of Boundless Rescue and Judgment from the East of the Boundless and Limitless came with the countless *wúyàng*, floating through the void.

When the scripture was recited twice, the Great God of Inspection and Rescue from the South of the Boundless and Limitless came with the countless *wúyàng*, floating through the void.

When the scripture was recited thrice, the Great God of Prohibition and Rescue from the West of the Boundless and Limitless came with the countless *wúyàng*, floating through the void.

When the scripture was recited four times, the Great God of Transformation and Rescue from the North of the Boundless and Limitless came with the countless *wúyàng*, floating through the void.

When the scripture was recited five times, the Great God of Prison-Judgment and Rescue from the Northeast of the Boundless and Limitless came with the countless *wúyàng*, floating through the void.

When the scripture was recited six times, the Great God of the Nine Abysses and Rescue from the Southeast of the Boundless and Limitless came with the countless *wúyàng*, floating through the void.

When the scripture was recited seven times, the Great God of the Springs’ Curves and Rescue from the Southwest of the Boundless and Limitless came with the countless *wúyàng*, floating through the void.

When the scripture was recited eight times, the Great God of Luo-Du and Rescue from the Northwest of the Boundless and Limitless came with the countless *wúyàng*, floating through the void.

When the scripture was recited nine times, the Great God of Transcendent Birth and Rescue from Above of the Boundless and Limitless came with the countless *wúyàng*, floating through the void.

When the scripture was recited ten times, the Great God of Ascension and Transformation and Rescue from Below of the Boundless and Limitless came with the countless *wúyàng*, floating through the void.

When the ten recitations were complete, the Great Gods of Rescue from the Ten Directions of the Boundless and Limitless Heavenly True all arrived together. The men and women of the land bowed their hearts in reverence.

The arriving multitude numbered in the myriads—all riding in unison, their spirit-light scattering hues, and fragrant mists filling the sky. The Eight Departments and Six Heavens, the Three Officials and Nine Ministries, summoned by their awe-inspiring light, gathered the suffering souls of strange destinies, along with the countless *wúyàng*. Half the land’s soil sank unevenly, beyond restraint.

Thus, the Primordial Origin, surveying near and far with compassion, took up the treasure fan and emitted a wondrous light, reaching the Ten Directions. All celestial and saintly beings who heard the law saw their forms as clear as *liúlí* glass, their inner robes washed like *zhùluó* silk. The ghosts, spirits, and lost souls each attained perfection within their kinds, their minds pure, their karmic fires extinguished. Flowers of the immortals scattered in flight, and great jade sounds resounded, proclaiming the law’s essence.

‘O ye beings! Through your accumulated sins and evils, your dead souls wander, rootless, drifting into the various destinies, enduring endless cycles, their Daoic connections unfathomable. Now, with the *jiǔyáng* divine qi of the Great Brahman Heavenly Expanse, the Twelve Spirit-Writings are transformed to rescue the dead souls, elevating them to the celestial realm.

From the moment of death, the corpse’s form is refined. The soul guards the corpse, the stagnant and lost ascend, and the immortals’ virtue restores them to life. They escape the Three Torments and cross the Eight Hardships.

The great assembly rejoiced, awaiting the grace of His light.

Then, the Primordial Origin, moved with pity, lit the incense of the flaming censer, and the smoke condensed into a jade palace, nine *zhàng* above the earth. Within hung a celestial rainbow, shimmering in five colors, to receive the assembly. All entered its midst.

The Primordial Origin then commanded the Heavenly Venerable Who Extracts Guilt, the Duke of Luo-Du, the True Person Who Saves Suffering, and the countless *wúyàng* to ascend together to the platform of wondrous purple jade and spirit-bloom."*

The Heavenly and human beings looked upward, and saw only the vibrant radiance of the Primordial Origin’s form. When the myriad spirits entered the jade palace, their whereabouts became unknown. The people of the land dispersed, the earth returned to its level state, and no longer tilted or collapsed.

The Primordial Origin then, upon the wondrous purple jade platform, completed the teaching of the sacred scripture. The multitude of *wúyàng* spirits, under divine supervision, transmitted it to me. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words. The rites were fully observed, and the celestial beings resumed their positions—all in an instant, leaving no trace of sound.

At that time, all Heavenly and human beings who encountered the scripture’s teachings universally received salvation. Their Dao/Way was preserved, and none were lost or submerged. The land turned toward reverence, and all cultivated benevolent hearts.

They neither transgressed nor offended, neither harbored resentment nor quarreled, neither wandered nor forgot, neither clung to attachments nor succumbed to them, neither disturbed nor alarmed. Their words were always true and upright, their speech free of malevolence. They harmonized in compassionate love, their teachings and transformations merging. Life and death were both secure, and they attained joyful rebirth.

The scripture’s origin was revealed in teaching: the hidden and manifest beings aligned in virtue. Those with sincere devotion, revering and honoring it, all gained the power to transcend the world.

The Dao/Way speaks: The words of the Primordial Origin’s sacred teaching are the true names of the Celestial Sovereigns within the Heavenly Domain—hidden tones of the Dao/Way. They are also the internal taboos of the True King, the secret names through which the hundred spirits achieve salvation. These are not the common words of the world.

The Supreme Saints, having already become True Persons, mastering the profound and subtle, know all its chapters. When one recites it ten times, the celestial realms respond in distant chanting, the myriad emperors offer rites, and the submerged, lost souls are restored to the ranks of immortals. Those bound by affectionate habits all attain liberation, and the assembled demons, in awe, dissolve into transformed spirits.

The learned scholars who recite it ten times shall have the Four Officials resolve their disputes, the Nine Abysses clear their grievances, the dead rise from their graves, and white bones return to form. All shall receive salvation and attain rebirth.

Thus it is: When scholars recite and chant this sacred text, they summon the True and the spirits. Wondrous *qi* arrives, and the Dao/Way generates divine virtue—so they may descend to save the dying and immediately ascend to transcendence. None fail to rise and advance.

A casual recitation brings misfortune, but proper veneration and rites ensure prosperity for one’s lineage through generations. With benevolent causes, all calamities are averted, and the divine guardians protect the gate.

This scripture is most exalted, unparalleled in the Heavenly Capital. It saves countless beings, standing as the root of all Dao/Way. Its vast and august influence is beyond measure, its virtue impossible to exhaust.

The Dao/Way speaks: For those who recite this scripture ten times, all celestial realms shall gather. The officials of Luo-Du’s Six Abysses, the river spirits of the cold courts and dark waters, the sovereigns of Tai Mountain and the earthly ramparts, all masters of the divine spirits, shall record their merits above. They shall transcend and free guilty souls—countless ancestors and descendants, the submerged and tormented—all immediately receiving salvation. Ascending to the Vermilion Palace, they shall dwell there for nine years, undergo transformation and rebirth, and become noble beings.

Those who earnestly study this scripture, their merits fulfilled and virtue attained, shall all become immortals, flying to the Golden Palace and feasting in the Heavenly Capital.

The learned scholars of the world, who recite and uphold this scripture, shall immediately receive salvation and ascend to the Southern Palace.

Common folk who recite it shall open the Nine Mysteries, escape the underworld, and be born into celestial bliss. They shall extend their gratitude to the later generations, forever free from bodily suffering.

This scripture is subtle and profound, its salvific power endless. All Heavenly and human beings rejoice in receiving its blessings. Its boundless merit bestows grace upon life and death.

Though Heaven treasures it, it is not passed down to the mortal world. Only the worthy scholars, offering gold and jade treasures with sincere hearts, swear by Heaven to transmit it.

If one reveals or scorns it carelessly, calamity shall fall upon nine generations, and eternal servitude in the netherworld awaits.

The Five Emperors, along with twenty-four jade attendants and twenty-four jade maidens, shall guard and attend the sacred text, protecting those who receive it.

The Dao/Way speaks: On the first month’s long fast, recite and chant this scripture to save the dying souls and absolve the Heavenly Officials of their transgressions in examining guilt. The great killing spirits of the Five Directions shall all cease their malevolence, and the dead shall be pardoned. They shall ascend to the Southern Palace, wandering freely in nature.

On the seventh month’s long fast, recite and chant this scripture to save the dying souls and absolve the Earthly Officials of their transgressions in examining guilt. The Five Mountains, Four Officials, Northern Luo-Du, the boundless wilderness, the spirits of altars and city gods, all prisoners and condemned souls, shall have their afflictions and misfortunes erased. Black ledgers shall be expunged, and white registers shall ascend to life.

On the tenth month’s long fast, recite and chant this scripture to save the dying souls and absolve the Water Officials of their transgressions in examining guilt. The sovereigns of the Northern Sea and river spirits, the marsh lords of the cold and deep waters, the Four Great Waters’ masters, shall all respond to the command of the tormented souls. Their sufferings shall be dispersed, and they shall cross into the realm of rebirth.

On the Eight Festivals, recite and chant this scripture to save the dying souls and examine guilt. The Eight Great Prisons and Eight Abyssal spirit jails shall all submit to the Dao/Way’s transformation, ascending to the Blessed Court. Deluded recognition shall open to enlightenment, and all shall attain the wondrous path. They shall be reborn in the mortal world, their wisdom bright and clear, diligently striving for higher learning and achieving true perfection.

On the Three Primordial Days, recite and chant this scripture to save the dying souls. Each shall fulfill their desires, be refined and ascend to the Southern Palace, return to life and receive spirit. Their souls shall be purified, their *qi* eternal, free from torment. Their bodies shall radiate light, and the Three Realms shall guard them. The Five Emperors shall welcome them, and the myriad spirits shall pay homage. Their names shall be recorded in Heaven, their merits complete and virtue attained, and they shall fly to the Upper Pure.

The Dao/Way speaks: On days of practice, one must bathe in fragrant water, fast and enter the chamber facing east. They shall strike their teeth thirty-two times, invoking the thirty-two heavens above. They shall bow in heart thirty-two times, close their eyes, and quietly meditate on sitting within the three-colored clouds of blue, yellow, and white. Within and without, all shall be obscured and luminous, with the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Crimson Bird, Dark Tortoise, Lion, and White Crane arrayed on either side. The sun and moon shall illuminate the chamber, casting radiant light within. A divine image shall arise upon their neck, its glow reaching the Ten Directions—so clear and distinct.

The secret incantation says:

*"Wúshàng xuán yuán, Tàishàng Dào jūn,*
*Summon forth the thirty-five Functionaries within my body,*
*Left and right officials, attendants bearing incense,*
*Jade maidens transmitting words,*
*The Five Emperors’ direct talismans,*
*The talismans of the thirty-two days,*
*Each thirty-two in number,*
*Unlocking all that is spoken."*

On this auspicious day of fasting and solemn rites, we recite the sacred scriptures to liberate countless souls. May my invocation ascend directly before the Most Venerable Supreme Sovereign of the Thirty-Two Heavens of the Primordial Origin.

Now, drawing the qi through thirty-two cycles, facing east, we recite the scripture:

**First Chapter: The Song of Liberating Souls from the Desire Realm into Empty Space**
Human paths easily fall,
Earthly minds torment the spirit.
The spirit labors and scatters,
Faintly fading, sinking souls.
Where do the souls awaken?
Suddenly departing the form.
The form turns to ash of eons,
The soul and spirit return to nothingness.
Silently retaining old memories,
Restlessly forgetting kin.
Gazing, no three lights,
Wandering, who is neighbor?
Ghostly officials cruelly punish,
Whips and beatings never cease.
Like driving sheep in ranks,
Lost in the boundless Underworld ferry.
Iron prisons eternally burning,
Poisonous smoke rising in confusion.
Piled corpses like mountains,
Tears and snot like rivers overflowing.
Through eons, guilt binds,
Dead souls suffer bitterly.

The Jade Purity Heavenly King,
Issues scriptures to liberate Heaven and Earth.
The Primordial Beginning’s Sacred Treasures,
Supernatural transformation generates spirit.

**Second Chapter: The Song of Ascending to the True King of the Formless Realm**
The Vermilion Gate of Nanchang,
Radiant and splendid.
The home of ten thousand spirits,
The gate of life and transformation.
Within lies eternal life,
The Great Emperor, the Purple Lord.
Feathered dragon robes,
Flying in green and purple skirts.
Holding the Yellow Scripture,
The Sacred Treasure’s upper scroll.
Judging merits in the Jade Pavilion,
Ascending and liberating dead souls.
Soul-qi receives refining,
Planting sacred roots.
Divine True moves through liberation,
Following the Yang to ascend.
Ascending the Mysterious Contract,
Water surging, fire blazing.
Flames flow in pools,
Jade rainbows, ten thousand scales.
Striding the pool as a bridge,
Golden light surging.
The Supreme Seven Elements,
Nine Abyssal guilty souls.
Bearing talismans and commands,
Ascending the transformation wheel.
Riding clouds, driving winds,
Tipping with Heaven.

**Third Chapter: The Song Demonstrating Transformation into the Formless Realm**
The Three Heavenly Realms above,
The Primordial Sovereign’s Mysterious Palace.
Returning beyond the Three Realms,
Luminous and profound.
Within lies the Great Spirit,
Called the True King.
Establishing transformations, opening liberation,
The ancestral lord of all paths.
The Primordial Beginning, Supreme Sovereign,
Bestows command with sacred scriptures.
Universally proclaiming to the underlings,
Guilt and suffering ascend and transform.
Dispersing the dark Underworld,
Universally manifesting light.
Eliminating calamities,
Permanently planting virtuous roots.

**The Song of the Formless Realm’s True King’s Salvation**

Life and death submit to the Way’s decree,
Receiving the Mysterious Sovereign’s grace.
The Underworld’s bureaucracy dissolves,
Celebrating eternal joy and prosperity.
Where the Way’s transformation reaches,
Who dares not obey?

Jade talismans guard the refining,
Peaceful through the eons’ span.
Above, the Formless Realm’s splendor,
Merging with Dao’s profound depths.

The azure void’s vast net,
Naturally spans countless eons.
This realm above the Three Worlds,
Midst the flying void’s expanse—
The True King’s sacred chant resounds,
Its melody harmonizing with the Cavernous Scripture.

Recite it a hundred times,
And your name ascends to the Southern Palace.
Recite it a thousand times,
And the Demon King comes to welcome.
Ten thousand recitations complete,
Ascend to the Celestial Void,
Transcend the Three Realms,
Ascend to the rank of Immortal Lord.
Hearing the sacred sound,
The Demon King bows in reverence,
Commanding the Earthly Deities
To escort and welcome.
Escaping the Earthly Gate,
Free from the Five Torments and Eight Hardships,
The Seven Ancestors ascend,
Forever departing the Ghostly Bureaucracy.
The soul crosses the Vermilion Mound,
Refined and reborn anew.

This is called the Boundless Salvation,
Universally liberating the endless.

There exists a Secret Scripture of the Celestial,
Revered by all the Heavens.
To reveal it carelessly invites the Hell’s fall,
Bringing calamity to the Seven Ancestors.
The Way declares:
These two chapters are the hidden sounds
Of the Celestial Sovereigns and the God of the Divine Tao,
And the True King of the Godly Expanse.
Refining and liberating the dead souls,
Ascending to the highest realms,
Heavenly lifespan spanning nine eons,
All guilt and grudges dissolved—
Their logic profound and mysterious,
All the words of the Great Brahman,
Not the common speech of the world.
Without melodic grace,
Without ornate tunes.
Thus called the Profound and Mysterious,
Difficult to fathom.
A treasure of the Celestial,
Hidden in the Divine Treasury’s Green Jade Vault,
Transmitted according to the Mysterious Principle when the time is right.
If a perfected adept brings sincerity and pledges allegiance,
Following the ancient format to inform the Three Heavens,
Then the Scripture shall be bestowed.

The Way declares:
The Earth and Heaven nurture form,
The Supreme Dao generates spirit.
Form is the dwelling of the soul,
Spirit is the Primordial Essence.
The Spirit Wind refines,
Heaven grants life.
Life forgets the Dao’s origin,
Entangled in karmic bonds.
The net of doubt, the prison of delusion,
Greed as transgression—
Objects confuse the mind,
Thoughts assail the spirit.
Qi fades, essence dissipates,
The body decays and dims.
The Five Viscera rot within,
The Seven Emotions scatter without.
The spirit’s dwelling collapses,
The spirit departs the form,
Sinking into abyssal suffering,
Dragged by past deeds.
The virtuous ascend to Heaven,
The wicked fall into the Black Waters.

The dead soul’s only reliance:
The Dao proclaims its mercy.
Sacred Scriptures save and guide,
True talismans uphold.
The Underworld officials bow in submission,
The True Officers all comply.
The Great Brahman’s lineage,
The Primordial True One’s abode.
All who share this qi must unite in heart,
Observing fasts six times daily,
Burning incense ten times through the sutras,
And virtue descends instantly.
The soul ascends to Heaven’s Hall.
The Boundless Scripture,
Universally liberating the endless.

The Way declares:
Those with shallow learning,
Or whose Immortal rank is incomplete,
When their fate of extinction arrives,
And their body enters the Great Yin—
At that moment, fellow adepts must burn incense,
Recite the sutra ten times,
And guide the corpse according to ritual.
The soul and spirit directly ascend to the Southern Palace,
According to their merit, reborn in due time.
The Wheel of Rebirth halts in confusion,
And enlightenment as an Immortal is attained.

The Way declares:
The truly learned adept,
Reciting the Three Caverns’ Sacred Scriptures,
Upholding precepts and talismans,
Secluding in mountains and marshes,
Forgotten by the world.
Or accumulating merit through deeds,
Their hidden virtue benefiting others—
When parents, teachers, or elders pass,
Desiring to guide their dead souls,
To ascend the Grand Platform,
And be enrolled in the Immortal Register—
They must first prepare the Five Fragrances’ refining broth.
Bathing the corpse’s soul,
With twelve Jade Scriptures of the Primordial Sovereign’s Sacred Text,
Inscribed in red on green silk,
Placed within the Mysterious Palace:
One on the pillow,
One on the face,
One in each hand,
One in each foot’s sole,
One before the heart,
One on each side of the coffin—
Twelve paths in total.
Burning incense, facing north, the invocation is written.
At the appointed hour, the incantation is recited:

*"Citizen of the Dao, Ruler of the King,
In life, you served the Immortal True.
At death, your form is refined.
Returning to the Great Yin.
The Sovereign’s Sacred Talisman,
Red script, jade text.
Guiding the dead soul,
Swiftly delivered to the Jade True.
Ascending to Heaven’s Hall,
Your name inscribed in the Immortal Register.
Your bones become orchid and jade,
Your face radiant with golden bloom.
The Great One guards your corpse,
The Three Officials protect your spirit.
Suddenly light as air,
Ascending to the Supreme Clarity.
The Earthly Underworld’s slaughter ceases,
Ghosts and spirits retreat.
Dare to defy the Sacred Talisman,
Disturbing the Divine’s order.
The Heavenly Executioner wields his axe,
Severing your five forms.
Mountains, marshes, waters, fire—
The True Wind and Qi protect the corpse,
Restoring life and returning the soul.
The Northern Emperor’s thunder shakes,
The corpse’s armor falls, the name of death vanishes.
On a flying cloud’s jade carriage,
You pay homage to the Purple Court.
Swiftly, as the decree commands."*

After the talisman is activated,
Fasting, burning incense, and reciting the sutras must follow.
For fasting, burning incense, and reciting the sutras,
Their merit is most profound.
The soul’s clarity ascends and transforms,
Enjoying blessings in new form.
Below, averting poison and harm,
To guide the myriad people,
Life and death rely on this salvation—
Its blessings are boundless.

Thus it is said:
All who possess this Scripture,
For kings, princes, nobles, or common folk,
Performing these merits on the day of salvation,
Burning incense and reciting the sutras ten times—
All are recorded by the Heavens,
Attended by ten thousand spirits,
And the adept of the Right Path
Shall become a minister of the Golden Gate’s Holy Sovereign.
The Heavens record every deed and transgression,
Not missing a hair’s weight.
The True King of the Celestial also recommends you,
And only those who attain the Dao
Shall truly comprehend these profound words.

**The Hidden Limitless Sound of the Great Brahman in the Midsection of the Primordial Sacred Scripture for Guiding Souls**
**Eastern Eight Heavens’ Revelation**

The radiant star clusters govern the celestial capital’s gates.
The cosmic cycles advance, exhausting their appointed numbers.
Water and fire flow as primordial roots.
Life’s Dao draws from the Mysterious—
Hearkening to Heaven’s spontaneous order.

The adept sheds like a discarded robe,
His spirit and *qi* both refined.
His rounded form manifests divine power,
His bending and extending reveal the Way’s truth.
His thoughts crystallize as jade-like purity,
Ascending through the Cloud Gate’s glory.

The Brahman’s transformation is swift and subtle,
The spirit traverses the Eight Extremes.
The white flower blooms in accordance with fate,
Its talismans aligned with the stars of *Mao* and *Bi*.

---
**Southern Eight Heavens**
Refining the crystalline gaze in the Jade Court,
Registering the female sovereign’s records.
Investigating omens reveals no deceit,
Ascending to flourish in the Prosperous Capital.
Preserving the sacred mechanism,
Rushing to the Imperial Plan’s decree.
The guilty ascend to the Celestial Bureau,
Their names inscribed in the Hall of Merit.
The Seal selects the youthful ministers,
All demonic transformations now complete.
The Mysterious responds with great scrutiny,
The netherworld’s bonds confine the cold pool.
Radiant streams transmit jade-like brilliance,
Transforming to nourish the Valley of Fusion.
Rescuing the spirit’s essence,
The *Bo* and *Yong* scriptures are draped in glory.

---
**Western Eight Heavens**
The *Tíyáng* is separated by the *Chū*,
Rolling flames sweep across the wild expanse.
The whale’s corpse disrupts the ghostly feast,
From the courtyard’s *Yóu* to the *Gēng* star’s domain.
Talismans transmit to the Dragon Palace,
Regretful of past transgressions by the *Píngquán*.
Life converges in the Divine Abode,
Omens interweave to form humanity.
The cavern’s fluids gather in coils,
Fruits dissolve around the body.
Calming the chaos of transformations,
Circulating to aid the True One.
The imprisoned armies and banners,
The wells and mats aligned in order.
Proclaiming through reverent observation,
The surging wheels drumming the *yuán* cart.

---
**Northern Eight Heavens**
Discarding the worm to beg for fish,
Do not linger in sluggish torpor.
The Edict summons the King of Stillness,
Whose mercy equals the *Bǐtú*’s embrace.
The ancient *Hán* is bound in chains,
The *Lóu* shifts the tongue’s deceit.
The *Fú* curses and seizes,
Silent as the *Yuán*’s abyss.
The *Chuò* distinguishes the vulgar from the refined,
The ancient depths resound with spirit.
Unbridled chaos brings no blessings,
The Imperial Decree bestows resources.
The *Qiú* constellations eclipse the Dipper,
The Dragon calls to the lofty heavens.
The Left General commands the *Kuí* and *Yǒu*,
Transformation births joyous wanderings.

---
**The Dao speaks:**
These are the Brahman’s hidden words,
The limitless sound within the Heavens.
The ancient scriptures were inscribed upon the Northern Celestial Jade Gate,
To rectify the Northern Mountain’s *Yīngquán* ghostly prisons,
To restrain the Nine Capitals’ great demons,
To rescue and guide the departed souls,
To birth and transform into the Land of Blessings,
Where spirits wander freely in wisdom.

Each character spans a full ten feet.
The Celestial True Man once inscribed these words,
Establishing them as the true sound.

Those who know this sound
And, with fasting, recite it—
The Heavenly察录神王 shall descend to observe their bodies,
Recording their merits and labors,
Reporting to the Heavens above.
Ten thousand spirits pay homage,
Earthly deities guard the gates,
The Great Merit True King recommends them to the Mysterious,
Their Dao complete, ascending to the Golden Gate,
Wandering the Three Realms.

This sound repels all obstacles,
Exorcises all calamities,
Guides all souls,
Accomplishes all transformations—
The natural sound of the Celestial True.

Thus, when recited, the spirit kings descend to observe,
The Supreme Deity sings from afar,
Ten thousand spirits pay homage,
The Three Realms attend the hall,
All deities bow in reverence,
Ghostly spirits vanish in terror,
The *línláng* chimes resound,
The Ten Directions grow serene,
Rivers and seas fall silent,
Mountains swallow their mists,
All spirits tremble in submission,
Summoning the gathered immortals,
Heaven is free of mist and filth,
Earth is free of demonic dust,
The netherworld’s wisdom is pure—
The boundless, profound virtue.

**The Supreme Scripture of Limitless Salvation for Transforming Beings**
**Volume Fifty-Six Complete**
**Volume Fifty-Seven**

**Explanation of the *Yōuláo* Scripture**
The Dao speaks: In days of old, within the **Primordial Azure Sky** (始青天), the **Void of the Verdant Deeps** (碧落) resounded with a vast celestial hymn, and the **Great Primordial Emperor** (元始) delivered the *Scripture of the Limitless Dao for Exorcising the Netherworld* (度人解释幽牢妙品).

When the **Primordial Emperor of the Dao** (元始天尊) spoke this scripture, He circled ten times, summoning the **Ten Directions** (十方), before ascending to His lofty seat. The **Celestial True Gods** (天真大神), the **Supreme Saints of High Rank** (上圣高尊), the **True Persons of Marvelous Practice** (妙行真人), the **Ten-Directional Emperors of Mercy Who Save from Suffering** (十方救苦天尊), the **Great Merciful Emperor of the Jade Purity Cloud Palace** (玉清云宫大慈天尊), the **True Sovereign of Great Compassion** (大悲真帝), and the **Immortal Officials of the Nine Netherworlds of the Black City** (酆都九幽帝主仙官)—countless as the sands of the **Unbounded** (无鞅)—rode the void and came.

From the **Ten Directions**, clouds arose, swirling like crimson hues. The **Jade Platforms and Precious Palaces** (琼台宝宇) flickered in the boundless expanse, while **Jade Horses and Golden Dragons** (玉马金龙) trotted through the mist, their **glowing light like phoenix canopies** (飞光凤盖) casting shade beneath **pearl-embroidered carriages** (垂荫珠軿). **Celestial auspicious hues** (瑞彩天光) radiated to the **Four Quarters** (四极), dense and verdant as the depths below (蓊郁渊映), piercing the **Azure Void** (明彻碧空). For seven days and seven nights, **crimson mists swayed** (红霞摇曳), revealing the **Divine Realm of the Godly Country** (远幕神乡). The **Celestial Capital of the Purple Micro** (天都紫微) layered its shadows, luminous as the **Star Palaces of the Crimson Hall** (丹殿星宫) and the **Jade Pavilions of the Solar Gate** (琼堂日阙). **Jade measures and celestial bands** (珠纬躔虚, 玉纲流演) wove through the **Nine Netherworlds**, while **purple vapors bloomed** (紫烟纷华), the **mountains and seas congealing into jade-green** (山海凝碧). The **auspicious golden boundary** (瑞金为界) and **colored clouds in formation** (色云合防) marked the **Pure and Tranquil Sacred Path** (清静圣途), its brilliance **unmarred by the slightest stain** (明无纤玷).

The gathered **True Gods** (众真) attended His seat, where the **Primordial Emperor of the Dao** (元始天尊) ascended to the **Floating Void Seat of the Eight Mountains, Nine Seas, Subdued Dragons, and Soaring Tigers** (玄坐空浮八山九海伏龙翔虎十极太玄之座).

As the scripture was spoken once, the **Celestial Emperors beat their drums in rhythm** (天帝鼓节), and the **High True Ones intoned with profound resonance** (高真洞咏). At that moment, the **heavy darkness of the Netherworld** (重冥阴域) was lifted from the land, and **light pervaded the age** (一时光明).

As the scripture was spoken twice, the **Thirty-Six Layers of the Underworld** (地下重垒三十六皇) bowed in submission, listening reverently, and **perused the imperial registers** (简阅皇籍).

As the scripture was spoken thrice, the **qi flowed sweet and moist**, nourishing the **withered and decayed** (气流甘濡，洒润枯朽).

As the scripture was spoken four times, the **ghosts were slain and their spirits extinguished**, the **host of demons fell silent** (杀鬼灭爽，魔众失声).

As the scripture was spoken five times, the **earth yielded eighty-one varieties of auspicious herbs** (地吐芝英八十一种), their **verdant hues and rare forms** (赪苍秀异) bearing **wondrous texts like swallows’ nests** (奇文燕胎).

As the scripture was spoken six times, the **Black Mountains of the Netherworld trembled** (酆山震摇), and the **Black Seas ceased their seething** (黑海停沸).

As the scripture was spoken seven times, the **Nine Netherworlds of Hell** (九幽地狱), with their **ten-thousand-li iron cities** (万里铁城), blazed with **karmic fires**, their **billions of eons glowing scarlet** (业火炽然，亿劫洞赤). At the scripture’s recital, the **venomous forces melted like ice** (毒势冰消), and the **flaming prisons dispersed** (炎牢消荡).

As the scripture was spoken eight times, **auspicious mists filled the void**, forming **nine-colored characters** (灵霞布空，九色成字), and the **True Scriptures radiantly appeared**, pardoning all guilty beings (真文廓现，赦诸罪人).

As the scripture was spoken nine times, the **dark qi congealed into clouds**, and the **wounds of the damned rained as tears** (暗气凝云，伤血陨雨). Those who heard the scripture **cleansed their filth**, as the **Divine Wind swept the dust** (神风扫尘).

As the scripture was spoken ten times, the **corpses rose in reverence**, their **luminous faces fresh and bright**, and they **naturally became living beings** (尸骨钦起，灵颜鲜莹，自然成人). Then, all within the land—**both male and female**—awoke to the **Dao and knew the True**, their **fetal bonds exorcised** (悟道知真，胞结解释), the **Netherworld’s gates recorded** (冥关录籍), their **characteristic marks erased** (字迹除脱), their **plain scrolls refined into sacred texts** (素幅炼章), **free of all guilt** (了无罪目), and all **turned toward the Celestial Emperor**, receiving **abundant life and nourishment** (归向天尊，咸遂生养).

The Dao speaks: Then, as the scripture was spoken once, the **Great Merciful Emperor of the Nine Qi from the Limitless and Boundless Scripture of the East** (东方无极无量品大慈九气救苦天君), with His **Unbounded multitude** (无鞅之众), floated through the void and arrived.

As the scripture was spoken twice, the **Great Wise Emperor of the Three Qi Who Pardons Sins from the Limitless and Boundless Scripture of the South** (南方无极无量品大智三气赦罪天君), with His **Unbounded multitude**, floated through the void and arrived.

As the scripture was spoken thrice, the **Great Illuminating Emperor of the Seven Qi Who Upholds the Law from the Limitless and Boundless Scripture of the West** (西方无极无量品大明七气执法天君), with His **Unbounded multitude**, floated through the void and arrived.

As the scripture was spoken four times, the **Great Beneferent Emperor of the One Qi Who Extinguishes Suffering from the Limitless and Boundless Scripture of the North** (北方无极无量品大惠一气息苦天君), with His **Unbounded multitude**, floated through the void and arrived.

As the scripture was spoken five times, the **Great Compassionate Emperor of the *Brahman* Qi Who Shatters the Prisons from the Limitless and Boundless Scripture of the Northeast** (东北无极无量品大悲梵气破狱天君), with His **Unbounded multitude**, floated through the void and arrived.

As the scripture was spoken six times, the **Great Emperor of the *Brahman* Qi Who Removes Transgressions from the Limitless and Boundless Scripture of the Southeast** (东南无极无量品除过梵气九幽天君), with His **Unbounded multitude**, floated through the void and arrived.

As the scripture was spoken seven times, the **Great Emperor of the *Brahman* Qi Who Extracts Sins from the Limitless and Boundless Scripture of the Southwest** (西南无极无量品大心梵气拔罪天君), with His **Unbounded multitude**, floated through the void and arrived.

As the scripture was spoken eight times, the **Great Merciful Emperor of the *Brahman* Qi from the Limitless and Boundless Scripture of the Northwest** (西北无极无量品大仁梵气玉匮天君), with His **Unbounded multitude**, floated through the void and arrived.

As the scripture was spoken nine times, the **Great Emperor of the Twelve Auspicious Qi Who Universally Saves from the Limitless and Boundless Scripture of the Upper Realm** (上方无极无量品普济一十二气万福天君), with His **Unbounded multitude**, floated through the void and arrived.

As the scripture was spoken ten times, the **Great Emperor of the Five Qi Who Remains Motionless from the Limitless and Boundless Scripture of the Lower Realm** (下方无极无量品不动五气玄母天君), with His **Unbounded multitude**, floated through the void and arrived.

When the ten recitations were complete, the **Limitless Celestial True Gods of the Ten Directions** (十方无极天真大神) and the **Emperors of the Boundless Dao** (无量天君) all arrived together in one moment. The **men and women of the land** (一国男女) turned their hearts in reverence, all **bearing the Emperor’s merciful grace** (咸荷慈恩). Even those who had **fallen into ruin** (下逮沦亡) were **touched by the sacred blessings** (俱沾圣泽). The **voices of their awe and gratitude** (感叹之声) echoed through the **Netherworld’s night**, while **birds and beasts wailed in sorrow** (鸟兽悲嗥), and **humans and ghosts lamented in unison** (人鬼帐惋). Those who came were as **numerous as sand grains drifting in the wind** (来者有如沙尘飘委), pressing toward the **Dao like currents flowing eastward** (向风倾注).

Then, the **Primordial Emperor of the Dao** surveyed all beings, **snapping His fingers and smiling faintly**, His **Golden Mouth emitting radiance** (金口发光), like the **brightness of the moon** (光如皎月). The **Upper Extremity reached the peerless heights** (上极无上), where the **rigid wind struck the heavens** (刚风顶际). The **Lower Extremity descended to the Water Wheel** (下极水轮), its **curved springs pouring through the Nine Leaks** (泉曲九漏). Even the **bottomless yin valleys** (无底阴谷) were **illuminated without obstruction** (无不照见), and within each ray of light, **all beings of the Three Realms** (三界众生) appeared—**good and evil, fate and root** (善恶命根), their **past retributions and new karmic ties** (宿报新缘) **mutually manifesting** (互相酬对), their **karmic fruits self-evident** (业果自明), their **hearts and eyes united in witness** (心目同证).

This **Ninefold Rotation** (九旋行) swirled in **five-colored halos** (晕成五色). It **covered the mortal realm below** (下覆人间) and **ascended to the celestial expanse above** (上接天境). Its motion was **light as a chariot**, its **radiant circular form** (灼灼圆象) **spanning the Nine Paths** (逡巡九道), resembling the **sun’s emergence over the Eastern Mountains** (状如日出东蒙). The **Ten Directions shone as one hue**, five zhang above the earth, **flashing and suspended in the void** (去地五丈，炯烁停空).

The **Primordial Emperor of the Dao** then **ascended and summoned** (登引), and the **Celestial True Gods**, the **Supreme Saints of High Rank**, the **True Persons of Marvelous Practice**, the **Limitless Ten-Directional Emperors Who Save from Suffering**, and the **Great True Gods**—countless as the sands of the **Unbounded**—all **entered the Nine-Colored Circular Form** (俱入九色圆象之中). The **heavenly and human beings** gazed upward, and **only saw a gentle breeze drifting from within the radiant circle** (惟见拂拂从圆光中入). Once they entered the light, **their whereabouts were unknown** (既入光中，不知所在), and the **people of the land scattered** (国人廓散), the **realm restored as before** (境宇如初).

The **Primordial Emperor of the Dao**, within the **Nine-Colored Circular Form**, completed the scripture’s recitation. The **gathered True Gods** oversaw the **transformation**, granting it to me. At that time, **joy and celebration were beyond expression** (喜庆难言).

The **rites of the law** were roughly performed, the **hosts of the heavens** resuming their stations. In a flash, **all sound ceased without remainder**.

At that time, **heavenly and human beings** encountered the **sutra of the law**, all receiving **salvation and deliverance**, their **dark and fettered bonds** dissolved, **no longer harmed by injustice**. The **lowly and obscure** turned upward in reverence, the **hidden and manifest** alike opened their hearts.

They **neither harbored resentment nor clung to grief**, **neither grasped nor hesitated**, **neither adhered nor loved**, **neither harmed nor deceived**, **neither wronged nor quarreled**. Their **words harmonized with reason**, their **speech carried resonant tones**, **united in compassion** though of different **essence**, **diverse in form yet kindred in spirit**.

The **land was secure**, its **people prosperous**, rejoicing in **great peace**. The **Primordial Emperor of the Dao** emerged to **proclaim the teaching**, and the **entire realm followed the Way**. Those with **sincere devotion** worshipped with **reverence**, all attaining **worldly liberation**.

The **Dao’s words**: Within the **sutra’s recitation by the Primordial Emperor**, all are the **proper names of the celestial and august lords**, **hidden sounds of the dharma**, also the **taboo names** of the **demonic kings**, the **secret names** of the **hundred spirits**—not the **common speech** of the world.

The **Supreme Sage**, having become a **True Person**, **penetrated the Mysterious** and **fathomed the subtle**. They **fully comprehended its verses**.

When **recited ten times**, then the **hosts of the heavens** sing from afar, the **Nine Abysses** open their gates, the **dark seas** fall silent, the **mountains of karma** topple in ruin. The **light pierces through the night**, across **accumulated kalpas and ages**, binding the **ghostly capital** in chains, their records **lodged with the Three Officials**. Their **rotting corpses and piled bones**, their **souls and spirits imprisoned in torment**, their **black qi foul and decaying**, shatter their **hearts and split their minds**. The **fires of the mountains** and **ice of the pools** scorch and boil them, **ten thousandfold** in suffering, **without day or night**.

Upon hearing this **pure and heavenly scripture**, the **Great One** records their souls, the **Southern Vermilion** refines their spirits. The **spirit returns to awareness**, abandoning illusion for truth. Their **grievances and resentments** are instantly clarified, the **true qi of Great Harmony** entering their **form and body**. **Lotus flowers** bear their sandals, **auspicious dragons** support their countenance, joining the **heavenly beings in joy**. The **Great Demon** awaits in submission.

The **scholars of profound learning**, when reciting this ten times, see **Mount Tai tremble in command**, and **King Zhou’s severed head** bow in awe.

This **Lord’s scripture**, once received, **erases their name from the Underworld’s ledger**. The **muddy embryo’s dark hall**, the **ancestral qi of the Seven Patriarchs**, **swirling yet unmanifest**, **forms within the womb’s blood**.

The **hundred joints’ insect officials**, their **bones filled with scribes**, the **earthly tigers** and **wind beasts**—**ghouls that devour flesh and consume qi**—and the **guardian deities of the Copper Fire Serpent in the Spring Treasury**, all recoil as **dark fumes billow forth**. The **wandering souls** grow faint and confused, the **spirit officials gnashing their teeth**.

A **hundred-li** cauldron of **seething oil**, a **thousand-fathom iron rampart**, **no stars visible**. The **vast domain of the Dao**.

**True knowledge** sinks into **obscurity**, **roots of sin entwined**. They **drag living beings into retribution**, summoning **lawsuits over ancestral graves and family halls**, **false accusations before the heavenly tribunals**. In **utter darkness**, no recourse exists—**ten thousand deaths** in an instant, **pain and torment without end**.

Upon hearing this **piercing sutra**, the **demon generals** halt their torments, the **Black Emperor** stays his hand. **Ancient kalpas** are purged, **recent suffering souls** transformed. The **Dao’s power** molds them, **harshness dissolved**, **enmity erased**. The **jade records** set the standard, **purple clouds** cover their seats. The **spirit winds** blow gently, their **fallen spirits ascend**, the **gates of death** no longer bind them—**they roam freely through the Three Realms**.

Even a **light recitation** of this **chapter brings calamity**. **Honoring and worshipping** with **devotion**, their **doorways flourish**.

世世昌炽，与善因缘，万灾不干，神明护门。
Through generations, prosperity thrives with virtuous connections—calamities never intrude, divine spirits guard the gate.

斯经尊妙，利乐幽灵，度人无量，为万道之宗。

Countless ancestors—both near and distant—suffering souls in torment—all are immediately liberated, ascending to the Vermilion Palace. Their fates are sealed for nine years, transformed and reborn as noble beings.

而有亿劫结魂，千载滞爽，太上不以闻宥，上帝不以恩原。
Yet there are souls bound by kalpas of suffering, lingering for millennia—even the Most High does not pardon them, nor does the Supreme Lord grant mercy.

禁狱幽牢，在女青天一。
Their prisons lie beneath the Azure Sky’s dominion.

王平女沙，九阴大禁，都司捡形，五老校录，暗黪芒窕之穴。
In the Black Sand’s realm, the Nine-Yin Forbidden Zone, where the Chief Officials inspect forms and the Five Elders record transgressions, within the shadowed, murky caverns of the *Mangtao* pits.

Vile winds and monstrous beings dwell in the Four Great Marshes, where the sea gates wither and erode.

不得鼓猬，锋之断笔。
No tortures of the *Gǔwèi* beast, nor the Pen of Severance may harm them.

韩君丈人将折简於螭笈，是皆玄司九幽酆泉之重刑。
Even the *Han Jun*’s executioner, poised to strike with the *Chī* case, cannot enforce these—all are grave punishments of the Nine Abysses and the *Yingquan* underworld.

Some sense human breath, poisoned food, or use straw and fodder to manifest their forms, lurking in darkness to deceive. Though the Nine Departments hunt them and the Three Officials record their crimes, the scripture’s divine power liberates them all, ascending to the Southern Palace.

奉行之者，则延寿长年，后皆得作尸解之道，魂神暂灭，不住地狱，即得返形，游行太空。

They present themselves before the Three Primordial Caverns’ ruler, the Fire Official of the Solar Birth, burning away their records of sin.

During the seventh month’s fast, reciting this scripture for ancestral souls—parents and kin—elevates and refines them, severing the bonds of sin. Their descendants rejoice as they present themselves before the Three Primordial Caverns’ ruler, the Water Official of the Lunar Death. The records of punishment drift away, original offenses are cleansed, and all torments—drowning in the abyss, freezing in ice pools, thunderstrikes, forced labor in the river bends, drowning in violent currents, or turbulent waves—are transformed by the scripture’s power into a hall of ease, where instruments of torment become objects of delight.

十月长斋，诵咏是经，为上世亡魂，姑妣娣姒，往逝妇姬，解断征呼，复连传逮。

Their sins and merits are assessed, liberating them from the Three Calamities, Four Killings, Five Sufferings, Six Harms, Seven Injuries, Eight Hardships, Nine Calamities, and Ten Extremes—all matters judged by the Three Primordial Examiners, the Underworld’s condemnations, and universal torments.

The Dao declares: On the day of practice, one must bathe in fragrant waters, fast in purity, enter the chamber facing east, and strike the teeth thirty-two times, ascending to the Thirty-Two Heavens. With the heart, one bows to the Thirty-Two Transgressions.

闭目，静思身坐青黄白三色云气之中，内外蓊冥，有青龙、白虎、朱雀、玄武、狮子、白鹤，罗列左右，日月照明，洞焕室内，项生图象，光映十方，如此分明。
Close the eyes, meditate upon sitting within the three-colored clouds of blue, yellow, and white. Within and without, darkness enfolds—yet the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Lion, and White Crane array themselves on either side. Sun and moon illuminate, the chamber radiant, talismans manifesting on the neck, their light shining across the ten directions, all made clear.

The secret incantation proclaims:

*"Supreme Mysterious Origin, the Most High Dao Lord,
summon forth from my body the thirty-five officials of the Five Stars,
left and right ministerial messengers,
attendants of fragrant jade boys,
messenger maidens of jade,
the Five Emperors’ direct seals,
and the thirty-two officers of the Radiant Incense Bureau—
each thirty-two in number—
to open the gates as spoken.

Today is a day of auspicious celebration, a pure hall of fasting.
Practicing this scripture, one attains boundless liberation for all beings.
May my petition ascend directly to the throne of the Most High Supreme Emperor of the Thirty-Two Heavens,
the Origin of All Beginnings, the Most Venerable Sovereign.

*Concluded. Draw in the qi of the Thirty-Two Transgressions, face east, and recite the scripture.*

**The Supreme Origin’s Boundless Liberation Scripture of the Highest Grade**

The *Supreme Origin’s Mysterious Treasure Scripture of the Cavernous Void*
interprets the hidden prison,
opens the radiant path to liberate beings,
unfolds the hidden melodies of the heavens,
and harmonizes the natural separation and union.

The Primordial Beginning was formless,
a boundless truth within the void.
The Original Qi gave birth to all,
as purple mists swirled in dense clouds.
Wind and fire shaped the crucible,
where essence congealed of its own accord.
Its form swayed low and deep,
carved like jade, refined as gold.
Hanging like a blade of grass,
it traversed the ten directions.
The *Mixed Void’s Crimson Text* inscribed intent as form—
separated, it became the myriad phenomena;
united, it became the Precious Scripture.
Strung like pearls, flowers in sequence,
it stirred the turbid and exalted the pure.
The Five Elders emitted seals,
while the Imperial Sage inscribed the numinous.
Creation thus took form,
and the Three Realms were illuminated.
Heaven was cleansed by it,
Earth was pacified by it,
Humans were born by it,
Spirits were enlivened by it,
and All Things were perfected by it.

The *Dharma-Qi* ascended to the left,
giving rise to spring and summer’s flourishing.
The *Heavenly Light* sped to the right,
nurturing autumn and winter’s growth.
The Supreme Origin Emperor
is named the *Jade Purity*.
Above, there is no further ancestor—
only the Dao as one’s true body.
The Five Talismans spread wide,
nurturing all divine spirits.
The Three Celestial Bodies radiated brilliance,
while the *Yulu* veiled the Jade Purity.
The Nine Terraces rooted deep,
their shadows stretching to the *Yin City*.
Below, the Great Demon
was born alongside the Dao.
The *Luo Mountain Dragon Source*
and the *Chou Capital* schemed in deceit.
Endless were the vast distances,
as the Cavernous Palace shimmered in the void.
Within lay ten thousand ghosts,
brandishing massive armies.
The *Prison of Darkness* examined the hidden,
while the Great Calamity was not abandoned.
Piles of fire and iron,
heaven and earth sealed shut.
The *Compassionate Dao King*,
the Most Exalted in Heaven,
emitted divine light from his mouth,
revealing the Jade Text.
Auspicious clouds gathered in azure,
while the *Phoenix-Qi* formed into mist.
The prison gates were thus opened,
and the Black Realm shone bright.
Nine dragons bore the seals,
refining and liberating the kindred souls.
This is the Great *Dharma*,
the Heaven within Heaven,
where myriad beings flourish,
and wisdom nurtures itself.
Within, vast undertakings were constructed,
silently contending with the divine.
The divine originated from Heaven,
yet primordial evil clung to it.
The suffering souls, lost in darkness,
fell into the heavy abyss.
The ghostly generals seized their contracts,
while tiger soldiers wielded their whips.
They called out names by their deeds—
who dared to obstruct my path?
Black-armored demons spewed fire,
while the *Thunder Mother* seized the immortals.
Ten thousand poisons took form,
sealed by the Heavenly Gate.
Eyes were closed, ears blocked,
as the distant *Southern Elixir* was sought.
Yearning for the Jade Seal,
I pardoned this hidden suffering.
The boundless blue sky,
with its nine calamities and towering peaks,
unfurled the *Supreme Yellow Banner*,
while the *Master of Fate* drove his chariot.
The *Nine Yin Commands* were proclaimed,
and the *Registrar of Life and Death* oversaw executions.
The *Yuan Child* governed the Northern Obscurity,
while the *Great Sovereign* ruled the Northern Yin.
The *Great God of Records* presided,
master of calculations and soul-capture.
The *Four Bright Ones* were born,
and the Five Peaks—*Tai Mountain*—were established.
The *Master of the Void* interpreted the hidden prison,
liberating boundless beings.
Today, the celestial records are examined,
as all the heavens gather at the hall.

Together, they ride upon flowing clouds and rainbow chariots,
with purple canopies and crimson wheels,
yoked to green elephants and spotted dragons,
bearing the *Summon-Spirits Banner* and the *Return-to-Life Flag*,
leading with the *Nine True Melodies* and trailing the *Eight Harmonious Tunes*.
Heavenly horses and qilins leap and bound,
while the *Six Ding* open the Dao,
and the *Seven Radiant Ones* bear the yoke.
Ten thousand chariots, a hundred thousand riders,
float through the sky,
their light turning back as they oversee true liberation.

The *Northern Yin Right Minister*,
the *Cavernous Abyss Transformation Palace*,
the *Three Primordials* assisting,
the *Supreme Spirit Lord*,
holding the *Sacred Registers* and seals,
converge at the Imperial Court.

As liberation is granted,
the hundred gods swear solemn oaths.
A proclamation is made to the *Yellow Gate*,
the *Boundless Void’s Hidden Pass*.
The *Nine-Song Lament* resounds,
testing the Great Demon.
The *Six Heavens* govern the prison,
while the *Ten Thousand Ghosts* are arrayed.
Boiling cauldrons of ice,
copper pillars and fiery mountains.
Flying spears and whirling halberds,
massive stones and wheel-blades.
Endless toil in the Three Abysses,
five torments in the Night River.
By the *Vacuous Sovereign’s decree*,
all are made to ascend.
The *Northern Capital’s Cold Pool*
guards the forms and souls.
The demons are subdued and recommended,
while the ranks are liberated to the *Southern Palace*.
The dead souls undergo refinement,
transforming into immortals and becoming human.
The living body receives liberation,
enduring through all calamities, age upon age.
With the *Wheel of Calamity* turning,
they align with Heaven’s years.
Forever severed from the abysmal depths,
they escape the sufferings of the Three Realms,
refined in the *Cavernous Yang*.
The *Cavernous Yang Heaven*,
ruled by the *Heavenly Dao-Origin*,
is the formless realm of *Dharma-Walking*.

**The Thirty-Two Heavens, the Thirty-Two Emperors.**
The hidden names of the Heavens, the concealed titles of the Heavens.
The central void of the Heavens, naturally luminous scriptures.
The hidden melodies of the Heavens, the sounds of transcending the abyss.
The exalted ones descending into the abyss, the spirits responding to the abyss,
unlocking the abyssal prisons, transforming and enlightening all souls.

The Nine Abysses and Ten Extremes, the transformations of the profound darkness,
the boundless mysteries, deep beyond measure.
The Dao emerges from divine truth, universally enlightening the destitute souls.

Today, rejoice in receiving the refining,
passing through the gates of all Heavens,
praying for the extinguishment of the Three Evils,
severing the earthly roots,
ascending beyond the fiery pools,
ranked among the *Great Dao*,
the Demon King overseeing,
the Heaven of No Constraint.

The Eastern Dipper presides over litigation, the Western Dipper governs punishment,
the Northern Dipper issues fate, the Southern Dipper alters life,
the Central Dipper descends the spirits—all souls are luminous.

The Green Emperor bestows nature, the White Emperor shapes form,
the Red Emperor transmits consciousness, the Black Emperor circulates essence,
the Yellow Emperor nourishes the *Spleen* (vitality)—all ebb and flow are clear.

The Wood Prison’s Demon King, examining and torturing, disputes and analyzes.
The Fire Prison’s Demon King, burning and branding, sears and scorches.
The Metal Prison’s Demon King, beheading and crushing, axes and spears.
The Water Prison’s Demon King, freezing and congealing, ice and chill.
The Earth Prison’s Demon King, sinking and burying, pits and ramparts.
The Five Prisons’ Great Demons, the origin of all prisons.
They fly and wreak havoc, commanding the ghostly armies.
Wielding blades and bearing axes, they stir the *qi* into wind.
Slaughtering the vital souls, their cruelty knows no bounds.

The Heavens enlighten mortals—imperial edicts to the Northern *Ting*.
The ghostly ministers report their fates, their brilliance matching the omens.
The iron city crumbles, the fiery net dissolves.
Shoulders bear spears, they charge like tigers, wielding blades.
Their might becomes breath, the malevolent *qi* perishes.

The prisons transform into Dao-lands, mortals ascend to the *Way*.
Dare to interfere, and the Supreme Truth shall repel you—golden axes surge forward, mystic banners halt behind.

The corpses and ghosts attain enlightenment, all sufferings cease,
thousands upon thousands escape the prisons, millions are reborn in form.

The Demon King interrogates, the ghosts and spirits are examined,
the Three Officials and Northern *Ting* inspect the ghostly encampments.
No concealment is permitted, the golden steeds deliver the messages.

Universal proclamation to the boundless—all spirits listen in obedience.
The Three Realms and Five Emperors, their words ascend to the *Upper Clarity*.

The *Primordial Yang* and jade repository distinguish the souls of darkness.
The Great Eon reaches its peak at *Yang Nine*, the Lesser Eon at *Yin Six*.
At that time, waters surge and flames ascend,
*Nine-Six* becomes the transformation—
weapons and punishments strike, mountains and valleys tremble,
the cosmos tilts, the heavens shift, winds and mists swirl in chaos.

The *Divine Land* of *Jade Capital*, the court of the *Great Dao*,
dimly vast for countless eons, neither dark nor bright.
Ascending to the Eight Firmaments, the unmoving realm,
descending to the roots of humanity, the unchanging land.

The Kunlun Dragon Abyss, the Jade State of Yellow Court,
the Three Calamities do not afflict—all is pure and luminous.

The bright and clear souls are all aided by the Dao’s *qi*,
neither drifting nor straying, naturally free from all entanglements.
The *Primordial Beginning* of boundless compassion,
the crimson scrolls and harmonized brilliance,
the radiant jade banners, the misty purple courts.

The phoenix bears and the dragon supports,
pardoning the suffering souls—
those within the Three Officials,
whose movements span countless eons.
The cycles of creation and destruction,
the karmic burdens without end.

Bound in abyssal prisons, eons of confinement.
Falling into the blackened city,
dimly within the extreme void—
above, the colorless realm,
below, the bottomless abyss.
The winds shake the Nine Voids,
one does not know their Heavens,
without light or clarity,
penetrating the abyss and the profound darkness.

Form and shadow reach their limits,
entering and exiting death and life.
Mingling in the boundless seas,
the souls are lost, their gates sealed.
Locks and chains, hooks and ropes,
all bound by accumulated karma.

The jade decrees open with clarity,
the transformations proceed naturally.
The *Mysterious Elder* brandishes his spear,
the dragon holds the Five Scrolls,
the crimson books and purple charts,
the green banners and tiger scriptures.
The bright rays and golden dippers divide,
preserving the eons’ transformations,
making the Heavens endure forever.

The *Yin* splendor binds the nets,
the Dao’s power expands.
The Northern Mountain’s Primordial Abode,
eastward to the *Pi-Tu* slopes.
The malevolent roots spread,
the Thirty-Six Capitals.
The revolving *Jing* prisons,
the encircling Nine Abysses.
The Dipper and Big Dipper’s constellations,
wheel through the Five Fields.
The Eighty-Thousand Prisons,
all *qi* gathered into the Three Elements.
The Six Voids array their palaces,
the *qi* enters the *Great Dao*.
The Great Demons within the Mysterious,
their karma equals the Highest Truth.

The floating *qi* stirs the mists,
listening to the jade decrees.
The golden steeds deliver the messages,
rescuing the souls from the ghostly encampments.
The pure songs summon the spirits,
the orchid tones assist the True Ones.
The stagnant darkness is dissolved,
all respond to their fates and are reborn.

The Holy True One spreads the transformation,
no hidden realm escapes their hearing.

To the left, the Purple Boy whistles,
to the right, they support the august Emperor.
The Yang vitalizes, the Yin restrains,
the Primordial Essence manifests as form.
Ten thousand harmonies, a hundred thousand unities,
naturally coalesce into humankind.
The Five Destinies revolve,
taking form through borrowed reception.
Within form, there resides a spirit,
the Great Lord of eternal life.
No Heroic Prince exists,
only the White Primordial Sovereign’s spirit.

The Supreme Unity governs fate,
the Peach of Longevity and the Pavilion of Nurturing join to extend life.
Holding talismans and grasping scriptures,
they safeguard life and cultivate its roots.
The Three Officials bestow their seals,
the Mountain Emperor records their names.
According to the fateful connection of their former lives,
they are born across the Three Realms.

At the highest extreme, the *Royal Ancestor*,
the Heaven of the Realm of Form.
With cassia-hall chambers and flowery lodgings,
within the Nine Abysses, amid the minutest.
Down to the *Dinglu* realm,
the shadowy palaces of the Mysterious Abode,
divided into nine categories,
twenty-four existences,
springs and streams, mountain wastelands,
the ghostly void where spirits dwell.
Ten revolutions through the Dark Passages,
the sufferings and torments equal those of immortals.

The Dao of immortals values life,
countless degrees of liberation for beings.
Opening the Eight Gates,
the flying celestial law-wheels.
Sin and merit, prohibitions and precepts,
the fateful causes and conditions.
Universal reception and liberation,
the dead soul regains its form.
The body attains rebirth,
ascending to hear the celestial realms.
Above the celestial realms,
each has its own gate of birth.
Within are hymns of empty caverns,
sacred texts that relieve suffering,
verses that match the Highest Truth.

**First:** The *Quanqufu* Heaven of Quenching Guilt and Aiding Suffering,
the Sovereign explains the sounds of the Dark Prisons and flying through space.
The endless river roars,
its vast currents flow from nine sources.
The waves are venomous and deep,
plunging into abyssal depths.
Their sins are entangled,
seized and bound, inextricably linked.
The great pit has no bottom,
darkly concealing myriad evils.
The myriad sufferings and torments,
receive their retribution in the Northern *Dinglu* and *Fang*.
Swiftly descending from the Spring Mountains,
they are relentlessly pressed—when will their grievances end?
The ghostly officials examine their deeds,
their wails shake the cold void.
Their crimes are recorded by the Three Officials,
no escape from the net of suffering.
The flying celestial descends from the Great Primordial,
the Eight Paths open the Dark Passages.
The scriptures illuminate the endless night,
liberating souls to regain their forms.
Forever unbound in ten thousand kalpas,
they bow in gratitude to the Mysterious Benevolence.

**Second:** The *Jiuyoufu* Heaven of Radiant Light and Liberating Guilt,
the Sovereign explains the chapter of the Dark Prisons.
The Kunqiu Mountains rise majestically,
gazing upward to the Eight Devas.
Gazing far, they survey the Ten Heavens,
their four eyes scan all directions.

「The Nine Mysterious Deities, transforming countless forms,
good deeds are carved into their names—even rotten bones ascend as Immortals.
The Supreme Unity reigns above, its luminous Green Palace boundless,
the Dark Realm lies below, where foul *qi* swirls endlessly.
To the east, the Black Mountains stand—eternal prison of the ghostly court,
to the south, the Iron Dungeon, where flames burn through ten thousand kalpas.

Distant through the Nine Realms, the Dao’s grace flows like rivers.
The Pure Domain clears all impurities, where High Worthies descend in splendor.
Refining ghosts to reach the Mysterious—golden talismans seal sacred texts.
Seated on the lotus, they recognize their true nature, their spirits liberated.
Without passing through the Three Realms, they remain mortal through all ages.

The Auspicious Clouds drift, their resounding jade tones pure.
**Third:** The *Tengdufu* Sovereign of the Five Spirits’ Shadowy Cavern sings:

The Northern Abyss, deep and vast, its *qi* piercing through the Yùluó.
Four gates guard the Ghostly Pass, the Teng Mountains rise in grandeur.
Six Heavens and Nine Realms—here dwell the spirits and deities.

The *Guǐhǎi* Sea, countless in depth, its cliffs embedded with beasts.
Shadowy Caverns radiate light, secretly connecting to the Great Void.
The Primordial Sovereign, True King, subdues all demons.
Heavenly rain and sweet dew descend, lavishly bestowing celestial flowers.
Auspicious omens arrive, blessings multiply—countless souls are liberated.
Virtues and powers are fully realized, blocking all false and evil paths.
Only the Dao is sought, no other trials.
Inner Truth self-sustaining, the spirit ascends to the Three Refined.
Forever departing from the Teng and the Black Pass,
they cross into the Immortal Realm beyond all reckoning.
Above the Three Realms, within the flying void,
High Worthies’ sacred voices resonate, echoing through the Caverns’ chapters.
Reciting them a hundred times earns liberation to the Southern Palace.
A thousand recitations universally gather demonic souls.
Ten thousand recitations fulfill the Dao,
explaining all grievances, transcending the Three Realms,
and recording in the Great Mysterious.

Those who hear the sacred voice—demon kings bow in reverence,
commanding earthly deities to guard and escort,
pulling them from the netherworld’s gates.
Suffering through the Five Torments and Eight Hardships,
seven generations ascend—forever freed from ghostly officials,
their souls liberated to *Zhūlíng*,
refined anew into life.

This is called the *Wúliàng*—universal liberation without end.
There are hidden celestial texts,
shared reverence across all Heavens.
Revealing them invites fall into the Hellrealms,
dooming even seven generations of ancestors.

The Dao speaks: These two chapters are the voices of the Supreme Deities of All Heavens,
and the Hidden Worthies of the Spiritly Darkness.
All are words of the Great *Fàn*—unlike mortal speech.
They speak of the deepest obscurity,
singing of the Spiritly Caverns’ mysteries.
Thus called *Xuàn’ào*—profound and hard to fathom.
Treasure of the Highest Heavens,
hidden in the Purple Micro’s Upper Palace,
transmitted through the Mysterious Science across forty thousand kalpas.

If a True Person descends to aid the *Quánqióng* at the Gate of the Spring,
liberating souls from the deepest darkness,
saving the dying and reviving the dead,
and offers a heart of golden virtue,
then they may petition the Ten Heavens,
and the souls shall be entrusted.

The Dao speaks: The spirit depends on karma, karma reveals the spirit.
The spirit is the master of coming and going,
karma the root of life and death.
Spirit, karma, and cause are one.
Through ten thousand kalpas, they are shrouded,
unable to escape the Dark Pass.
Though the spirit does not depart,
its karma shifts externally.
The Six Paths and Four Births—demons wield authority.
Registering these trials is arduous,
karma and fate intertwined.
Essence *qi* flows and transmigrates—suddenly, one becomes mortal.
Life’s blessings hang by fate:
poverty or wealth, nobility or lowliness,
simply recorded in their origins.
Spirit-winds turn, all forms manifest,
the moment of birth and death.
All who share the same breath must unite in heart to observe fasts,
burn incense in the Six Periods,
recite the sutras ten times.
Blessings descend instantly,
dispelling all doubts.

The boundless texts, universal liberation without end.
The Dao speaks: Mortals with shallow understanding,
or Immortal Virtues yet unfulfilled,
may have their fate extinguished in the Great Darkness.
At the time of passing,
even those with shallow learning should have True Persons burn incense for them,
recite the sutras ten times,
to liberate their mortal forms as per the law.
The souls of those who observe fasts and recite sutras,
whose virtues and powers are pure,
dwell between the ghostly officials in the Three Officials’ Life-Protecting Palace,
where records of Mysterious Merit are verified.
They shall ride the Flying Dragon,
attend the *Xuān Dì* in his Hall,
refine their True Nature and cultivate the Dao,
until their single, unchanging spirit ascends
to the Eastern Honor’s Pure Void in the East,
where they freely wander, their merits increasing.
They shall then drive the White Palanquin to the North,
bow to the Supreme Polarity in the Upper Palace,
and attain High Immortality,
participating in Heaven’s governance,
commanding transformations and powers.

The Pure and Bright—clearing all suffering,
they follow the world’s path to Immortality.
The souls of the Three Vehicles,
guided by mountain and river spirits,
or those who dwell in auspicious lands,
shall ascend directly to the Southern Palace,
their rebirth granted by their merits—day by day.

The Wheel of Transmigration never falters,
and they shall become deities and immortals.

The Dao speaks: The Dao has no end or beginning,
but mortals know life and death.
Only the Great True Spirit,
one with the Dao,
is eternal and unchanging.
Karma rides the spirit,
striking the consciousness and extinguishing its nature,
binding it to form—form identical to matter.
Thus, there is an end.

The end is the limit of form,
the limit of *qi*.
The spirit never ends.
Mortals are deluded by falsehood,
believing in life and death.
Clinging to karma and consciousness,
they fall into the Hellrealms,
self-deceived and shrouded,
ghostly officials seizing their records.
Forever sealed in the Dark Dungeon,
through endless darkness, they never see the Radiant Circle.

The Primordial moves in pity,
sacred texts shine brightly,
jade scrolls radiate light—
ugly forms are liberated,
day by day ascending,
pure *qi* nourishing their essence,
spirits awakened—
as they approach refinement,
all must observe fasts and recite sutras.

Fasts and sutra recitations—
their merits are profound.
They ascend to the Nine Heavens,
protecting and sustaining emperors.
They descend into the Spiritly Paths,
liberating guilty souls.
Life and death depend on them—
their blessings are boundless.
Thus called *Wúliàng*—universal liberation for Heaven and mortals.

The Dao speaks: All who possess this sutra,
capable of easing the suffering of souls through kalpas,
of boundless Spiritly Paths,
shall perform these merits.
On the day of liberation,
they vow to observe fasts and burn incense,
reciting the sutras ten times—
all Heavens shall record their names,
ten thousand spirits guard them,
and they shall be ranked among the True Persons,
worthy to serve as ministers beneath the Golden Gates of the Holy Sovereign.

All Heavens meticulously record mortals’ merits and demerits,
not missing even a hair’s breadth.
Demon kings in Heaven shall also recommend their souls—
those who attain the Dao must deeply understand these sacred words.

**Jiàngdòng Miàobì** (絳洞妙弼), **Qiūmù Yùnfēi** (丘目蕴飛).
**Dìngmáng Hùnzhú** (定芒混逐), **Kūnqí Jiànméng** (坤齐建蒙).

**Jǐdàn Yuèzhī** (戟旦悅支), **Xiāndū Xiázhōu** (仙都霞周).

Within the **Bāzì Xuānlǎo Nèimíng** (八字玄老內名).

The Dao speaks: These hidden words of the Great Brahman in the Heavens,
the boundless sounds.
The ancient scriptures were inscribed on the **Tàixuān Běiquē Wǔlíng Chánglóu** (太玄北闕五靈長樓),
to open the **Jìu Tàishān** (九泰山) and the **Jiǔyōu** (九幽),
to arrange the **Lúohēng Quānlù** (羅酆泉曲),
to liberate the suffering souls trapped in **Míngguān Lěikǔ** (冥關累苦),
bound to the **Sānguān** (三官), unable to enlighten themselves,
wandering the **Xuánkōng** (玄空).

The **Dānshū** (丹書) is raised to rescue the fallen.
In ancient times, the **Tiānzhēn Huángrén** (天真皇人) visited the **Yèguāng Yuánhòu** (夜光元后),
imitating the scriptures, each character broad and long—
one *zhàng* (丈) in width, with eight angles and drooping beams,
like a seal’s impression, the **Jiǔliù Zhīhuì** (九六之會) as the true sound.
Those who know this sound and can fast and recite it,
all Heavens send **Fēitiān Shénwáng** (飛天神王),
descending to observe their bodies,
recording their merits and efforts,
reporting to the Heavens and the **Wànshén** (萬神),
who gather in courtly homage,
while the **Dìqí** (地祇) attend at the gates.
The **Dàmó Wáng** (大勳魔王) recommends them to the **Shàngzhēn** (上真).
When the Dao is complete, they roam the **Sānjiè** (三界),
ascending to the **Jīnmén** (金門).

This sound cleaves all obstacles,
dispels all calamities,
liberates all beings,
fulfills all desires—
the natural sound of **Tiānzhēn** (天真).
Thus, reciting it brings release from **Dìyù** (地獄),
long nights turned to dawn,
the **Yōutáng Yīnjiè** (幽牢陰界) free from suffering,
ascending to life.
Mortals find peace,
ghosts escape torment,
the **Bǐgōng** (碧宮) is covered with mist,
the **Dānlíng** (丹陵) glows with light,
calming the seas and mountains,
blessing all living beings,
Heaven bestows **Cǎiyào** (彩耀),
Earth surges with **Yùyīng** (玉英).
The **Mínghuì** (冥慧) is revealed,
the **Dàliàng Xuānxuān** (大量玄玄) is profound.

Thus ends the *Língbǎo Wúliàng Dùrén Shàngpǐn Miàojīng* (靈寶無量度人上品妙經), the **57th scroll**.
The **58th scroll** follows.

「The *Returning Life and Reviving the Dead* Chapter

The **Dao** speaks: In days of old, within the **Zǐkōng Yàojǐng Tiān** (紫空耀景天), the **Xuánfēng** (玄风) pierced through with the **Mìhǎo** (妙行) of the **Dàlíng Miàotǔ** (大灵妙土), where the **Yuánshǐ** (元始) **Tianzūn** (天尊) taught the **Wúliàng Huíshēng Qǐsǐ** (无量度人回生起死) **Dàshàngpǐn** (上品) **Miàojīng** (妙经).

The **Yuánshǐ Tianzūn** (元始天尊), when delivering this **sutra**, circled ten times through the **Ten Transgressions** (十过), summoning the **Ten Directions** (十方), before taking his seat.

The **Tiānzhēn Dàshén** (天真大神), the **Shàngshèng Gāozūn** (上圣高尊), the **Mìoxíng Zhēnrén** (妙行真人), with their **Wúyàng** (无鞅) retinues, rode upon the wind and arrived.

Their **Línghuī** (灵辉) radiance illuminated the void,
with **Qióngchē Yùyú** (琼车玉舆) and **Fúhuá Chénbì** (扶华宸盖),
four **Yúnjīng** (云旌) banners unfurled,
**Ruìǎi** (瑞霭) mists interwoven,
eight **Míluó** (弥罗) coils of light,
for five days and five nights,
all **tians** (天) and **dis** (地),
the interplay of **yīn** (阴) and **yáng** (阳) forces,
all ceased their motion at once.
The **Xuán Gāng** (玄纲) was shaken with solemnity,
the seas and mountains grew clear,
all things flourished in harmony,
and life was universally pacified.
In one land, earth, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees
all became **Níngxiān** (凝鲜) of the highest grade,
with no more decay or destruction—
the soil itself bore strange treasures,
shimmering and resplendent.

The **Zhēnshén** (众真) gathered around him,
as the **Yuánshǐ Tianzūn** (元始天尊) sat upon his **Xuánzuò Kòngfú Wànqì Yùnhuá Bǎozuò** (玄坐空浮万气云华宝座).

After one recitation of the **sutra**,
the **Dàshèng** (大圣) of all **tians** (天) simultaneously praised its virtue.
At that moment, all men and women of the land
no longer suffered calamities or untimely deaths.

After two recitations,
all **zāibìng** (灾病, afflictions and illnesses) were dispelled.

After three recitations,
the **Wēng’ài** (翁艾, aged and decrepit) returned to infancy.

After four recitations,
those at death’s door were revived,
their **shòu** (寿, lifespan) extended eternally.

After five recitations,
those condemned to the **lúnzhuǎn** (轮转, cycles of rebirth) were granted liberation.

After six recitations,
those undergoing **Chénshī Jiǔliàn** (沈尸九炼, nine trials of the corpse), their **yīnzhì** (阴质, vital essence of the dead) revived.

After seven recitations,
they were transformed by the **Tàixuán** (太玄, Great Mysterious),
their **gūgǔ** (枯骨, dried bones) regaining form.

After eight recitations,
all beings in the world awakened to clarity,
their **dàoxìng** (道性, inherent Dao-nature) restored to its original purity,
holding **virtue/power** (德) in high esteem and **zhèng** (正, rectitude) as precious,
severing all **jiānxié** (奸邪, deceit and malice).

After nine recitations,
those who sought the **Dao** attained it,
those who sought **xiān** (仙, immortality) became **xiān**.

After ten recitations,
the **miàoqì** (妙气, wondrous qi) was complete,
mixing with **shénmíng** (神明, divine luminosity).
At that time, all men and women of the land
tilted their hearts in reverence,
all receiving protection and deliverance,
universally attaining longevity.

The **Dao** speaks: When the **Yuánshǐ Tianzūn** (元始天尊) delivered the **sutra** once,
the **Wújié Wúliàng** (无极无量) **Dàshén** (大神) of the **East—Huíshēng** (回生, Reviving Life)—
with his **Wúyàng** retinue, floated through the void and arrived.

When delivered twice,
the **Wújié Wúliàng** **Míngxìng** (明性, Illuminating Nature) **Dàshén** of the **South**
with his **Wúyàng** retinue, floated through the void and arrived.

When delivered thrice,
the **Wújié Wúliàng** **Jiégài** (结气, Binding Vital Essence) **Dàshén** of the **West**
with his **Wúyàng** retinue, floated through the void and arrived.

When delivered four times,
the **Wújié Wúliàng** **Kāihuì** (开慧, Opening Wisdom) **Dàshén** of the **North**
with his **Wúyàng** retinue, floated through the void and arrived.

When delivered five times,
the **Wújié Wúliàng** **Shēnghún** (生魂, Reviving Spirit) **Dàshén** of the **East-North**
with his **Wúyàng** retinue, floated through the void and arrived.

When delivered six times,
the **Wújié Wúliàng** **Yùxíng** (育形, Nurturing Form) **Dàshén** of the **East-South**
with his **Wúyàng** retinue, floated through the void and arrived.

When delivered seven times,
the **Wújié Wúliàng** **Bǎomìng** (保命, Preserving Life) **Dàshén** of the **West-South**
with his **Wúyàng** retinue, floated through the void and arrived.

When delivered eight times,
the **Wújié Wúliàng** **Yányuán** (延年, Extending Years) **Dàshén** of the **West-North**
with his **Wúyàng** retinue, floated through the void and arrived.

When delivered nine times,
the **Wújié Wúliàng** **Huíshēng** (回生, Returning Life) **Dàshén** of the **Upper Realm**
with his **Wúyàng** retinue, floated through the void and arrived.

When delivered ten times,
the **Wújié Wúliàng** **Qǐsǐ** (起死, Reviving the Dead) **Dàshén** of the **Lower Realm**
with his **Wúyàng** retinue, floated through the void and arrived.

After ten recitations, the **Wújié Tiānzhēn Dàshén** (无极天真大神) of the **Ten Directions** all arrived together,
and all men and women of the land
tilted their hearts in homage.

All who had fallen into **lúnhuà Chénmíng Shīguò** (沦化沈冥尸过, the depths of transmigration and death),
were covered by the **Dao**’s grace,
their **shēngqì** (生气, life-giving qi) entering their bodies,
and though dead, their forms returned.

Those who came were like mountains rising from clouds,
filling all four directions, their **Wúyàng** retinues
so vast that half the land was submerged—
an unstoppable tide.

Thus, the **Yuánshǐ** (元始) opened the **Qībǎo Shān** (七宝山, Seven Treasures Mountain),
unveiled the **Wúbiān Mù** (无边目, Boundless Vision),
adjusting robes and gathering his attendants,
he focused his gaze and contemplated the distant,
then addressed the **Zhōngzhēn** (众真):

*"All beings are lost in delusion,
unaware of the **Xuánzhēn** (玄真, Mysterious Reality).
Once they leave the womb,
their passions follow the transformations of **huà** (化, transmigration).
By their **yuánlèi** (缘类, karmic affinities),
they generate **yèyīn** (业因, karmic causes),
and these **yèlěi** (业累, karmic accumulations) corrupt their nature,
enslaved by perception, they become foolish.
Strife of gain and loss assails them,
passions and desires sway their minds—
from childhood, they reach maturity,
and in the blink of an eye,
they grow old.
Their **jiāoláo** (焦牢, vital essence) is exhausted,
their **shēngqì** (生气) spent,
until they perish in decay.

Yet they do not know
that the **Dao** is the **virtue/power** (生德) of life,
and life is the root of the **Dao**.
If one’s heart abides in the **Dao**,
it remains with life forever.
All things have birth and death,
but the **Dao** has neither.
If one preserves the **Dao** in form,
the **shēngqì** (生气) will naturally endure.
When the body’s count is exhausted,
the **Dao** can revive it again.
With life and **Dao** thus established,
they do not follow **huà** (化, transmigration),
preserving form without decay,
enduring forever in unbroken continuity,
returning life and transcending death—
a feat the **Shàngzhēn** (上真) hold in highest veneration.

Now, for all of you,
I reveal this **miàoběn** (妙本, wondrous source),
universally delivering the boundless.

At that time, the **Yuánshǐ** (元始) raised his **Huáfú** (华拂, divine banner),
and **Jǐngwù** (景雾, luminous mists) billowed in all four directions,
like clouds and smoke,
floating in the void—
nine *zhàng* (丈) above the earth.

The **Yuánshǐ** (元始) gathered all,
the **Tiānzhēn Dàshén** (天真大神),
the **Shàngshèng Gāozūn** (上圣高尊),
the **Mìoxíng Zhēnrén** (妙行真人),
and the **Wújié Zhēnshén** (无极至真大神) of the **Ten Directions**,
all their **Wúyàng** retinues,
now all stood within the **Jǐngwù** (景雾).

The earth returned to its level state,
no longer tilted or sunken.

The **Yuánshǐ** (元始) then, upon the **Jǐngwù** (景雾),
completed his delivery of the **sutra**.
The **Zhōngzhēn** (众真) bore witness to its transmission,
and bestowed it upon me.
At that moment, my joy was indescribable.

The **fǎshì** (法事, ritual matters) were roughly understood,
the **tians** (天) returned to their places,
and in an instant,
all traces of sound vanished into silence.

At that time, all **tiānrén** (天人, heavenly and mortal beings)
who encountered this **jīngfǎ** (经法, sutra-teaching)
universally received deliverance,
eternally nurturing the root of life,
with none falling into ruin.
All lands turned in reverence,
all walked in **dàoxīn** (道心, Dao-heart).

They neither competed nor disturbed,
neither toiled nor labored,
neither schemed nor desired,
neither coveted nor grew angry,
neither schemed nor pondered.

Their words were without embellishment,
their mouths without grievance,
all shared the same **cí’ài** (慈爱, compassionate love),
and though of different **gǔ** (骨, essences),
they became kin.

The land was secure, its people prosperous,
rejoicing in eternal peace.
The **sutra** began its teachings,
and the land was governed by the **Dao**.」

The **Dao** speaks: With sincere devotion and reverence in worship, all attain the power to save the world.

The **Dao**’s words: What the **Yuánshǐ Tiānzūn** (元始天尊, Primordial Celestial Venerable) spoke within the **sutra**—all are the inner names of the **zhūtiān Dàdì** (诸天上帝, celestial sovereigns)—hidden, resonant sounds. They are also the **zhēnwáng** (真王, True Sovereign’s) secret names for reviving the dead and restoring life, the hidden names of the hundred spirits. These are not the common words of the world.

The **shàngshèng** (上圣, Supreme Sage), having already become a **zhēnrén** (真人, True Person), mastering the **Xuán** (玄, Mysterious) and probing the subtle, can fully comprehend its chapters.

When recited ten times, the celestial beings gather **qi**, all **dào** (道, Ways) align in truth, spiritual transformations unfold, and all receive the **Xuán**’s grace. The **shēngjīn** (生津, life-giving essence) eternally flows, the **pò** (魄, vital force) is summoned, the **hún** (魂, soul) collected. The decayed and lifeless are reborn, returning to their **shīxíng** (尸形, corporeal form), revived and restored to life—even bones become flesh.

For those of **zhìxué** (至学, supreme learning), reciting it ten times summons the **wǔdì** (五帝, Five Emperors’) sacred spirits, the **sān yuán** (三元, Three Primordials) decree truth, and the **língzhēn** (灵真, numinous truths) descend in harmony. The **sǐdào** (死道, path of death) collapses, and those at death’s door are rescued, returning from the brink of extinction.

This is so because the scholar’s **dàoqì** (道气, Dao-qi) is not yet pure, their body not yet attuned to truth. Though they command the **wànshén** (万神, myriad spirits) and their **dé** (德, virtue/power) is not yet complete, they can yet turn the wheel of fate, unlock the **shēngjīn**, and merely revive the dead—without further transformation.

To recite this chapter lightly invites calamity upon oneself.

To venerate and honor the **sutra** brings prosperity to one’s gates, flourishing through generations. Bound to virtuous causes, one escapes all calamities, with divine guardians protecting the door.

This **sutra** is supreme and wondrous, unmatched in the **Yùjīng** (玉京, Jade Capital). It saves innumerable beings and is the foundation of the **shēngdào** (生道, Way of Life).

Its grandeur is vast and boundless; its **dé** (德, virtue/power) is immeasurable.

The **Dao** speaks: For those who recite this **sutra** ten times, all celestial beings gather, the **shēngdào** (Way of Life) is illuminated, and rebirth is perfected. Countless generations of ancestors, their suffering souls released, all receive salvation, ascending to the **Zhūgōng** (朱宫, Vermilion Palace). After nine years of transformation, they are reborn, becoming **zhēnxiān** (真仙, True Immortals).

Those who earnestly study this **sutra**, their merits fulfilled and virtue complete, shall ascend in body, soaring to the **Jīnquè** (金阙, Golden Gate) and feasting in the **Yùjīng**.

Scholars of the highest learning, practicing and reciting this **sutra**, shall immediately be saved and ascend to the **Nángōng** (南宫, Southern Palace).

Mortals who recite it shall prolong their years, enduring without end. Even as their **yùnshù** (运数, fateful allotment) reaches its limit, they shall attain the **jiěhuà** (解化, Way of Liberation and Transformation). Their divine essence shall not perish, ever preserved in splendor, wandering freely through the **shí tiān** (十天, Ten Heavens).

This **sutra** is subtle and wondrous, saving all without end. All heavenly and mortal beings rejoice in its blessings. Infinite blessings bestow life and death with grace.

It is the treasure of the **shàngtiān** (上天, Highest Heaven), not to be passed down to the world below. Only the **zhìshì** (至士, supreme scholars), bearing gold and jewels with sincere hearts, may pledge allegiance to the **Shénxiāo** (神霄, Divine Exaltation) and transmit it. To leak or neglect it lightly invites retribution upon nine generations, binding one to eternal service in the **guǐguān** (鬼官, spectral bureaucracy).

The **sutra** is attended by the **wǔdì** (五帝, Five Emperors), each with twenty-four **yùtóng yùnǚ** (玉童玉女, Jade Boys and Girls), guarding the sacred scriptures and protecting those who receive the **sutra**.

The **Dao** speaks: In the first month, observe a long fast and recite this **sutra** to avert the calamity of decline, decay, death, and the **jímèi** (极会, ultimate gathering of misfortune), ensuring survival.

In the seventh month, observe a long fast and recite this **sutra** to preserve **shénqì** (神气, divine qi), dispelling disasters and misfortunes. One’s name shall be inscribed on the **qīngshù** (青箓, Blue Talisman), and eternal life shall be granted.

In the tenth month, observe a long fast and recite this **sutra** to protect all under heaven, saving the people and creatures. **Rénshòu** (仁寿, benevolent longevity) shall be attained, aligning with Heaven without deviation. Through generations, prosperity shall flourish, and the sovereign shall be revered. The nation’s fate shall be secure, and the **wànjié** (万劫, ten thousand kalpas) shall be one of eternal peace.

On the **bājié** (八节, Eight Festivals), recite this **sutra** to harmonize **zàohuà** (造化, creation and transformation). The **jīnmù** (金木, Metal and Wood) shall align, **shénqì** (divine qi) shall unite, nurturing the **huánglíng** (皇灵, sovereign spirit). The withered shall revive, and through its refining power, one shall attain **xiānzhēn** (仙真, Immortal Truth).

On one’s **běnmìng** (本命, birth-day), recite this **sutra** to preserve **qīngzhēn** (清贞, purity and integrity), renewing body and essence daily. Calamities shall vanish, and one shall long enjoy blessings. The **tiāncháo** (天曹, Heavenly Bureau) shall record virtues, the **dìshì** (地司, Earthly Officials) shall erase sins, and seven generations shall rejoice. One’s name shall be inscribed on the **sān tiān** (三天, Three Heavens), and with merits fulfilled and virtue complete, one shall ascend to **Shàngqīng** (上清, High Purity).

The **Dao** speaks: On days of practice, one must bathe in fragrant waters, fast in purity, enter the chamber facing east, and strike the teeth **sānshíèr tōng** (三十二通, thirty-two times) to ascend to the **sānshíèr tiān** (三十二天, Thirty-two Heavens). With the heart, bow thirty-two times.

Close the eyes and meditate silently, imagining oneself seated within the **qīnghuángbái** (青黄白, Azure, Yellow, and White) clouds. Within and without, all is profound darkness, where the **qīnglóng** (青龙, Azure Dragon), **báihǔ** (白虎, White Tiger), **zhūquè** (朱雀, Vermilion Bird), **Xuánwǔ** (玄武, Dark Warrior), **shīzǐ** (狮子, Lion), and **báihè** (白鹤, White Crane) array themselves on either side. The sun and moon illuminate, their radiance filling the chamber. The **huíshēng qǐsǐ** (回生起死, revival of life and resurrection of the dead) **Xuánhuà Dàshén** (玄化大神, Great Divine Transformation) stand guard before and behind, their **xiàngshēng yuánxiàng** (项生圆象, circular halos) casting light in all ten directions—thus, clearly manifest.

The secret incantation:

Thirty-two Heavens, thirty-two Emperors.
The heavens conceal their names, the heavens conceal their titles.
The central void resonates naturally with sacred patterns,
The heavens conceal their melodies—the sounds that summon life.
The august ones who establish fate, the gods who respond to transformation.
Altering corpse-demons, freeing from the womb to become spirits.
Yang warmth and yin unity, descending qi to Upper Clarity.
Boundless mysteries, too profound to fathom.
Manifesting divine truths, universally measuring gods and humans.

Today, rejoicing in receiving measure,
Reviving the dead, restoring life,
Passing through the heavenly gates,
Requesting the annihilation of the Three Evils,
Severing earthly roots,
Flying beyond the Five Torments,
Commanding life in the Great Mystic.

The Demon Kings oversee and elevate,
No longer bound by the gates of birth.
The Eastern Star conveys the soul,
The Western Star divines the spirit,
The Northern Star determines fate,
The Southern Star calculates years,
The Central Star governs fortune,
The Great Star preserves life,
Guarding the Three Enclaves,
Overseeing all spirits.

The Green Emperor knows awareness,
The White Emperor stirs ability,
The Red Emperor moves insight,
The Black Emperor refines essence,
The Yellow Emperor receives form,
Ten thousand gods reside within the body.

The Azure Sky Demon King revives the dead and continues the severed.
The Vermilion Sky Demon King restores *qi* and revives the blood.
The White Sky Demon King draws breath like a cord.
The Black Sky Demon King masters the Six Arts and attunes the spirit.
The Yellow Sky Demon King commands ghosts and nurtures the infant.

The Five Emperors, Great Demons, are the ancestral lords of ten thousand gods.
With flying drums and banners, they command the ghostly legions.
With banners and drums, they roam the boundless void.
They proclaim their splendor, matching Heaven’s merit,
Ascending to guide mortals, sternly overseeing the Northern Tartarus.

The Celestial Capital receives its mandate,
Sweeping away all ill omens.
The Eight Wonders revive the dead,
Turning withered decay into fragrant vitality.
Divine dragons march in procession, true officials display their might.
Heavenly attendants summon the soul, the Great Marshal raises the corpse.
A hundred gods return in their glory, riding jade carriages and golden palanquins.
The fate of death is severed, ghosts locked in the Northern Mountain.
Fires are hurled ten thousand *li*, bells toll through the Eight Directions.
Dare any interfere? They shall be crushed by the Celestial Worthies.
With golden axes they strike before them, the Great Queen of the West enforces judgment.
They slaughter and cleave the ghostly host—wind and fire relentless.
Thousands beheaded, ten thousands dismembered.
No demon dares transgress, no ghost escapes their precision.

The Three Officials of the Northern Tartarus inspect the ghostly encampments,
Tolerating no concealment, presenting them at the Golden Horse Inn.
A universal proclamation is made, all gods heed it.
The Five Emperors of the Three Realms speak to the Highest Clarity.
The boundless void lies silent, the cosmic womb in tranquil embrace.
Vast and countless, life and transformation merge in primordial chaos.
No fixed hue without, no fixed depth within.
Wind courses through the Six Voids, golden elixir floats in Heaven.
Above Heaven and below, no shadow, no darkness, no form, no limit.
The Great Void, the Brahman, boundless and luminous.
Within lies the utmost essence, self-aware and self-generated.
Awareness yet no awareness, clarity yet no clarity.
Not bound by awareness or clarity, the Dao perfects the spirit.
When the spirit arrives, life emerges; when it departs, death follows.
Life is the waning of the embryo, death the falling of the root.
When *qi* connects, the spirit is born; when *qi* falters, the spirit fades.
Blood congeals, bones wither—yet the corpse stands upright.
Nine pests infest as specters, gnawing at the brain and marrow.
The spirit is hidden in the *dantian*, the Dao fixed by Heaven.
If the spirit does not leave the body, the dead may be restored to life.
You possess the Dao’s power—reviving even withered bones.
In death’s silence, the soul wanders, the spirit breathes faintly.
Like the *kalpa* yet to unfold, dim and still.
When the Crimson Clarity unveils its diagram, the course unfolds naturally.
The Primordial Origin settles, unfolding the Five Scriptures.
The Crimson Text, Jade Characters, the Eight Wonders in Dragon Script.
Preserving the cosmic cycle, ensuring Heaven’s endurance.
The Brahman’s *qi* spreads like the *mula* tree, ten thousand patterns unfold.
The Primordial Thread flows, through the Thirty-Two Heavens.
Revolving the Three Realms, circling the Ten Directions.
Turning the Celestial Abode, reviving the dead.
Returning to the Five Constants, the Thirty-Five Divisions.
Gathering the Primordial *qi*, the Eight Scenes merge in obscurity.
*Qi* enters the Profound Profound, the Supreme Sovereign within.
The Highest Sovereign, the Transcendent, drifts through the Divine Mists.
Reciting the Cavernous Chapters, the Golden Worthies radiant.
Their voices echo through the cloudy encampments, jade tones gathering *qi*.
Winds swirl, smoke gathers—purple voids bloom with splendor.
Assisting myriad immortals, in perfect harmony, life naturally obtained,
Life and spirit intertwined—Great Lord of Eternal Life.
Without the Left Minister of Merit, the White Element as Right Spirit.
The Supreme One encompasses cognition, the Lord of Fate dispenses souls.
The *peng* and *kang* *qi* is primordial, merging with the Mother’s essence.
Holding talismans and scriptures, pursuing the dead to restore life.
Ascending to the Highest Clarity, entering the Radiant Hall.
Within the Eight Obscurities, the minutest depths.
Descending to govern the mortal form, the *dantian* and Vermilion Palace.
Regulating the Five *qi*, blending with the hundred gods.
Ten revolutions restore the spirit, purifying form and essence.
The Three-in-One returns to the True, ten thousand *qi* become immortals.
The Dao of the Immortal values life, boundless in its salvation.
Opening the Eight Gates, the Flying Heavenly Wheel.
Sin and virtue, prohibitions and karmic ties,
All receive the revelation—souls reborn, bodies revived.
The body obtains life, ascending to hear the celestial realms.
Above the celestial realms, each has its gate of birth.
Within lies the hollow song of the *Returning Souls Chapter*.
Words addressed to the Highest Worthies.

**First Chapter: The Desire Realm’s Flying Void Revival Hymn**
Within the Great Void, no distinction of inner or outer.
A single spark generates light, transforming this Heaven and Earth.
How did Heaven and Earth arise? From the luminous spark, the spirit.
The spirit established, *qi* formed—yet *qi* itself is formless.
Formless and nameless, it generates the Three Purities.
The myriad classes of *Yin* and *Yang* thereby obtain life.
To preserve this life is to vanish without trace.
Heaven’s Dao values life; the ghostly Dao demands an end.
When *qi* is exhausted, the spirit does not perish.
The spirit knows no end, harmonized by Heaven’s balance.
Naturally reviving, decay does not prevail.
The dead’s spirit departs—why not retain it?
The spirit may be retained; life and death both transcended.
The corpse lies still—yet essence suddenly revealed.
Seeing nothing to see, consorting with the True.
Bones hold the Profound Void; *qi* enters like wind.
Suddenly, the spirit arrives—laughter and form restored.
What is this Dao? Merging intent with the Profound.
The Profound communicates through intent—effortless, natural.
Divine texts restore the jade calculations,
Withered corpses regain their five senses.
I recite the Highest Clarity’s Chapters,
Subduing demons at the Hall of the Red Maw.
Holding the contract, I inform the Lord of Fate,
From the depths of darkness, life is reborn.

**Second Chapter: The Form Realm’s Revival and Eternal Life Hymn**
At the Crimson Gate of the Divine Mists, purple vapors swirl around the sun.
Within stands a jade-robed figure, playing a flute atop a white lotus.
Bowing to the Jade Clarity King, he registers the myriad immortals.
With register in hand, he summons the Nine Souls,
Holding the tally, opening the Eight Gates.
When fate is exhausted, he calls upon the Imperial Sovereign,
Waving his jewel-staff to restore the spirit.
Life prolonged with the Yellow Thread, the Crimson Text radiant.
The Seven Souls enter the *dantian*, the Jade Maiden opens the Crystal Hall.
Feathered canopies shelter the Most High, the Azure Dragon dispatches the Crowing Bird.
White clouds return to the Vermilion Palace, luminous light dances with the embryonic immortal.
The Demon of Fate is sealed in the Cold Pool, the Wicked Slain at the Strange Spring.
Forms of impermanence are extinguished, reverently reciting the *Great Possession Chapter*.
A hundred gods guard the Great Mystic, pearls cascading.

Laughing through the vast *kālpa*’s span,

The Nine Orifices harmonized.

The *Extreme Yang* seems nonexistent,
Yet harmony awakens—*Dao*’s mystery revealed.

「此三界之上，飞空之中，真王歌音，音参洞章。」
Above the Three Realms, within the flying void,
The Sovereign’s Song resounds—
Its melody harmonizes with the *Taoist Canon*.

Recite it a hundred times,
And the *Dao*’s passage is named in *Nán Gōng*.

Ascend to the Highest Void,

And rank among the Celestial Masters.

「有闻灵音，回生返形，勑制地祇，侍卫送迎，拔出地户，五苦八难，七祖升迁，永离鬼官，魂度朱陵，受炼更生。」
Hearing the Sacred Sound,
Life returns, the form restored.
The *Earthly Deities* are commanded,
Guards attend with reverent escort.
The *Hellish Gates* are torn asunder,
Five *Sufferings* and Eight *Hardships* dispelled.
The Seven *Ancestors* ascend in glory,
Forever freed from the *Ghostly Bureaus*,
Souls pass through *Zhūlíng*,
Refined anew in eternal life.

This is called the *Boundless Dharma*,
Universal salvation without end.

「有秘上天文，诸天共所崇。」

Summoning the *Living True*,
Returning the corpse to spirit,
The Nine *Palaces* radiate luminous glory,
The Three *Bureaus* condense the jade nectar.
The body clad in violet splendor,
Face bathed in crimson light,
Ascending beyond the *Mystic Capital*.

「皆是大梵之言，非世上常辞。」
All are the words of the *Great Fàn*,
Not the common speech of mortal men.

「言无韵丽，曲无华宛。」
Speech without melodious grace,
Tune without ornate adornment.

「故谓玄奥，难可寻详。」
Thus called the *profound mysteries*,
Hard to trace or fully comprehend.

「上天所宝，秘於神霄玉清上宫东华宝室，依玄科应运下传。」
Treasured by the Highest Heaven,
Hidden in the *Yùqīng*’s Celestial Palace—**East Hua’s Gem Chamber**—
Transmitted below by *Dao*’s law when fate aligns.

「若有至人赍金宝质心，依旧格告盟十天，然后而付焉。」
Should a *Perfect Adept* bring a heart of golden purity,
And pledge in ancient form to the Ten *Heavens*,
Then the secrets shall be entrusted.

「道言：夫天地运度，亦有否终，日月五星，亦有亏盈，至圣神人，亦有休否，未学之夫，亦有疾伤。」
The *Dao* says: Even the *Heavens* and Earth,
With their cycles of *fate and passage*,
Have moments of cessation and decline.
Sun and moon, the Five *Stars*,
Also wax and wane in power.
The *Most Sage* of *Divine Humans*,
Even they have periods of repose or decline.
The unlearned, too, suffer sickness and harm.

「凡有此灾，皆可回还生气，起济穷绝，同气皆当齐心修斋，六时行香，十遍转经，福德立降，消诸不详。」
For all who face such calamity,
Life’s *qi* may be restored,
The *desperate* saved from ruin.
All who share this breath must unite in heart,
Practicing *fasting* and *ritual purity*,
Offering incense at the Six *Times*,
Reciting the *Sutra* tenfold.
*Merit and Virtue* descend swiftly,
Dissolving all ill omens.

「无量之文，普度无穷。」
The *Boundless Texts*,
Universal salvation without limit.

「道言：夫末学道浅，或仙品未充，运应灭度，身经太阴。」
The *Dao* says: The *unlearned* with shallow understanding,
Or those whose *Daoist rank* is yet unripe,
When fate decrees annihilation,
Their bodies pass through *Tài Yīn*’s domain.

「临过之时，同学至人为其行香，诵经十过，以度尸形如法，则生神赴身，宫室开明，死户闭塞，秽胞荡清，天机玄省，南昌上宫，返其魂神，随其学功，计日而得更生。」
At the moment of crossing,
Let *Perfect Adepts* of shared learning
Offer incense in their stead,
Recite the *Sutra* ten times,
And guide the corpse by *Dao*’s law.
Then the *Living Spirit* returns to the body,
Palaces brighten, gates of death sealed.
The *filthy womb* is cleansed,
Heaven’s *mechanism* veiled in mystery.
The *Nán Chāng*’s High Palace
Restores their *soul and spirit*,
Following their *Daoist cultivation*,
And grants rebirth in counted days.

「转轮不惑，便得神仙。」
The *Wheel of Rebirth* does not turn,
And *Divine Immortality* is swiftly attained.

「道言：夫回生起死，灵宝所重，神霄禁书。」
The *Dao* says: To restore life and raise the dead,
The *Sacred Treasure* holds supreme weight—
A *forbidden text* of the *Divine Dao*.

「大至天地，细逮人物，皆有生死增减益算之道。」
From the grandest—*Heavens* and Earth—
To the minutest—*humans* and *beings*,
All have the *Dao* of life and death,
Of growth, decline, and fate’s reckoning.

「天地运终，己亥交气，星宿错度，日月失昏，躔次推移，四时失度，阴阳不调，金胜火伏，国境有灾，兵盗时作，太一行宫，疫毒流行，兆民死伤，人运临克，师友命过，真谱断宗。」
When *Heavens* and Earth’s cycles conclude,
And *Jǐhài*’s *qi* exchanges,
*Stars* and *constellations* stray from their paths,
Sun and moon lose their eclipses,
*Lunar stations* shift disorderly,
The Four *Seasons* fall out of measure,
*Yīn* and *Yáng* unbalanced—
Metal triumphs, Fire subdued—
Then calamities plague the realm,
Bandits and wars rise in their time.
The *Tài Yī*’s *Traveling Palace*,
Plagues and poisons spread abroad,
Countless folk perish in their beds,
Human fate nears its *Great Crisis*,
*Master* and *friend* meet untimely ends,
The *True Dao*’s lineage severed.

「亦当修斋，行香诵经、回生以成吉，起死以破凶，福应不沦，生道咸赖。」
Yet one must still practice *fasting*,
Offer incense, recite the *Sutra*,
To restore life and bring auspicious fortune,
Raise the dead and dispel malevolence.
*Merit* descends without fail,
All rely on the *Dao* of rebirth.

「切於己形，施於天下，灵秘至微，下学殊昧。」
Personal salvation for one’s own form,
Universal benevolence for all beneath the *Heavens*.
The *Sacred Secrets* are most subtle,
Yet the *unlearned* grasp them differently.

「夫斋戒诵经，功德甚重。」
Indeed, *fasting* and *ritual purity*,
Reciting the *Sutra*—
Their *merit* is most profound.

「上消天灾。」
Above all, it dispels celestial calamities.

「保镇帝王。」
And safeguards the *Imperial Sovereigns*.

The *Sacred Secrets* descend to dispel poisonous harm,
To deliver all beneath the *Heavens*.
Life and death alike find their reliance,
Their *merit* is boundless—*universal salvation* for *Heavens* and mortals.

The *Way* declares:
All who possess this *Sutra*,
Can act on behalf of *Heavens*, *Earth*, the *Imperial Sovereign*, and the myriad people,
Performing such *merit*—
On days of calamity, with a sincere heart,
Practice *fasting*, burn incense,
Recite the *Sutra* ten times.
All the *Celestial Beings* record their names,
Ten thousand *Spirits* attend as guardians.
The *Exalted Ones* of the Right Path shall
Surely become *Holy Ministers* of the *Golden Gate*.

The *Celestial Beings* record all deeds—
Not a hair’s breadth is lost.
Even the *Magical Kings* of the *Heavens* shall
Recommend your virtue.
Those who attain the *Way* shall
Pierce the depths of these *Sacred Words*.

The *Great Brahman*’s hidden speech,
The *Sound of Infinite Measure*—
Composed by the *Dao Lord*,
The *Original Beginning’s Sacred Scripture*,
The *Jade Scroll of Qi-Returning Harmony*.

**The Eight *Heavens* of the East**
Bestow *Imperial Tokens* of treasure,
Bestow *Celestial Merit* of vast renown.
The *Original Mysteries* are vast and true,
Ascending to the *Nine Heights*.
Firm as *Jade*, towering like *Lapis Lazuli*,
Their splendor blazes like *Flame’s Seal*.
Deep as *Jade Pavilions*, dim as *Spiritual Pools*,
Protected by the *Dragon Ancestors* of the *Celestial Dipper*.
Revering the *Master* of swift flight,
Desiring the *Silent Host*’s repose.
The *Red Seal* of *Han*’s *Sacred Strategy*,
The *Jade Bead*’s distant might.
Directing the *Celestial Procession*,
Displaying the *Mound’s* grandeur.

**The Eight *Heavens* of the South**
With *Lan*’s *Chariot* in order,
Exalted *Yì*’s boundless virtue.
Singing to chase the *Barbarians*,
Turning *Spirits* to aid the *Han*.
Pillars of *Ten Thousand Years*,
Gold-carved *Radiant Halls*.
Withering *Years*’ beauty in the gaze,
Bright *Regulations* bestowed like *Enums*.
The *Noble Gate* of *Shénnà*,
Strong *Bi*’s appointed office.
The *Ghostly Society* thrives in life,
The *Lone Official* at *Ā*’s spring.
The *Dragon’s* cavern is vast,
The *Sacred Waters* flow deep and black.
The *Jade Peak*’s noble daughters,
Their *Fortune* nurtures a thousand.
The *West’s* Eight *Heavens*
Record *Yī*’s *Four* in order,
*Yīn*’s robes match the *Xuan*.
Absorbing *Clouds* to drink the *Gān*,
White-forged *Tiger*’s winding path.
*Qi*’s strings bathe the *Spirit*,
*Gēng*’s *Soul* circles the *Heavenly Stem*.
The *Dipper’s* pavilion registers *Simplicity*,
The *Royal Command* prolongs *Yán*.
Mingled and vast in unity,
Responding to the *Abyss*’s exchange.
The *Mian*’s expanse is measured,
*Dan*’s *Lü* glistens with *Qiu*’s *Xian*.
Praying at *Xiāo*’s *Zhuó*,
The *Moon* offers *Yǒu*’s company.
Examining the *Corpse’s* clarity,
The *Celestial Edict* swiftly spreads.

**The Eight *Heavens* of the North**
The *Way* reaches without bounds,
The *Green Spirit*’s intent is vast.
Overflowing *Juice* ascends the *Peak*,
Silently seeking *Feast*.
The *Ghosts* gather in hidden stores,
The *Phoenix Stone*’s *Jade* resounds.
*Scented Flowers* quiet the *South*,
All encircle the *Party*.
The *Cracks* conceal the *Spirit*,
Mysteries align in perfect grace.
Suddenly, *Eons* stretch a hundred *Ren*,
The *Round* and *Clear* abyss stands still.
Teaching the *Tao*’s vast song,
The *True* and *Subtle* threads extend.
The *Grand Dwelling* knows no inhabitant,
Mingling with *Ancient Speech*.

The *Way* declares:
These are the *Great Brahman*’s hidden words,
The *Sound of Infinite Measure*.
The *Old Texts* recorded by the *True King of the Celestial Mists*,
On the *Purple Court* of the *Azure Enclosure*,
Summoning the *Celestial Beings* to restore life,
Commanding the *Northern Capital* to raise the dead.
The *Ghosts* and *Spirits* honor it to enhance *Spiritual Power*,
The *Immortal Saints* wear it to pierce *Mysteries*,
*Heavens* and *Earth* rely on it for *Transformation* and *Nurturing*,
*Yin* and *Yang* harmonize through it to *Shape Forms*.
Drumming the *Tuó* to move *Spirits*,
*Qi* arrives, *Fate* converges.
The *Taboo* of the *Way of Life*—
One must know it to preserve longevity.

The *Heavenly True Man* of old inscribed these words,
Establishing them as *True Sound*.
Those who know this *Sound* and recite it with *fasting*,
The *Celestial Beings* shall dispatch the *Spirit-Kings* of *Restoration* and *Form*,
Descending to observe their bodies,
Recording their *Merit* and *Labors*,
Ascending to report to the *Celestial Beings*,
Where ten thousand *Spirits* pay homage,
The *Earthly Deities* guard the gates,
The *Great Virtues* of the *True Immortals*
Recommend them to the *Upper Pure*,
Their *Way* complete—
They roam the *Three Realms*,
Ascend to the *Golden Gate*.

This *Sound* repels all,
Dispels all,
Delivers all,
Accomplishes all—
The *Natural Sound* of the *Heavenly True*.

Thus, when recited,
The *Spirit-King* descends to observe,
The *Supreme Deity* sings from afar,
Ten thousand *Spirits* pay homage,
The *Three Realms* attend the *Hall*,
All *Deities* bow in reverence,
The *Ghostly Spirits* vanish of their own accord,
The *Lingering* and *Luminous* resound,
The *Ten Directions* grow serene,
The *Nine Peaks* fall silent,
The *Seven Marshes* swallow the mist,
All *Spirits* tremble in submission.
Summoning the *Hosts of Immortals*,
The *Heavens* know no *Fog* or *Filth*,
The *Earth* knows no *Deity-Dust*,
The *Dark Wisdom* is perfectly clear—
The *Great Measure* of the *Mysterious Mysteries*.

**The *Sacred Treasure of Infinite Salvation*—**
*The Supreme Marvelous Sutra*, Volume Fifty-Eight complete.
Volume Fifty-Nine ends.

**The Chapter on Transforming Corpses into Form**

The Dao speaks thus: In days of old, within the *Dongguang* Heaven, the *Void-Transformed Flying Song* of the *Great Primordial* cultivated the *Earth of Nurturing*. There, the *Primordial Origin* taught the method of *Transforming Corpses into Form*—an infinite, supreme teaching.

When the *Primordial Origin Heavenly Venerable* delivered this sutra, circling ten times to summon the *Ten Directions*, the *Heavenly True Great God*, the *Supreme Saintly High Venerable*, the *True Person of Marvelous Conduct in Transforming Corpses into Form*, arrived with countless hosts, riding the void.

His vast *qi* surged and receded, his strides stirring the heavens, his purple carriage and yellow canopy gleaming, his crimson clouds and jade wheels casting morning shadows. His divine essence radiated, his multicolored brilliance dazzling, his misty aura dense and thriving, illuminating the boundless expanse for three days and three nights. The celestial stars and solar rays, the pearl-strung moonbeams, all paused in their courses. Gentle winds dispersed the mists, auspicious clouds spread their blessings, the heavens knew no floating veils, and the four seasons shone clear. Across the land—its earth, mountains, forests, and streams—all became level, with no high or low. The soil bore patterns of jade-like, emerald-green luster, its hue unchanging.

The assembled *True Ones* attended at his seat. The *Primordial Origin Heavenly Venerable* ascended in silence upon the floating *Nine-Qi* *Brahman* Light *Jade Terrace* in the void.

When the sutra was recited once, the *Great Saints of Heaven* all proclaimed its excellence. At that moment, all men and women of the land, their corpses filthy and decayed, transformed into form and became immortals.

When the sutra was recited twice, clouds and mists dissolved into emptiness, and golden effigies blazed like the sun.

When the sutra was recited thrice, flowers congealed into immortal dew, and ten thousand blossoms bore pearls.

When the sutra was recited four times, divine essences refined the bones, and the corpse’s form was perfected.

When the sutra was recited five times, the *Great Knot* was unsealed, and spirit-*qi* merged.

When the sutra was recited six times, the *Register of High Clarity* was inscribed, and *Nectar of the Spirit* bathed the body.

When the sutra was recited seven times, the *Divine Ritual* hurled fire, illuminating the *Mud Ball* within.

When the sutra was recited eight times, the *Heavenly Steed* galloped on the wind, shedding the old corpse.

When the sutra was recited nine times, the *Three Officials* issued decrees, casting off the yin-corpses.

When the sutra was recited ten times, the *Divine Luster* was firmly established, the *Life-Giving Qi* clarified, and all men and women of the land—without exception—turned their hearts toward it, receiving protection and attaining eternal life.

The Dao speaks further: When the sutra was recited once, the *Great God of Silent Dao* from the *East of the Boundless Infinite* arrived with countless hosts, floating through the void.

When the sutra was recited twice, the *Great God of Divine Power* from the *South of the Boundless Infinite* arrived with countless hosts, floating through the void.

When the sutra was recited thrice, the *Great God of Concentrated Essence* from the *West of the Boundless Infinite* arrived with countless hosts, floating through the void.

When the sutra was recited four times, the *Great God of Mysterious Operation* from the *North of the Boundless Infinite* arrived with countless hosts, floating through the void.

When the sutra was recited five times, the *Great God of Corpse-Demons* from the *Northeast of the Boundless Infinite* arrived with countless hosts, floating through the void.

When the sutra was recited six times, the *Great God of Divine Ritual* from the *Southeast of the Boundless Infinite* arrived with countless hosts, floating through the void.

When the sutra was recited seven times, the *Great God of Fetal Spirits* from the *Southwest of the Boundless Infinite* arrived with countless hosts, floating through the void.

When the sutra was recited eight times, the *Great God of Mechanized Use* from the *Northwest of the Boundless Infinite* arrived with countless hosts, floating through the void.

When the sutra was recited nine times, the *Great God of Corpse-Transformation* from the *Upper Boundless Infinite* arrived with countless hosts, floating through the void.

When the sutra was recited ten times, the *Great God of Receiving Form* from the *Lower Boundless Infinite* arrived with countless hosts, floating through the void.

As the ten recitations completed, the *Heavenly True Great Gods* of the *Ten Directions* all arrived together. All men and women of the land turned their hearts in reverence, comprehending the *Great Dao*, deeply attuned to the *Divine Source*, all declaring they had attained birth, their lifespans measured in millions, yet none escaping their term. The *Mysterious Extremes* of *威神* unfolded their *Great Law*, guiding all to single-heartedness, opening the *Root Principle*, revealing their state before birth—what form they then possessed.

Within the boundless void, by what cause did they suddenly gain awareness and perception? The five phases of cold and heat—all were recognized in full. As the *Dao of Life* was about to depart, their *qi* scattered, their spirits fled, and only the filthy corpse remained.

The *Primordial Origin’s* divine wisdom nurtured all living things. At the touch of the most subtle *Spirit*, it transformed this decaying corpse, received a new form, and ascended as a *True Person*. There must be profound *Mysterious Essence*—this must be proclaimed.

Such celestial beings, their numbers infinite, young and old, wise and foolish, ordinary and saintly—all wished to hear with reverence. Though even in heaven they still clung to desires, their defilements were light, yet they had not yet attained the *Empty Clarity* of the *Marvelous Dao*. All submitted to the *Victorious Transformation*, gathering like clouds and wind.

Those who came were as dense as fine rain and mist, their countless hosts causing half the land’s soil to sink unevenly—an unstoppable tide.

Thus, the *Primordial Origin*, knowing all thoughts, emitted an auspicious light from his crown, its nine hues illuminating the *Boundless Infinite Lands* of the *Ten Directions*, the *Thirty-Two Heavens*, and the *Thirty-Two Sovereigns*—all bathed in radiance.

Within this light, the *Primordial Origin* manifested countless beings from countless eons, lost in delusion and ignorance, their habits begetting one another in endless cycles of birth and death. They saw no *True Dao*, their countless *karma* and retributions, their endless grievances and debts—all revealed as clearly as if gazing into their own minds.

The *Primordial Origin*, surveying the great assembly, spoke:

*"The Dao of *Yuqing* surpasses ten thousand heavens. Divine *qi* returns as light; the corpse perishes, the form refines. The form refines into *qi*; embracing the spirit, containing the void—hidden and revealed at will, appearing and vanishing without obstruction. Gazing back upon the world, it is finer than a single drop of dew.*

He then gathered the auspicious light, compressing the manifested realm into a *Treasure Pearl* the size of a millet grain, suspended seven *zhang* above the earth in the void.

The *Primordial Origin* then ascended, and the *Heavenly True Great God*, the *Supreme Saintly High Venerable*, the *True Person of Marvelous Conduct in Transforming Corpses into Form*, the *Silent Mysterious Immortal*—with countless hosts—all entered the *Treasure Pearl*."

The celestial beings and mortals gazed upward, and saw only a surging vitality enter through the Pearl’s mouth—once inside, its whereabouts became unknown. The populace dispersed, the land restored to evenness, no longer tilted or sunken.

Within the Treasure Pearl, the Primordial Origin completed the transmission of the scripture. The gathered immortals, overseeing the salvation, entrusted it to me. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words.

With the ritual matters now complete, the celestial hosts resumed their stations. In an instant, all sound vanished, leaving perfect stillness.

At that time, all who encountered the scripture’s teachings were universally saved and delivered, their lives preserved without injury. The land’s people turned in reverence, their corpses transformed into refined forms—neither obscured nor illuminated, neither arrogant nor invasive, neither pure nor defiled, neither in use nor in alarm, neither restrained nor divided. The emaciated flesh dissolved, the received form took shape, all united in boundless compassion, disparate bones forming kinship.

The realm became secure, its people prosperous, rejoicing in eternal peace. The Dao’s teachings spread, and the entire land followed the Way.

Those with sincere devotion, reverently upholding the scripture, all attained salvation in the world.

The Dao declares: All names spoken within the Primordial Origin’s scripture are the hidden, coded names of the celestial deities transforming corpses. They are also the taboo names within the True King’s received form—the concealed names of the hundred spirits. These are not the common words of the world.

The Supreme Saint, already a perfected immortal, penetrating the Mysterious and fathoming the subtle, transformed and purified the decaying corpse, receiving a refined spiritual form. Those who master its verses and recite them ten times will stir the distant heavens—old forms dissolve, new ones arise. The myriad emperors praise its marvels, their forms transmuted into true essence. The nine seas stilled their waves, the five mountains exhaled their clouds, the sun and moon doubled their brilliance, their radiant rays circulating vital essence. Yin and yang reversed, mortals became immortals, demons bound in form, ghosts and specters extinguished, corpses transformed into living beings, white bones restored to flesh.

Scholars who recite it ten times will see their five viscera regenerate, the Three Corpses flee in terror, demonic essences vanish, ghostly calamities extinguished. They will rescue the dying, restoring life from death. This is so because scholars, their impure *qi* not yet dispelled, their bodies not yet perfected in truth, still govern their corpses through life’s force. Though they may wield celestial authority and subdue earthly spirits, binding demonic essences, they can only repel death—not attain true transcendence. Lightly reciting this chapter invites misfortune.

Honoring and venerating the scripture brings prosperity to one’s lineage, generation after generation, untouched by calamity. Divine protection guards the door.

This scripture’s sublime mysteries surpass even the Jade Capital. It saves innumerable beings, standing as the root of all Daoist paths. Its grandeur is boundless, its virtue incomparable.

The Dao declares: Those who recite this scripture ten times will see the myriad heavens converge, with countless ancestral spirits and tormented souls all transformed into refined forms, ascending to the Vermilion Palace. After nine years of cultivation, they are reborn, becoming noble beings. Those who earnestly study the scripture, their merits complete and virtue fulfilled, will attain immortality, ascending to the Golden Gate and wandering the Jade Capital.

Advanced scholars who practice and recite this scripture will immediately receive salvation—their forms refined, their corpses dissolved—as they ascend to the Southern Palace. Mortals who recite it will prolong their years, all eventually attaining the Way of Corpse Dissolution. Their spirits, though momentarily extinguished, avoid the underworld and return to their forms, wandering the boundless void.

This scripture’s subtlety is profound, its salvific power endless. All celestial beings rejoice in its blessings, granting immeasurable merit across life and death. It is a treasure of the heavens, not to be passed to the mortal world. Only those who offer gold and jade with sincere devotion may swear to heaven and transmit it. Leaking or neglecting it invites retribution upon nine generations, binding one to eternal service as a ghostly official.

The scripture is attended by the Five Emperors and their twenty-four玉童玉女 (*yuétóng yǔnǚ*—jade boys and girls), who guard its divine texts and protect those who receive it.

The Dao declares:
In the first month, with prolonged fasting, recite this scripture to invoke the *Taqing* Transcendent Purple Emperor, who will deliver the suffering souls of past ages from underworld torment, transforming their corpses into refined forms and guiding them to the Southern Palace.

In the seventh month, with prolonged fasting, recite this scripture to invoke the *Shangqing* Three True Ones of the Supreme Micro Emperor, who will transform corpses into immortal forms, granting the reciter’s body immortality. Those who write it on jade tablets or gold slips will escape death and be reborn.

In the tenth month, with prolonged fasting, recite this scripture to invoke the *Yuqing* Divine and Subtle Flying Void Emperor, who will transform corpses into soaring immortals. Kings and emperors, their ministers and kin, will secure their lineage’s longevity, preserving the heavens’ stability and eternal peace for generations. They will forever govern their lands, their people calling it the Great Peace.

On the eight seasonal festivals, recite this scripture to invoke the Nine-Heaven Emperor of Corpse Transformation, who will deliver the liberated and descending immortals, granting them the rank of Nine-Palace True Ones.

On one’s birthdate, recite this scripture to summon the Nine-Heaven True King, who will ride through the void, purifying the corpse’s spirit, receiving the Supreme Mysterious form. The hundred spirits will drink the elixir, their vital essence purified, their lifespan eternal. Free from suffering, their bodies radiant, they will be attended by the Three Realms’ guardians, welcomed by the Five Emperors, and honored by the myriad spirits. Their names inscribed in heaven, their merits complete, they will ascend to the Upper Clarity.

The Dao declares:
On days of practice, one must bathe in fragrant waters, fast in seclusion, facing east. Strike the teeth thirty-two times to commune with the thirty-two heavens. Bow the heart thirty-two times in reverence. Close the eyes, meditate upon sitting within clouds of sp

On this auspicious and joyous day, one must observe a strict fast in the purified hall.
Reciting the sacred scriptures to liberate countless beings, may my invocation ascend directly before the Supreme Sovereign, the Most High Emperor of the Thirty-Two Heavens of the Primordial Origin.

When complete, draw in the *qi* thirty-two times, facing east to recite the scripture:
*The Primordial Origin’s Supreme Scripture of Infinite Liberation*
*The Primordial Origin’s Mysterious Treasure of the Soul’s Essence*
—transforming the corpse into form, wondrously awakening beings to liberation.

The hundred demons retreat in silence, their dissolution and coalescence unfolding naturally.
The Primordial *qi* ascends in crimson, refined by fire into the True.
In the Primordial Ancestor’s eon, the corpse is transformed into form.
When the spirit departs, it is called a corpse—unaware, unhearing.
When the spirit attaches, it is called form—movement arises in bending and stretching.
All this is the Dao’s mechanism, which the Most High holds in reverence.
There is none it does not transform from corpse to form,
None it does not receive into form.
When form moves, the corpse stirs not;
When the spirit flows, its motion is perfectly balanced.
Transforming the corpse into form, vital essence spontaneously generates.
Shared origin with Heaven and Earth, it opens the three luminaries.
This is the Heavenly Root—spirit without form or feature.
Taking the Dao as body, the five phases’ essence,
Spirit and *qi* swirling, responding to emotion with hue,
Shaping form through color’s influence.
The five true *qi* coalesce into five patterns,
The five patterns expand and plant divine spirits universally.
Without patterns, there is no radiance,
Without patterns, there is no clarity,
Without patterns, there is no establishment,
Without patterns, there is no completion,
Without patterns, there is no liberation,
Without patterns, there is no birth.
The True Spirit’s talisman summons—white bones take form.
The Inner Canon of the Human Sovereign—corpse-forms regenerate.
Refining the old to return to new, the True attains its True.
Transforming corpse into form, form endures and preserves.
Great and small are impermanent—ascending to the Supreme Clarity in flight.
This is the Great Brahman, the Heaven within Heaven.
The Yùluó Xiāotái, the Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital.
The Supreme Beyond Supreme, the Great Luo’s Pure Clarity.
Vast as eons, as if nonexistent, as if existing.
The Three Floras depart—wondrous courts emerge.
Golden gates, jade halls, arrayed in pristine mists.
The Great Path’s Brahman *qi* encircles the ten directions.
Within are gods of transforming corpse into form,
Within is the Great Sovereign of the Southern Extremity, the Peacemaker of Life’s Transformation,
Within is the Great Spirit Marshal who descends essence to receive form,
Within is the Lord Han, the Cultivator of Corpse-Transformation for Life’s Sake,
Within are the Southern Sovereigns of Life’s Record, Longevity’s Extension, Fate’s Calculation, and Calamity’s Relief.

**First Chapter: The *Zhēnwáng* [真王]’s Hymn of Flying Void to Form**
The *Fán* [梵] *Qì* [氣] knows no absence,
the *Yùqīng* [玉清] is profound and luminous.
Descending straight to the *Shénqiū* [神丘].
Surrounding the void’s wave-like expanse.
Seven *jié* [劫]’s golden mountains,
ten-thousand celestial jade trees.
The sun and moon both radiate,
through boundless *jié* [劫] they pass.
Blow, and *yīn* [陰] arises;
cease, and *yáng* [陽] reaches its peak.
Fragrant winds and crimson rains,
jewel towers and yew pavilions.
The *Yuánshǐ* [元始] flows its essence,
piling snow and stacking butter.
Encounter fire, it becomes liquid,
casting the *Yùjīng* [玉京].

Mighty mountains and towering stones,
comparable to the *Níhuán* [泥丸].
Within, the *Huángchì* [黃赤] is contained,
the *Tiānxiāng* [天潢] surging forth.
The tail’s orifice is sealed,
roaring like torrential waves.
Deeply rooted in Heaven’s *Dé* [德],
comparable to the spine’s nodes.
Within are the Nine *Zhēn* [真],
white clouds drifting endlessly.
The *Shénfēng* [神風] circles eight times,
no *Yīng* [英]—just the *Qīngjīn* [青巾].
Riding the *Qì* [氣], it forms thunder,
the *Yùnǚ* [玉女] blows her *shēng* [笙].
The Five *Yīn* [音] burst forth,
the Seven *Qíng* [情] weep and laugh.
The Dao possesses supreme essence,
formless, nameless.
Flying void and receiving form,
the *Xiānzhēn* [仙箓]’s purple *Líng* [靈] script.
Sing this Hymn of Void and Form,
and the ultimate truth ascends beyond naming.

The world does not comprehend the *Zhēn* [真] Dao,
the *Fǎ Lún* [法輪] turns again and again.
How many departures and returns?
Forever submerged in the *Yùhǎi* [欲海].
Above these Three Realms,
within the flying void,
the *Zhēnwáng* [真王]’s sacred hymns,
their words matching the profound chapters.

Recite this a hundred times,
and you earn the degree of *Nán Gōng* [南宮].
Recite it a thousand times,
and the Heavenly *Zhēn* [真] will welcome you.
Recite it ten-thousand times,
the Dao is complete—
ascend to the Great Void,
transcend the Three Realms,
and attain the rank of *Xiān Gōng* [仙公].

Those who hear the sacred hymns,
the *Mówáng* [魔王] reveres their forms,
and commands the *Dìzhǐ* [地祇].
Escorts and sentinels attend,
pulling them free from the earthly gates.
The Five *Kǔ* [苦] and Eight *Nàn* [難],
the Seven Ancestors ascend and depart,
forever leaving the *Kǎoguān* [考官].
Their souls cross the *Zhūlíng* [朱陵],
refined and reborn—
this is the boundless,
the endless enlightenment.

There are hidden celestial texts,
all realms hold them in veneration.
Revealing them carelessly,
one falls into the *Dìyù* [地獄].
Disaster befalls the Seven Ancestors.
The Dao says:
These two chapters belong to the Celestial Emperor
and the *Yùqīng* [玉清] *Zhēnwáng* [真王]’s hidden hymns.
They are words of transformation,
of flying void, receiving form,
attaining the Dao, and ascending to *Zhēn* [真].
They exchange *Qì* [氣] and return to life—
the natural speech of the Great *Fán* [梵],
not the common words of mortals.

No melodious harmony,
no ornate tunes.
Thus called profound and mysterious,
hard to trace and examine.
Treasure of the Highest Heaven,
hidden in the *Shénxiāo* [神霄] *Yùqīng* [玉清] *Zhēnwáng* [真王]’s Eastern *Yùtáng* [玉堂],
awaiting the Celestial Emperor’s decree to be transmitted.

If a perfected one brings a heart of gold and precious sincerity,
and according to the ancient pattern pledges to the Ten Heavens,
then they may be entrusted with it.

The Dao says:
He who strays far from the Dao loses life,
who departs from essence scatters *Qì* [氣].
When *Qì* [氣] is still and the *Shén* [神] fades,
what remains is but flesh, bones, teeth, and hair—
a lifeless corpse.

For they cannot retain the *Shén* [神] to nourish the *Qì* [氣],
nor store the essence—
only like wood and stone,
without awareness or movement.
Thus, they are called corpses.

「The Most Venerable and Divine Sage, about to return *Qì* [氣] and summon *Shén* [神],
awakens wisdom within the corpse—
suddenly aware, they regain their former form,
returning to their original abode.
The hundred spirits come to pay homage,
reveling and feasting within the golden halls and jade chambers.

If they see the world’s entanglements,
the passions and desires that arise,
and the thoughts and emotions that move them,
unaware of their source,
they gaze upward at the Three Celestial Marks,
downward at myriad things,
and find joy in themselves.

The high perfected ones,
transforming the corpse and receiving form,
all attain the Dao in this manner.

In general, when the celestial course is exhausted,
the stars and sun wane or wax,
and humans face decline or death—
sickness, injury, or passing—
all who share this fate must
unify their hearts and observe fasts,
burn incense at the six times,
recite the scriptures tenfold,
and merit will swiftly descend,
dispelling all ill omens.
The merit is boundless,
universally benefiting the endless multitudes.

The Dao says:
Those whose learning is shallow,
whose Daoic attainment is yet incomplete,
whose celestial course is destined to end,
and whose bodies must pass through the Great Yin [太陰]
—at the moment of their demise—
should have their fellow disciples and perfected ones
burn incense for them and recite the scriptures ten times,
so that they may transform the corpse and receive form as prescribed.
Their souls and spirits ascend to the Southern Palace,
following their Daoic merit,
and are reborn on the appointed day,
unhindered in the Wheel of Rebirth,
thus attaining the state of Immortals.

The Dao says:
The transformation of the corpse and reception of form
is not merely rooted in human bodies,
but may be equated with the grandeur of Heaven and Earth.
To welcome life and prolong *Qì*,
to invite merit and extend years,
is to align with the Dao without fail.

When Heaven and Earth’s courses reach their end,
the celestial lodges are disordered,
the sun and moon lose their regular eclipses,
the four seasons falter,
the balance of *Yīn* [陰] and *Yáng* [陽] is disrupted,
and calamities strike the realm—
plagues and poisons spreading,
the common folk dying in masses,
teachers and friends perishing—
all must observe fasts,
burn incense, and recite the scriptures.

For fasting and scripture recitation
carry immense merit.
Above, they dispel celestial disasters,
preserving and safeguarding the Emperor’s land.
Below, they avert poisonous harm,
delivering the common folk.
Life and death depend upon them,
and their blessings are immeasurable.
Thus, they are called boundless,
universally benefiting Heaven and humanity.

The Dao says:
All who possess this scripture,
capable of serving as Heaven’s and Earth’s sovereigns,
and the myriad folk,
and performing these meritorious deeds—
on days of calamity,
when they resolve to fast, burn incense,
and recite the scriptures ten times,
they cleanse the corpse’s defilements,
and their bodies ascend to Immortality.
All celestial beings record their names,
and ten thousand spirits guard them,
ranking them among the perfected,
and they may become holy ministers of the Golden Gate.

The celestial beings meticulously record
each person’s merits and offenses,
not missing even a hair’s breadth.
The True Kings of the Heavens also recommend them.

Those who attain the Dao must
penetrate and comprehend these profound words.

Within the Heavens, the Great *Vajra* [大梵]’s hidden speech,
the boundless sounds,
are inscribed in the ancient, sacred, and resplendent texts.
The True King commands the *Tàixuān* [太玄] *Shìmìng* [司命] *Shàngqīng* [上清] *Língxū* [靈虛] True Person
to record them with a vermilion brush,
so that those who wear and serve them
may transform the corpse and receive new life,
and be freed from sickness and misfortune—
like dust lifted by the wind.

All manner of worldly misfortunes,
corpse anomalies, and ill omens,
are to be addressed by vermilion inscription
and fire purification.

Or if one is forbidden to enter temples and ancestral shrines,
they shall immediately comply.

The Heavenly Scriptures and Treasure Maps
have characters each a broad length of one *zhàng* [丈].
The Heavenly True and Sovereign Person
once inscribed these texts,
establishing them as the correct sounds.
Those who know these sounds
and fast while reciting them
shall have all celestial beings dispatch
attendants of the True and Illustrious Spirits
to inspect their bodies,
record their diligent merits,
and report them to the Heavens.
Ten thousand spirits shall pay homage,
the Earth spirits shall attend at the gate,
and the True Kings of Great Merit
shall recommend them for profound enlightenment,
their virtue vast and limitless,
allowing them to roam the Three Realms
and ascend into the Golden Gate.

This sound dispels all obstacles,
averts all calamities,
delivers all beings,
and achieves all objectives—
the natural sound of the Heavenly True.

Thus, when recited to manifest
the flying ascent beneath Heaven’s gaze,
the Celestial Emperor sings from afar,
ten thousand spirits pay homage,
the Three Realms attend in reverence,
all deities bow their heads,
the spirits of the dead perish of their own accord,
the resonance of the *Línláng* [琳琅] echoes,
the Ten Directions are purified,
the rivers and seas fall silent,
the mountains and hills swallow smoke,
all living beings tremble in submission,
and the gathered Immortals are summoned.
Heaven is free of *Fēn’ài* [氛秽], Earth of *Quán* [祆] dust,
the *Mínghuì* [冥慧] is clear and penetrating—
a boundless and profound mercy.

The *Língbǎo* [靈寶] *Wúliàng* [無量] *Dùrén* [度人] *Miàojīng* [妙經] concludes here.

The *Refining Qi and Transmuting into Immortal* Chapter

The Dao speaks: In days of old, within the Azure Sky’s beginning, the vast song of the Great Floating Earth of the Spacious Void, the Primordial Origin taught the method of refining qi and transmuting into Immortal—ascending to the Supernal Pure. When the Primordial Origin, Celestial Venerable, was about to expound this scripture, circling ten times in succession to summon the Ten Directions, only then did they arrive at the seat.

The Heavenly True Great God, the Supreme Sage of High Veneration, the Mysterious Conduct True Person—all the Ten Directions’ gods who refine qi and transmute into Immortals, born of the Dao of the Spirit, their bones transmuted, their lives sustained, the Functionary Celestial Officials recording the names of those who attain True and are delivered—those who refine qi and transmute into Immortals, countless in number, and all the great gods of the heavens, innumerable hosts, riding the qi and arriving.

This qi lingers, neither void nor substantial, neither form nor hue—mixed and boundless, without limit. Like clouds and mists of the celestial heights, its essence is beyond description. Its colors shift in nine hues, now radiant, now luminous, now crimson, now verdant, dazzling the nine heavens, illuminating the Three Realms. It cannot be likened to the divine mists and sacred hues of the heavenly gods, nor to the immortal clouds and auspicious colors.

It emanated from the Primordial Origin’s Jade Capital, the Azure Chamber, the Yawning Abyss, the Mysterious Cavern—spreading softly and dispersing. Within it, countless myriad lights appeared, each displaying a red carriage and green palanquin, feathered canopies and jade wheels, dragon banners and phoenix pavilions, night-light steeds, nine fierce beasts of the absolute, jade curtains suspended in space, purple canopies shading high, flowing essence-light, vast qi surging—illuminating the boundless expanse for three days and three nights.

The celestial wheels of the heavenly hosts, the sun and moon and stars, the symbols of the constellations, the golden tripods and jade gates, the jade pivots and precious scrolls, the celestial cords and cloudy domains, the lodges of the Vermilion Gorge—all moved in unison, their courses shifting, unlike the usual order.

At that time, the Heavenly Officials, the High Ministers and their attendants, each guarding their wheels and hubs, turning the pivots and levers, could not follow their accustomed paths. All were astonished, speaking among themselves: *"What auspicious cause is this? What strange transformation do we behold?"*

They then raised the Heavenly Drum to await the Great Chariot, striking nine times. Below, they observed the Jade Capital’s twelve mountains, the Spirit Sea’s sapphire waves, the divine ferry’s tides responding, the dragon’s coils emerging and vanishing—its roar like thunder, the great abyss vast and surging, the trickling streams swallowed—all unlike the time when the Heavenly Drum sounded.

As fate aligned, the heavenly palaces of the gods, unaware of the cause, saw this marvel. They consulted the ledgers and scrolls, preparing to ascend to the Imperial Terrace to inquire into their doubts.

Swiftly, they dispatched the Mighty Spirits, sweeping the clouds to clear the path, gathering the *shen* and ordering the Dao, harnessing dragons and tigers, bearing banners and flags—yet before they could proceed, divine mists rose in four directions. The Heavenly Wind blew gently, the Three Suns reversed their light, the Mysterious Qi clarified, the circular canopy rotated left and right, celestial harmonies resounded, and the profound song played in unison. A thousand realms shone with flowing light, the Eight Directions towered high, and the gathered True Ones all took their seats.

The Primordial Origin, Celestial Venerable, sat in the void, floating above the indigo-lotus flower, its petals myriad, the stamens encircling far and wide. Each petal broadened downward, covering all beneath the heavens. Each stamen’s jewel displayed a golden, wondrous world of the heavens. Within each realm, there were heavenly Immortals and sovereign kings, their crowns adorned with precious flowers, their robes swaying with immortal hues, riding cranes and phoenixes, moving without hindrance. The lotus stem was clear as crystal, piercing the void, its roots coiled in the Jade Sea, its circular diameter ten thousand *li* wide. Within it stood precious pavilions and jade halls, layered palaces of marvel—sacred visions beyond thought or measure.

To speak of it closely, it was like gazing at the Granary of the Sky from afar.

The Primordial Origin, Celestial Venerable, sat serenely upon the lotus, surveying the heavens below. His form, great and small, was equal and without flaw.

When the scripture was expounded once, the great saints of the heavens all proclaimed its excellence. At that time, the men and women of a single realm saw their light and shadow intertwine.

When the scripture was expounded twice, the divine manifestations became boundless. The Jade Capital and Kunlun Mountains were as a speck of dust, without limit.

When the scripture was expounded thrice, all phenomena and beings spoke in unison, praising the Dao’s law, chanting the True.

When the scripture was expounded four times, the Nine Heavens of the Upper Pure resounded, thirty-six thousand days and months shone together, the sun and moon radiant as one. The nine shades of decaying corpses, the bones of those yet undelivered, rose and became whole.

When the scripture was expounded five times, golden dragons and divine beasts competed in spewing winds and clouds, their mouths merging in nine hues, penetrating the profound and the obscure.

When the scripture was expounded six times, the men and women of a realm—those of the qi-laden kind—became youthful in visage, their bodies of gold and jade, unaware of death, nourished by qi and wandering as spirits.

When the scripture was expounded seven times, Heaven hung jade-green, Earth turned to gold, red dew dripped, and sweet nectar overflowed.

When the scripture was expounded eight times, the golden-winged ceased to be born, divine dragons sang at night, the Five Peaks gathered their mists, and the Eight Auspicious Signs manifested.

When the scripture was expounded nine times, the Jade Sea raised waves, the green mountains flourished, flying Immortals came to pay homage, their cloud-chariots and phoenix banners arrayed.

When the scripture was expounded ten times, the Earth-Store opened its sweet dew, the Seven Treasures sprouted uniformly, the stubborn and impure foundations transformed under auspicious light. At that time, all men and women of the realm, without exception, turned their hearts in devotion, all receiving protection and deliverance, attaining longevity.

The Dao speaks: At that time,
when the scripture was expounded once, the Eastern gods who refine qi and transmute into Immortals, the True Gods of the Absolute, innumerable hosts, floated through the void and arrived.
When the scripture was expounded twice, the Southern gods who refine qi and transmute into Immortals, the True Gods of the Absolute, innumerable hosts, floated through the void and arrived.
When the scripture was expounded thrice, the Western gods who refine qi and transmute into Immortals, the True Gods of the Absolute, innumerable hosts, floated through the void and arrived.
When the scripture was expounded four times, the Northern gods who refine qi and transmute into Immortals, the True Gods of the Absolute, innumerable hosts, floated through the void and arrived.
When the scripture was expounded five times, the Northeast gods who refine qi and transmute into Immortals, the True Gods of the Absolute, innumerable hosts, floated through the void and arrived.

When the scripture was expounded six times, the Southeastern gods who refine qi and transmute into Immortals, the True Gods of the Absolute, innumerable hosts, floated through the void and arrived.

When the scripture was expounded seven times, the Southwestern gods who refine qi and transmute into Immortals, the True Gods of the Absolute, innumerable hosts, floated through the void and arrived.

When the scripture was expounded eight times, the Northwestern gods who refine qi and transmute into Immortals, the True Gods of the Absolute, innumerable hosts, floated through the void and arrived.

When the scripture was expounded nine times, the Upper Realm gods who refine qi and transmute into Immortals, the True Gods of the Absolute, innumerable hosts, floated through the void and arrived.

When the scripture was expounded ten times, the Lower Realm gods who refine qi and transmute into Immortals, the True Gods of the Absolute, innumerable hosts, floated through the void and arrived.

When the tenfold recitation was complete, the True Gods of the Absolute who refine qi and transmute into Immortals from the ten directions all arrived together. The people of the land, both men and women, devoted their hearts in reverence.

Those who came heard the marvelous qi, filling and permeating everywhere, vast and boundless, countless in number. Their forms merged with qi, and qi merged with form—no east or west, no boundaries. Countless figures, male and female, appeared and vanished, hid and revealed themselves, filling the great land, their qi dispersed and abundant, beyond restraint.

Then, the Primordial Beginning smiled, extending the Five-Fingered Hand of Purple-Golden Radiant Palm, gathering the qi into a luminous display. Immediately, all celestial beings, the true assembly listening to the law, the boundless Dao’s awe-inspiring spirit, the silent void’s heavenly domains, all divine officials, the Great Thunderer of the Ghostly Hosts—all were within the radiant qi, bowing in homage, circling beneath the seat, eager to hear the essential teachings.

In the vast expanse, a hundred zhang above the earth, the Primordial Beginning ascended, summoning the True Gods of the Absolute, the Highest Saints, the Marvelous Conduct Immortals, the ten-directional gods who refine qi and transmute into Immortals—innumerable hosts—all entering the radiant qi.

All celestial beings saw the Primordial Beginning, the Highest Saint, like a jewel and pure lapis lazuli, the heavens and seas intermingling, boundless and azure, their light illuminating within and without, spotlessly clear.

They saw the ten-directional void’s luminous eyes, all the True Immortals gazing upward in song and praise, stepping through the void in worship.

Only a faint stirring was seen—entering and departing, light merging with qi, their whereabouts unknown.

The people of the land dispersed, the celestial realm restored to its proper order, the void open and unobstructed.

The Primordial Beginning, within the qi’s observation of existence and nonexistence, completed the scripture’s recitation. The assembled True Ones, overseeing salvation, entrusted it to me. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words.

The ritual matters were now fully known. The celestial beings returned to their stations. In a fleeting instant, the void and qi merged as one, leaving no trace of sound.

At that time, all celestial officials, the Three Celestial Stems and Two Celestial Branches governing the turning of fate, and all True Gods realized the strange transformation of qi and the shifting of spirits—none knew its origin—only recognizing that the Primordial Beginning, desiring to expound the supreme marvelous Dao of refining qi and transmuting into Immortals, first revealed this auspicious sign.

All True Immortals and celestial beings, encountering this scripture and its teachings, universally attained salvation and deliverance, preserving their celestial lifespan without harm. The land’s people revered the Dao, forgetting all else.

Refining qi clarifies qi, great qi strengthens qi, empty qi is profound, surging qi flows, qi of presence and absence, qi’s transformation into Immortality.

Words do not proclaim the essence, lips do not name the object—harmonized in compassion, differing in form yet united in kinship.

The land was secure, the people prosperous, rejoicing in eternal peace. The teachings began, and the land refined qi as one.

Understanding the Twelve Methods, merging qi with the Dao, merging the Dao with the heart, the heart with spirit, the spirit transforming into Immortality.

Revering the lineage, observing rites with respect, all attained the power to save the world.

The Dao speaks: All that the Primordial Beginning spoke within the scripture are the hidden sounds of the celestial emperors refining qi, transmuting into Immortals, generating spirits, and altering bones. They are also the secret names of the ten-directional True Gods of the Absolute who transmute qi into Immortals—the hidden names of refining qi and transmuting into Immortals—not the common words of the world.

The Highest Saints have already become True Persons, penetrating the Mysterious and fathoming the subtle. Those who master its chapters, their qi having ascended to sacred ground, entering the formless yet still refining it, when recited ten times, summon the celestial qi, causing the ten thousand emperors to transmute into Immortals, the heavens and earth returning to their origin. Qi flows like a deep spring—mountains refined into qi, earth refined into qi, heavens refined into qi, humans refined into qi. The Three Celestial Stems and myriad phenomena all refined into qi.

Qi has no fixed form, its existence and nonexistence indistinct. Those who recognize it transform spirit into Immortality. Those who fail to recognize qi do not know the Dao of refining.

With fasting and recitation of the scripture, true qi naturally arises. Refining qi naturally responds to the heavens and earth. The Three Celestial Stems cease their motion, the multitude of demons bound in form. Ghostly spirits perish, the dead revive, white bones transmute into Immortals.

Scholars of the highest learning, reciting it ten times, will have their essence and blood transform into qi, their qi reaching the hundred rivers. The five viscera and six entrails function without obstruction, naturally entering the void, their qi refining endlessly, enduring forever, transforming spirit into Immortality.

They will rank among the Five Emperors’ attendants, the Three Celestial Stems will emit mist, demonic spirits will lose courage, the Ghostly Officials will wield their whips, purging the nine impurities. Their qi will reach the utmost subtlety, healing the sick and reviving the dead, restoring life to those at death’s door.

This is because scholars who refine qi without clarity, whose bodies have not penetrated the True, can summon and control the myriad qi. Their qi ascends to the celestial gate, returns to the celestial gate, yet they do not know the formless. Their virtue can subdue the earthly spirits, binding demonic souls—but only to repel death and gain life through qi.

Lightly reciting this chapter will not radiantly manifest the qi. The flowing essence will congeal into jade, sealing the passways and bright hall. The Mysterious Officials will record the words, leaving behind lingering calamities.

With reverent offerings and proper rites, one’s gates will flourish, prospering through generations. Connected to virtuous causes, they will be untouched by ten thousand calamities, with divine spirits guarding the door.

This scripture is supremely honored, unmatched in the Jade Capital, saving innumerable beings, serving as the foundation for the ten thousand methods of refining qi and transmuting into Immortals.

The vast and august Dao/Way is difficult to fathom in its virtue.

The Dao/Way speaks: *"For those who recite this scripture ten times, the qi of all the heavens arrives. Countless myriads of ancestors, tormented in the underworld, once their suffering ends, all transform into qi. Without refining, this qi remains obscure and lifeless. Those who receive the qi through recitation are all immediately liberated, ascending to the Vermilion Palace, where they dwell for nine years before being reborn and becoming noble beings. Those who love learning this scripture, fulfilling its virtue and power, refine qi and transmute into Immortals, ascending to the Golden Gate and feasting in the Jade Capital.*

*Scholars who study it, reciting this scripture, are all immediately liberated, ascending to the Southern Palace. Mortals who recite it will prolong their lifespan, and all will attain the method of corpse dissolution. The form follows the qi as it departs, dissolving into the boundless. The spirit and soul merge with the qi, which coalesces into spirit—unbound by the underworld, they immediately regain their form, drifting through the cosmic qi.*

*This scripture is supremely subtle, universally liberating the boundless. All heavenly and human beings rejoice in its blessings, receiving immeasurable fortune and grace across life and death. It is a treasure of the heavens, not transmitted to the mortal world. Only the virtuous, bearing gold and jewels with sincere devotion, pledge to the heavens before passing it down. Leakage or negligence invites calamities upon nine generations, binding one to eternal service in the ghostly bureaucracy.*

*Five Emperors and sixty-four玉童玉女 (Jade Boys and Girls) attend this scripture, guarding and protecting those who receive it with divine texts. The Dao/Way speaks: In the first month, with prolonged fasting, recite this scripture to refine the qi into verdant green—this renews the qi of departed ancestors, severing the underworld’s ensnarement and ancestral lawsuits, liberating them to the Southern Palace. In the seventh month, with prolonged fasting, recite to refine the qi into empty whiteness, transforming the body into an Immortal, with heavenly records inscribed on jade talismans and white contracts, erasing death for rebirth. In the tenth month, with solemn fasting, recite to refine the qi into the Great Yellow—this benefits the Dao/Way’s kings and emperors, their ministers, parents, and children, summoning the qi of the Nine Heavens to bestow celestial fortune, stabilizing the nation’s destiny and ensuring eternal rule, forever securing peace for their realm. On the eight seasonal nodes, recite to refine the qi into the Nine Stars, manifesting as nine colors—wearing the Nine and treading the One, with Three on the left and Seven on the right, Two and Four supporting the body, Six and Eight flanking the feet. The qi permeates the Nine Palaces, transforming into the True Body, becoming a True Person of the Nine Palaces. On one’s birth day, recite to refine the qi into the Great Micro—from stem to branch, the Six Jia officials attend, one qi transforming into the strange, the spirit and soul clarifying, ten thousand qi following, avoiding all suffering. The spirit transforms into the Mysterious and Subtle, the Three Realms offering their wheels, the Five Heavens unfurling their banners, ten thousand spirits paying homage, their names recorded in heaven. With virtue and power fulfilled, they ascend to the Upper Clarity.*

*The Dao/Way speaks: On days of practice, one must bathe in fragrant waters, fast in seclusion, facing east, striking the teeth sixty-four times to reach the sixty-four heavens, mentally bowing sixty-four times, closing the eyes, and quietly contemplating oneself seated within the three-colored clouds—green, yellow, and white—inner and outer darkness enveloping. There appear a Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Lion, and White Crane arrayed on either side, with the sun and moon illuminating, the chamber glowing brightly. A round halo forms at the neck, its light radiating ten directions, so vividly clear. The secret incantation is thus:*

*'Supreme Mysterious Origin, the Most High Dao/Way Lord, summon forth from my body the Three Five Functionaries, left and right officials and messengers, the Jade Boys bearing incense, the Jade Girls transmitting words, the Five Emperors’ direct seals, the direct-day incense officials—sixty-four each—opening the gates as spoken.*

*Today’s auspicious joy, with prolonged fasting in the pure hall, practicing this supreme scripture to liberate countless beings, may my petition reach above, directly before the Supreme Sixteen Heavens’ Elemental Beginning Emperor, the Most Honored One.*

*Finished. Draw the qi thirty-two times, facing east and reciting the scripture.*

*The Supreme Beginning’s Boundless Liberation Uppermost Marvelous Scripture,*
*The Supreme Beginning’s Cavernous Mysterious Treasure Original Chapter,*
*Refining Qi and Transmuting into Immortals,*
*Nine Transformations to Liberate Beings.*

*The Dao/Way’s qi hides in its rhythms, merging and separating naturally, blending into the boundless and formless. The formless becomes empty essence, the qi and emptiness coexisting. The qi is the Supreme Truth, subtly entering the Mysterious Void. The qi is the nature of the Dao/Way, belonging neither to being nor non-being. Transformation and divinity are unified, the spirit and qi as one. The qi is neither vaporous nor breath, neither exhaled nor mist or smoke, neither form nor substance. The True Qi has no body, yet is named as such. The qi can generate and transform, harden and return, endure and persist. My qi is not a thing, yet it generates all things. My qi is without sentiment, yet it transforms into sentient beings. The qi is the Mother of the Dao/Way, the Great Spirit—moving, it becomes existence; still, it becomes emptiness.*

*It generates the Jade Capital, its lofty towers towering. The Great Luo’s Pure Clarity, the Golden Gate’s Jade Chambers, the Purple Pavilion’s Vermilion Courtyard. The True Qi flows between, forming the Uppermost Truth. Without qi, there is no radiance, no clarity, no establishment, no completion, no liberation, no birth—this is the Great Brahman, the Mysterious within the Mysterious.*

*Its branches and offshoots spread like linked rings, coiling and winding, violet qi and white mist, ever-shifting above and below, with firm boundaries between hardness and softness. High Saints and Spirit Immortals, ten thousand emperors and a thousand truths, all merge into one qi, refined and transmuted into Immortals. Like the world’s mountains and seas, palaces and gates, all things flourish in splendor—wise and foolish, the wise and the ignorant, rulers and officials—all arise from the qi. Refined and transformed, the qi knows no birth or death, no partiality. It responds as sensed. The qi’s marvels are transmitted: sometimes absent, sometimes present, faintly manifesting in the three conveniences—Rainbow Capital and Jade Pools, the Sun’s dew and the Flowering Abyss, the Great Path’s Brahman qi, encircling the ten directions, generating and liberating beings."*

Together, they ride the Brahman qi, transforming into chariots of purple clouds and jade-lined carriages, jade phoenix palanquins, yellow canopies, and white-wheeled coaches, harnessed by nine dragons and three-qi litters, with banners of misty clouds and bells of flowing fire. They strike the golden drums and shake the imperial chimes, with the Celestial Boys singing in unison before them and the Jade Maidens playing their pipes behind. Lion-demons part the way, roaring in song—*hūxiāo*—as the Eight Extremes unfold their maps, the Five Emperors ascend in smoke, with countless carriages and myriads of steeds, floating on qi and descending with radiant light, overseeing the True and liberating beings.

The Celestial Chancellors, the Supreme Palace of Great Purity, masters of the Dao and controllers of qi, the Great Divine of Transcendence, holding talismans and registers, all assemble before the Emperor, responding as needed to liberate beings.

The Celestial Records are strictly compiled.
A universal proclamation to the Three Realms: the Boundless Divine Homeland, the Curved Springs’ Domain, the Northern Capital of Luo City, the Three Officials and Nine Ministries, the Twelve River Sources.

The departed ancestors, countless eons of kin, lingering yin-corpses and drifting souls, those who have abandoned the Three Officials, whose qi has long congealed, whose past karma swirls like wind, drifting with malevolent roots.

The qi knows no birth or death, only the boundless void. Consciousness clings to qi, drifting without foundation. The virtuous transform into the Hall of Blessings; the wicked descend into the Pool of Flames. Nature follows deluded perception, carried by the qi’s flow.

As in life, they experience joy, fear, laughter, and tears.
The demonic qi acts as officials, interrogating them.
The wandering souls, filled with sorrow, recall their past lives.
The Primordial Beginning’s Daoic grace refines and sustains the qi.
Accumulated grievances dissolve into harmony; accumulated faults renew into virtue.
The dying qi disperses, extinguishing the roots of sin.
They cannot be detained, forced into ghostly throngs—by the Primordial符命, they ascend at the appointed hour.
Returning to the Boundless Primordial, merging with the Dao’s embryo.

The Six Directions’ Heavenly Demons, the fires of hell and ice of the abyss—
when karmic debts are exhausted, the qi is refined, and jade light pierces the void.
In stillness, the emptiness remains, with only the solitary and mysterious surviving.
The dead souls undergo refinement, transforming into celestial marvels.
The Dao is my body; the qi is my spirit.
To dwell in worldly delusion brings only sorrow.
Refining the qi to transcend—endlessly liberating beings.
The living body receives liberation, enduring through countless eons, turning with the wheel of time, equal to the heavens.
Forever liberating the coarse and stained, those bound by desire in the Heavenly Prison, whose souls and spirits pass unchecked, transcending the Three Realms to roam freely in Upper Purity.

The Heaven of Upper Purity: the most true celestial qi, the formless realm of Brahman practice.
The **East’s Sixteen Heavens**—
This qi, the Great Brahman, was originally nonexistent; its arising and cessation are all manifestations of the Dao’s true and perfect essence. It has no inherent form; the Dao’s transformation is the true essence itself. This is called *qi observation*, yet it is not a refined transformation that appears. It is the natural truth of the heavens, the profound mystery of the boundless void. It does not traverse the degrees of stars or dwellings; it exists beyond the formless realm, outside the division of yin and yang—all are the abodes of the Highest Saints.

The Heavens conceal their rhymes,
The sound within qi, the honor within qi, the deity within qi, the great demon within qi, the spirit within qi.
Nine transformations, ten refinements, merging into Supreme Clarity.

Dao’s nature as qi, qi merging with emptiness.
If you cannot refine, recite this Cavern Text.
If you know how to refine, refine into the utmost essence.
Qi’s origin is unrefined; refinement is but a false name.
Because you are not precise, you indulge in love and hatred.
Karma becomes filth, emotion becomes blemish.
It harms your Dao-qi, strips your splendor.
Refine with stillness, guard with rectitude.
Refined long, qi becomes steadfast—naturally, Supreme Clarity emerges.
Hold the qi scripture, smooth and level, fourfold tranquility.
Internal gaze at the eight scenes, six voids flowing luminous.
Refine beyond human Dao, distant in alignment with the True.
The boundless mysteries, profound beyond measure.
Manifest divine truth, universally liberating heaven and man.
Today, rejoicing in receiving liberation, passing through the gates of the Heavens,
Severing all evil qi, slaying the roots of wickedness,
Ascending the Three Palaces, transforming into the Supreme Mysterious,
The True King within qi, overseeing and safeguarding refinement,
Entering and exiting without gate.

The Eastern Dipper’s qi is azure, the Western Dipper’s qi is white,
The Northern Dipper’s qi is dark, the Southern Dipper’s qi is crimson,
The Central Dipper’s Yellow Court—refine the five Dipper qi.
Residing in transformed form and hue, form and hue reaching truth.
Not mere illusion’s annihilation, but where Dao directs—transforming into an immortal, equal to spirits.

Crimson qi nourishes harmony, black qi circulates blood,

Transforming and subduing the flying void, crushing demons and binding gods.
Severely subduing the Northern Duān, transforming into an immortal by command.
Descending to sweep away inauspiciousness, the stale qi of the Six Heavens.
Foul blood surging in eight bursts, stagnant and unilluminated,
Coiled and attacking horizontally, grimy and foul—
Ghosts and spirits hide their traces, concealed among the world, bringing calamity to all.

The Emperor commands the Nine Elders,
Issuing decrees to subdue the Duān and Luó,
Lightning and fire lead the charge, whipping tigers and barking at dragons,
Echoing through the heavens, hurling fire into the nine layers.
Harming qi for a thousand li, refining into azure void.
The Great Emperor’s roar—jade purity unfurling.
Jewel wheels grinding the sky, purple landscapes dissolving.
Dare to obstruct? Repulse the Supreme True Ones.

Vast and boundless eons, within primordial chaos.
Above, qi without hue; below, no abyss.
Within, the void’s cavern—refining qi into heaven.
Above and below heaven, no darkness, no obscurity,
No form, no shadow, no limit, no end.
The boundless Great Void, vast and lightless.
Refining qi into crimson clarity, naturally ascending.
Primordial Beginning’s tranquility, the nine voids transforming into immortals.
Refining qi into existence—clouds, mists, and vapors.
Refining qi into nothingness—spiritual realms transforming into immortals.
Qi congealing into Great Void, the divine scripture’s cavernous chapters.
Fire refining water into jade—ten brilliances, resplendent.
Eight corners with drooping thorns, golden script upon azure heaven.

The jade script shines within the void, where tigers lie and dragons slumber.

They uphold the eternal order—preserving life through boundless eons.

Feasting in the Nine Palaces, their guests are heavenly jade attendants.
The **Taiyi** (Great Unity) kneads the **Nihuan** (Earthly Pill), dwelling in the **Xingming** (Life Command) Palace.

The **Tao** and **Kang** (Peach of Immortality) together extend—**Qi** nurturing divine spirits.

Ascending to the **Shangqing** (Upper Clarity) realm, entering and exiting the **Huafang** (Flower Hall).
Within the Eight **Ming** (Obscurities), in the realm of subtlety.
Below, they govern the mortal frame—the **Nihuan** (Earthly Pill) and **Ganggong** (Vermilion Palace).
Within, they merge with **Tai xu** (Great Emptiness), void as the **Dao**’s mother.

Above the Three **Jing** (scenes/heavens),
Within the flying void,

Recite it a hundred times,
And one’s name ascends to the Southern Palace.
Recite it a thousand times,
And the True King’s protection welcomes you.
Ten thousand recitations complete the **Dao**—
Ascending to the Great Void,
Transcending the Three Realms,
Ranking among the Immortal Lords.

Hearing the sacred sound,
Demonic kings restrain their forms;
By imperial decree, the Nine Heavens are guarded,
Divine attendants escort and welcome.
Emerging from the earthly gate,
**Qi** turns black to crimson—
A hundred knots at the Great Pass,
Three punishments and four executions,
Five paths and six calamities,
Ancestral **Qi** ascends and transforms,
Forever departing from the Ghostly Palace.
The soul crosses to Zhu Ling,
**Qi** refines into rebirth.

This is called **Wu Liang** (boundless),
Universal salvation without end.

There are hidden celestial texts,
All revered by the heavens.
Revealing them carelessly leads to the Hell of Falling,
**Qi** lost, ancestral essence extinguished.

The **Dao** says: These Azure Chapters are all the sacred words of the Heavenly Sovereigns,
The hidden sounds of refining **Qi** to become an immortal True King.
They are the speech of the Great **Fan** (Dharma),
Not the common words of the mortal world.
Without melodious charm,
Without ornate phrasing—
Thus called Mysterious and Profound,
Difficult to trace in detail.

Treasured by the heavens,
Hidden in the Purple Micro Palace of the Mysterious Capital,
Transmitted by the Mysterious Art every **40,000 kalpas**.
If a perfected adept offers a golden treasure with sincere devotion,
And according to the ancient formula swears an oath to the High Clarity,
Then it shall be entrusted to them.

The **Dao** says: Even the **Qi** of heaven and earth has its limits.
The Three Lights refining **Qi** also have their ebb and flow.
The most sacred divine person also has their **Qi** destiny.
The **Qi** of shallow learners may also bring fatal harm.
All who suffer such calamities
Should, in accordance with the pact, wholeheartedly observe fasts,
Burn incense at all six times,
Recite the sutra ten times in rotation—
Blessed **Qi** descends instantly,
Harmful **Qi** disperses like dew.
Boundless texts,
Universal salvation without end.

The **Dao** says: For those of shallow understanding or whose **Qi**-refining lacks success,
When their time of extinction approaches,
Their **Qi** halts at the Great Yin (Darkness).
At the moment of passing,
Their perfected adepts should burn incense for them,
Recite the sutra ten times over,
And refine their corpse-**Qi** according to the method—
Their soul and spirit shall ascend to the Southern Palace,
Following their own merit,
And be reborn on the calculated day.
The Wheel of Rebirth never ceases,
Transforming their spirit into an immortal.

The **Dao** says: When one’s **Qi** destiny in heaven and earth is exhausted,
They must also observe fasts,
Burn incense, and recite the sutras.
When celestial **Qi** is disordered,
The sun and moon lose their light,
They must also observe fasts,
Burn incense, and recite the sutras.
When the Four **Qi** (seasons) are misaligned,
And yin and yang are unbalanced,
They must also observe fasts,
Burn incense, and recite the sutras.
When a land suffers disaster,
And martial **Qi** rises in all directions,
They must also observe fasts,
Burn incense, and recite the sutras.
When pestilential **Qi** spreads,
And countless people perish,
They must also observe fasts,
Burn incense, and recite the sutras.
When a teacher or friend’s **Qi** is exhausted,
They must also observe fasts,
Burn incense, and recite the sutras.

The fasts and recitation of sutras,
Their virtue and power are most profound.
Above, they dispel celestial calamities,
And protect the imperial throne.
Below, they avert harmful **Qi**,
And save the countless people.
In life and death, they undergo refinement—
Their blessings are immeasurable.
Thus it is called **Wu Liang** (boundless),
Universal salvation for both heaven and man.

The **Dao** says: All who possess this sutra,
For the sake of heaven, earth, the imperial sovereigns, and the countless people,
Should perform these virtuous deeds.
On days of **Qi** calamity,
They must vow to observe fasts, burn incense,
And recite the sutra ten times over.
All shall be recorded by the heavens,
Ten thousand spirits shall attend as guardians,
Ranked among the holy ones,
And shall attain to become the golden-gated ministers of the Sacred Emperor.

The heavens record all deeds and misdeeds without omission.
Even the True King within the **Qi** shall recommend you—
Those who attain the **Dao** shall truly comprehend these profound words.

The hidden speech of the Great **Fan** within the heavens,
Boundless sounds of the **Dao**,
Refining **Qi** to become an immortal—
The nine-palace Mysterious texts.

The Heavenly Sovereign knows the origin of **Qi**,
Obtains the root of **Qi**—
When **Qi** transforms and disperses,
Its horizontal and vertical shifts form the text,
Written in cinnabar script,
Eight corners radiant,
Layered jade and ordered pearls—
Its square measures a zhang,
Four scenes brightly illuminated.
In ancient times, the text was inscribed,
To establish the proper sound.

The one who knows this sound and can fast and recite it,
Refines **qi** and cultivates the True,
His spirit hidden in the void and the dark—
The True Kings of the heavens below observe his form,
Record his merits and labors,
And present them above to the heavens.
Ten thousand spirits pay homage in worship,
Earthly deities attend at the gate,
The Great Merit True King recommends him to the Highest True,
His **Dao** complete, he attains it—
Roaming the Three Realms,
Ascending into the Golden Gate.

This sound refines all,
Nurtures all,
Transforms all,
Illuminates all—
The natural sound that refines **qi** and becomes an immortal.

Thus, when it is recited, he achieves flight beneath the heavens,
The Celestial Sovereign sings from afar,
Ten thousand spirits pay homage in worship,
The Three Realms attend at the hall,
All spirits bow their heads,
Ghostly essences vanish on their own,
**Qi** surges through the spirit palace,
Jade tones resound spontaneously,
The celestial sphere trembles with sound,
The **Dao** clears the stagnant and purifies the turbid,
The sea calms, the mountains rise,
Emerald mists encircle the golden city,
Cranes gaze upon the ramparts,
The immortal capital fills with emptiness,
Ten thousand immortals gather in procession,
Purple canopies and vermilion banners unfurl—
Heaven and Earth refine **qi**,
Transforming and changing the Celestial Capital,
Swiftly transcending the dark and obscure,
A boundless, profound, and profound **virtue**.

*Completes Volume Sixty of the Supreme Treasure Sutra of Infinite Degrees for Liberating Beings, the Supreme Excellent Scripture*
*Volume Sixty-One*

「The Eternal Cessation of the Wheel of Rebirth (品)

The **Dao/Way** speaks: In days of old, when the Azure Sky first emerged,
The Great **Dao/Way** floated in the **Void** and sang of the Mysterious and Illuminated Black Earth,
And received the **Eternal Beginning’s** instruction to liberate beings and eternally cease the Wheel of Rebirth in the Infinite Supreme Grade.

When the **Eternal Beginning** (元始) **Celestial Venerable** (天尊) was to proclaim this **sutra/scripture**,
He circled ten times through the ten directions,
To summon the ten quarters,
And then approached His seat.

The **Heavenly Pure** (天真) **Great Spirit** (大神),
The **Highest Sage** (上圣) **Exalted Venerable** (高尊),
The **Wondrous Conduct** (妙行) **True Person** (真人),
And the countless **unrestrained** (无鞅) **assemblies** (数众),
All rode upon the **Void** and came.

With **jade steeds** (玉马) and **cloud chariots** (云轺),
**Rainbow mists** (彩霞) and **flowing veils** (流霭),
**Vermilion carriages** (丹舆) and **crimson wheels** (彤毂),
**Fragrant blossoms** (阵萼) and **flying perfumes** (飞香),
The **three luminaries** (三景) gathered in pristine clarity,
Their radiance converging in the **Great Emptiness** (太空),
For seven days and seven nights.

The **celestial hosts** (诸天) displayed **dragon script** (龙文) upon the sun,
And **treasures** (宝字) upon the moon,
**Crane-observed star pavilions** (鹤观星楼),
**Abodes of constellations** (宿舍机躔),
At once halting the **Wheel of Rebirth** (轮),
With **dragon winds** (龙风) and **phoenix rains** (兼雨),
**Phoenix qi** (凤气) forming mountains,
The sky unclouded,
The **four symbols** (四象) ascendant and luminous.
Within a single realm—its lands, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees—
All stretched flat as one, with no high or low,
Its soil soft as **purple-gold** (紫金),
Encompassing the **four elements** (水火),
With **pure brilliance** (净莹) intermingling and unifying,
No hue distinct.

The **assemblies of spirits** (众真) attended His seat,
While the **Eternal Beginning** **Celestial Venerable** (元始天尊) sat in **Void** upon the **floating, colorless sea of light** (无色海光),
With the **immovable golden mountain** (金山) standing firm,
And **auspicious manifestations** (瑞相) arrayed in solemn grandeur.

After proclaiming the **sutra/scripture** once,
The **Great Saints** (大圣) of the ten quarters simultaneously extolled its virtues,
And at that time, all men and women within the realm
Beheld the **True Form** (道真) of the **Dao/Way**,
And loathed to abandon their lives, spurning birth and death.

After proclaiming the **sutra/scripture** twice,
They awakened to the **Three Realms of Existence** (三业),
As though flames gathered in kindling.

After proclaiming the **sutra/scripture** thrice,
They observed the **filth of their bodies** (身秽),
And aspired to attain the **Dharmakāya** (法体).

After proclaiming the **sutra/scripture** four times,
They pitied the **Three Realms** (三界),
Their minds revolving like wheels.

After proclaiming the **sutra/scripture** five times,
Their worldly illusions dissolved,
Their thoughts returning to the **True Dao/Way** (正道).

After proclaiming the **sutra/scripture** six times,
The **Dao/Way** could elevate their **spirits** (神),
Unsoiled by coarse defilements.

After proclaiming the **sutra/scripture** seven times,
They knew their **past lives** (宿命),
And held no regard for **communicating with spirits** (通灵).

After proclaiming the **sutra/scripture** eight times,
They abided in this **True and Eternal** (真常),
And eternally ceased the Wheel of Rebirth.

After proclaiming the **sutra/scripture** nine times,
Their lives surpassed those of Heaven and Earth,
And they attained **True Eternal Life** (真长生).

After proclaiming the **sutra/scripture** ten times,
They ascended to **Dao/Way** realization,
And eternally ceased birth and transformation.
At that time, all men and women within the realm
Could not help but incline their hearts,
All receiving protection and liberation,
And attaining eternal life.

The **Dao/Way** speaks: At that time,
When the **Eternal Beginning** **Celestial Venerable** (元始天尊) proclaimed the **sutra/scripture** once,
The **Multifarious-Hearing Great Spirit** (多闻大神) of the **Infinite Supreme Grade** (无极无量品) in the East,
And the **unrestrained assemblies** (无鞅之众),
Floated upon the **Void** and arrived.

When the **sutra/scripture** was proclaimed twice,
The **Multifarious-Eyed Great Spirit** (多目大神) of the **Infinite Supreme Grade** (无极无量品) in the South,
And the **unrestrained assemblies** (无鞅之众),
Floated upon the **Void** and arrived.

When the **sutra/scripture** was proclaimed thrice,
The **Firmly Abiding Great Spirit** (坚住大神) of the **Infinite Supreme Grade** (无极无量品) in the West,
And the **unrestrained assemblies** (无鞅之众),
Floated upon the **Void** and arrived.

When the **sutra/scripture** was proclaimed four times,
The **Stabilizing the Sea Great Spirit** (定海大神) of the **Infinite Supreme Grade** (无极无量品) in the North,
And the **unrestrained assemblies** (无鞅之众),
Floated upon the **Void** and arrived.

When the **sutra/scripture** was proclaimed five times,
The **Divine Utilization Great Spirit** (神用大神) of the **Infinite Supreme Grade** (无极无量品) in the Northeast,
And the **unrestrained assemblies** (无鞅之众),
Floated upon the **Void** and arrived.

When the **sutra/scripture** was proclaimed six times,
The **Authoritative Transformation Great Spirit** (权化大神) of the **Infinite Supreme Grade** (无极无量品) in the Southeast,
And the **unrestrained assemblies** (无鞅之众),
Floated upon the **Void** and arrived.

When the **sutra/scripture** was proclaimed seven times,
The **Dao/Way-Sound Great Spirit** (道聪大神) of the **Infinite Supreme Grade** (无极无量品) in the Southwest,
And the **unrestrained assemblies** (无鞅之众),
Floated upon the **Void** and arrived.

When the **sutra/scripture** was proclaimed eight times,
The **Mysterious Concealment Great Spirit** (玄藏大神) of the **Infinite Supreme Grade** (无极无量品) in the Northwest,
And the **unrestrained assemblies** (无鞅之众),
Floated upon the **Void** and arrived.

When the **sutra/scripture** was proclaimed nine times,
The **Eternal Life Great Spirit** (永生大神) of the **Infinite Supreme Grade** (无极无量品) in the Upper Realm,
And the **unrestrained assemblies** (无鞅之众),
Floated upon the **Void** and arrived.

When the **sutra/scripture** was proclaimed ten times,
The **Pacifying Transformation Great Spirit** (息化大神) of the **Infinite Supreme Grade** (无极无量品) in the Lower Realm,
And the **unrestrained assemblies** (无鞅之众),
Floated upon the **Void** and arrived.

After ten rounds of proclamation,
The **Great Spirits** (天真大神) of the **Infinite Supreme Grade** (无极无量品) from the ten directions
All arrived at once.
All men and women within the realm
Inclined their hearts and bowed in reverence,
And in the heavens where they dwelled,
In the palaces where they resided,
They all beheld the **Eternal Beginning** ascending to His seat in majestic splendor,
Proclaiming the **sutra/scripture** and expounding the **Dharma/Teaching** (法),
Illuminating the Infinite Ten Directions,
With radiance as clear as daybreak.
Their forms appeared, and they spoke to one another:
*"We, though attaining the ranks of the celestial hosts,
Have yet to escape the Wheel of Rebirth,
Our lives exceeding five kalpas,
And we have not yet freed ourselves from birth and death,
Our forms bright yet unspared from decay.
Now we hear the Celestial Venerable’s desire
To proclaim the Great **Dharma/Teaching** (法),
To eternally cease the Wheel of Rebirth,
And we begin to awaken,
Entering the True **Dharma/Teaching** (法) gate,
Escaping the net of birth and death."*

The arriving **unrestrained assemblies** (无鞅之众)
Sank half the realm into dense mists and fine rain,
An unchecked tide, impossible to restrain.

Thus, the **Eternal Beginning** shook out His robes and leaned upon His table,
Emitting a **Great Radiance** (大明) from His crown,
Illuminating all ten directions of the world,
The **Infinite Supreme Grade** **Dao/Way-True** (仙真) realms—
Each realm within the Infinite,
Where the **assemblies of immortals** (仙真) and **spirits** (众真) resided,
Beheld the **immortal kings** (仙王),
Who came to lead their subjects,
And gather at the **Dharma/Teaching** seat.

They also saw the **celestial hosts** (诸天) each bearing
**Strange treasures** (奇华) and **wondrous fruits** (异果),
**Jade fungi** (玉芝) and **immortal grasses** (仙草),
As offerings of reverence.

Some **immortal kings** (仙王),
Residing in great palaces,
Practiced the **Dao/Way-Immortal** arts (仙业),
And governed the **celestial administration** (天政),
Their hearts weary of sensory pleasures.
Or they sought **radiant light** (光华) and **elixir flavors** (咽味),
Feasting on **True Scenery** (真景),
Urging the **assemblies of spirits** (众真) to
Teach them **various wondrous matters** (种种妙事),
And gather the **heavenly and human** (天人) within the assembly.
All were aware, their minds and eyes fixed,
Yet dared not speak their thoughts.

The **Eternal Beginning** then slowly opened His **thunderous voice** (雷音),
And proclaimed to the Great Assembly:

*"To escape birth and death,
To not fall into wandering,
One must first attain **no-mind** (无心).

If you attain **no-mind** (无心),
Then the **Three Realms of Existence** (三业) will cease.
All beings, lost in delusion,
Take the **perception of the senses** (指识) as **mind** (心),
Distinguishing **having and not having** (有无),
And measuring **birth and death** (生死).
Yet **mind** (心) is but a false name,
A false name by which we grasp the false.
Thus, **mind** (心) is empty and illusory.
The enlightened know this—
Its essence is the **Original Dao/Way** (道元),
What concern has it for **mind’s affairs** (心事)?
To cling to **mind** (心) and be attached to **phenomena** (境),
Is to dwell within birth and death.
If you abandon the false **mind** (妄心),
You will not dwell within birth and death,
And thus eternally cease the Wheel of Rebirth.
Even the **Great Celestial Hosts** (大天偠),
The **High True** (高真) **Imperial Sovereigns** (帝王),
Through **no-mind** (无心),
Attained the ranks of **Saints** (圣真),
And naturally realized the **Dao/Way**.

To take or reject based on **mind** (心),
To incline toward death or life,
Is never the ultimate truth.
Even the **refinement of qi** (服气炼化),
The **consumption of elixirs** (饵药) to prolong life,
Are but **small vehicle** (小乘) practices for sensory response,
And none can truly **liberate** (解脱) or **ascend to the formless Dao/Way** (升入无形之道).

If you do not let **mind** (心) sway you,
Nor follow **thoughts** (念) and **emotions** (情),
And forget both **mind’s traces** (心迹) and **its movements** (用情),
Then you will behold the **True Body of the Dao/Way** (道体),
Eternally cease the Wheel of Rebirth,
Dwell not within birth and death,
And align with me—
Here, within the **colorless sea of light** (无色海光),
Proclaiming such **Dharma/Teaching** (法) as this."*

If one acts with **mind** (有心),
Then all **Dharma-protectors** (护法)—heavenly beings, humans, dragons, and ghosts—
Shall each depart in flight,
And shall not come here to pay homage and revere.

Thus it is known:
**Dao/Way** is **non-mind** (无心),
The **True Form** (真形) is **emptiness** (无),
Equality in **Dharma** (法) is the **Body** (身),
And all deeds of the **Ten Saints** (十圣) remain unknown.

Words spoken from the mouth
Are the **edicts of the Heavenly Emperor** (天帝勅).
If **mind** (心) schemes and calculates,
Then **demonic essences** (魔精) will attach themselves,
And one shall inevitably descend into the **Evil Paths** (恶道).

**Yuan Shi** suddenly emerged from the **Sea of Light** (海光),
Merging into the **colorless Great Primordial Void** (无色太玄空),
Suspended a **treasure pearl** (宝珠),
As large as a millet grain,
Within the **Great Emptiness** (太虚),
A thousand *zhang* above the earth.

**Yuan Shi** ascended and summoned:
The **Heavenly True Gods** (天真大神),
The **Supreme Saints and Exalted Ones** (上圣高尊),
The **Mysterious Conduct True Persons** (妙行真人),
The **Ten-Directional Boundless Great Dao/Way’s Mighty Spirits** (十方无极大道威神),
And countless **unfettered assemblies** (无鞅数众),
All entered the **Treasure Pearl**.

Heavenly beings gazed upward,
Only seeing a **gentle breeze** (拂拂) entering through the pearl’s mouth.
Once inside, their whereabouts became unknown,
The people dispersed, the land returned to level,
No longer tilted or sunken.
**Yuan Shi** then, within the **Treasure Pearl**,
Completed the **Sutra’s** (经) exposition.
The **True Ones** (众真) oversaw the transmission,
And entrusted it to me.
At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words,
The **Dharma-affairs** (法事) were fully accomplished,
The heavens resumed their stations,
And in an instant, all was silent—no trace remained.

At that time, those who encountered the **Sutra’s Dharma** (经法)
Universally attained awakening,
In **mystical silence and luminous emptiness** (玄默虚明),
Unattached to **void-illusions** (空见),
All bowed in reverence, their hearts filled with virtue.
They did not kill or harm,
Nor harbor jealousy or resentment,
Nor commit lewdness, theft, gluttony, or lust,
Nor hold hatred or deceit.

Their speech was unadorned,
Their words held no malice,
Their hearts were uniformly compassionate,
And even those of differing natures became kin.

The land was secure, the people prosperous,
Rejoicing in eternal peace.
The **Sutra’s teachings** (出教) began,
And the entire realm aligned with the **Dao/Way**.
Those with sincere devotion,
Who revered and followed with ritual,
All attained the power to **deliver the world**.

The **Dao/Way’s words**:
All that **Yuan Shi, the Heavenly Venerable** (元始天尊) spoke within the **Sutra**,
Are the **inner names** (内名) of the **Heavenly Emperors** (诸天上帝),
Hidden in **mystical cadences** (隐韵之音).
They are also the **taboo names** (内讳) of the **True Kings** (真王),
The **secret names** (隐名) of the **hundred spirits** (百灵).
Not the common words of the world.
The **Supreme Saints**, already perfected as **True Persons** (真人),
Mastering the **Mysteries** (玄) and fathoming the **Subtle** (微),
Can fully comprehend their meaning.

To recite it **ten times** (十过),
The heavens will chant in response,
The **Ten Thousand Emperors** (万帝) will offer rites,
Clouds and mists will fall silent,
The deep spirits of sea and mountain will respond,
The **Two Symbols** (二象) will be pure and vast,
The **Three Manifestations** (三景) will shine brightly,
All sentient beings will harmonize with the **True Dao/Way** (真道),
Forever ceasing the **Wheel of Rebirth** (轮转).

For those of **highest learning** (至学之士),
To recite it **ten times**,
The **Five Emperors** will attend as guardians,
The **Three Realms** will prostrate in homage,
**Demonic essences** will lose their power,
**Ghostly spirits** (鬼祆) will perish,
The **spirit will soar, the form will solidify** (神飞形固),
And **eternal life** (永生) will be attained.

Yet this is because:
Scholars whose **impure qi** (秽气) has not yet dissipated,
Whose **Body** (体) has not yet penetrated to **True Reality** (洞真),
Summoning and restraining the **Ten Directions** (十方),
Whose **might** (威) has not yet governed the **Heavenly Laws** (天政),
Whose **virtue/power** (德) can only subdue the **Earthly Spirits** (地祇),
Binding and restraining **demonic spirits** (魔灵),
But can only **save myriads of lives** (济兆身),
And cannot universally **deliver all spirits** (度群灵).
To recite this **chapter lightly** (轻诵此章) brings calamity to oneself.
To **revere and supply offerings** (供养尊礼) brings prosperity to one’s gate,
Generations of flourishing fortune,
Associated with virtuous causes,
No disasters will afflict,
And **Divine Beings** (神明) will guard the door.

This **Sutra** is most **venerable and subtle** (尊妙),
Unmatched in the **Jade Capital** (玉京),
Delivering countless beings,
As the **root of all Dao/Way-paths** (万道之宗).
Its **grand framework** (大范) is awe-inspiring,
Its **virtue/power** (德) is beyond measure.

The **Dao/Way’s words**:
For those who recite this **Sutra ten times** (诵是经十过),
All the heavens will gather,
The **Three Realms** will halt the **Wheel of Rebirth** (停轮),
Myriads will attain the **Supreme Truth** (至真),
Illuminating the **roots of life** (生根),
Unattached to **being or non-being** (不着有无),
Unobstructed by **extinction or existence** (不滞亡存),
If there were great beings
As gates to **birth and death** (生死门),
Yet no forms exist,
Mingling in **undivided unity** (混洞不分),
Forever ceasing the **Wheel of Rebirth** (轮转),
Merging with the **Dao/Way in profound obscurity** (与道杳冥),
Countless ancestral souls (亿曾万祖),
Suffering in **darkness and torment** (幽魂苦爽),
All shall immediately be **delivered** (受度),
Ascending to the **Crimson Palace** (朱宫),
Forming a **rank of nine years** (格皆九年),
Receiving transformation and rebirth,
Becoming **noble beings** (贵人).
Those who love this **Sutra** and fulfill its **virtue/power** (功满德就),
Shall return to **namelessness** (无名),
Transcending **Yin and Yang** (阴阳),
Unbound by **clash or conflict** (无犯克并),
Not subject to **birth and death** (不属生死),
Forever ceasing the **Wheel of Rebirth** (轮转),
Transforming without transformation,
Rebirthing without rebirth,
Merging with the **Dao/Way’s Body** (与道合体),
All shall become **Immortal Worthies** (神仙),
Ascending to the **Golden Gate** (金阙),
Feasting in the **Jade Capital** (玉京).

Those of **high learning** (上学之士)
Who recite this **Sutra** shall immediately be **delivered** (受度),
Ascending to the **Southern Palace** (南宫).
Common folk who recite it
Shall prolong their lifespan,
Instantly attaining awakening,
Understanding the **Mystical and Profound Dao/Way** (玄解之道),
Their **spirit-awareness** (神识) unobscured,
Responding to all things without end,
Instantly mastering their **form** (运形),
Wandering and observing the **Great Darkness** (太冥).

This **Sutra** is **subtle and wondrous** (微妙),
Universally delivering all **sentient beings** (含灵).
All **heavenly beings and humans** (天人)
Shall receive its blessings.
Infinite blessings shall be bestowed upon **birth and death** (生死蒙惠).
It is a **treasure of the heavens** (上天所宝),
Not to be transmitted to the lower world.
Only those of **high virtue** (至士), bearing **gold and jewels** (赍金宝) with sincere hearts,
Shall swear by the heavens to pass it on.
To **leak or slight it** (轻泄漏慢) brings calamity to the **nine ancestral lines** (九祖),
Endless servitude to the **Examiners of the Dead** (考官),
Serving the **Five Emperors** (五帝) with the **Sutra**,
With **Twenty-Four Jade Boys and Girls** (玉童玉女) each,
Guarding and protecting the **Divine Texts** (神文) of those who receive the **Sutra**.

Adhere to precepts and enter the chamber,
Facing east,
Knocking the teeth thirty-two times,
Ascending to hear the **Thirty-two Heavens** (三十二天),
Heartfully bowing to the **Thirty-two Offenses** (三十二过),
Closing the eyes,
Silently meditating on oneself seated within the **nine-colored clouds of qi** (黄绿青赤苍黑碧紫白九色云气),

So clear and distinct.

With benevolent teachings, they repel evil, demonstrating the mysterious net of the Dao.

**The Dao speaks:** These are the hidden words of the Great Brahman within the Celestial Hosts—the Infinite Sound.

The ancient text of the Nine Elders of Mystic Capital was inscribed with yellow *zhu* lacquer upon the Gate of the Eon’s Imperial Threshold. Those of True Perfection, transcending the Three Realms and departing the Ten Directions, must ascend the Gate of the Eon and chant the Middle Chapter to rise into the Formless.

Those of the latter ages, dwelling in the cycle of birth and death and confined to the lesser vehicle, who do not recite this text shall have their forms recorded by the Earthly Officials, their spirits forbidden by the Heavenly Ministers, and their path to the Dao obscured—unaware of the utmost Mysteries.

Those who savor this Sacred Text shall have the spirits of the Central Pool reveal the boundless, opening the Great Clarity at the Window of Wisdom, and illuminating the Ocean at the Capital of Meditation.

Each character spans a breadth of ten feet.

The Heavenly True Ones of old inscribed this text, establishing it as the True Sound. Those who know its sound and recite it while fasting shall have all the Celestial Beings dispatch Flying Heavenly Kings to observe their bodies, record their merits, and report them above. The myriad spirits shall pay homage, the Earthly Deities attend at the gates, and the Ten True Ones of Great Merit shall recommend them to the Upper Purity. With the Dao complete, they shall attain the rank, roam the Three Realms, and ascend the Golden Gate.

This sound repels all, averts all, liberates all, and fulfills all—it is the natural sound of the Heavenly True Ones.

Thus, when it is chanted, the Three Realms below observe, the Supreme Deity sings from afar, the myriad spirits pay homage, the Three Realms attend at the hall, all spirits bow their heads, and the ghostly intelligences vanish. The *linlang* chimes resound, the Ten Directions grow serene, the rivers and seas fall silent, the mountains and hills swallow their smoke, and all spirits tremble in submission. The gathering of all immortals is summoned, Heaven is free of mist and filth, Earth of demonic dust, and the Dark Wisdom becomes utterly clear.

**The boundless, profound, and profoundest mercy.**
*The Scripture of the Supreme Treasure for Universal Liberation, Chapter Sixty-One, concludes.*
