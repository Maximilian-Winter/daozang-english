# 元始说功德法食往生经

*The Scripture of Merit, Dharma-Food, and Rebirth as Spoken by the Primordial Beginning*

At that time, the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy, together with the sacred assemblies of the heavens, the celestial immortals and terrestrial immortals, the officials of the three realms, the earth administrators of the Five Marchmounts, the water palaces of the Five Emperors, the Northern Capital of Fengdu, and the Two Lads of Good and Evil, wandered through the Jade Treasure Tower Pavilion World of the Eastern Quarter beneath the Azure Tree and upon the Blue Lotus, expounding the ten kinds of causes and conditions and the thousand karmic retributions, so that all in the Dharma assembly might generate the mind of liberation.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy manifested a great radiance, filling that world, and beheld the beings of the hells, hungry ghosts, and animal realms—heads and faces scorched and rotting, bodies aflame, pierced by wheel-blades and sword-points, their suffering and poison piercing the heavens, their pain wounding to the marrow, fierce fires blazing to the sky, thirstily drinking molten bronze, wailing their grievous debts without respite. All in the assembly universally witnessed this.

At that time, there was an immortal named Great Compassion and Great Wisdom, who wept in sorrow and lamentation. Rising from his seat, he bowed his head, composed his countenance, and prostrated himself, addressing the Heavenly Worthy: "I humbly beseech Your Sagely Compassion to deign to hear my plea. I, together with all in this Dharma assembly—the flying immortals, divine immortals, and others—pity the beings of the lower realms. We beseech the Heavenly Worthy’s equal and great compassion: how may they be delivered?"

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy remained silent for a long while before at last opening his compassionate countenance. Raising his Fivefold Luminous Fan, he emitted a great and vast sound, responding to the immortal:

"Excellent! Excellent!"

"You, who can widely awaken compassionate thoughts for all beings, now ask this matter—it is for this that I have manifested to this assembly of yours. You must listen carefully."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "In the Three Paths and Nine Courts, the hundred and twenty Fengdu hells of the underworld, there are beings who do not cultivate the true Dao. Upon death, they enter eternal night, their souls becoming lowly ghosts, sinking into evil destinies."

Moved with pity, he composed a verse:
*"Cool and sweet, the nectar’s grace,
The Dharma’s flavor beyond thought’s embrace.
The fragrance of the Seven Perfected flows,
Yet in the dark, why doubt still grows?
Those who partake of this Dharma-food,
Ascend to heaven, the Purple Tenuity’s mood.
The field of merit stands lofty and high,
Offerings and alms make purity nigh.
All conditioned things, in their boundless array,
Become the means to transform fate’s sway.
I lift you from the Three Paths’ pain,
Bestow upon you the Ninefold Mystery’s gain.
When the time comes to receive this fare,
All the heavens sing in praise and prayer.
In the cold courts, sorrow and woe,
Turn your heart to the Primal Sovereign’s glow.
The Nüqing Talisman of the Spirit Treasure,
The Zhongshan Scripture of the True Emperor’s measure.
One thought ascends to the Great Clarity,
A second returns to the Great Vacuity.
The merit descends to the Nine Darks below,
And step by step, you rise to the Purple Void’s glow."*

The Heavenly Worthy spoke:
To offer this Dharma-food to the departed is beyond conception. Whether the lost souls be male or female, when they partake to the full, each shall be freed from suffering, attain liberation, and receive rebirth. Upon a lotus seat of cool purity, they shall forever break free.

Then the Heavenly Worthy proclaimed again in verse:
The merit is beyond conception,
The practitioner reaps blessed reward.
Offering this Dharma-food as repast,
They dwell forever in the Way of peace and joy.

When the Heavenly Worthy had finished this verse, all the hells witnessed in response instantly dissolved at the sound. The bound spirits, following their wishes, were reborn. The Great Compassionate and Great Wise Perfected, along with all the assembly of the Dharma-gathering, rejoiced and leapt for joy. With their five limbs touching the ground, they paid homage and withdrew, faithfully receiving and upholding the teaching.

Thus concludes *The Scripture of Merit, Dharma-Food, and Rebirth* as spoken by the Primordial Beginning.
