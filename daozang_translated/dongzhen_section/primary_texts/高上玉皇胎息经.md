**The Highest Jade Emperor's Embryonic Breath Scripture**
The Jade Emperor of Highest Sovereignty (玉皇天尊) decrees:
The embryo forms within the **concealed qi** (伏氣),
And the **qi breathes** (息) within the embryo that has formed.

When **qi enters the body**, it is called life (生);
When the **spirit departs the form**, it is called death (死).

Knowing that **spirit and qi** (神氣) can bring **longevity** (長生),
One thus **nurtures the void** (虛無) to preserve **spirit and qi**.

When the **spirit moves**, the **qi moves** (神行即氣行);
When the **spirit dwells**, the **qi dwells** (神住即氣住).

If one seeks **longevity** (長生),
Then **spirit and qi must align** (神氣相注).
The mind remains **unmoved and thoughtless** (心不动念),
Neither arriving nor departing (無來無去),
Neither emerging nor entering (不出不入),
And **naturally abides forever** (自然常在).
Diligently practice this—
This is the **true Dao/Way** (真道路).
