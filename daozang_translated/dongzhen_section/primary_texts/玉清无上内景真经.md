### **The Jade Purity Supreme Inner Radiance Perfect Scripture**
*Transmitted by the Celestial Mother of Purple Radiance from the Great Luo Perfected Heaven and the Primordial Heaven of the Supreme Sage*

At that time, the Primordial Celestial Worthy, the Perfect and Great Sage, transformed and inaugurated the heavens. By his great divine power and great wisdom, he structured the cosmos, harmonized *yin* and *yang*, and governed creation.

First, within the Mysterious Void of the Great Brahma Perfected Heaven, he manifested external forms to reflect the inner radiance. He divided the *nine qi*, which took the color of the Wood essence of the East, coalescing into the Nine-*Qi* Venerable One to preside over them. In humans, this corresponds to the liver and the *hun*-soul.

Next, he divided the *seven qi*, which took the color of the Metal essence of the West, coalescing into the Seven-*Qi* Venerable One to preside over them. In humans, this corresponds to the lungs and the *po*-soul.

Then, he divided the *three qi*, which took the color of the Fire essence of the South, coalescing into the Three-*Qi* Venerable One to preside over them. In humans, this corresponds to the heart and the spirit.

Next, he divided the *five qi*, which took the color of the Water essence of the North, coalescing into the Five-*Qi* Venerable One to preside over them. In humans, this corresponds to the kidneys and essence.

The remaining *qi* of the four directions—Water, Fire, Metal, and Wood—were distributed at the center, taking the color of the Yellow Court. They coalesced into the One-*Qi* Venerable One to preside over them. In humans, this corresponds to the spleen and thought.

The five viscera contain consciousness and together possess the Ten Perfected. The essence of the Ten Perfected can accomplish the Nine Revolutions, gathering into the elixir and scattering as sweet dew. Circulating above and below, they refine and nourish the hundred bones, washing away turbidity to retain clarity, dissolving *yin* to forge *yang*, restoring my primordial state, and preserving my great wholeness. Emerging from Kunlun, entering the Great Abyss, guiding the dragon’s transformation, passing through the Tiger City, the four *qi* harmonize and unite to perfect my supreme truth. Decay is reversed into flourishing; old age returns to infancy. Withered countenance regains freshness; white hair turns black again. The voice rings like a bell; the body becomes light as a feather. All mortal bones are renewed, ascending in flight to the Upper Clarity.

Scholars of the world, establish precepts and uphold concentration to generate wisdom and clarity. By these Three Powers, you may eternally preserve countless years, treading the light and pure *qi*, wielding stillness and transformation to transcend as immortals.

The Two Mysteries, the Limitless True Sovereigns, widely disseminate this Dao among heaven and humanity, enabling them to abandon impermanent karma and enter the wondrous state of True Unity—neither aging nor dying, abiding in serene constancy.

The Primordial Celestial Worthy emitted great radiance from his seven orifices, illuminating boundless lands, the twelve thousand heavens, and the hundred billion worlds of humanity. Each, by their own power, scattered incense and scattered flowers in offering, all rejoicing and awakening to their original mind.

At that time, within the Mysterious Void of the Jade Purity Transformation Palace, a precious moon’s radiance suddenly appeared, illuminating the inner and outer ten directions. Within the precious moon, enveloped by purple *qi*, sat an infant upon a jeweled lotus dais. From its mouth issued golden light, and it uttered a great jade-like sound, reciting a gatha:

*"With one mind, true concentration arises;
Myriad forms naturally manifest.
Following the directions, the five *qi* divide;
The five *qi* conceive the one spirit.
The one spirit penetrates transformation,
Refining and coalescing the original truth.
The original truth has no form,
Yet neither is it nonexistent nor nothing.
Those who comprehend this principle
Truly awaken to the pearl that gathers dust."*

Within the Mysterious Void, inside the moon’s light, the Jade Infant expounded the teaching. Heaven above and heaven below all heard it at once. None failed to attain the stillness of the ocean of wisdom, their karmic mountains crumbling. Turning inward in reflection, they eternally realized the truth of the Dao.

Gazing up at the sacred radiance, they bowed in reverence and departed, holding fast to faith and devotion.
