**The Supreme Venerable Original Heavenly Worthy’s Scripture of Attaining Fruition**

At that time, the Supreme Venerable Original Heavenly Worthy was within the Jade Purity Palace, expounding the true scripture to the assembled immortals and perfected sages.

Should one transmit and receive it, their body shall radiate light; to their left, Heavenly Soldiers shall stand, and to their right, the Seven Stars. The Three Realms shall attend them as they receive this true scripture. Those who uphold and recite it shall cause the myriad ghosts to dissolve and become tranquil. By reciting this true scripture, one shall naturally attain longevity. The Five Emperors shall guard them, and through ten thousand kalpas, all shall be illuminated. As the kalpas turn, they shall roam freely in the Upper Clarity, their radiance surpassing that of the immortals. Those who receive it shall attain longevity. The wondrous records of the Mysterious True shall restrain and banish malevolent spirits. A thousand thousand shall have their heads severed, and ten thousand ten thousand shall have their forms cut down. Heavenly talismans and kalpa decrees shall sever the roots of ghosts and spirits, shattering their heads into seven parts and eradicating their origins. Those who cultivate with resolve shall receive the grace of the Celestial Emperor. The true scripture is subtle and wondrous, difficult to encounter and rare to hear.

The August Highest Lord, the Five Numinous Great Spirits—
The Three Realms shall execute and restrain them, and the roots of the Ten Evils shall be severed.
The Illuminating Lion of the Cavern shall guard the Dragon Gate.
The Jade True of the Three Realms—within the true, there is spirit.
Heavenly beings shall protect and defend, cutting off the hordes of demonic and perverse beings.
Transmit and receive it among the myriad people, and they shall endure through generation after generation.

The Dao declares: This *Scripture of Attaining Fruition*—should one read and recite it ten thousand times, the living shall attain longevity, and their household shall know felicity. The dead, their hidden souls, shall escape suffering, their bodies freed from evil destinies. All good and faithful men and women in the world ought to revere and practice it accordingly.
