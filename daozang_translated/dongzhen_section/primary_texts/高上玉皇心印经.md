**The Supreme Jade Emperor’s Heart-Seal Scripture**

Three supreme elixirs: spirit, qi, and essence.
Vague and indistinct, dim and obscure.
Preserve the void while holding to the real—
In an instant, perfection is achieved.

The wind returns, blending—
A hundred days’ work yields miraculous power.
Silent homage to the Celestial Sovereign—
In a decade, ascension soars.

The wise may grasp it easily;
The ignorant find it hard to practice.

Tread the celestial light, breathe to nurture purity.
Enter the dark, return to the womb—
As if lost, as if present.
Endless and unbroken, rooted deep and firm.

Each has his essence; essence unites with spirit.
Spirit unites with qi; qi unites with the True.
Without attaining the True, all else is mere pretension.

Spirit can penetrate stone, spirit can shift form.
Enter water—no drowning;
Enter fire—no burning.

Spirit follows form to live, essence swells with qi.
Unwithering, unbroken—
Like pine and cypress, evergreen.

One principle in three elixirs—
Wondrous beyond hearing.

When gathered, it exists;
When scattered, it vanishes.

The seven orifices connect—
Each orifice radiant.

On holy days and holy months,
Illuminating the Golden Court.

Once attained, forever held—
The body naturally lightens.

*Taihe* overflows—
Bones dissolve into cold jade.

Obtain the elixir, and life is eternal;
Fail, and all is lost.

The elixir dwells within the body—
Neither white nor green.

Recite it ten thousand times—
The wondrous principle reveals itself.
