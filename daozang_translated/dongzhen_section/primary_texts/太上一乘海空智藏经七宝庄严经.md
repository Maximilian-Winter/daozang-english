**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme One-Vehicle Scripture of the Ocean of Wisdom Treasury of Emptiness* (abbreviated as *Scripture of the Ocean of Emptiness*).

The *Zhenping Lun* by Xuanting of the Tang Dynasty records that Daoists Li Xing of Yizhou and Fang Chang of Lizhou jointly composed the *Scripture of the Ocean of Emptiness* in ten scrolls. According to sources, Li Yuanxing and Fang Huichang were both Daoists during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Tang. The base text is from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* section, *Benwen* category. Additionally, over ten fragmentary Dunhuang manuscripts exist, including P.2759.

**The Supreme One-Vehicle Scripture of the Ocean of Wisdom Treasury of Emptiness, Scroll 1**
*Chapter of the Preface* #1

At that time, the Ocean of Wisdom Treasury of Emptiness beheld the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Beginning traversing other realms, arriving at the wondrous peaks of the Land of Ultimate Bliss. Seated in right mindfulness beneath the Kāñcana grove, he was accompanied by one thousand three hundred disciples, all of whom had attained penetrating insight, comprehending without obstruction. In a single instant, they could reach the Three Realms, perceiving all the myriad phenomena—mountains and rivers, lands, the Six Paths, the Four Modes of Birth, the sentient and insentient—with perfect clarity. The Great Illumination of the Turning Wheel was fully realized in wisdom. Embracing all foreign realms and blending with all beings, they regarded the ten thousand kinds as equal, all utterly empty and quiescent.

Amidst the limpid vastness of the mysterious desert, they abided in profound stillness, contemplating with unwavering focus, dwelling in solemn reflection—thus were all myriad delusions barred from entry. His appellations were the Youth of Supreme Wisdom, the Radiant Wondrous Youth, the Youth of True Samādhi, and the Immortal Minister Youth, with suchlike as his retinue.

At that time, to the west of the land stood a great city named Treasure Assembly, encircling over four hundred *li* in circumference. This city’s adornments were unmatched in the world, surpassing the eight directions in splendor and magnificence. Its terrain was level and even, devoid of hills, pits, perilous mountains, or obstructing forests. Sweet fruits flourished abundantly, the branches of trees grew in perfect pairs, their blossoms and fruits fragrant, luxuriant through all four seasons, resplendent in vibrant hues like a forest of the seven treasures. At the slightest breeze, elegant melodies arose, and those who heard its sound were instantly purified, awakening to the Dao.

Within this city, the populace thrived in abundance, their dwellings connected roof to roof, door to door, with no vacant space between. At all three periods of the day, they expounded the most wondrous principles—namely, that all dharmas of the three times are like sighs, like scoffs, like hisses, like breaths, like calls, like inhalations, all utterly without substance. Such were the countless millions who gathered as his retinue, their voices of exposition resounding through heaven and earth.

To the southwest of the city dwelt a true adept, two thousand years in age, of dignified and peerless countenance, unmatched by any companion. His wealth of treasures enriched the entire city, while his wisdom and spiritual powers moved freely as he willed.

He would always sit in solemn stillness beneath a single tree. When midday arrived, boundless multitudes from all times would bow and present their doubts. Then the true adept would analyze each question in turn, leaving none displeased—they would depart with reverence, their heads bowed in gratitude. Such was his teaching and transformation, accumulated over many years. His propagation of the supreme truth reached everywhere, even liberating all birds and beasts. Having become the object of veneration for all things, the king and his consorts all paid homage and made offerings, his majesty and virtue towering, unmatched by gods or men. The people of the city together named the true adept "Ocean-Empty Wisdom Treasury." The reason for this was that his person was like the sea, his mind like emptiness, his principles embracing all beyond phenomena—thus he was called the Wisdom Treasury.

Upon hearing that the Heavenly Honored One had arrived in this land, his heart swelled with great joy, and he declared: "None in this kingdom can rival me; all their words and discourses fail to stir or inspire. I have long pondered matters that remain unresolved, with nowhere to seek answers, and have often sighed deeply over this. Now I hear that the Heavenly Honored One’s wisdom and virtue are supreme, his spiritual powers uniquely transcendent, his form and bearing radiant, his light and color dazzling. A single word from his mouth subdues all in the assembly; in guiding and receiving sentient beings, he never falters or retreats."

The lands he traversed all benefited thereby. Having heard his renown, I have long wished to pay homage. Today I shall command my chariot and proceed directly to his abode to consult on matters unresolved.

He then instructed his disciples to prepare all carriages, ensuring they were impeccably arrayed, without a trace of shabbiness. "At dawn tomorrow," he said, "I shall go to pay my respects to the Wise One."

Just then, a disciple named Doubt Arisen stepped forward and addressed his master: "Venerable One, why do you entertain such base thoughts? What does this mean—suddenly speaking thus? Your wisdom here is unmatched; not only do the king and his subjects revere you, but even within the Three Realms, your name is extolled. Why debase yourself by seeking out another for the Dharma? How could we bear this humiliation—following you to beg for teachings? What perverse folly! I pray you abandon this journey."

The master replied to Doubt Arisen: "Worthy one, do not cling so. Consider this: if a man stands atop a high terrace and gazes down, he sees the multitudes below, none of whom can reach him. Those multitudes, looking up from below, strain to see the heights, their aspirations cut short. The man on the terrace, believing himself supreme, declares, ‘Here I stand at the utmost peak, unrivaled and unsurpassed.’ Such is his delusion, for above him stretch the Twenty-Eight Heavens, the Three Clarities, and the Jade Capital—boundless and infinite. The multitudes below see only this height; unable to reach it, they claim none surpasses it, yet they too harbor a sense of inferiority. Though I am far removed from such a terrace, it is no different than if we dwelt in separate lands. To reach it would suffice—what more could one desire? Both the self-exalting man on the terrace and the self-deprecating multitudes below err equally. My wisdom surpasses that of the man on the terrace. Why then do you align yourself with the base-minded below? If he is my inferior, my visit to him incurs no loss of reputation; if he surpasses me, my journey brings great gain. Why deem this unreasonable?"

Upon hearing these words, Doubt Arisen’s mind opened, and his understanding deepened. He then prepared offerings for the journey: banners, canopies, palanquins, fragrant flowers, music, and countless wondrous treasures. At midday, they mounted their carriages and set forth. Their retinue of disciples numbered fifty thousand, all possessed of great wisdom, deeply versed in the sources of the Dharma, and lucid in the nature of emptiness—such as the emptiness that is not empty, the absence of self in phenomena, the non-abiding nature of things, and the unreality of forms.

Each disciple also prepared various treasures and offerings, accompanying their master as they journeyed together. Arriving at the mountain’s edge, they halted their carriages and rested, strolling leisurely through the marshes.

From the assembly, a disciple named Great Wisdom stepped forward, knelt, and addressed his master: "The path has been long, and we have traversed mountains and forests. Are you not weary? Today, I wish to pose a question; may the Great Master deign to hear my humble words."

The master replied: "Ask as you will, and I shall listen attentively."

Great Wisdom then said: "Great Master, your virtue is unfathomable to gods and men alike; all things revere you as they do their parents. The hearts of the multitude turn to you as their great refuge. Your discourses and teachings serve as a model for others; your words are weighty and not to be spoken lightly. If we meet this person, I first beg to engage him in debate. If I hold my own, you may remain silent, and your esteemed reputation will stand unchallenged, sparing you the effort of exchange. Is this not sound?"

The master answered: "What you say is not amiss."

Entering the mountains, they saw the Heavenly Honored One from afar—his radiance towering like the Diamond King, his brilliance illuminating the mountains as the rising sun. His majestic light and dignified bearing struck awe into all who beheld him. The master and his disciples were all astounded: some concealed themselves, some rejoiced, some trembled in fear, some blushed with shame, their hearts stirred in myriad ways, their intentions shifting.

Having arrived, they dismounted from their carriages and took their seats in order. Each was filled with trepidation, as if something had been lost. After a long while, the Heavenly Honored One’s countenance brightened, and he appeared to smile. His retinue then relaxed slightly, their breath steadying.

The disciple Great Wisdom rose and approached the Heavenly Honored One, standing before him to pay respects and inquire after his well-being: "Have your wanderings in the mountains caused you any harm?"

After the Heavenly Honored One had responded, Great Wisdom spoke again: "I have heard that your spiritual powers are sovereign, your eloquence unobstructed, and that you fully comprehend the affairs of beings across countless kalpas. Moreover, your wisdom perceives the desires and aspirations of all hearts without hindrance—hence you are called the Heavenly Honored One. Today, we wish to consult you on certain matters; may you expound broadly upon them."

The Heavenly Honored One then replied to Great Wisdom: "Excellent, excellent, good man, you speak rightly."

Great Wisdom then asked the Heavenly Honored One: "Among all dharmas, which is the foremost for attaining the fruit of the Way? Which is the foremost for attaining wisdom? Which is the foremost for attaining spiritual powers? Which is the foremost for attaining quiescence, the unconditioned, the unobstructed, the supreme and foremost? Among these four paths, how do their causes differ in cultivation? How do their attainments vary, and their accomplishments diverge? I pray you clarify and elucidate this, that we and the people of this land may cultivate accordingly."

The Heavenly Honored One replied to Great Wisdom: "Excellent is this question, excellent is this question. One who asks thus will surely serve as a great bridge, a great vessel, a great treasure chariot for all the world..."

Those capable of elevating the world to the rank of *rushi* (perfected beings), I shall now distinguish and explain for you, that those who have not yet heard may all come to hear and know, and thus attain liberation. Listen carefully and discern well.

Good son, the conduct of people in the Three Realms varies—some are restless, some tranquil; some foolish, some wise. Yet the foolish are not dull-witted by nature, nor are the wise endowed with sublime, responsive wisdom. Restlessness does not persist in constant motion, nor does tranquility persist in perpetual stillness. Judging by what prevails, there are degrees of superiority and inferiority. From these prevailing tendencies, names arise: the restless are called "restless people," the tranquil "tranquil people," the wise "wise people," and the foolish "foolish people."

Among these four dispositions, one may be wise yet restless, or foolish yet tranquil. Those who are wise yet restless cannot attain the fruit of the Way. Why is this so? Their wisdom is not yet complete, and restlessness compounds their agitation. With such limited wisdom, they pursue many paths. Their minds unsettled, good and evil become indistinguishable, and thus they fail to attain the Way.

What is the fruit of the Way? There are five kinds: the fruit of earthly immortals, the fruit of flying immortals, the fruit of self-mastery, the fruit of the untainted, and the fruit of the unconditioned. Though the intentions behind these five fruits differ, they all converge at a single source. To cultivate these fruits, one must employ a tranquil mind—tranquility and single-minded focus ensure success in practice.

What are these practices? The five fruits correspond to five endeavors, and the cultivator must understand their causes, conditions, and the intentions that guide them.

If one practices alchemical ingestion, fasting, refining the essence of the Dao’s flavor, yearning for mountain forests, concealing one’s form in seclusion, consuming mist and absorbing *qi*, forsaking rich delicacies, and abandoning fatty foods—lightening the body, strengthening its vigor, and escaping old age and death—this is called the *earthly immortal*.

If one is born into nobility or wealth, dwells in splendor, suffers no illness or distress, observes long fasts with vegetarian fare, and renounces lust—this, too, is called the *earthly immortal*.

If one is born with robust *qi* and strength, directs the mind to the root of the Dao, refrains from consuming living beings, practices the Dharma of compassion, and attains a lifespan of one hundred and twenty years—this is called the *earthly immortal*.

Those who strive for the fruit of earthly immortals must accumulate learning and maintain unwavering resolve. If one abandons alchemical practices midway, illness follows; if one abandons seclusion in forests and marshes, peril ensues. A mind burdened by excessive concerns cannot remain single-minded; a mind adrift cannot achieve deep tranquility. A mind lacking unity and thoughts lacking stillness cannot long dwell in renowned mountains, sipping from pine streams. Thus, earthly immortality demands tranquil focus. Even the foolish and unlearned, if they cultivate the methods described above without studying scriptures, may attain the fruit of earthly immortals.

Good son, if one practices the ten virtuous deeds, upholds precepts without transgression, aligns body and mind, fasts and abstains from grains, guards the six senses, avoids defilement, conducts oneself with integrity, maintains inner and outer consistency, traverses sacred peaks, and consumes cloud and mist—cultivating such arts—this is called the *flying immortal*.

By what mental effort is the fruit of flying immortals attained? It, too, requires a tranquil mind, steadfast and unshaken. Though one may not widely study the wondrous tones of the *Great Cavern*, a heart of unyielding purity—like a lapis lazuli bead, radiant within and without—can, through such cultivation, attain the fruit of flying immortals.

Good son, if one thoroughly comprehends precepts and observes manifold decorum, aligning body and mind with hidden standards, revered by gods and humans who offer homage without exception; if one wields spiritual powers and transformations, manifesting without limitation; and if one’s will and intention achieve all they seek—this is the path to the fruit of self-mastery.

Without consuming elixirs or herbs, one attains natural satiety. Should one wish to eat, sustenance arrives at the mere thought. In this world, one’s form and thought become autonomous, roaming mountains and marshes without fear, preserving long years free from illness and distress—this is called *self-mastery*.

By what mental effort is the fruit of self-mastery attained? One must cultivate the work of wisdom, also requiring a tranquil mind. Though the body may stir in response, the heart remains steadfast as a mountain, unshaken as the earth. Though one may not fully grasp the supreme methods of wisdom, through cultivating its causes one never grows weary, practicing spiritual penetrations and refining contemplative focus. Within this refined concentration, one can divide the body and respond to boundless calls. One who thoroughly comprehends these arts thereby attains the fruit of self-mastery.

Good son, if one fully illuminates and penetrates all dharmas, discerning the coarse and fine movements of others’ minds without error; if one can perceive the karmic conditions of all gods—their virtuous and unwholesome deeds, signs of decline and transformation, all actions and conduct—and thereby benefit immeasurable multitudes, instantly responding to those ready for liberation and delivering them all; if one constantly cultivates precepts and sublime scriptures, mastering all foundations of the Dao without omission; if one enters every gate of spiritual penetrations and every realm of wisdom, as well as the threshold between emptiness and existence; if one receives and upholds all scriptures of the Supreme Great Dao, free from afflictions—then all afflictions, such as those of wrong views, wrong faith, greed, hatred, and delusion, are wholly abandoned, with no lingering attachment.

There are five kinds of attachment: the eye’s attachment to forms, the ear’s to sounds, the tongue’s to sweetness, the nose’s to fragrances, and the body’s to smoothness. When all such attachments are eradicated without remainder, the six senses become pure. These six senses—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—when their faculties are clear, determine all that is received and contemplated as the profound scriptures of the Three Caverns.

There are also external fetters: the three fetters. The first is the fetter of obscurity when entering the realm of dharma. The second is the fetter of obstruction when following dharma companions. The third is the fetter of incompletion in all vows and practices. When these fetters are forever severed without residue, the mind becomes luminously open—this is the fruit of the *untainted*.

By what mental effort is the fruit of the untainted attained? One must cultivate wisdom. Though one may not fully attain all spiritual penetrations, one diligently practices the boundless gates of the Supreme’s immeasurable wisdom, refining contemplative focus and attaining clear illumination. With eloquence in expounding the Dharma, one liberates sentient beings, never regressing in this life or the future, gradually ascending the steps to the supreme Dao, which is no longer distant. Through such cultivation, one attains the fruit of the untainted path.

Good son, the fruit of *non-action* is the entry into the supreme gate of quiescence. Why is this so? Quiescence is non-action, and non-action is quiescence. What is quiescence? It is neither birth nor death, thus it abides eternally; neither destruction nor change, thus it responds to transformation. Non-action is action, and action is non-action; through non-action, action arises, and through action, one enters non-action. Quiescence is responsiveness, and responsiveness is quiescence; through quiescence, responsiveness arises, and through responsiveness, one returns to quiescence. Quiescence is the source of wondrous existence—though spoken of as "existence," it cannot be equated with nothingness. Since it is neither nothingness nor existence, it is called non-action. The discourse on non-action transcends all realms, hence it is called non-action.

By what mental effort is the fruit of non-action attained? One must perfect all varieties of wisdom and spiritual penetrations, fulfill all practices, and surpass gods and humans. It is neither existence nor non-existence, nor is it neither-existence nor neither-non-existence. Because nothing is perceived, it is deemed non-existence; because it responds, it is deemed existence. This is non-action—the supreme fruit.

Furthermore, good son, O Great Wisdom, having attained the root of great wisdom, one cultivates the three characteristics: the characteristic of existence, the characteristic of non-existence, and the characteristic of neither existence nor non-existence. By contemplating these characteristics, one enters the source of wisdom. Yet the observation of these three characteristics diverges.

Some beings contemplate from existence to enter non-existence. Some beings contemplate from non-existence to enter existence. Some beings, with resolute spirit, transcend these two characteristics and perceive the nature of existence and non-existence.

Good son, if there are beings who, as students of emptiness, constantly direct their minds from existence to observe non-existence, asserting, "I see all things—though they appear now, they must ultimately return to nothingness. Know that all is fundamentally void, without true substance, devoid of profound wisdom, devoid of contemplative wisdom, devoid of responsive wisdom." Know that such a person holds the view of annihilation, which, though resembling wisdom, deviates from its essence.

Good son, if there are beings who constantly direct their minds from non-existence to observe existence, asserting, "All things in this world arise from nothingness. Originally, they did not exist, yet now they do—by what cause do they arise? They must arise from nothingness. Thus, within nothingness, all things exist, and because they exist, all nothingness ceases to be." Know that such a person holds a narrow view, which, though resembling wisdom, loses its essence.

Good son, if there are beings who constantly direct their minds to contemplate existence and non-existence from the perspective of neither existence nor non-existence, asserting, "All beings in this world are neither existent nor non-existent. Why? If they are said to exist, they ultimately return to nothingness; if they are said to be nothing, they are presently seen to exist. If this is so, then their nature is indeterminate. Because their karma is indeterminate, they cannot be liberated."

The rewards of humans and heavens—know that the six destinies arise with form and perish with form. If one holds this view, it is a partial seeing, not true wisdom. These three views all lose the root of wisdom.

Good son, if there is one who contemplates the Three Realms with such a mind, observing all as nothingness—this is desolation, incapable of generating things, utterly unmoving, unable to respond. Good son, it is like a great mountain that well stirs the clouds, and the clouds bring forth rain. From such examples, know decisively that from existence arises existence, and from nothingness arises nothingness.

Again, observing existence clings to form and substance; this form and substance are truly existent. Apart from this form and substance, there is no place to name existence. Further observing neither existence nor non-existence—good son, it is like the sound of wind, its resonance pervading everywhere. Such examples show that the substance of wind is not nothing, yet it cannot be grasped. If one claims it truly exists, it is not obstructive. Echoes are likewise. Know that such examples are neither existent nor non-existent. If a learner holds this view, they too lose the root of wisdom.

Good son, if there is one who observes the three characteristics with four kinds of intention—subtle non-existence, subtle existence, coarse non-existence, and coarse existence—understanding these four intentions, one naturally sees neither existence nor non-existence. What is subtle non-existence? It is the nature of the Dao. For what reason is the principle of Dao-nature called subtle non-existence? Because it is profoundly quiescent and responsive. If one abides in the realm of profound quiescence and observes all existences, one sees no characteristics. If one abides in the realm of responsiveness and observes all existences, one sees characteristics.

Good son, if one claims the Dao-nature is entirely non-existent, it still responds; if one claims the Dao-nature is entirely existent, it is truly tranquil. Therefore, know that the existence of Dao-nature is not worldly existence, and the non-existence of Dao-nature is not worldly non-existence. This is called subtle non-existence. For what reason does one observe subtle existence? It is responsiveness, the beginning of the Dharma-body, flourishing and arising, transcending the Three Realms. Though it has substance, it is not like the ordinary. For this reason, it is called subtle existence.

Good son, for what reason does one observe coarse non-existence? Coarse non-existence is simply nothingness—without response, without correspondence, an empty and desolate place, utterly void. This is called coarse non-existence. Good son, for what reason does one observe coarse existence? Coarse existence is obstructive substance. Because it is obstructive, it is called coarse existence.

Good son, if one can thoroughly understand these four intentions and discern their essence and characteristics, know that this person has come to understand neither existence nor non-existence. For what reason is this known? By tracing the Dao-nature, its meaning can be sought. If a learner practices observing the three characteristics and comprehends these four intentions, they enter the treasure city of wisdom, wander the chamber of wisdom, sit upon the seat of wisdom, and feast on the food of wisdom—this is obtaining the root of the mechanism of wisdom.

Furthermore, good son, excellent indeed, Great Wisdom, you have attained the power of spiritual penetrations through practicing the meaning of subtle contemplation, profound and vast, difficult to debate. For this reason, it is called subtle contemplation. All beings attain the power of spiritual penetrations through nothing other than this. If one attains great samadhi and wields this spiritual power, it is like the wind fanning a fire—within a single thought, all ceases together. Know that subtle contemplation generates various wisdoms of spiritual penetrations.

There are two kinds of spiritual penetrations. What are the two? The first is spontaneously possessing spiritual penetrations, clearly illuminating all, able to know and see, responding to conditions as they arise, not requiring entry into samadhi, naturally complete. In an instant, it generates countless transformations, freely following the mind, never contrary to intention. Such spiritual penetrations are the supreme power. The second kind of spiritual penetration arises from subtle contemplation and exists through samadhi. Without entering samadhi, it cannot arise, manifesting various transformations—this is a secondary power. Yet both these penetrations rely on subtle contemplation to be complete. With long accumulation and practice, one naturally becomes effortlessly and spontaneously transformative.

If a learner seeks spiritual penetrations, they should rightly contemplate the Dao of subtle contemplation, which is the source of spiritual transformations.

Furthermore, good son, excellent indeed, Great Wisdom, seeking quiescent extinction, non-action, and unimpededness—all arise from perfecting various wholesome thoughts and actions, possessing majestic spiritual power, accomplishing boundless merits and virtues. Cultivating boundless practices, the root of all Dao, spiritual power and freedom, penetrating transformations, the essence and characteristics are subtle and wondrous, like pure vaidūrya. All gods and humans, when moved, must respond. Liberating and delivering the four kinds of birth, none are not freed. This is the root of the Dao, the source of wisdom, quiescent extinction, non-action, and unimpededness.

For what reason is it called quiescent extinction? Good son, quiescent extinction is not empty void. Because it is empty and void, it is unstained by the Three Realms, its conduct transcending the mundane. All dharmas cannot disturb it—this is quiescent extinction. Good son, non-action means all myriad things cannot act upon it as a moving function. Its appearance is clear and desolate, its substance profoundly mysterious—this is non-action. Good son, unimpededness means all myriad things cannot obstruct it. Its responsiveness is subtle, its power all-pervading—this is unimpededness. Among these four paths, quiescent extinction is supreme. Therefore, learners should cultivate such various merits and virtues.

Then, Great Wisdom, having heard these words, generated great reverence and admiration, his heart and words in accord: "Ah! Great Virtue, your eloquence is penetrating and free, unimpeded, able to open and develop my wisdom—truly delightful!" He further addressed him: "Great Virtue, Heavenly Honored One, with such majestic spiritual power, attaining fearlessness, possessing great spiritual penetrations, able to deliver ordinary and worthy ones into the right path, traversing the Three Realms, supreme and unmatched."

Today, filled with reverence, I rank you with my teacher." Thereupon, he untied the precious guiding pearl necklace from his upper robe and offered it to the Heavenly Honored One, saying, "Great Virtue, I pray you accept my offering as a token of my sincere devotion."

At that time, the Heavenly Honored One replied to Great Wisdom, "I now dwell in these deep mountains and remote valleys. Such precious and resplendent adornments are unnecessary. To accept them in vain would be wasteful."

Great Wisdom spoke again, "The sage appears in the world, his heart free from vanity or superficiality. For what profound reason does he manifest this body? Why remain hidden in these secluded valleys? I now wish to invite you to journey through this troubled land, which is why I offer this robe."

Then, the Heavenly Honored One silently declined, and in that very moment, transformed the offering into thirty-six thousand white jade guiding necklaces with azure pearls, thirty-six thousand golden guiding necklaces with crimson pearls, thirty-six thousand lapis lazuli guiding necklaces with white pearls, thirty-six thousand agate guiding necklaces with black pearls, and thirty-six thousand amber guiding necklaces with yellow pearls. Such guiding necklaces filled the space beneath his seat, beyond count. He then addressed Great Wisdom, "Do you see among these the multitude of great guiding pearls and necklaces?"

Great Wisdom replied, "Heavenly Honored One, I see them clearly. How is it that such treasures and guiding necklaces have arisen here? Ah! What wondrous spiritual power has brought forth this abundance! How marvelous, Heavenly Honored One, that such auspicious signs have manifested!"

At that time, the Heavenly Honored One answered Great Wisdom, "I appear in the world to serve as the great guiding master for all beings in darkness, decisively leading countless beings out of the sea of birth and death. How then could such precious guiding treasures be considered strange?" Immediately, with his spiritual power, he gathered all the guiding treasures into one. This single guiding treasure filled the entire void, its luminous radiance illuminating all, beyond description.

The assembly of Ocean-void Wisdom Treasury and his retinue all bowed in reverence, none daring to speak. Then, from among the crowd, a disciple named Foremost Foot stepped forward, prostrated before his teacher, and said, "Great Teacher, I have followed you for over a hundred years, humbly receiving your kindness, ascending the hall and entering the inner chamber. Yet never have I witnessed such extraordinary spiritual powers and auspicious signs. Why then does this great virtue suddenly leap in praise? I pray, Great Teacher, exert your wisdom and manifest wondrous signs, that all in this assembly may see and extol them."

At that time, Ocean-void Wisdom Treasury replied to Foremost Foot, "Do not be arrogant or seek superiority. Why? The Heavenly Honored One is majestic, his radiant signs peerless—how could worldly beings compare or equal him? I may yet consult him on my doubts to resolve them. How could I lightly boast of my meager spiritual powers? Say no more."

Then, from the assembly, another named Wondrous Thought stepped forward, joined his palms, bowed at the Heavenly Honored One’s feet, and asked, "Though I am foolish and base, I wish to consult you. I pray, Great Virtue, have compassion and grant your teaching."

The Heavenly Honored One replied to Wondrous Thought, "Excellent, excellent! Ask whatever you wish. I shall explain each matter clearly, that you may fully understand."

Wondrous Thought said, "Great Virtue and Sage Teacher, by what causes and conditions do all things come to be born and die? Why are there the foolish and the wise, those of great power, those of great beauty, the noble and the base, those without dignity, those respected by others, and those held in contempt? Such variations are endless. Are these the fruits of planted causes? Or are they the karmic retributions of cultivated practices? When I reflect, it is difficult to discern clearly. I pray you have compassion and grant a merciful answer."

At that time, the Heavenly Honored One replied to Wondrous Thought, "Excellent, excellent, good son! A great and virtuous scholar indeed, to raise such a profound question. I shall now explain each point clearly, leaving no doubts.

"Wondrous Thought, know this: It is like a person speaking into the empty void, their voice echoing in the valley, returning without deviation. If coarse words are spoken, the echo returns coarse; if kind words are spoken, the echo returns kind; if singing, the echo returns singing; if weeping, the echo returns weeping; if loud, the echo returns loud; if soft, the echo returns soft; if moderate, the echo returns moderate. If calling out, in countless ways, the voice responds in kind, echoing without fail, in thousands upon thousands of instances, never erring.

"Good son, the various good and evil deeds of people in this world are likewise—all arise from the actions of past lives, bearing their fruits. This is no different from the echo following the voice. If in a past life one cultivated a heart of compassion, saving and delivering all beings, in this life they gain great power and virtue, respected by all. If one was deceitful and venomous, lacking compassion, in this life they lack dignity and are not loved by others.

"If in a past life one made offerings to the Three Jewels, cultivated generosity and precepts, diligence, patience, contemplation, and wisdom—such practices—then in this life they gain the power of wholesome karma, spiritual wisdom, fearlessness, and all good roots.

"Good son, if in a past life one universally aided beings, they gain the reward of long life without illness. If in a past life one harmed beings, they gain the retribution of sickness, suffering, and short life. Such karmic fruits are countless, beyond enumeration. All arise from the causes of past lives, bearing these retributions, just as the echo follows the voice, without difference.

"Furthermore, Wondrous Thought, it is like a shadow, which arises from form. If the form is long, the shadow is long; if short, the shadow is short; if large, the shadow is large; if small, the shadow is small. The shadow cannot depart from the form..."

"The size of the form cannot conceal the shadow. All worldly beings experience differing karmic fruits in just this way. Good son, if in a past life one planted small causes, the retribution is small; if large, the retribution is large. Like compass and square, like inked line and marking cord, they correspond precisely, without the slightest deviation. Wondrous Thought, you should understand that the arising of good and evil is like echo and shadow, never departing from form and sound."

Then, Wondrous Thought, hearing these words, conceived a doubt. Adjusting his robe and headdress, he composed his mind and focused his thoughts, then addressed the Heavenly Venerable once more: "Great Virtuous and Sacred Master, the echo responds to the voice—this is indeed as you have so wondrously explained. Yet if one utters a small sound in a deep mountain or secluded valley, where forests and barriers layer thickly, the echo returns greatly amplified. If one utters a great sound in a small chamber or vessel, the echo returns diminished. Though the sound itself is no different, why does the response vary? Moreover, in an open field, though one may emit a sound, there is no echo at all. Why, in such places, does a mighty sound go forth yet find no response? If we extend this analogy, we must conclude that whether the cause be sinful or meritorious, they are equal and without difference—yet some yield great fruit, some small fruit, and some no fruit at all, just as with the emission of sound. At the moment of emission, whether great or small, the sound is the same, yet the echoing response differs according to the place. Again, like form and shadow: when the form meets slanted light, its shadow lengthens; when it meets direct light, its shadow shortens; when it meets no light, its shadow vanishes. Though the form itself does not change, the shadow varies in length and presence. If we extend this analogy, whether the cause be meritorious or sinful, they are equal and without difference—yet some yield long-lasting fruit, some short-lived fruit, and some no fruit at all. Great Virtue, your comparison to echoes and shadows does not accord with principle. If it were not so, it would not be a true analogy. The assembly is perplexed; we humbly beseech your explanation."

Then, the Heavenly Venerable, his mind joyful and at ease, replied to Wondrous Thought: "Excellent is this question! It gives rise to the doubts of the multitude, and its skillful benefit cannot be measured. Now listen carefully and ponder deeply. You ask me why, though the actions are no different, the retribution varies. The principle is indeed as you have said—just as you have said. Why is this so?"

If there are worldly people who take lives, the act of taking a life is no different—yet if they kill a true practitioner, a virtuous person, a Daoist, or one of great virtue, the sin is profound and weighty. Why is this so? Such persons serve as teachers and models for others, benefiting all beings, liberating them from the suffering of birth and death. Without them, all beings would remain trapped in the afflictions of the three evil destinies and the eight difficulties. To take such a life is to sever the roots of goodness for all beings. Thus, the sin is multiplied manyfold. If one kills those of the five rebellious acts, the wicked, or the malevolent—such as these—the sin lies only in the taking of life, not in the harm to goodness. In this case, the karmic retribution is lighter and lesser. Though the act of taking life follows these two paths, identical in form, the retribution differs. It is like the emission of sound: though the sound is the same, the echo varies in size depending on where it resounds.

Again, consider almsgiving: all acts of generosity and offering are meritorious deeds, equal and without difference. Yet if one gives to a true practitioner, a virtuous person, a Daoist, or one of great virtue, the karmic reward is vast and weighty. Why is this so? Such persons propagate teachings and transform the world, delivering beings and benefiting all things. To give to them is to provide the bridge and beam of the Dharma for all beings, the path to the Dao. Know then that the blessings gained are boundless. If one gives to the wicked, those of the four grave offenses, the four afflictions, or the five rebellious acts, though the act of giving is the same, the reward is uncertain. If one gives with a heart of compassion, the merit gained still does not equal that of giving to the virtuous. If one provides for all evil persons with a mind of generosity, the sin incurred is instead great and unlike the former. Why is this so? Because one nourishes and sustains the wicked, thereby harming all things—such giving is no different from harming all things. Thus, though the act of giving is not distinct, the retribution differs. Good man, it is like the emission of sound: though the sound is the same, the echo varies in size depending on where it resounds.

Again, consider the taking of life with an indeterminate mind. If the killer bears no resentment, feels no joy, and simply takes the life without generating either good or ill will in the process, the sin incurred is slightly lighter. Why is this so? Because the heart holds no malice.

Just as a sound emitted in empty space is not without an echo, yet its resonance is faint and inaudible to the ear, so too do beings who commit offenses with an indeterminate mind not escape retribution—though their sin does not become manifest.

Again, consider the act of giving with an indeterminate mind. If, when bestowing alms, one does not arouse a mind of vast relief, nor a mind of deliverance, nor a mind of compassion, nor a mind of joy, nor a mind of envy, nor a mind of surpassing others, nor a mind of boasting, nor a mind of gratitude, nor a mind of stinginess—if one’s giving is like casting dung into the great sea—then know that such a person gains but meager merit. Why is this so? Because there is no good intention. Just as a sound emitted in empty space is not without an echo, yet its resonance is faint and does not reach the ear, so too does one who performs good deeds with an indeterminate mind not fail to gain merit—though that merit does not become manifest. For this reason, what you have said is not mistaken.

Upon hearing this, Miaosi was suddenly enlightened, his mind free of doubt and entanglement. He attained understanding, returned to his seat, and rejoiced with exultation.

At that moment, another in the assembly, named Zuisheng, arose—majestic in bearing, towering above the crowd, foremost disciple of Haikong Zhizang, having mastered the Ten Transformations: the Transformation of No Sorrow, the Transformation of Pure Mind, the Transformation of Dispelling Obstruction, the Transformation of Penetrating the Classics, the Transformation of Attaining Understanding, the Transformation of Clear Vision, the Transformation of Skilled Means, the Transformation of Comprehending Conditions, the Transformation of Great Illumination, and the Transformation of Perfection. He possessed supernatural powers: the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and hand. He was endowed with eloquence: the Eloquence of Understanding Intent, the Eloquence of Resolving Afflictions, the Eloquence of Severing Anguish, the Eloquence of Discerning Marks, and the Eloquence of Probing the Profound. Possessing the highest wisdom, he was revered as the crown of the nation.

Rising from his seat, he approached the Heavenly Venerable, paid homage, stood upright with reverence, and fixed his gaze unwaveringly. With single-minded devotion, he addressed the Heavenly Venerable: "For many years, I have diligently studied and accumulated merit, concentrating my thoughts to comprehend the profound Dao. Though I have had questions, I dared not speak first. Today, seeing how Great Wisdom and Miaosi posed their doubts, and how the Heavenly Venerable, in your compassion, bestowed your discerning answers—clarifying principles so that all who heard immediately understood without further obstruction—I am filled with boundless joy. It is like one who, having suffered a grave illness, suddenly recovers as if restored to health. My joy is likewise. Or like one who, having long been parted from parents, unexpectedly encounters them again. My joy is likewise. Or like one who, after days of famine, suddenly comes upon a feast of delicacies. My joy is likewise.

"Yet, Heavenly Venerable, I still harbor a doubt. It is like a man afflicted with a grievous illness, lying upon his sickbed, unable to eat or drink, his breath and life nearly spent. Suddenly, from the empty sky, a vessel brimming with sweet dew medicine appears at his head. The man is startled, suspecting it to be a ghostly poison or a demonic calamity. Or perhaps he wonders if it is a gift from the gods. Hesitating to drink, he wavers—until a benevolent spirit speaks from the void, declaring it a wondrous medicine. Only then does he rejoice, take the medicine, and drink, whereupon his illness vanishes.

"So too am I. Though my doubts have long lingered, upon hearing the Heavenly Venerable’s teaching, I have not yet fully understood. Discerning its nature, my heart remains hesitant, and I dare not accept it outright. If I were to hear further clarification, my mind would be thoroughly enlightened, clear and free of doubt.

"Or consider one who wishes to journey to a distant land but is separated by a great river. Gazing longingly at the far shore, which seems immeasurably distant, he is filled with sorrow and distress, unable to restrain himself. Then, the Benevolent Spirit King, appearing on the riverbank, manifests a boat fully equipped with oars and poles, lacking nothing. A voice from within calls out, offering passage. The man is startled: 'I have waited here so long, searching in vain for a boat—how could one suddenly appear? Surely this is a demon luring me into the water, or some illusory trick that will later harm me. Better to die here than to be deceived and perish in regret.' At that moment, the Benevolent Spirit King transforms into a flying immortal and, amidst the clouds, cries out: 'This is a benevolent spirit seeking to save your life. Cross without fear.' Hearing this, the man rejoices immeasurably, his heart at ease. He boards the boat and safely reaches the far shore.

"So too am I today. Having heard the Heavenly Venerable expound the supreme and wondrous Dharma, I cannot yet fully comprehend it, and my heart remains hesitant. If I were to hear further clarification, I would be free of doubt and regret.

"Heavenly Venerable, Great Sage, if you know the doubt in my heart, I beg you to dispel it, that I may be at peace, free of entanglement."

Then the Heavenly Venerable addressed Zuisheng: "Excellent, excellent, good man. I now know the doubt in your heart. You wonder: 'All beings receive their bodily form due to past karma. Their actions—whether good or evil—and the conditions of their karma are all established by prior causes. It is like form and sound producing echoes. Without form or sound, there would be no echo. Yet if, as the Heavenly Venerable has said today, all beings at the inception of consciousness have no good or evil, how then do they come to differ in goodness and evil, beauty and ugliness, nobility and baseness?' Is this the doubt that binds your heart?"

When Zuisheng heard these words, he was struck with awe, his heart trembling, unable to speak for a long while. Then the Heavenly Venerable asked: "Is this not the doubt in your heart?"

Zuisheng replied: "Great Sage, Heavenly Venerable, only today have I realized that in this world there exists a Venerable One of great wisdom, a Great Illuminator. I rejoice that this world has gained the Supreme Teacher, the Great Guide, the Great Vessel, the Great Eye of Wisdom, the Great Dharma City."

All the world shall now be delivered from fear, from the five destinies, from craving and desire, from sorrow and lamentation, from the three obstructions, from defilement and impurity, from all karmic entanglements. My joy today knows no bounds. Until now, I have indeed harbored such doubts. I pray the Heavenly Venerable will expound and clarify. Once my doubts are dispelled, I shall not only find liberation myself but also bring benefit to the heavenly and human multitudes of the present and future.

Then the Heavenly Venerable proclaimed in a loud voice: "All who have come here today, give ear with single-minded attention to what I shall say." Thus he called three times: "All who have come here today, give ear with single-minded attention to what I shall say. Let no slackness arise, nor let your thoughts wander to other matters."

"Here in this assembly sits a great perfected one named Zuisheng, whose heart is bound by doubt. As I have said, I shall now analyze the principle for him with utmost clarity. Therefore, all of you should heed these words well, that you may gain immeasurable and inconceivable blessings."

"Zuisheng, you must understand: the karmic nature of all beings in the six destinies and four modes of birth, at the inception of consciousness, is purely good, undefiled, and singular, of one body with the Dao, moving in accord with the Dao. In their actions—whether walking, standing, rising, or reclining; speaking, silent, eating, or resting—they all conform to the true principle. Just as a fish, at its first birth, naturally takes to rivers and lakes without need of instruction, or as jade is inherently white, indigo inherently blue, fire inherently hot, and water inherently cold—these qualities are not acquired through learning but are naturally so by principle—so too, at the inception of consciousness, all beings are endowed with the natural Dao-nature, spontaneously in accord with it, without any distinction."

"How then do they come to generate the various evil conditions and suffer the retributions of hell, hungry ghosts, and beasts? You must know that all these arise from the six roots. What are the six roots? The eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind."

"The eye-root, through conditions, becomes attached to forms and contacts. The characteristics of form cling and entangle, their principles manifold, and all manner of forms enter the eye-root. From this condition, the eye-root generates outflows. Once outflows arise and interact, they give birth to measureless and boundless dharmas, some good, some evil. From this indeterminate cause, evil fruits arise."

"The ear-root, through conditions, is likewise attached to sounds and contacts. The characteristics of sound cling and entangle, their principles manifold, and all manner of sounds enter the ear-root. From this condition, the ear-root generates outflows. Once outflows arise and interact, they give birth to measureless and boundless dharmas, some good, some evil. From this indeterminate cause, evil fruits arise."

"The nose-root, through conditions, is likewise attached to fragrances and contacts. The characteristics of fragrance cling and entangle, their principles manifold, and all manner of fragrances enter the nose-root. From this condition, the nose-root generates outflows. Once outflows arise and interact, they give birth to measureless and boundless dharmas, some good, some evil. From this indeterminate cause, evil fruits arise."

"The tongue-root, through conditions, is likewise attached to flavors and contacts. The characteristics of flavor cling and entangle, their principles manifold, and all manner of flavors enter the tongue-root. From this condition, the tongue-root generates outflows. Once outflows arise and interact, they give birth to measureless and boundless dharmas, some good, some evil. From this indeterminate cause, evil fruits arise."

"The body-root, through conditions, is likewise attached to textures—fine and smooth—and contacts. The characteristics of the body cling and entangle, their principles manifold, and all manner of textures enter the body-root. From this condition, the body-root generates outflows. Once outflows arise and interact, they give birth to measureless and boundless dharmas, some good, some evil. From this indeterminate cause, evil fruits arise."

"The mind-root, through conditions, is likewise attached to clinging and entanglements. Due to clinging, its principles are manifold, and all manner of clinging enters the mind-root. From this condition, the mind-root generates outflows. Once outflows arise and interact, they give birth to measureless and boundless dharmas, some good, some evil. From this indeterminate cause, evil fruits arise."

"Zuisheng, you must know that the arising of the three evil destinies is due to the six roots, six contacts, six feelings, and six defilements. These four great knots give rise to the various karmic causes of good and evil, amplify the manifold sufferings of the three evil destinies, and can alter the originally pure and good foundation from beginningless time. For this reason, all beings initially plant the seeds of their afflictions through the six roots. Once afflictions arise, they condition further arising without cessation."

"You must all understand that the six roots are a calamity beyond measure. Therefore, those who study the Dao must guard and discipline the six roots, never allowing them to wander in careless attachment to phenomena."

When these words were spoken, another great perfected one in the assembly, named Jueli, rose from his seat and approached the Heavenly Venerable. Prostrating himself with his head to the ground, he bowed and said: "Heavenly Venerable, you have just declared that at the inception of consciousness, all beings are purely good and undefiled, their actions necessarily in accord with principle, their movements in harmony with truth. In their advancing and retreating, rising and reclining, there is no lapse of propriety. Every dharma conforms to the essence of the Dao, without distinction. If this is so, how then do beings, in what they see and hear, in their movements and actions, become stained by coarse and defiled matters?"

"Venerable One, it is like a hall of ice, its beams and pillars, its mats and curtains, all formed of frozen ice. How, within such a place, could fire arise? How could the afflictions of heat and vexation come to be?"

At the inception of consciousness, all beings are likewise thus—pure in their mutual goodness, undivided and unadulterated. How then, through the six senses, do they become defiled? How do they cultivate evil and incur the fruits of sin?

Moreover, Venerable One, it is like lapis lazuli, which shines through within and without, its surface and interior entirely free of stain or blemish. The inception of consciousness is also thus: inherently good, and what it cultivates is likewise good. How then does it reap the manifold fruits of evil?

Again, Venerable One, it is like a casket of a hundred blended incenses, from which fragrance overflows, without a trace of foul or putrid odor. The inception of consciousness is also thus: inherently pure and fragrant, with no place for filth or impurity.

Again, Venerable One, it is like the radiant brilliance of sunlight, within which there is no darkness. The inception of consciousness is also thus: inherently luminous and clear. How then do brightness and obscurity come to be used together?

I now harbor this doubt: in the world, beings do not reject goodness yet commit boundless evils. I only pray that the Great Virtue will resolve this for me, that all in this assembly may be thoroughly cleansed and freed from all doubts and obstructions.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Venerable answered serenely: "Decisive Principle Perfected One, such a pointed question is beyond reckoning. You have all once drawn near to boundless and innumerable Perfected Ones, made offerings to boundless and innumerable Heavenly Venerables, attained great wisdom, and gained unhindered clarity. Thus are you able to utter these subtle and wondrous words. I shall now explain the truth of the matter in full. Listen carefully and do not grow weary.

Decisive Principle Great Perfected One, the nature of the human mind cannot be wholly likened to ice, lapis lazuli, or incense. The reason is this: such things are all static phenomena, their substance tranquil and unchanging, incapable of transformation, and thus their essence cannot generate anything else. Because they are static causes, external things cannot enter them. These analogies are therefore flawed. The analogy of the sun, however, may be apt. The reason is this: the sun is not perpetually bright, its body not perpetually upright; at times it is eclipsed, at times it declines and vanishes. The nature of the mind is likewise: shifting and unstable, driven by defilements, coveting self-interest, delighting in one’s own well-being, the eye coveting beautiful forms, the ear coveting beautiful sounds, the nose coveting beautiful fragrances, the tongue coveting delicious tastes, the body coveting pleasant touches, and the mind coveting ease and pleasure—all these are suffering. Whatever is coveted becomes the greatest suffering. Why is this so?

The eye covets beautiful forms, and each person’s mind generates manifold thoughts. If one constantly attains them, it harms the mind and thought, knowing only covetousness and love while forgetting the original goodness. If one does not constantly attain them, manifold desires and calculations arise. Seeing others with beautiful forms, one wishes to possess them all. Such beings directly bring upon themselves boundless afflictions—how much more so when their desires are not immediately fulfilled.

The ear covets beautiful sounds, and each person’s mind generates manifold thoughts. If one constantly attains them, it disturbs the mind and thought, knowing only covetousness and love while forgetting the original goodness. If one does not constantly attain them, manifold desires and calculations arise. Hearing others with beautiful voices, one wishes to hear them all. Such beings directly bring upon themselves boundless afflictions—how much more so when their desires are not immediately fulfilled.

The nose covets beautiful fragrances, and each person’s mind generates manifold thoughts. If one constantly attains them, it corrupts the mind and thought, knowing only covetousness and love while forgetting the original goodness. If one does not constantly attain them, manifold desires and calculations arise. Smelling others’ beautiful fragrances, one wishes to inhale them all. Such beings directly bring upon themselves boundless afflictions.

The tongue covets delicious tastes, and each person’s mind generates manifold thoughts. If one constantly attains them, it troubles the mind and thought, knowing only covetousness and love while losing the original goodness. If one does not constantly attain them, manifold desires and calculations arise. Tasting others’ delicious flavors, one wishes to consume them all. Such beings directly bring upon themselves boundless afflictions.

The body covets pleasant touches, clinging to softness and smoothness, and each person’s mind generates manifold thoughts. If one constantly attains them, it vexes the mind and thought, knowing only the movement of the mind, habituated to love and softness, while losing the original goodness. If one does not constantly attain them, manifold desires and calculations arise. Seeing others with fine textures, one wishes to attach them to oneself. Such beings directly bring upon themselves boundless afflictions.

The mind is unstable, clinging to manifold thoughts. All conditions enter the mind, which then clings to the senses, ceaselessly coming and going. If all accords with the mind, arrogance and indulgence arise; if it opposes the mind, anger and resentment arise. Through these causes and conditions, beings directly bring upon themselves boundless afflictions.

Decisive Principle, know this: all in the world who remain tranquil and at ease, who do not cultivate superior practices, do not contemplate the true Dao, do not practice the six penetrations of supreme wisdom, do not delight in diligence, and do not plant the seeds of blessings—indulging instead in the six senses and led by the six emotions—naturally fall into the currents of the three evil destinies. The reason is this: the six senses and six defilements can generate boundless and manifold causes of sin, beyond reckoning. Thus, it is not that the inception of consciousness cultivates wickedness and incurs the fruits of sin; nor is it that seeing evil generates the fruits of sin; nor is it that hearing evil generates the fruits of sin. It is simply that the six defilements themselves give rise to all transgressions. Gradually growing, they lead to the manifold causes of hell, animal rebirth, and hungry ghosts.

Decisive Principle, know this: in a past age, there was a land called Sun-Earth. This kingdom was prosperous and joyful, like the heavens of the desire realm. Its people were boundless, all living in peace and happiness, constantly cultivating the wondrous Dao, and none failed to recite the teachings of the Three Caverns. In this land there was a king named Crown-Restrainer. This king was enlightened, possessed of great spiritual power, and in his walking, sitting, rising, and reclining, he displayed manifold transformations."

Suddenly, before the throne, a lotus flower appeared, its thousand petals lush and resplendent, its radiance dazzling. King Crown-Restrainer rose in astonishment, bowed to the flower, and in an instant, from within its petals emerged a boy, aged five or six, of unparalleled beauty, without equal in the Three Realms. Seeing this, the king immediately commanded that he be taken in and raised, naming him Transformation-Born. As he grew to maturity, his wisdom waxed like the moon, his spiritual powers were unhindered, and none in the boundless lands failed to submit to him. Whatever he sought or desired was fully granted. King Crown-Restrainer, revering his towering virtue and power, abdicated his throne and entrusted the kingdom to Transformation-Born. All gods and humans rejoiced, honoring and esteeming him without weariness.

One day, he assembled his ministers, kinsmen, state preceptors, Daoist masters, and scholars of the profound and the classical for a grand feast and discourse that lasted from dawn to dusk. Transformation-Born, the great king, raised his voice and declared: "In this land of ours, all is at ease, and we enjoy peace and happiness without decline. Yet I have heard of a land in the east called the Great Hall Village, the World of Received Goodness. Though I have heard its name, I have not seen its form. I wish to journey there with you all, to observe its customs and its people. Would this be acceptable?"

All the ministers replied in unison: "Great King, your spiritual powers are unhindered—what doubt could there be in your desire to survey all? We, too, wish to rely on your majestic might and witness the wonders of that land together."

At that moment, without rising from his seat, he employed his spiritual power and arrived there in an instant, accompanied by his ministers and his palace. Upon reaching that land, the king of Received Goodness ordered his chariot to go forth and welcome them. From afar, he bowed in reverence, inquired after their well-being, and together they returned to the city, where a great high seat was prepared. This seat was vast and boundless, beyond the reckoning of the world. Transformation-Born ascended and sat upon it, emitting radiant light and performing manifold divine transformations. Throughout the land, he manifested four hundred million jeweled banners, each forty thousand *li* in height. Atop each banner shone a great light, illuminating all with such brilliance that the radiance of the sun and moon was eclipsed and rendered useless. Seeing this light, all the people marveled, saying to one another: "How is it that such a wondrous sign has suddenly appeared in our land?" They gathered in groups of five or three, discussing and debating, yet none could fully explain it.

Then Transformation-Born thundered with a great voice, proclaiming to the people: "You may ride this light and enter the royal city." As soon as these words were spoken, all within the kingdom heard them. Following the light, each arrived at the king’s presence. There they saw Transformation-Born seated upon the high seat, and all bowed their heads in reverence, standing with respect. Once the assembly was complete, Transformation-Born raised his voice and declared: "Let all here know that the nature of all dharmas cannot be eternally preserved—they must decay and pass away according to conditions. Do not think this land’s happiness is secure, for there are countless lands more excellent than this. If one cultivates good karma, one is certain to be reborn there." He then bestowed upon the people the Ten Good Precepts: not to kill, not to steal, not to engage in sexual misconduct, not to consume intoxicants, not to speak falsely, not to use divisive speech, not to engage in double-tongued speech, not to use harsh speech, not to covet, and not to harbor anger. He declared: "If you firmly uphold these ten precepts, know that you will certainly be reborn in a wondrous land."

After speaking thus, the multitude took refuge and all received and upheld the precepts, never faltering for the rest of their lives. The king of Received Goodness, too, attained spiritual powers and a purified, wondrously transformed mind. When the teaching was complete, Transformation-Born rose lightly and returned home. Along the way, he thoroughly examined every land he passed. Upon returning to his own realm, he asked a minister named Penetrating Vision: "When you accompanied me to the World of Received Goodness, what did you observe? Speak of it in full."

Penetrating Vision replied: "Great King, as I attended you, I surveyed that land and saw that its earth was as flat as a palm, without sand or gravel. Various fruits were planted in orderly rows, straight as a line or a knife’s cut. All the people ate the fruits of the trees, their forms upright and comely, with little sickness or suffering. The city walls and palaces were predominantly blue, like morning clouds resting upon green mountains. Upon reflection, this land cannot compare to ours."

Transformation-Born Great King addressed Penetrating Vision: "What else did you observe?"

Penetrating Vision replied: "I further saw jeweled pearl-banners—these were manifestations of Your Majesty’s power, not the land’s true native endowment. If it were only thus, it would not be worthy of aspiration."

Transformation-Born Great King answered his ministers: "Each of you, rest and reflect. We shall journey more widely yet." The ministers, having heard this, withdrew to their places and sat in silent reverence, hands clasped.

*Thus concludes Fascicle One of the* **Supreme One-Vehicle Ocean-Empty Wisdom Treasury Sutra**.

---

**Fascicle Two: The Lamentation Chapter**

At that time, Ocean-Empty Wisdom Treasury rose from his seat, bowed his head in homage, knelt with hands clasped, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "What has been spoken is truly profound, its subtle virtue and power beyond conception. I now reflect upon the origins of the myriad transformations of the ten thousand kinds. How is it that all beings and all dharmas each possess their Dao-nature, arising from causes and conditions? Given these causes and conditions, should there be bondage, or should there be no bondage? Are these the five aggregates, or the six sense-objects? As I contemplate this, thought after thought arises and perishes. In such arising and perishing, who is bound, and who is not bound? Who is liberated, and who is not liberated? Through these causes and conditions, one set of five aggregates gives rise to another; with the cessation of these aggregates, those aggregates do not arise. How can the five aggregates be defiled by afflictions, when they arise and perish in each moment? What, then, are afflictions?"

Then the Heavenly Worthy answered Ocean-Empty: "Excellent, excellent, good man! Listen carefully, listen carefully, and I shall distinguish and explain this for you. Good man, it is like when beings approach the moment of death, great sorrow and suffering arise. Parents, spouse, and kin gather around, wailing in anguish. They gaze in terror, not knowing where to turn for refuge. Though the five senses remain, there is no awareness; the limbs tremble uncontrollably, the body grows cold and hollow, and the breath of life nears its end. Then they see the retribution of the sins and merits they have cultivated, following their karma to be reborn—whether in the three evil paths, the five destinies, or among humans—each according to their deeds, without exception. Good man, it is like the setting sun: as it nears its descent, the shadows of mountains and hills appear to shift eastward, though in truth it does not set in the west. The fruition of beings’ karma is likewise. These five aggregates perish, and those five aggregates arise. It is like a lamp: when the lamp is lit, darkness vanishes; when the lamp is extinguished, darkness returns. Good man, it is like a clay vessel: clay and vessel unite, and when the clay is transformed, the vessel is formed. Yet the nature of the clay is never called a vessel. Though the vessel is not clay, it does not come from elsewhere—it arises from the causes and conditions of clay. Good man, these five aggregates perish, and those five aggregates arise. These aggregates do not transform into those aggregates, nor do those aggregates arise of themselves or from elsewhere. It is through these aggregates that those aggregates arise. It is like the clay vessel: when the clay is transformed, the vessel is formed. Though their substance is not different, they differ according to time. For this reason, through these five aggregates, those five aggregates arise. With the cessation of these aggregates, I speak of those aggregates. Whether virtuous or unvirtuous aggregates, observing good and evil, when parents unite in the mingling of vital essences, one is reborn according to karmic causes and conditions. Love arises toward the mother, affection toward the father; when parents think of the child, joy fills their hearts. From such conditions arise inverted causes: what is unloved is seen as loved, what is suffering as joy, what is impermanent as permanent. Such inverted views give rise to good and evil causes, and afflictions produce karma. Karma produces afflictions—this is called the bond of entanglement. For this reason, there is arising and perishing in each moment. If a virtuous person draws near to a wise teacher, they may hear and behold the wondrous scriptures of the Three Caverns and the Ten Divisions of the *Numinous Treasure*. Having heard the Dharma, they pay reverence, circumambulate, and praise it; they recite, transcribe, and single-mindedly uphold it, making pure offerings. Six times a day, they contemplate and reflect upon it, never ceasing. At such times, they sit in repentance. Once the mind of repentance arises, joy follows. With a joyful mind, they abandon their spouse and children, dwell alone in the mountains and forests, and preserve the true mindfulness of the Dao. Through these causes and conditions, they attain liberation within the cycle of birth and death, extinguishing all afflictions. Like a lamp dispelling darkness, this is called *nirvāṇa*. For this reason, it is called the cessation of causes and conditions."

Then among the assembly, a youth named Good Talent rose from his seat, approached the Heavenly Worthy with measured steps, bowed his head in homage, and said: "Heavenly Worthy, what you have expounded today is of profound and subtle virtue and power, not something the lesser vehicles can fathom. How then can you speak of these five aggregates perishing and those five aggregates arising, yet say that these aggregates do not transform into those aggregates? How can such five aggregates be bound by afflictions? If there are afflictions, there should be no arising and perishing; if there is arising and perishing, how can afflictions arise once they have ceased, given that the five aggregates are based on causes and conditions? I beseech the Heavenly Worthy to distinguish and explain this, so that all in this assembly may resolve their doubts."

Then the Heavenly Worthy answered Good Talent: "Excellent, excellent, good man! Let all of you in this assembly listen carefully, and I shall distinguish and explain how afflictions strike and bind. Good man, afflictions strike and bind the five aggregates; apart from the five aggregates, there are no separate afflictions; apart from afflictions, there are no separate five aggregates. Good man, it is like a wooden bed: apart from wood, there is no bed; apart from the bed, there is no wood."

For this reason, the five aggregates of sentient beings are likewise: when there are afflictions, they are called "bound"; when there are no afflictions, they are called "liberated." Good man, it is like the eye-root: when open, it sees forms; when closed, it sees nothing. The striking and binding of afflictions, their arising and perishing, are in principle no different. The five aggregates of sentient beings are likewise: if there are afflictions, they are called "struck and bound"; if there are no afflictions, this is called "liberation." For this reason, it is said that afflictions strike and bind sentient beings; if afflictions cease, then there are no sentient beings. Apart from afflictions, there are no separate sentient beings; apart from sentient beings, there are no separate afflictions. It is also called "afflictions striking and binding sentient beings," and it is also called "sentient beings striking and binding afflictions."

Good Talent then said: "If this is so, the eye does not see itself, the finger does not point to itself, the blade does not cut itself, and the recipient does not receive itself. How then can the Heavenly Worthy say that afflictions bind afflictions? Why is this? These afflictions are none other than sentient beings; these sentient beings are none other than afflictions. If it is said that afflictions strike and bind sentient beings, it should be known that afflictions strike and bind afflictions."

Then the Heavenly Worthy answered Good Talent: "Good man, it is like when the eye closes—there is no other dharma that comes to close it. Afflictions and sentient beings are likewise. For this reason, I say that afflictions bind sentient beings. If there are sentient beings free from all afflictions, then they attain liberation. Therefore, I say that sentient beings are liberated."

Good Talent then said: "If afflictions are what strike and bind, how can the Heavenly Worthy speak of the divine sages dwelling in the city of afflictions, yet not be struck and bound?"

Then the Heavenly Worthy answered Good Talent: "Good man, dwelling has two kinds: first, transformative dwelling; second, fruitional dwelling. As for transformative dwelling, the Heavenly Worthy and sages dwell in afflictions, yet in truth have no afflictions. Why is this? They have realized the nature of afflictions. For the sake of sentient beings, they dwell by expedient means. What is fruitional dwelling? Good man, these sentient beings have not yet been able to relinquish the binding of afflictions. Because of this binding, they revolve in birth and death and do not perceive the nature of the Dao. Because they do not perceive it, they do not attain the vision of my eternal and blissful mind. For this reason, they constantly abide in the three realms, struck and bound by afflictions. For this reason, being struck and bound by afflictions is called 'sentient beings.' This body of sentient beings is none other than afflictions."

Then Good Talent addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "The five aggregates of sentient beings are empty and without substance. Given this, who is there to receive teachings and cultivate virtue and the Dao?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Good man, all sentient beings possess the mind of thought. The initial thought-moment arises with diligent progress and generates the mind of generosity. Such dharmas as these arise thought-moment after thought-moment. For this reason, they continue without interruption, and this is called 'cultivating the Dao.'"

Good Talent then said: "As you have explained, thought-moments arise successively—each thought-moment arises, and once it has arisen, the next thought-moment has not yet come to be. Given this, how can they continue without interruption and be called 'cultivating the Dao'?"

Then the Heavenly Worthy answered Good Talent: "It is just so, exactly as you have said. Good man, it is like a lamp’s flame: though it perishes thought-moment after thought-moment, it still produces light that effectively dispels darkness. All dharmas such as thoughts are likewise. Good man, it is like the actions of sentient beings: though they perish thought-moment after thought-moment, they still reach their destinations, moving east or west as they wish. It is like taking medicine: though it perishes thought-moment after thought-moment, it can still cure illness. It is like the sun and moon: though they perish thought-moment after thought-moment, they can still cause trees, forests, and grasses to grow. Good Talent, as you have said, once a thought-moment has passed, how can there be continuity? Good man, it is like a person singing: the voice may be loud or soft, and the five notes cannot all be produced at once. The first does not reach the middle, the middle does not reach the last, and both loud and soft perish thought-moment after thought-moment. Because of this perishing of thought-moments, over time a wondrous sound is formed. The cultivation of the Dao by people is likewise. Good man, it is like a person counting: one does not reach two, two does not reach three, and though they perish thought-moment after thought-moment, they still reach a thousand or ten thousand. The cultivation of the Dao by people is likewise. Good man, it is like a lamp’s flame: the flame perishes thought-moment after thought-moment. Once the initial blaze has perished, the later blaze does not say, 'I perish, and you arise.' Knowing this arising and perishing, the nature of the lamp is thus formed."

Good Talent then said: "As you have explained, even after long cultivation of the Dao and attaining the four heavens, one must still diligently cultivate kindness and compassion, refrain from killing, sexual misconduct, and stealing, guard the mind against jealousy, avoid divisive speech, and abstain from intoxicants and meat—yet still one cannot attain the pure and wondrous realm of the sovereign. How then can it be said that through long cultivation of precepts amidst evil afflictions one attains the Dao?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "All sentient beings, though amidst afflictions, long cultivate the precepts. Good man, all sentient beings do not lose the nature of the Dao. Though born in evil realms, by the power of the Dao they attain the cultivation of wondrous realms. Good man, it is like a treasure mountain within a noxious forest, where a fierce tiger constantly dwells. For this reason, all sentient beings—birds and beasts—avoid this mountain, none daring to approach. A poor man reflects and thinks, 'How can I go to that mountain to gather treasures, so that today I may quickly become wealthy?' Thereupon, he practices various poisons and goes to the mountain. Then, the evil creatures, upon smelling his poisons, immediately depart. Thus, the poor man gathers treasures as he wishes. The long cultivation of precepts amidst afflictions, culminating in the attainment of the Dao, is likewise. Good man, it is like the Jade Capital, which possesses supreme wondrous medicines—pine resin and Solomon’s seal. If one consumes them, though in an evil realm, thought-moment after thought-moment perishing, by the power of the medicine, one is ultimately not harmed."

Good Youth further asked: Though one may long cultivate pure precepts amidst afflictions, by what cause do those who study the Dao uphold precepts, concentration, and wisdom? You should know that such a person draws near to the secret treasury of the Ocean of Emptiness. For this reason, how should one cultivate precepts, how concentration and wisdom, to attain the Dao?

Then the Heavenly Worthy addressed Good Youth, saying: Excellent, excellent, good man! If there are beings who receive and uphold the prohibitive precepts yet do so only for self-benefit, seeking wealth and joy among humans and gods, unable to act universally for all sentient beings, not for the protection of the supreme Dao and its Dharma, but only for self-nourishment—fearing the three evil destinies, fearing the paths of the six domestic animals, fearing the laws of worldly rulers, fearing the evil reputations of the world—they seek immediate results. Such guardianship of precepts cannot be called the cultivation of pure precepts.

Good man, what is meant by cultivating and upholding pure precepts? If there is one who liberates all sentient beings, this is called upholding pure precepts. Those who have not yet crossed over are crossed over; those who have not yet understood are made to understand; those who have not yet cultivated are made to cultivate; those who have not yet practiced are made to practice. For this reason, when cultivating such precepts, one does not perceive the marks of precepts, does not perceive the marks of cultivation, does not perceive the marks of self, does not perceive the marks of retribution. Good man, if one can be thus, this is called the cultivation of true precepts.

Good man, what is meant by cultivating concentration and wisdom? If there is one who exalts and liberates only themselves, seeking self-nourishment and self-benefit, not for the sake of sentient beings to uphold the true Dharma, who reads, recites, and contemplates merely to perceive the sins of greed, desire, and the various karmic offenses—such as thoughts of male and female, the three poisonous actions of body, speech, and mind, quarrels, disputes, beatings, humiliations, and mutual killings—because of these, they cannot be called cultivators of the pure and true Dharma.

Good man, if there are beings who cultivate concentration and wisdom, practicing equanimity toward all sentient beings, universally mindful that all beings attain the subtle and wondrous Dharma, mindful that all beings attain the wheel of the true Dharma, for the sake of enabling all beings to realize the marks of the Great Vehicle, to contemplate the meaning and flavor of the teachings, to read, recite, praise, revere, and uphold the supreme true Dharma, for the sake of enabling all beings to abide in the treasury of the Ocean of Emptiness, to attain vajra wisdom, to settle in concentration and contemplation, to swiftly ascend to the Mystery, to attain unimpeded power, and to comprehend the true marks of the Dao—when perceiving thus, there is no division, no distinction, no marks of distinction; no other, no self, no marks of other or self.

Without hatred, without love, without marks of hatred or love;
without greed, without desire, without marks of greed or desire;
without cultivation, without practice, without marks of cultivation or practice;
without cause, without effect, without marks of cause or effect.

Good man, if one can be thus, this is called cultivating the treasury of concentration and wisdom, the Ocean of Emptiness.

Good man, if one can destroy all marks of greed, desire, and the like in sentient beings, this is called cultivating wisdom. Through cultivation, one shatters the mind of doubt, for the sake of cultivating the Dao. Through cultivating the Dao, one sees the nature of the Dao. Seeing the nature of the Dao, one enters the treasury of the One Vehicle, the Ocean of Emptiness. Having entered this treasury, one severs all dharmas of birth-and-death and all dharmas of affliction in sentient beings. Once all demonic influences are severed, one attains constant bliss, purity, and freedom, entering the treasury of the One Vehicle, the Ocean of Emptiness Dharma.

Sudhana further said:
What has been spoken of as "without division, without distinction" is called the treasury of the Ocean of Emptiness. Why is it not said that "with division, with distinction" is the treasury of the Ocean of Emptiness?

Then the Heavenly Worthy replied to Sudhana:
Good man, it is just as you say. As you have spoken, "with division, with distinction" is called the treasury of the wisdom of the Ocean of Emptiness. But this is not so. Why?

"Because there is beginning and end, there is birth-and-death."

Sudhana further said:
"These dharmas of birth-and-death have no beginning or end. Because they have no beginning or end, they are called 'constant'—this is what is meant by the Ocean of Emptiness. Why then is it not said that the dharmas of birth-and-death and affliction are the treasury of the wisdom of the Ocean of Emptiness?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied:
"Good man, these dharmas of birth-and-death all possess cause and effect. Because they possess cause and effect, they cannot be called the One Vehicle Ocean of Emptiness. Why? The emptiness of the Ocean of Emptiness is without cause or effect, without beginning or end."

Sudhana further said:
"As you have said, the emptiness of the Ocean of Emptiness is without cause or effect, without beginning or end. Why then do you speak of cultivating practice to see the nature of the Dao? Rebirth in the heavens arises from causes, and the enjoyment of bliss arises from causes—is not the constant bliss of the Ocean of Emptiness also a fruit? Why then do you say the emptiness of the Ocean of Emptiness is without cause or effect?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied:
"Good man, when I speak of the cause of cultivating practice in the Ocean of Emptiness, this is the nature of the Dao. The nature of the Dao-nature is without birth or extinction. Because it is without birth or extinction, it is the Ocean of Emptiness. The emptiness of the Ocean of Emptiness is without cause or effect. Because it is without cause or effect, it severs afflictions. For this reason, it is called 'cultivating practice.'"

Sudhana further said:
"As you have said, the nature of the Dao-nature is without birth or extinction. Is the Dao-nature of sentient beings shared by all, or does each possess it individually? If it is shared, then when one being enters the treasury of the Ocean of Emptiness, all sentient beings should likewise enter. For example, if there are a hundred or a thousand enemies, when one makes peace, all hundred or thousand are at peace; when one bears enmity, all hundred or thousand bear enmity. The Dao-nature is also thus: when one attains it, all attain it; when one does not attain it, none attain it. If each possesses it individually, then it is impermanent. Why? Because it can be counted. How then can you say the Dao-nature of sentient beings is neither one nor two? If each possesses it individually, you should not say the Dao-nature is equal, like empty space."

The Heavenly Worthy replied:
"Excellent, excellent, good man! What you have questioned is this: the Dao-nature of sentient beings is neither one nor two, ultimately equal, like empty space, and shared by all sentient beings. Good man, deep in the mountains there is a treasure called Supreme Victory. If a person takes it, they become wealthy. The Dao-nature of sentient beings is also thus."

Sudhana further said:
"As you have said, is this treasure of Supreme Victory one or many? If it is one, then once one person obtains it, it should be exhausted, and the mountain would be empty of treasure. How then can you say that all sentient beings who cultivate pure precepts enter the secret treasury of the One Vehicle Ocean of Emptiness? If it is many, how can you say the Ocean of Emptiness is not all dharmas, and that the Dao-nature of sentient beings is also thus?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied:
"Good man, it is like a single road, whether wide or narrow, where all sentient beings walk without obstruction. The Dao-nature of sentient beings is also thus. Good man, it is like a jewel with only one gate. Though many people pass in and out, there is no crowding or hindrance; nor does anyone break or take away the jewel. The Dao-nature of sentient beings is also thus. Good man, it is like a bridge that bears all travelers, whether heavy or light. The bridge itself neither increases nor decreases. The Dao-nature of sentient beings is also thus."

Then Sudhana said to the Heavenly Worthy:
"Such analogies are difficult to fathom; their meaning is profound. Yet this cannot be so. Why?"

Those who walk ahead on the road obstruct those who follow. How then can you speak of there being no hindrance?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "What you describe does not accord with principle. Are these analogies not merely partial, rather than encompassing all? If it were a worldly path, there would indeed be obstruction, with distinctions between this and that, and no equality. But the Dao-nature of the sea and sky allows sentient beings to proceed without hindrance, equal and undivided, without distinction between this and that. Such is the true Way, which serves as the illuminating cause for the Dao-nature of all sentient beings, not as a generating cause. It is like a lamp that illuminates objects.

"Good man, all sentient beings arise from the conditions of afflictions and ignorance. One cannot say that after a single course of afflictions and ignorance has run its course, the rest should be absent. All sentient beings possess the conditions of ignorance, and thus it is said that the conditions arise in sequence, all equally. When sentient beings cultivate the true Way of non-action and sever the afflictions and delusions of sentient beings, this is called equality—seeing all dharmas as without this or that, without hindrance. Therefore, the Perfected One is named Fragrant Youth, who gains the power of wisdom and clearly perceives the minds of others."

Sudhana said: "All sentient beings have dissimilar bodies—some tall, some short, some with heavenly bodies, some human, some animal, some hungry ghost, some hell-being. Such bodies differ in every way. How then can you say the Dao-nature is one?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Good man, it is like salt placed in various substances, even in water, where all become salty. The substance is not called salt, nor is the salt called the substance, yet even in water it is thus. Though the name changes, the nature of salt remains unchanged, and its saltiness pervades all five flavors. If one drinks the water, the saltiness is strongly present, though no salt is seen within the water. The Dao-nature of sentient beings is also thus. Though the five destinies differ in body, long or short, the Dao-nature remains constant and unchanging.

Upon hearing this, the four assemblies were filled with joy, their hearts leaping with delight. They rose to bow, then returned to their seats.

Then Sea-Sky Treasury of Wisdom rose, prostrated at the Way’s feet, bowed, and asked: "Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy, you have expounded the wondrous scripture of the One Vehicle, the *Sea-Sky Treasury of Marvels*, fully revealing its aspects for the sake of sentient beings, teaching its profound meaning and inconceivable merit. Excellent indeed, Heavenly Worthy, that you have spoken thus! How is it that sentient beings dwell in the city of birth-and-death, giving rise to various illnesses—bodily sickness, mental sickness—and through these, their bodies, speech, and minds commit manifold evils? By committing evil, they cycle through the three realms, enduring all manner of suffering. How does the Perfected Immortal, the Supreme Youth, dwell in the jeweled and radiant royal city, endowed with excellent marks, profound wisdom, constant joy, and freedom, skillfully upholding the secret treasury, contemplating its meaning, and inquiring into the scriptures for the sake of all sentient beings, becoming their refuge?"

Having spoken thus, he gazed up at the Heavenly Worthy’s face, his mind free of other thoughts.

Then the Heavenly Worthy answered in a gentle voice: "Excellent, excellent, good man! Sea-Sky Treasury of Wisdom, for the sake of sentient beings, you ask thus. In asking thus and speaking thus, you seek to benefit all beings and open the eyes of the blind. Good man, how is it that sentient beings dwell in the city of birth-and-death, giving rise to various illnesses?

"Good man, when I previously expounded this scripture, seven thousand people were present to hear it. Among them, three hundred and three generated thoughts of ignorance, spoke various words, slandered the true Dharma, and gave rise to disbelief. They rose from their seats, departed, and returned to their own lands. Then, they prepared boats to cross the sea. An evil wind blew their vessels, drifting them into the sea of ignorance, where they contracted grave illnesses—bodily sickness, mental sickness, sickness of mind, sickness of speech, and the like. They thought, ‘Why do we, as cultivators, suffer such afflictions?’ Then they invoked the Treasury of Sea-Sky Wisdom of the One Vehicle. At once, all their bodily afflictions vanished. Yet due to these conditions, they cycle through birth-and-death, abiding in the three evil destinies, enduring manifold sufferings. Thus they stray far from the true path of the Three Vehicles, fall into the land of ignorance, take human form but have the hearts of beasts, grow evil roots, devour others, and are born and die day after day, their wails filling the roads without end.

"Good man, the Perfected Youth observes these conditions and, within his own body and mind, generates great fear. He abandons all evil and dwells in the jeweled city, constantly contemplating the secret treasury of the One Vehicle, the Sea-Sky.

"Good man, it is like a great king who orders a man to feed and care for four fierce tigers, tending to their every need, bathing and grooming them. If even one tiger grows angry, the king declares by law that the man’s life will be forfeit. Hearing the king’s decree, the man is filled with terror, trembling in fear. He considers fleeing, abandoning the tigers. When the king learns the man has fled, he sends a young warrior with a drawn sword to pursue him. The man looks back, sees the young warrior behind him, and flees even faster. The young warrior, employing a cunning stratagem, hides his sword and secretly sends another man, pretending to be a friend, to call out: ‘Come back!’ The man does not believe him and enters an empty city to hide. Once inside, he sees that all the monasteries are deserted. Finding no one, he sits and lies down. Then he hears a voice from the void: ‘Alas, man! This city is desolate, with no one dwelling here.’"

Tonight, four hundred bandits will come—should you encounter them, your life will not be safe. What will you do to escape this fate?"

Then the man’s terror grew even greater, and he fled once more. His path was blocked by a river, its waters rushing and surging, with no boat or ferry in sight. His heart filled with sorrow and distress, he gathered all manner of grasses and wood to fashion a raft. Yet he thought further: "If I remain here, I will surely be harmed by the fierce tigers. But if I cross this river, the raft cannot be trusted—I may drown in the waters, yet I will not be torn apart by those tigers." So he pushed the wooden raft into the river, leaned his body upon it, and paddled with hands and feet, cutting through the current until he reached the far shore. There, he found safety as before, and his heart swelled with joy.

"Good man, all beings who hear and uphold the *Sutra of the One Vehicle’s Ocean-Empty Subtlety* perceive this body as a dead dog upon the road, as a poisonous tiger. All beings who encounter this poison pity their own lives, and for this reason, they distance themselves from all evils—just as that man fled the tigers."

Then *Ocean-Empty Wisdom Treasury* bowed his head in praise and said: "So it is, so it is—truly as you have spoken. All dharmas are utterly not empty. Because they are not fixed, know that all dharmas are also not fixed. As you have said, the true person, the youth who cultivates the *One Vehicle’s Ocean-Empty Treasure Treasury*, hears what has never been heard before. Why is *Ocean-Empty* called the great treasure hoard? How does this treasure hoard skillfully ferry all beings?"

Then the Heavenly Worthy praised *Ocean-Empty*, saying: "Excellent, excellent, good man! If there is one who reflects and cultivates wholly, they can inquire as you have. Good man, it is like when people of the world speak of the great ocean, the great river, the great mountain, the great earth, the great city, the great king, the great person, the great heaven, the great Dao. *Ocean-Empty* is also thus: there is *Ocean-Empty*, and there is the *Great Ocean-Empty*; there is the *Treasure Hoard*, and there is the *Great Treasure Hoard*. What is *Ocean-Empty*?

"Good man, it is like a starving person who obtains a little food—this is called bliss. Such bliss is also called *Ocean-Empty*. Like one who recovers from illness and finds bliss—such bliss is also called *Ocean-Empty*. Like one who, in terror, finds a place of refuge and thus attains bliss—such bliss is also called *Ocean-Empty*. Good man, it is like a poor person who obtains the seven treasures and thus attains bliss—such bliss is also called *Ocean-Empty*. Yet this is not called the *Great Ocean-Empty Treasury*. Why? Because it is bliss born of hunger and thirst, of poverty and illness, of terror—thus it is called bliss, thus it is called *Ocean-Empty*. This is the *Great Ocean-Empty*, yet not the *Great Ocean-Empty*.

"Good man, if there are faithful beings who, whether in the mundane world or the Dao of immortals, sever all fetters completely, they attain bliss. Such bliss is also called *Ocean-Empty*, yet it is not called the *Great Ocean-Empty Treasury*. Why? Because afflictions may arise again, and habitual tendencies remain—it is not constant bliss.

"Good man, only one who abides in perpetual ease and freedom may be called the *Great Ocean-Empty Treasury*. Good man, it is like a place that receives all streams—this is called the great ocean. Wherever the hundred rivers come and go, that is called the *Wisdom Treasury*. Good man, if there are beings who clearly perceive the nature of the Dao, they may be called the *Great Ocean-Empty Treasury*. For this reason, the *Ocean-Empty Treasury* is neither existent nor nonexistent, neither arising nor ceasing.

"Good man, if there is a great lord or a lesser king who, over years and months, cannot reach a certain place, that place is called a great city. A city that transmits and transforms many names is called a small city. Wherever there is transformation is called a great king; wherever the king transforms is called a small king. Small kings and great kings, following regions and transformations, are neither kings nor transformations, neither great nor small. For this reason, it is called the *Supreme Wheel-Turning Sage King*, adorned with the seven treasures, wondrous and rare—this is called the *Great Ocean-Empty Treasury*. For this reason, it is named *Ocean-Empty*.

"Good man, it is like a mighty warrior who enters the four kinds of armies without fear—know that such a person is called *Great Multitude of Power*. If there are beings who, in the three evil destinies and amidst afflictions and evil karma, feel no terror and can broadly ferry beings therein—know that such a person is the *Ocean-Empty Treasury*. If there is one who serves parents, reveres Daoists, bows in worship, burns incense, cultivates wholesome dharmas, speaks with sincerity, without deception, endures the unendurable, and bestows alms upon the poor—this is called the *True Person, Ocean-Empty Wisdom Treasury*. Why? The *Ocean-Empty Treasury* possesses great compassion, pitying all beings, acting as a great compassionate father to all beings, as a great compassionate mother to all beings, ferrying beings across the river of birth and death, revealing the subtle marks of the One Vehicle’s wondrous Dao. This is called the *Ocean-Empty Wisdom Treasury*.

"Good man, the *Ocean-Empty Treasure Hoard* is inconceivable—all beings cannot comprehend it. Because they cannot comprehend it, they do not accept it in faith, giving rise to various thoughts and uttering various slanders. Therefore, I now call it *Ocean-Empty*. The mark of *Ocean-Empty* is only emptiness with emptiness—only thus can emptiness be understood. The emptiness of understanding emptiness is emptiness without being empty, understanding without being understanding. For this reason, know that it is called *Ocean-Empty*—this is called the *Wisdom Treasury*."

Then the four assemblies, having heard these words, rejoiced greatly, leapt up in reverence, surrounded the Heavenly Worthy, bowed, and praised him: "Excellent, Heavenly Worthy! You have expounded such profound and rare teachings!"

"Among us four assemblies, there is that which we cannot comprehend."

At that moment, a youth named Marvelous Thought arose from his seat, approached the Heavenly Worthy, clasped his feet, held a lotus flower in hand, gazed up at the Heavenly Worthy, bowed his head, and inquired: "Excellent, Heavenly Worthy! You have expounded such joyous and profound teachings, so deep in meaning as to be beyond conception. What is meant by *Ocean-Empty Wisdom Treasury*? Is the emptiness of *Ocean-Empty* empty yet not empty, or not empty yet empty? Is the emptiness of the not-empty empty of emptiness? For this reason, is it the emptiness of many bodies, the emptiness of one body, the emptiness of dust-motes, or the emptiness of transformations? What is the meaning of emptiness? Is it emptiness of self-nature, emptiness of other-nature, or emptiness of both self and other? Due to these causes and conditions, among us assemblies, there is that which we cannot comprehend. We only beseech the Compassionate Venerable One to specially bestow your mercy, distinguish and explain these matters, and enable all beings to decisively understand the true mark."

Then the Heavenly Worthy replied to Marvelous Thought: "Excellent, excellent, good man! Among you assemblies, you serve as bridges of the Dharma for all beings, as ladders and steps of the Dharma, as the great gate of wisdom, as the great refuge. You are the true understanding of my wisdom, you are my treasury. Were it not for you, there would be none who could ask; were it not for me, there would be none who could expound."

You, with single-minded focus, skillfully contemplate and remember—thus are you named Marvelous Thought. Now listen carefully, now listen carefully.

What is meant by "Sea of Emptiness, Treasury of Wisdom"? The emptiness of the Sea of Emptiness is neither empty nor non-empty, both empty and non-empty, neither empty nor non-empty, neither non-empty nor non-empty, neither empty nor non-empty, empty yet not empty, empty without discrimination, for discrimination itself is empty—thus is it called the Sea of Emptiness. It is neither self-empty, nor other-empty, nor empty of both self and other; neither vast-empty, nor small-empty, neither empty nor non-empty, neither vast nor small; neither many-empty, nor one-empty, neither empty of dust-motes, nor empty of transformation. For these reasons, it is called the Sea of Emptiness.

The Sea of Emptiness is without self; I name it the Sea of Emptiness. Like a dust-mote filling the ten directions and measureless worlds, the body of the Sea of Emptiness is not truly the Sea of Emptiness. By its freedom, it manifests as a dust-mote body, yet not a dust-mote body, and as a single mote filling all worlds. The body of the Sea of Emptiness does not truly fill all lands and worlds. Why? Because it is unimpeded—thus is it called the body of the Sea of Emptiness, Treasury of Secret Wisdom, filling the world.

The body of the Treasury of Wisdom is not truly the Treasury of Wisdom. For these causes and conditions, the Sea of Emptiness, Treasury of Wisdom, abides unmoving, yet manifests in measureless forms across all directions, each inspiring reverence and praise in those with minds, desiring that all beings attain eloquence. The body of the Sea of Emptiness constantly abides in one direction, yet is seen by all in other directions. The body of the Sea of Emptiness, adorned with seventy-two marks and eighty-one excellences, cannot be perceived by seeing form, hearing sound, smelling fragrance, distinguishing taste, sensing touch, or knowing dharmas. The six senses of the Sea of Emptiness are utterly unknowing. Why? Because it attains freedom.

The mind of the Sea of Emptiness also has no attainable mark. Why? Because there is nothing to attain—thus is it called the Sea of Emptiness. If true persons or youths of wondrous conduct conceive the notion of attainment, even the gods cannot reach the Sea of Emptiness. The emptiness of the Sea of Emptiness is empty of attainment—thus is it called the Sea of Emptiness.

The Sea of Emptiness expounds the flavor of the One Vehicle for measureless kalpas, inexhaustibly. Sometimes it teaches the Two Vehicles of precepts, concentration, and wisdom; sometimes it expounds the Three Caverns of subtle and wondrous scriptures. At such times, it observes without generating the thought, "I speak, they listen," nor does it produce even a single phrase of thought. Why? I adapt to beings, speaking more or less, following convention—thus is it called "speaking." The nature of the Dharma-nature expounded by the Sea of Emptiness is also without speech—thus is it called the Sea of Emptiness expounding the Dharma-nature.

Good man, it is like empty space: the nature of empty space cannot be seen. The expounding of the Sea of Emptiness is likewise unknowable. Good man, it is like a treasure hoard, filled with many rare and wondrous things, complete in every variety—thus is it called the Treasury of Wisdom. The profound and mysterious treasury of the Tathāgatas of the three times is also like this, filled with many marvels, complete and without lack—this is called the One Vehicle’s profound and mysterious treasury.

Good man, boundless things are called a treasure hoard; within this treasure hoard, nothing is exhausted—this is called the Treasury of Wisdom.

Then Marvelous Thought said: Venerable One, what you have expounded is truly profound. The meaning and flavor of the Sea of Emptiness perfects all beings of the future, enabling them to cultivate the foremost merit of the treasure hoard. The various analogies are inconceivable. Greatly Compassionate Heavenly Worthy, what is meant by the seven treasures’ adornment, the fulfillment of merit?

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy replied to Marvelous Thought: Excellent, excellent, good man! What is meant by the wondrous marks of the seven treasures’ adornment, the fulfillment of merit? Good man, the adornment of merit has two aspects: inner adornment and outer adornment. Outer adornment consists of the seventy-two marks and eighty-one excellences. Inner adornment is the cultivation of the One Vehicle, the secret treasury of the Sea of Emptiness.

Good man, it is like a jade mountain: outwardly radiant, inwardly luminous with pure brilliance, unimpeded by measureless dust-motes. Why? Because its nature does not shift—thus is it called a jade mountain. The wondrous merit of the seven treasures’ adornment is also like this.

Furthermore, good man, I now adorn my transformed body with expedient means, manifesting as vast or small, pervading the world. With this vast body, I enter a single minute dust-mote, yet my body does not become small. Though true immortals adorn their transformed bodies to fill the world, they cannot, at such a time, make their vast bodies enter a minute dust-mote—even this they cannot do, let alone keep their minds from being disturbed. True immortals’ minds do not follow their bodies.

Good man, though true immortal youths possess divine powers to shake the world, so that all beings see and hear, their minds never conceive, "Let this divine power pervade the world, enabling beings to hear what they have never heard before." For these reasons, true immortal youths never say, "It is by my power that beings now hear what they have not heard before." If someone claims, "Because I expound the Dharma, beings hear what they have not heard," know that such a person will never attain the *Sutra of the Equal One Vehicle, the Secret Treasury of the Sea of Emptiness and Wisdom*. Why? The mind that thinks, "Beings do not hear, so I speak for them," is a mind of birth and death. All true immortals have exhausted this mind. For these reasons, the body and mind of true immortal youths do not follow one another.

Good man, the bodies and minds of all ordinary beings follow one another. True immortals are not so. To transform beings, they manifest only small bodies, yet their minds are not small. Why? The nature of the minds of my disciples is always vast and expansive. Though they manifest vast bodies, their minds follow vastness.

How is it that a vast body fills the world? How is it that a small mind performs the conduct of an infant, wailing all day yet never hoarse? For what reason? By this cause and condition, the mind does not follow the body. The true immortal youths have already distanced themselves from the dust of sensual desires; though they dwell in the demon’s city, their minds remain unmoved. Because they are unmoved, know that the true immortals’ bodies and minds are free—manifesting as a single mote of dust, a body of afflictions. Yet each being sees them differently.

Then Miao Si again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "As you have said, the true immortal youths’ bodies and minds are free. Though they dwell in the demon’s city, their minds remain unmoved, manifesting as a single mote of dust, a body of afflictions. For this reason, doubts arise among the assembly: How do the true immortal youths cultivate practice to attain spiritual powers, shaking beings to awaken them to the *Secret Treasury of the Sea of Emptiness and the Equal One Vehicle*? We beseech the Compassionate Worthy to explain this for all beings, that we may hear what we have never heard before and see what we have never seen."

Then the Heavenly Worthy replied to Miao Si: "Excellent, excellent, good man! How do the true immortal youths cultivate practice to attain the spiritual penetrations and unlock the *Sea of Emptiness Treasury*? These true immortals of old offered their kingdoms, cities, wives, children, kin, and the seven treasures as offerings. They further praised and made offerings with wondrous sounds, recited, contemplated, and expounded the meaning and flavor of the teachings. By this cause and condition, they were able to dwell in the world of Adorned Benefit, their bodies and minds no longer following one another. For what reason? They had departed from the marks of self, person, reliance, action, thought, cause, and effect. By this cause and condition, though dwelling in the demon’s city, their minds remained unmoved.

Good man, if there are beings who dwell in the demon’s city and uphold even a single phrase or word of the *Secret Treasury of the Sea of Emptiness and the Equal One Vehicle Sutra*, such persons will certainly perfect their merit and virtue, abiding in eternal joy, purity, and freedom, far removed from the marks of person, self, action, and thought. Good man, if there are beings who make offerings with their beloved kin, the seven treasures, or vaidūrya, it is likewise so. For what reason?"

Such persons know cause as non-cause, for cause arises from cause, and since cause is impermanent, what is born is also impermanent. For this reason, they make offerings while far removed from all attachments.

Good man, if there are beings—good men and good women—who hear even a single word or phrase of the *Sea of Wisdom Treasury of the One Vehicle* yet do not grasp at the mark of words, the mark of phrases, the mark of hearing, or the mark of speaking, such is the mark of no-mark. By the mark of no-mark, they attain eternal joy, purity, and unimpeded freedom. Their bodies and minds become resolute, and they shall surely become the true immortal youths of the ten directions, generating a heart of compassion. This is called the body of eternal joy and freedom—neither a body nor apart from body, nor yet non-body.

For this reason, the true immortal youths cultivate the *Subtle Sutra of the Sea of Wisdom Treasury of the One Vehicle*, attaining the resolute body of profound principle and freedom.

At that time, Miao Si again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "What has been spoken is truly most profound. How do such true immortals, as fields of merit, attain the successive realization of eternal joy and freedom?"

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy replied: "Excellent, excellent, good man! How do the true immortal youths, as fields of merit, attain the resolute realization of eternal joy and freedom? Good man, true persons who uphold the precepts—even down to the various immortals—are called fields of merit. If someone declares that such beings are true fields of merit, know that this person possesses good roots, serves as a good refuge, and is the support upon which immeasurable beings rely.

Good man, the true immortal youths contemplate all immeasurable beings as none other than fields of merit. For what reason? Because of good roots, they regard beings as true fields of merit. There are three fields, six fields, eight fields, nine fields—such fields of merit give rise to immeasurable fields. According to the inclinations of beings, they expound and distinguish four kinds of fields. What are the four?

1. The impure field,
2. The pure field,
3. The field that is both pure and impure,
4. The field that is neither pure nor impure.

What is the impure field? Good man, if the donor upholds the precepts and knows the wisdom of giving, like water flowing to the stream, yet the recipient violates the precepts, clings to perverse views, and neither gives nor receives reward—due to this cause and condition, it is called impure.

What is the pure field? Good man, if the donor violates the precepts and clings to perverse views, denying the wisdom of giving and its karmic reward, yet the recipient is pure and expansively teaches the Dharma, knowing the wisdom of giving and its karmic reward—this is called the pure field.

What is the field that is both pure and impure? Good man, if both donor and recipient uphold the precepts, possess vast wisdom, and know the wisdom of giving and its karmic reward—this is called pure.

What is impure? If both donor and recipient break the precepts, violate the true statutes, and give rise to deluded confusion—this is called impure.

What is the field that is neither pure nor impure? Good man, when the most supreme donor gives to the most supreme field—this is called the neither-pure-nor-impure field. These are the four kinds of fields.

If there are beings who conceive of giving in their minds and await its karmic reward, know that such persons cling to perverse views, violate the prohibitions, and destroy the mind of the Great Vehicle. If good persons expound and distinguish between giving and receiving, such persons are called right-viewed. If they rely on the *Sutra of the Wisdom Treasury of the One Vehicle*, rightly perceive the wisdom of giving and its karmic reward—such persons are called precept-keepers, ever abiding in right view.

Good man, the true immortal youths, wherever their thoughts arise, through cultivation, perceive beings as upholders or violators of precepts, as givers or receivers, and their karmic rewards. For this reason, they are called precept-keepers, right-viewed, and they also perceive the four kinds of fields of merit and non-fields of merit."

At that time, Miao Si again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "What is called a pure land?"

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy replied to Miao Si: "Excellent, excellent, good man! You all see that I am about to return to the Land of Eternal Joy, and so you ask this question at the right time. Good man, there are four kinds of lands. What are the four?

1. The impure,
2. The both pure and impure,
3. The neither-pure-nor-impure,
4. The non-non-pure.

What is the impure? Good man, if there are beings who greedily cling to desire, slander with perverse views, and thus are born in a lower land—overgrown with thorns and poisonous grasses, barren and uneven, ugly in form, generating many evils, killing and harming living beings, with short lifespans—due to this cause and condition, they are born in a lower land. This is called impure.

What is the both pure and impure? Good man, all beings have differing thoughts and dispositions—some purify the three karmas, while others defile the body. Such beings are born in mixed lands. This is called both pure and impure.

What is the neither-pure-nor-impure? Good man, like the Land of Difficult Victory, with its extraordinary and wondrous forms, surpassingly beautiful and rare—due to this cause and condition, it is called neither-pure-nor-impure.

What is the non-non-pure? Good man, the Land of Wondrous Joy is not non-pure. For the sake of beings, it is expounded in various ways as pure in the Dao-fruit, neither existent nor non-existent, nor yet both existent and non-existent. If there are beings who cultivate the *Subtle Sutra of the One Vehicle*, generate a mind of equality, and with these good roots, vow to share this land with the immortal youths—with long lifespans, great power, and vast spiritual penetrations—then, by the power of this vow and cause, when they attain the Dao in the future, they shall see all lands as non-non-pure. This is called non-non-pure.

These are the four kinds of wondrous lands. Good man, if there are good persons who contemplate the *Subtle Sutra of the One Vehicle* with joyful minds, broadly ferrying beings across, and with these good roots, vow to share this land with all beings—far removed from desire, anger, delusion, and attachment to all things, without hunger, thirst, or afflictions in body—such is the land."

Furthermore, good man, those born among the lower ranks receive three kinds of retribution: first, the retribution of perception; second, the primary retribution; and third, residual retribution.

What is the retribution of perception? Good man, if there are beings who fully commit the ten evils, defy their parents, and slander the *Subtle Sutra of the One Vehicle*, such persons will suffer from malignant diseases, festering sores, the six illnesses, deafness, blindness, lameness, and various ailments, enduring manifold sufferings. For this reason, it is called the retribution of perception.

What is primary retribution? Good man, if there are beings who, upon birth, suffer from grave illnesses and, upon death, enter hell—abiding in gloom and darkness, dying and being reborn day after day without respite—such suffering is called primary retribution.

What is residual retribution? Good man, those reborn from hell assume the bodies of the six kinds of livestock, becoming owls, parrots, or other ill-omened birds; or they become turtles, fish, or venomous creatures; or they take the forms of macaques, deer, tigers, or leopards. Even if they attain a human body, they suffer from blindness, darkness, or the six afflictions; though they possess human form, they lack human sentiment. They are fully endowed with the ten vicious traits and all manner of foul appearances. If they leave the household life, they violate grave precepts, transgress regulations, and break the moral code. This is called residual retribution. Such residual retribution is the lingering effect of afflictions.

However, true youths who cultivate the *Subtle Sutra of the One Vehicle, the Ocean of Emptiness* can eradicate all such residual retribution and abide in the realm of true emptiness.

Furthermore, good man, how do pure and true immortal youths uphold the precept of non-killing? They perfect the five contemplative minds—lower, middle, upper, supreme, and superior—culminating in right view. These fifty minds constitute the initial arising of the aspiration, and when fully determined, they complete the fifty minds. This is called fulfillment. One hundred such minds constitute a hundred virtues, and when the hundred virtues are perfected, they form a single mark. Through such transformation and accumulation, the seventy-two marks of excellence are fully achieved. This is called the pure and wondrous body.

Good man, true youths constantly cultivate purity of body. Why? Because all gods, humans, and beings revere and submit to them. Therefore, true youths perfect the eighty-one secondary marks of excellence, their bodies unshaken, so that all beings, following their faith, pay homage, revere, praise, and honor them with minds of equality. For this reason, true youths cultivate purity of body.

Good man, it is like a wise minister who, wishing to receive the great king, first adorns and prepares the palace and halls, ensuring the provision of various delicacies, fragrant and delectable flavors. Only then does the great king proceed accordingly. True youths are likewise: desiring to invite the Wheel-Turning Saintly King of the supreme Dharma, they first cultivate and purify themselves. Only then does the Wheel-Turning Saintly King follow and abide in that place. With fragrant, sweet, and pure celestial delicacies, they make offerings skillfully. The king rejoices greatly and proclaims in praise: "Excellent, excellent! I now receive these offerings of manifold fragrances and flavors. I prepare a magnificent and wondrous jeweled throne. Reflecting thus, I shall distribute these fragrant delicacies to all impoverished beings, sating them so that they are free from hunger and thirst."

Good man, true youths are likewise: with pure bodies and minds, they invite the supreme *Ocean of Emptiness of the One Vehicle*, the ambrosial flavor of the Dharma, for the benefit of all beings, leaving none displeased.

Good man, it is like the spring month when the heavens send sweet rain, and all grasses and trees, great and small, sprout forth. The ambrosial flavor of the *Ocean of Emptiness* is likewise. Good man, if there are beings with pure minds, in a single thought-moment, their bodies transform and abide in the realm of the *Ocean of Emptiness*, attaining adamantine bodies. They sever the afflictions of the thirty-two heavens in the ten directions. Why? Because the adamantine purity perceives the mark of non-perception: though they see male and female, there is no mark of male or female; though they see form, there is no mark of form; though they see day and night, there is no mark of day or night; though they see afflictions, there is no mark of afflictions; though they see the *Ocean of Emptiness*, there is no mark of the *Ocean of Emptiness*. Why? Good man, because all dharmas are without marks, like an illusion, like a dream, like the flash of lightning or the spark from striking stone.

True youths, by this cause and condition, perceive the mark of non-perception and abide in the mark of non-abiding. Therefore, they are called those who abide in the realm of the *Ocean of Emptiness*.

Upon hearing this teaching, the four assemblies all rose, paid homage, rejoiced exceedingly, and took their leave.

*The Supreme One Vehicle Ocean of Emptiness Treasury of Wisdom Sutra, Scroll Two* concludes.
*The Supreme One Vehicle Ocean of Emptiness Treasury of Wisdom Sutra, Scroll Three* begins.

**Dharma Marks Chapter**

At that time, *Ocean of Emptiness Treasury of Wisdom* rose from his seat, adjusted his robe and stole, held an incense burner, and stood reverently facing the Heavenly Worthy. His gaze was fixed, his eyes unturning, his mind free of stray thoughts.

Then the Heavenly Worthy asked in a gentle voice: "Virtuous one, why do you stand so earnestly, bowing so deeply? Do you have some decision to make, or is there something pressing?"

"I am the master of the great Dao for gods and humans, my eloquence unbounded, my insight penetrating the subtle and profound. I am well able to expound the treasury of immeasurable meanings, to comprehend the ten transformations of all dharma gates, and to discern the wishes of others’ minds—nothing escapes my illumination. You should ask whatever you wish without hesitation. I shall resolve the deepest roots of the Dao."

Thereupon, *Ocean of Emptiness Treasury of Wisdom* answered composedly: "Greatly Wise Heavenly Worthy, I wish to ask a question but dare not speak first. The Heavenly Worthy, knowing the time, first bestowed compassionate encouragement, filling me with kindness and joy, easing my heart. Thus I know the Heavenly Worthy is surely the father of the world, the refuge of all beings, the object of veneration for the ten thousand multitudes. Now, relying on your great spiritual power and out of pity for me, I venture to speak my humble words. I pray you will heed and accept them.

Great Sage Heavenly Worthy, earlier the greatly wise one posed a weighty doubt, asking among the four paths which differ, how their fruits vary, and how their attainments diverge. The Heavenly Worthy’s answer dispelled all obstructions like melting ice, leaving no trace of hesitation, directly pointing to the source of wisdom.

The Heavenly Worthy further answered the subtle inquiry, saying that all good and evil arise from conditions, and conditions depend on the mind. You also resolved the principle that the mind’s power, being unstable, gives rise to good and evil. Such wondrous teachings are all clear and lucid. Yet I still have doubts and wish for their resolution.

Heavenly Worthy, for what reason do the roots of all dharmas arise? Are the marks of all dharma roots, being conditioned, real? Are they empty? Are they neither empty nor real?

If they are real, they should be eternally fixed, without change or transformation. If they are empty, their nature and marks are distinct, with their own forms and characteristics. If they are real, there should be no diminution or extinction. If they are empty, there should be no arising or manifestation. If they are real, they should have form and substance. If they are empty, there should be no evidence or verification.

If they are real, where do the dharmas reside after all sages attain the Dao? If they are empty, how do all sages cultivate and abide in the supreme wisdom? If they are real, when all sages relinquish these dharma marks, how do the dharma marks exist or cease? When they attain these dharma marks, from where do the dharma marks arise?

If they are empty, there is no difference between relinquishing and receiving dharmas. If they are real, where do they reside within sentient beings? If they are empty, sentient beings have no dharmas and cannot be established. If they are real, going and coming, departing and returning, should entail obstructions. If they are empty, going and coming, departing and returning, should encounter nothing.

For these reasons, the marks of all dharmas cannot be fathomed; the boundaries between emptiness and existence remain unknown. I only pray the Heavenly Worthy will descend and resolve these doubts with your eloquence."

Then the Heavenly Worthy answered *Ocean of Emptiness Treasury of Wisdom*: "Excellent, excellent! True man and great being, your mind comprehends dharma marks, pure and unburdened—thus you are able to ask this question today. This will benefit all, accomplishing immeasurable merit and fruition, which are now manifest.

I shall distinguish and explain for you, so that all present and future beings may gain clear understanding, cross beyond birth and death, and enter the source of dharmas.

*Ocean of Emptiness Treasury of Wisdom*, all dharma marks arise from conditioned existence; their source is not real, and their return is also empty. Why is this so? The arising of dharma marks is due to sentient beings; sentient beings being empty, dharma marks are also empty. The arising of dharma marks is due to spirits; spirits being empty, dharma marks are also empty. The arising of dharma marks is due to the world; the world being empty, dharma marks are also empty. The arising of dharma marks is due to the teachings; the teachings being empty, dharma marks are also empty. The arising of dharma marks depends on provisional names; provisional names being empty, dharma marks are also empty. The arising of dharma marks arises from creation; creation being empty, dharma marks are also empty. The arising of dharma marks arises from good methods; good methods being empty, dharma marks are also empty. The arising of dharma marks arises from evil; evil being empty, dharma marks are also empty. The arising of dharma marks arises from insufficiency; insufficiency being empty, dharma marks are also empty. The arising of dharma marks arises from contentment; contentment being empty, dharma marks are also empty. The arising of dharma marks arises from the eye faculty; the eye faculty being empty, dharma marks are also empty. The arising of dharma marks arises from the ear faculty; the ear faculty being empty, dharma marks are also empty. The arising of dharma marks arises from the nose faculty; the nose faculty being empty, dharma marks are also empty. The arising of dharma marks arises from the tongue faculty; the tongue faculty being empty, dharma marks are also empty. The arising of dharma marks arises from the body faculty; the body faculty being empty, dharma marks are also empty. The arising of dharma marks arises from the mind faculty; the mind faculty being empty, dharma marks are also empty.

For these reasons, know that the essence of dharma marks all arises from emptiness, from emptiness generating emptiness. Thus know that emptiness is empty, without any actuality.

When transforming sentient beings, and sentient beings receive transformation, attain the root of dharmas, and cross the sea of suffering, the dharma marks they practice immediately return to emptiness. Why is this so? If they did not return to emptiness, how could they abide? Where would they abide? Having no place, this is called emptiness."

What is meant by "from emptiness generating emptiness"? Dharma marks are not fixed; if they arose from the actual, they could not transform and adapt. Thus know that dharma marks do not arise from the actual. Not arising from the actual, they arise from emptiness. Arising from emptiness, this is called emptiness. How can the essence of emptiness generate empty dharmas? Thus know that emptiness does not depart from emptiness; if it departed from the actual, there would be no such place.

How are dharma marks due to sentient beings? Without sentient beings, there would be no dharma marks. Because of sentient beings, boundless dharmas arise. Thus know that dharma marks arise from sentient beings. How are all sentient beings empty dharmas? All sentient beings are fundamentally empty, their constructed essence also empty. Like the great plantain, like mirages and illusions, suddenly arising and swiftly vanishing—this is called emptiness. How do dharma marks follow the emptiness of sentient beings? Because their arising and ceasing are the same.

How do distinct dharmas follow the emptiness of the world? Because their arising and ceasing are the same. For this reason, when the world is destroyed, distinct dharmas are also extinguished; while the world is not destroyed, distinct dharmas are not extinguished. Arising through dependence, rising and ceasing together, inseparable—this is all emptiness.

How are dharma marks due to the teachings that gather? Without the teachings that gather, there would be no ritual dharmas. Because of the teachings that gather, ritual dharmas arise of themselves. Thus know that ritual dharmas arise from the teachings that gather. How are all teachings that gather empty dharmas? All teachings that gather exist because of people; people are not actual dharmas—this is called emptiness. How do ritual dharmas follow the emptiness of the teachings that gather? Because their arising and ceasing are the same. For this reason, when the teachings that gather are extinguished, ritual dharmas are also extinguished; while the teachings that gather are not extinguished, ritual dharmas are not extinguished. Arising through dependence, rising and ceasing together, inseparable—this is all emptiness.

How are dharma marks provisional upon expedient names? Without expedient names, there would be no skillful means. Because of expedient names, skillful means arise of themselves. Thus know that skillful means arise from expedient names. How are all expedient names empty dharmas? All expedient names are established according to conditions—this is called emptiness.

Arising through dependence, rising and ceasing together, inseparable—this is all emptiness.

How do dharma marks arise from construction? Without construction, there would be no dharmas of craftsmanship. Because of construction, dharmas of craftsmanship arise of themselves. Thus know that dharmas of craftsmanship arise from construction. How is all construction an empty dharma? All that is made is ultimately worn away—this is called emptiness.

For this reason, when virtuous methods are extinguished, dharmas of benevolence and compassion are also extinguished; while virtuous methods are not extinguished, dharmas of benevolence and compassion are not extinguished. Arising through dependence, rising and ceasing together, inseparable—this is all emptiness.

How do dharma marks arise from evil? Without evil, there would be no dharmas that harm beings. Because of evil, dharmas that harm beings arise of themselves. Thus know that dharmas that harm beings arise from evil. How is all evil an empty dharma? All evil ultimately returns to the source of goodness—this is called emptiness. How do dharmas that harm beings follow the emptiness of evil? Because their arising and ceasing are the same. For this reason, when evil is extinguished, dharmas that harm beings are also extinguished; while evil is not extinguished, dharmas that harm beings are not extinguished. Arising through dependence, rising and ceasing together, inseparable—this is all emptiness.

Arising through dependence, rising and ceasing together, inseparable—this is all emptiness.

These sixteen dharma marks all arise from provisional causes and conditions; when the marks of causes and conditions cease, the dharma marks also cease. Thus know that all conditioned dharmas are empty. The reason is this: conditioned dharmas are subject to destruction and cessation, to arising and rising. When all beings attain the supreme fruit of the true and correct Dao, the substance of conditioned dharmas reverts to the unconditioned. Therefore, all conditioned dharmas are a great mass of emptiness, while all unconditioned dharmas are the profoundly still dharma, free from the realm of emptiness and existence.

The reason is this: if one speaks of emptiness, it can effect transformation; if one speaks of existence, it cannot be sought. This is the realm of neither non-existence nor existence. You who cultivate the dharma should cultivate the supreme, unconditioned, profoundly still dharma; do not practice conditioned dharmas of attachment to marks.

At that time, Haikong Zhizang again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "The Great Sage’s words are truly subtle. My mind still harbors doubts; I humbly request further explanation to attain thorough understanding. The Heavenly Worthy now says that conditioned dharmas are unreal in their marks, while unconditioned dharmas are not empty in their principle. Yet the conditioned dharmas we presently see have manifest real marks, their forms and qualities easily discerned, their movements and activities perceptible to reason. Why does the Heavenly Worthy today declare them empty? Unconditioned dharmas are secluded and profoundly distant, without trace or influence, impossible to contemplate or fathom with thought. Why does the Heavenly Worthy now declare them existent? These two paths seem contradictory, leading future beings astray—how should they cultivate to reach the true source of the Dao?"

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy replied to Haikong Zhizang, saying: "Do not harbor perverse doubts. If one clings to existence and attaches to marks, how can one seek the supreme and true Dao? A true adept should know that all conditioned dharmas in their marks and natures are subject to decay and destruction, without anything abiding permanently. Why is this so? All dharmas within the Three Realms arise through the power of sentient beings’ minds, and the nature of sentient beings is momentary arising and ceasing. Conditioned dharmas are likewise—momentary arising and ceasing. At the very moment of their arising, they are already marked by cessation; at the very moment of their existence, they are already marked by emptiness. Because they are not permanent, they are called empty. Unconditioned dharmas cannot be destroyed or measured. If there is a response, they manifest according to circumstances; if there is no response, they abide serenely and eternally. From this, you should understand: that which follows conditioned dharmas has the mark of cessation, and because it has the mark of cessation, it is called empty. That which has no successor cannot be destroyed, and because it cannot be destroyed, it is called existent. You should contemplate this and carefully discern the source of all wondrous dharmas."

Thereupon, Haikong Zhizang, having heard these words, awakened in his heart and attained great clarity. Rising from his seat, he knelt and bowed his head, addressing the Heavenly Worthy: "The explanation of emptiness and existence is truly extraordinary, profoundly aligning with the ultimate principle, beyond thought or conjecture. I shall uphold and practice it, spreading it throughout my worn and weary land. I only beseech the Heavenly Worthy to accompany me back to my kingdom today, employing your great spiritual power to transform and guide those who have not yet heard the teaching, delivering them all and bestowing the most excellent benefit."

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy replied to Haikong Zhizang: "The time is not yet ripe; you should go first. I shall know the proper time and enter your kingdom to instruct and admonish the people, enabling them all to comprehend the boundless profound meaning."

Haikong Zhizang again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "This is precisely the right time. I implore your compassion to enter that kingdom without hesitation." He entreated repeatedly, bowing without cease.

The Heavenly Worthy remained silent, then assented to his plea. Turning to his disciples, he commanded: "Prepare the various implements for the journey. Today, I shall accompany you and follow Haikong Zhizang into the Land of Ultimate Bliss to proclaim and perform the Dharma, delivering sentient beings, serving as a bridge of the Dharma, a ladder of the Dharma, a great illuminating torch, a great vessel and ferry, enabling all in the world to awaken and realize the fruit of the supreme and true Dao."

Having spoken these words, the Immortal Minister and youths stepped forward, bowed, and knelt, addressing the Heavenly Worthy: "Great Sage Heavenly Worthy, you discern the proper time and expedient means, skillfully assessing the myriad practices and varying capacities of sentient beings. Where transformation is possible, we rejoice greatly and shall diligently prepare the various implements."

Thereupon, they advanced and, through the power of their spiritual feet, manifested four hundred million true immortal Daoists. Each stood twelve feet tall, their bearing and appearance surpassing all, their dignity and beauty unmatched in the world. All wore dark crowns and jade-green sashes. Each immortal held a seven-jeweled lotus flower, twelve feet in height, their blossoms fully opened, fragrant and radiant, illuminating the entire kingdom with a crimson glow. Reciting the hidden verses of the sacred scriptures, their voices shook the world as they encircled the Immortal Minister as his retinue.

Upon entering the kingdom’s gates, immeasurable multitudes of faithful men and women lined the roads to welcome them, scattering flowers upon the ground until no space remained empty, the blossoms piling several feet deep. The incense they burned formed dense clouds in the sky, bringing coolness to travelers and relieving them of heat and affliction.

On that very day, they entered the Jeweled Assembly City. Within the city was a king named Good Seed, accompanied by his retinue, ministers, officials, and people numbering in the thousands of millions. Queen Good Seed also led the entire palace retinue, one hundred thousand in number. They prepared a lofty and expansive seat, adorned with rare treasures, the couch, mat, and curtains all exquisitely beautiful. The king and his ministers, along with the queen, each took their places on one side, sitting in silence to listen to the Dharma.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy and the true adepts ascended the seat and sat down. Their majestic spiritual power blazed forth, surpassing the world, their radiance towering and immeasurable. The Immortal Minister stepped before the assembly and proclaimed in a loud voice: "The Dao is not far. Those with deep aspiration need only earnestly seek to attain it. All of you, my retinue, now single-mindedly observe the dharmas of the body as illusory, magical, like lightning, like wind, without any true master, all subject to destruction. Why, then, do you drown in these decaying dharmas, deeply attached to the six senses, unmindful of the true Dao? When your life ends, your spirit departs forever, passing through the Three Paths, lost and cut off eternally, with no hope of emergence, sinking into the sea of suffering, enduring countless agonies—how can they be fully described? You should all know to depart from these calamities."

Having spoken these words, the entire assembly was seized with terror, trembling and sweating, at a loss for words. The Immortal Minister, seizing this opportunity, transformed his body into a vast ocean, boundless and immeasurable, without visible shores. He placed the assembly on one side, the Jeweled Assembly City remaining unchanged as before. Gazing across the expanse, they saw an island of extreme splendor, its jeweled terrace towering high, brushing the sun and moon above and obscuring the clouds below. The Immortal Minister stood upon the terrace, his appearance majestic, attended by an infinite retinue. Surrounding the terrace on all four sides were bottomless deep pools, their winds and waves surging to the heavens, shaking the sun and moon.

The Immortal Minister raised his hand and called out from afar: "Great King Good Seed and all your retinue, this vast ocean can wash away all defilements and obstructions, purifying and making flawless, accomplishing the supreme Dharma. If any among you are weary of the dust and filth and seek the Dao, you should enter these waters and receive my instruction."

Thereupon, the entire assembly, without distinction of men or women, removed their garments and competed to enter the water. Some, wading only to their knees, turned back, thinking: "How can this vast ocean be crossed? The far shore is not yet in sight. To drown in it would be of no benefit to the true Dao."

Some, wading only to their waists, turned back, thinking to themselves: "I have not yet gone far into these waters, yet the pearl of the sage already seems distant and unreachable. Why should I drown myself and vainly lose my life?"

At that moment, eight hundred thousand among the assembly thought: "This body and life are the root of all suffering, destined to decay and rot. Why cling to them? Nurturing the source of evil, even if we cannot reach the far shore, to drown in these waves is no loss."

Yet when they plunged forward and reached the other side, their resolve was not steadfast, and they could not enter the supreme Dharma gate.

Then, seventy-seven myriad and two thousand great worthies among the assembly thought: "I have heard the scriptures’ admonitions and followed the sage’s teachings—there is nowhere one cannot go. On the terrace of the far shore dwell divine powers and sagely virtue. With but a beckoning hand, we shall surely be delivered. My heart now knows no fear or hesitation." Filled with joy, they threw themselves forward with all their might. In an instant, they reached the far shore, and through the power of their resolve, they awakened to the true, unconditioned, supreme Dharma.

These seventy-seven myriad and two thousand great virtuous ones, having awakened to the Dao, radiated light from their bodies, illuminating all realms beyond. Then the Immortal Minister gathered his divine power and returned to his former state.

The awakened ones’ forms and appearances were transformed, astonishing the crowd. They said to one another in amazement: "Those who entered the water earlier—some drowned in the deep pools. How is it that today they appear thus?" Each marveled, sighing in wonder, and doubt arose: "Where now is the vast ocean of before? Those who drowned show no sign of it, yet their benefit is even greater. Such matters are unfathomable. If one were to hear their profound and wondrous essence, the heart would surely open in awakening, free from the net of doubt."

Then the Heavenly Worthy declared: "Let none among you doubt. The ocean just now was vast and measureless, its depths unfathomable. This was none other than the divine transformation of the Immortal Minister, not something truly existent. To discern the weight of all dharmas of joy and the measure of deliverance, he manifested this auspicious sign. You should know that those who cherish the true Dao and spare not their bodies or lives attain the greatest, boundless merit and fruit, beyond all reckoning.

All of you should know: I recall that in the beginning of the Dragon Han kalpa, there was a world called Ever-Joy. Its people were diligent in practice, observing long fasts and reciting scriptures day and night without cease. At that time, a Heavenly Worthy, also named Yuan Shi, dwelt in that world, expounding the wondrous Dharma of the Numinous Treasure. With compassion, he transformed the five directions, using the *True Writs and Sacred Talismans* to deliver all beings. All those multitudes received benefit. Later, at one time, he returned to the world of Ever-Joy to teach and guide all people.

Yet because their causal conditions were not yet determined, he displayed great divine power, raising his hand to screen the heavens. His radiance concealed itself, transforming into a mass of fire two thousand *zhang* high. He then manifested his own body within the flames. Through his divine power, his brilliance shone clearly in all four directions, visible to all without exception. From within the fire, he proclaimed the great Dharma sound: 'All you great assembly and retinue, if you seek long life, enter this fire and receive my teaching.'

At that moment, those of steadfast resolve spared not their bodies or lives and rushed into the fire to seek the Dao. Then Yuan Shi, within the flames, bestowed upon them the scriptures and vanished from sight. All attained the Dao of long life and deathlessness.

You, great assembly, should understand the meaning of the sage’s transformation of beings—its methods are not one. All serve to deliver the people of the world. Why is this so? Great fire and vast waters are places of terror, not to be lightly risked. If there are beings who do not shrink from suffering, who value the Dharma above their bodies and spare not their lives, know that such people, through the causal conditions of the Dharma, will never be stingy. They will reach the source of the Dao without slackening.

For this reason, those who entered the waters earlier all attained the fruit of the Dao, truly because their love for the Dharma was sincere and steadfast. You should know that the Heavenly Worthy Yuan Shi of former times is none other than today’s Immortal Minister. Those seventy thousand and more who attained the Dao in the past did so because in former lives they loved the Dharma and, rushing into the fire with unwavering resolve, never retreated. Today, seeing the ocean, they were able to plunge forward and accomplish the supreme, unconditioned practice."

When the Heavenly Worthy had spoken these words, all those who had earlier not entered the water aroused the great mind, awakening to the turning of no-sorrow. They lamented their former lack of resolve, having lost the root of the Dao’s lineage, and sighed: "What use is regret now?"

Then Haikong Zhizang arose, knelt, and praised: "The wondrous Dharma spoken by the Heavenly Worthy delves into the profound and extraordinary, bringing boundless benefit. All beings gain the ladder of the Dharma, reaching the realm of quiescence. Yet I still harbor a small doubt, and all in this great assembly share this perplexity. Thus, I repeatedly beseech the Heavenly Worthy: may you grant compassion and graciously resolve our confusion.

The Heavenly Worthy earlier spoke of a past-life practitioner of the Dao, the Heavenly Worthy Yuan Shi. This title is lofty and exalted, majestic and supreme, the great model for all things, revered by immortals and sages. Why then does he now occupy the position of a disciple, unable to attain the highest rank and deliver the world? By what causal conditions has he descended to such a station?"

Then the Heavenly Worthy smiled and replied: "Haikong Zhizang, do not harbor such deep doubts. I shall explain and distinguish this for you, that you may awaken and ascend to the supreme Dao.

Haikong Zhizang, the sage is unconditioned, yet for the sake of beings, he manifests conditioned activity. The sage’s mind is ever quiescent and still, yet because beings make different karmic connections, the sage’s responsive manifestations also differ in form."

Know then that the sage’s form cannot be fathomed or measured, for it takes shape only in response to the karmic connections of beings. Why is this so? When beings invoke this Great Sage Master, the Sage Master immediately responds with a corresponding form; when beings invoke this Secondary Sage Master, the Sage Master immediately responds with a corresponding form; when beings invoke this Lesser Sage Master, the Sage Master immediately responds with a corresponding form. The Sage Master’s mind remains ever unchanged; it is the karmic fruits of beings that differ in principle and effect.

It is like a sounding bell suspended in the void: though never struck, the potential for sound abides eternally. Why does the potential for sound abide eternally? Because it awaits the striker. When struck, a great striker produces a great sound, a moderate striker a moderate sound, a small striker a small sound—yet the essence of sound within the bell remains unchanged. Each sound differs according to the strike. The sage is likewise: the principle of his quiescence is uniform and unchanging, yet in response to beings, he manifests myriad forms in endless variety.

Haikong Zhizang, know that today all beings invoke me as their Great Master due to prior karmic conditions; they invoke the Immortal Minister Lad as their Secondary Master, also due to prior karmic conditions.

Then Haikong Zhizang addressed the Heavenly Worthy once more: "Earlier, you explained that the sage is unconditioned, yet manifests conditioned activity in response to the minds of beings, appearing in various forms according to their karmic connections. This principle is subtle and profound, its truth deep and recondite. Later, you further stated that all beings, by virtue of karmic conditions, invoke the Heavenly Worthy as their Great Master, and all beings, by virtue of karmic conditions, invoke the Immortal Minister Lad as their Secondary Master. We now wish to hear of these karmic conditions. We pray that the Heavenly Worthy will expound further, fully revealing the wondrous principle, that all in this great assembly may be fully enlightened and free from doubt."

Then the Heavenly Worthy addressed Haikong Zhizang, saying: "Listen carefully now, and do not grow weary. I shall explain in full detail for you.

Do you not recall? In the distant past, eighteen thousand kalpas ago, there was a world called Square Citadel. Within this world stood a royal capital named Wondrous Ultimate, which is the present Land of Ultimate Bliss in the world of Square Citadel. Its land was level and smooth, without hills, pits, gravel, or thorns. All four directions were pure and clean. The world bore only sweet fruits, and all springs and pools were clear and sweet. All beings drank the water and ate the fruits without contention. Everywhere stood mountains of the seven treasures."

Those who sought anything would journey to these mountains, and their desires would be fulfilled the moment they wished, with nothing lacking. The beings there enjoyed bliss and freedom, free from all illness, their lifespans fixed at seven hundred years. When the time of death arrived, they would go to the burial grounds of their own accord and depart with parted sleeves.

In the Land of Wondrous Bliss there was a great king named Ruler of the Dharma, who was exceptionally wise and discerning, his talents and skills all-encompassing. His appearance was fair and upright, like the full moon, and his virtue and adornments were flawless in every way. The king had a thousand sons, all of them bright and astute, their various skills fully mastered, with nothing they did not comprehend.

King Ruler of the Dharma would often expound the wondrous Dao at midday, and his sons would attend him without ever leaving his side. All the people would likewise accompany him, never growing weary. Among these sons was a prince named Victorious Cause, the ninth in line, whose divine brilliance stood out uniquely, his fame surpassing all others. The other princes regarded him as the foremost.

When the great king lectured on the wondrous scriptures, if anyone in the assembly had doubts, there was a great minister named Advancing Goodness who, whenever anyone was entangled in the web of doubt, would consult Victorious Cause to seek clarification. Victorious Cause would then explain and distinguish the teachings, resolving all uncertainties so that everyone attained full understanding.

On days when the great king did not lecture, Advancing Goodness would petition the king to command Victorious Cause to expound in his stead. This continued for over six hundred years, and all the people of the land would often say: "We are fortunate to serve King Ruler of the Dharma, who establishes teachings and rules, propagates the Dao, and expounds the supreme fruit of the true and non-action. Though we enjoy such bliss, we daily hear what we have never heard before and see what we have never seen, and we are certain to achieve all wondrous sources. Yet our minds are sometimes dull and obstructed, giving rise to doubts and hindrances. Some things we fail to grasp, others we cannot resolve, leading to frustration and self-inflicted affliction. Fortunately, Victorious Cause dissects our deep doubts, elucidates the true principle, and awakens our minds to clarity, so that not a single matter remains forever obscure. These two sages guide and instruct us with profound kindness. We only wish that in the future they will forever serve as the great masters of the Dao for us. The great king is supreme, and Victorious Cause is next. All four kinds of beings will surely be spared the sufferings of the three evil paths, the five agonies, and the nine dark realms."

For this reason, the karmic reward of Prince Victorious Cause surpassed that of King Ruler of the Dharma. Why was this so? Though King Ruler of the Dharma proclaimed the wondrous teachings, there were those among the assembly who did not understand. Not only did they fail to cultivate wisdom, but they also accumulated boundless afflictions. Prince Victorious Cause, however, was able to dispel the afflictions of beings and establish the causes of wisdom. For this reason, his karmic reward was greater.

Haikong Zhizang, was King Ruler of the Dharma someone other than myself? I am he, and Prince Victorious Cause is now the Immortal Minister Youth. Advancing Goodness is your present self. Relying on our past lives, for having skillfully resolved afflictions and benefited beings, you first attained perfect enlightenment before me. At the beginning of the Dragon Han kalpa, you expounded the Dharma and taught beings, while I have only now, at the dawn of the Kaihuang era, ascended to the supreme fruit. The Immortal Minister Youth, having once assisted me in clarifying the subtle and wondrous teachings, and because all beings made vows, has now, in response to the inclinations of beings, manifested again in this land.

Do you now harbor doubts and thus have forgotten? Having spoken these words, Haikong Zhizang immediately recalled his past affairs, and all was restored without loss. He attained the wondrous Dao and, in this very lifetime, will achieve full and perfect realization, equal in power above, benefiting beings without limit.

Then Haikong Zhizang again bowed and, kneeling, asked: "The words the Heavenly Worthy has now spoken are most rare and subtle. May I inquire by what name this sutra should be called? What karmic blessings arise from upholding, reciting, and venerating it?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "This sutra was brought to fruition through your own initiation and guidance, and thus should be named *The Sutra of Haikong Zhizang*. It is also the gathering of all treasures, and should be called *The Adornment of the Seven Treasures*.

If any being in the world upholds even a single line or verse of this sutra, reveres and honors it, and enshrines it—whether in a brocade bag, an embroidered case, or a jeweled casket—with such offerings, then those who make such offerings will be loved and respected by all sentient beings in water, on land, and in the air. They will be venerated by countless deities, constantly protected and guarded, and will become fields of merit.

If any being can recite even a single phrase of this sutra, know that this person has entered the source of the Dao and will surely attain fruition in a future life. They will be able to recognize and read boundless scriptures, fully comprehend all written characters of beings, and penetrate the hidden texts of the heavens without obstruction.

If any being can chant even a single phrase of this sutra, know that this person has tread the root of the Dao and will surely attain fruition in a future life. They will be thoroughly versed in boundless wondrous meanings, clearly understand all celestial golden scriptures and true texts, and never forget them.

If any being transcribes this sutra, know that this person is a true companion of the Dao and will surely attain fruition in a future life. They will possess wondrous spiritual powers, be able to proclaim the great Dharma, and save and deliver beings.

If any being explains this sutra, know that this person has entered the nine transformations and will surely attain fruition in a future life. They will penetrate the profound and subtle, comprehend the wondrous meanings, resolve doubts for all people, benefit countless beings, and accomplish the great Dharma.

If any being reveres this sutra, know that this person has entered the mysterious realm and will surely attain fruition in a future life, possessing the thirty-two marks and a majestic, wondrous body.

If any being bows in worship to this sutra, know that this person has awakened to the nature of the Dharma and will surely attain fruition in a future life, obtaining a vajra body, firm and indestructible."

If any being praises this sutra, know that this person has already expounded the supreme and wondrous meanings. In a future life, they will surely attain fruition, their subtle and marvelous voice resounding throughout the infinite trichiliocosms. All beings who hear it will grasp the essentials of the Dao, and how much more so those who further receive, uphold, read, recite, transcribe, explain, reverently worship, praise, and proclaim it? The blessings of such a person are boundless, majestic and venerable, attaining the foremost realization.

O Treasury of Wisdom of the Empty Sky, I recall that in the past three thousand kalpas, I constantly cultivated this Dharma with utmost sincerity, never slackening or retreating. Through this cause and condition, I have now attained the wondrous fruit of supreme wisdom.

You should now single-mindedly uphold and maintain it, accomplishing the formless, most supreme Dharma-body.

At that time, the Treasury of Wisdom of the Empty Sky addressed the Heavenly Venerable, saying: "I humbly inquire, what methods should one employ to receive and uphold such a wondrous scripture? I only wish for a thorough explanation, so that in future ages all may hear and know, obtaining great and excellent benefits."

Then the Heavenly Venerable replied: "Great Sage, you are indeed capable of this, striking the great Dharma-bell for all beings of the future, seeking the supreme resonance. Truly, this is compassion, bringing boundless benefit. I shall now explain its meaning and purport for you.

O Treasury of Wisdom of the Empty Sky, this sutra is profound and wondrous, treasured and revered as most precious by all the great sages of the Mysterious Capital and Jade Capital. It is difficult to obtain and rare to encounter. Because your heart is earnest and single-minded, I today transmit it to you orally. You must receive it with utmost reverence and not lose it. If you proclaim it to the world, you must carefully select those who are fitting and only then may you impart it.

What kind of person is fitting? The essence of fitness comprises six principles. What are these six?

First, if there are practitioners who from their youth have entered the treasury of the Dao and Dharma, have already received and upheld the *True Writ of the Numinous Treasure*, thoroughly comprehend the profound and subtle purport of the *Cavernous Mystery*, and can explain its meaning without doubt or obstruction—only such persons may be imparted this teaching.

Second, if there are practitioners whose minds are not attached to the phenomena of conditioned dharmas, who skillfully discern the emptiness of the foremost meaning, thoroughly perceive the nature of dharmas, and see all as empty and quiescent, regarding self and others equally without notions of inner and outer; who, having understood in their own minds, can also teach others—only such persons may be imparted this teaching.

Third, if there are practitioners who diligently cultivate vigor, ceaseless day and night, not for their own sake but solely to deliver beings, sparing not their own bodies to benefit all things—only such persons may be imparted this teaching.

Fourth, if there are practitioners who skillfully uphold the precepts, their deportment complete, serving as models for all people; who teach and transform their disciples not with a mind burdened by attachment but constantly with the mind of the great and small formless Dharma, imparting all teachings—only such persons may be imparted this teaching.

Fifth, if there are practitioners who practice great forbearance, able to endure all insults and base treatment, ascribing good deeds to others while returning defilement and evil to themselves, their minds penetrating and thorough, not calculating self and other—only such persons may be imparted this teaching.

Sixth, if there are practitioners who skillfully contemplate the subtle, their powers of thought and mindfulness never scattered, single-mindedly and earnestly reflecting, diligently practicing the Dao and Dharma, penetrating the wondrous marks without clinging to self and other—only such persons may be imparted this teaching.

O Treasury of Wisdom of the Empty Sky, know that only these six kinds of practitioners may be imparted what is spoken today. The reason is that these six kinds of persons can practice this Dharma, illuminate the wondrous teaching, and benefit and deliver beings. Therefore, you should impart this esoteric instruction to them.

If, however, there are those attached to conditioned dharmas, submerged in the six sense-contacts, unable to establish the causes of the supreme Dharma; or who deceive and delude themselves regarding what they see—such persons, upon hearing this wondrous teaching, will surely be startled and dismayed, exclaiming that it is unreal, generating various heterodox views, entangled in the net of doubt. Not only will they be unable to practice it, but they will also slander it. For this reason, you must not proclaim the *Treasury of Wisdom of the Empty Sky*.

The merit of this sutra surpasses all other scriptures. The wondrous teachings of the Three Clarities and the supreme words of the Three Caverns do not compare to it. If there are worldly persons who disrespect these words, slight and scorn them, or generate slander, claiming that this sutra is not the teaching of the supreme sage, know that such persons are already companions of the three evil destinies and causes for hell. In this present life, they will inevitably encounter boundless terrors, afflictions, and bitter poisons. In future lives, they will endure burning, boiling, flaying, and roasting, suffering pains beyond measure, as the *Code of Illuminating Reality* clearly states without fail."

At that time, the Heavenly Venerable praised the matter as excellent and spoke these verses:

"O Treasury of Wisdom of the Empty Sky,
Great indeed is the true adept,
Who emerges from this realm,
Virtue and conduct perfectly fulfilled,
Expounding the Dharma and delivering beings,
Boundless and measureless.
All revere and honor,
Heavenly and human beings praise as excellent.
Able to strike the Dharma-bell,
Able to beat the Dharma-drum,
Able to draw forth the Dharma-stream,
Able to proclaim the Dharma-teaching.
This is the root of the Dharma,
The bridge of the Dharma,
The ladder of the Dharma,
The nectar of the Dharma;
The father of beings,
The refuge of beings,
The life of beings,
The essence of beings.
Virtue and conduct fully possessed,
Majestic bearing manifest,
Speech and utterance,
Naturally harmonious and refined.
Coming to my presence,
Seeking the supreme Dharma,
Undeterred by peril and distance,
Unafraid of toil and hardship,
Seeking only the Dharma,
No other thoughts.
My heart rejoices,
And I utter wondrous sounds.
The two marks of emptiness and existence,
Clearly discerned and distinguished,
No more doubts or obstructions,
Washed clean and clearly explained.
All beings
Attain the true fruit,
Hell becomes cool,
Heavenly and human realms expand.
This Dharma is profound and recondite,
The refuge of all beings;
The immortals of the Jade Capital
All revere and practice it.
I now appoint you
As the Treasury of Wisdom of the Empty Sky,
To expound this profound Dharma,
Having delivered the perfected person,
And also benefiting the great assembly.
You should know
That the Treasury of Wisdom of the Empty Sky
Is your teacher,
Able to create for you
Great and excellent karmic merit."

You should all
Reverently prostrate and pay homage,
With earnest devotion and utmost sincerity,
To seek and receive this wondrous Dharma.
Their minds, wisdom, and eloquence
All respond without exception.
I now bestow in full
This supreme Dharma,
Entrusting and commissioning
The Treasury of Wisdom of the Empty Sky.
You, the great assembly,
And all learners of future ages—
If any doubts arise,
You may consult and resolve them,
Naturally attaining awakening,
No more doubts or obstructions.
Bowing in reverence, they paid homage.

The Third Scroll of *The Supreme One’s One Vehicle Treasury of Wisdom of the Empty Sky* concludes.

The Fourth Scroll of *The Supreme One’s One Vehicle Treasury of Wisdom of the Empty Sky*
Universal Discourse Chapter

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the Treasury of Wisdom of the Empty Sky, saying: "Good son, in the kalpas of the distant past, I wandered through the Radiant Seven-Jewel Flower Grove, accompanied by a great assembly of sages—innumerable and boundless heavenly youths: the Youth of Majestic Light, the Youth of Moonlight, the Youth of Universal Light, the Youth of Jeweled Clarity, the Youth of Jeweled Form, the Youth of Jeweled Adornment, the Youth of Empty Treasury, the Youth of Empty Thought, the Youth of Empty Seal, the Youth of Right Mind, the Youth of Right Concentration, the Youth of Right Speech, the Youth of Right Compassion, the Youth of Right Giving, the Youth of Dragon Majesty, the Youth of Dragon Wisdom, the Youth of Dragon Flower, and the Youth of Dragon Virtue. Such multitudes, innumerable and boundless, formed My retinue as I expounded the Dharma.

At that time, there were also the Perfected of Pure Form, the Perfected of Pure Precepts, the Perfected of Pure Clarity, the Perfected of Dharma Kingship, the Perfected of Radiant Light, the Perfected of Wondrous Penetration, the Perfected of Wondrous Contemplation, the Perfected of Wondrous Wisdom, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Perfected of Universal Attainment, the Perfected of Universal Receptivity, the Perfected of Pure Fragrance, the Perfected of Pure Flower, the Perfected of Left Mystery, and the Perfected of Right Mystery. Such hosts, innumerable and boundless, formed My retinue as I expounded the Dharma.

At that time, there were also the Great Wisdom Immortals, the Great Brahmā Immortals, the Dharma-Upholding Immortals, the Vast-Giving Immortals, the Ever-Protecting Immortals, the Wondrous Conduct Immortals, the Wondrous Form Immortals, the Wondrous Adornment Immortals, the Wondrous Contemplation Immortals, the Compassionate Immortals, the Flying Heaven Immortals, and the Wisdom Light Immortals. Such multitudes, innumerable and boundless, formed My retinue as I expounded the Dharma.

At that time, there were also innumerable earthly immortals, including the Hundred Million Wondrous Dao Earthly Immortals who uphold and rely upon the true Dharma. Such hosts, innumerable and boundless, formed My retinue as I expounded the Dharma.

At that time, there were also the Daoist masters of the heavenly realms: the Daoist of Superior Form, the Daoist of Superior Wisdom, the Daoist of Eloquence, the Daoist of Diligent Recitation, the Daoist of Faithful Conduct, the Daoist of Precept-Holding, the Daoist of Incense-Holding, and the Daoist of Dharma-Teaching. Such multitudes formed My retinue as I expounded the Dharma.

At that time, the great kings of the nations, lesser kings, elders, good men, and good women all came to the seat to hear the Dharma.

Good son, I now turn the great Dharma wheel of this profound and true Dharma, extolling the root of the Dao, proclaiming and expounding the great compassionate Dharma rain. You, the fourfold assembly, should exert your very lives, bowing in reverence with single-minded devotion to receive and uphold it, entreating protection for all past, future, and present kin.

Thereupon, the fourfold assembly bowed their heads in unison to the Supreme Heavenly Worthy, their faith sincere and unwavering, ever abiding in the fruit of the Dao. Gazing up in admiration, they praised the inconceivable.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy, moved by great compassion, radiated light from His entire body, universally illuminating the ten directions. His harmonious voice resounded with virtuous words, shaking the lands. The sound was like thunder, like a lion’s roar. His radiance shone boundlessly, compassion descending to the world, universally moistening all beings—whether human or non-human—all receiving benefit.

Thereupon, the fourfold assembly each rose to bow, prostrating in reverence and praising the subtle and wondrous virtues, manifesting forms never before seen in the world. The great assembly of the Heavenly Worthy guided them to the gate of good destinies, revealing the secret essentials. The precious treasury of the Dharma rain of the Empty Sky was sprinkled across the ten directions. The radiant forms stood majestic and resplendent, like the sun at dawn, like the moon among stars, universally illuminating the lands of the ten directions—beyond thought or measure.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy joyfully replied: "Excellent, excellent, good son! You and your retinue should listen single-mindedly, universally practicing the supreme treasury of the true Dharma, beholding the One Vehicle Treasury of Wisdom of the Empty Sky, seeking the ultimate fruit, realizing the Dharma body, neither coming nor going.

You, My retinue, now contemplate thus: by taking refuge in the supreme Dao, you escape the thousand poisons of the sea of birth and death—beyond thought or measure."

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy, his heart suffused with great compassion, spoke in verse:

The Empty Sky knows no bounds,
Its form and response defy description.
The true nature abides eternally,
Expounding the constant and the inconstant.

I now open the ears of the deaf and eyes of the blind,
Taking refuge in the Great Compassionate Worthy.
For the sake of the Treasury of Wisdom of the Empty Sky,
The gateway of the Well-Gone One in the world.

It becomes the supreme medicine,
Universally bestowed upon the destitute and hungry ghosts.
By the power of wisdom and skillful means,
It is universally established among humans and gods.

The supreme true Dharma is proclaimed,
Its prophecy transmitted to descendants.
The profound scripture of the One Vehicle,
Discussed by immortals and the Dao.

Without form, without shadow,
It becomes the root of the field of merit.
With single-minded contemplation,
One ultimately attains the garden of true fruit.

The Perfected, youths, and others
Proclaim and penetrate the gate of the true Dharma.
Subduing all heterodox paths,
They perfect humans and immortal youths.

With the three karmas ever reverent,
Bowing to the compassionate and sagely teacher.
The Lord of the Great Dao of the Three Times,
Followed and understood according to one’s portion.

Only wishing for embrace and acceptance,
Attaining thorough penetration, forever unobstructed."

At that time, the Youth of Great Wisdom among the assembly, having heard the verse, single-mindedly bowed in reverence, joining his palms to pay homage. He addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "Great Compassionate One, long have You adorned the distant past. The subtle seven treasures radiate light, universally illuminating Your body."

The one who skillfully comprehends the nature of dharmas,
Neither ceasing nor abiding.
Extolling the treasure of the Dao, its merits peerless;
Extolling the treasure of the Dharma, most boundless,
Its merits lofty and wondrous.
Further extolling the treasure of the teacher,
Who skillfully guides all beings,
Benefiting without obstruction,
Skillfully leading devas and humans—
Among devas, the world’s finest physician.
Deeply penetrating wisdom,
Skillfully employing expedient means.
All beings in samsara make offerings,
Gaining great benefit.
How could this be common or long-lasting?
Transcending the heavens with immortality.

Now my retinue,
Immeasurably rejoices,
Encountering the rare.
For this cause and condition,
I speak verses in praise:

Great wisdom opens the blind and dark,
All humans and non-humans.
Like the light of the sun of wisdom,
Discerning the false and true.
Universally attaining equal awakening,
The mind may extinguish without remainder.
Abiding in virtue, perfect wisdom,
Following the great compassion.
The nature of suffering beings,
Deeply understood, ascends the four classes.
Roaming and transforming the ten directions,
Expounding the Dharma to guide their minds.
The original body relies on the Dao’s wisdom,
Never violating the spirits of beings.
Understanding the supreme wisdom,
Not dwelling near birth and death.
Ever arising great compassion,
Not entering defiled dust.
Universally establishing expedient gates,
Naturally attaining the truth of the Dharma.
With body, speech, and mind,
I bow to the supreme benevolent one.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy, with great compassion, addressed the Youth of Great Wisdom: "Good son, it is just so, just as you have said. Now your retinue, from immeasurable kalpas past, has gained the power of wisdom, skillfully comprehending the true King of Physicians. Good son, it is like fragrance completely dispelling all dust. Such fragrance does not come from without, nor does it arise from seeds. For this cause and condition, it is called habitual qi. Good son, it is like vajra: because the mind is unimpeded, it can dispel all delusions. Why? Because one contemplates the true Dao. Dispelling false delusions, like fragrance.

You should know that the Heavenly Worthies of the Three Times manifest wondrous forms, emitting great light that illuminates the ten directions and countless worlds. Yet all beings cannot see or hear it. Good son, it is like a foolish person born blind: though there is light, they never behold it. Those of unwholesome dharmas are likewise. Good son, all beings drowned in the sea of birth and death, clinging to sensual desire and affectionate bonds—through such causes and conditions, this city of afflictions, with its inverted arising and ceasing, covers their bodies. Their sins are boundless, entwined with the roots of afflictions. Today, I universally expound the treasury of the One Vehicle Dharma, enabling them to generate understanding and sever the defilements of afflictions.

Good son, it is like a person who obtains this wondrous Dharma and transmits it to all good men and women. Through this cause and condition, like a wheel-turning king, those not yet subdued are subdued; those already subdued are guarded and protected, never to waver again. Like the wondrous Dharma, those whose afflictions are not yet destroyed are enabled to destroy them; those already destroyed are prevented from arising again. For the benefit of all beings, I expound the three wisdoms as expedient paths, causing their afflictions to be forever extinguished without remainder. At one time, for all beings, with a single principle, I universally expound it, desiring that all beings—whether human or non-human—each gain wisdom and understanding, perceiving all immortals as like empty space. All myriad things fill it, for space is eternally one.

Good son, these divine worthies, for all beings, are likewise. These divine ones constantly abide in emptiness and quiescence, without employing the mind, manifesting bodies in the ten directions, displaying various wisdoms, expounding the Dharma to teach and transform, benefiting equally. Without hatred or love, without greed or desire, their merits are boundless. Benefiting birth and death, neither can obstruct; accomplishing compliance, they act as the wisdom of all for beings."

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy spoke verses:

Excellent is the true mark,
Cause and effect, expedient means differ.
The three trainings and fruition,
Wisdom boundless in aspiration.
In the lands of the ten directions,
All see the youths in attendance.
Entering the city of empty space,
Faith’s benefits boundlessly heal.
This realm has no end or beginning,
All dharmas depend on their stations.
If there are Daoists
And those of great universal wisdom,
Dharmas abide in the treasury,
Able to act as seed-benefits.
This is called the adamantine Dao,
I constantly expound it.
Grasping and discerning coarse and fine,
Seeds eternally flow.
For the foolish and ordinary, I expound,
Do not cling and take it as sorrow.
Alone practicing ignorance,
Great compassion is vast.
Expedient means without distinction,
Also called nothing un-subdued.
No self, no clinging to marks,
A single lifetime without flow.
In the neutral of good and evil,
I should never cease.
Departing from the defiled mind,
Dust and filth cannot consume.
Without all this,
Neither poor nor rich.
Attaining the true meaning,
How could delusion and hindrance thrive?
Constantly practicing the One Vehicle Dao,
Name and essence alone are not fathomed.
Diligently contemplating without retreat,
This is called the wealth of kings.

At that time, Prince Sheng of the Square City, through the Youth of Immortal Ministers, heard the Heavenly Worthy expound the profound, subtle, and wondrous true Dharma: "Excellent is the Dharma-joy! Compassionately extolled, the supreme great teacher is thus rare—like the seven-jeweled flower, the purple-gold treasure flower, rare indeed, rare indeed!" Having spoken these words, Prince Sheng of the Square City, through the Youth of Immortal Ministers, opened his mind and gained understanding: the sea of the One Vehicle’s emptiness, the emptiness of no-emptiness, the emptiness of no-self, constant joy and self-mastery, subtle and complete, inconceivable.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy, with the eye of wisdom, immediately addressed the Youth of Immortal Ministers, Prince Sheng: "Good son, the treasury of wisdom is like the great ocean: whatever comes to it, its taste remains constant. Though it is the refuge of many seeds, the water’s taste does not change or differ. All various things come to rely on it, yet the ocean’s water is likewise unchanged."

"Good son, the secret treasury of wisdom of the One Vehicle’s sea of emptiness is likewise thus. Abiding in the worlds of the ten directions, all sentient beings come and go as they please, yet this treasury of wisdom likewise waxes and wanes.

Good son, just as the form realm and the formless realm, and suchlike states, are either covered or uncovered—speaking of these two realms’ afflictions, they can never be attained.

Good son, though the sea of emptiness and the treasury of wisdom dwell within the city of birth-and-death and afflictions, the mind constantly contemplates the flavor of the One Vehicle’s meaning, expounding it for others, unfolding its profound significance. Body and mind are pure, like the formless realm, yet the three inversions repeatedly assail and harass. Even so, the formless realm is never defiled—likewise thus.

Good son, the sea of emptiness that emerges from the world brings great benefit and manifold virtues, like empty space, boundless and inexhaustible, empty and without possession. For this reason, emptiness is without end.

At that time, Prince Sheng of the Square City, the Youth of Immortal Ministers, bowed his head in reverence, gazed up at the guide before him, and spoke in verse:

Within and without, unclear,
In the two, only provisional names—
Neither real nor substantial,
Yet forming the seeds of dharma.
Thought after thought, both perish together,
Pursuing even to namelessness.
Determinedly observing causes and conditions,
Just as fruit arises from the tree.

Firm and untainted,
Forever parted from form and sound.
The ultimate pure dharma,
Expounded for sentient beings.
The six consciousnesses respond without fail,
The three destinies never afflict.
Thought after thought, not coexisting,
Clearly seeing the sea of emptiness and the city.

Within and without, these seeds,
Flourish throughout the three realms.
Seeds arise from continuity,
Their fruits ripen in fullness.
Like moistened seeds,
Sweet dew gives rise to all.
Without inner or outer conditioning,
How can there be the name of seeds?
Equal and without conditioning,
Fruits arise yet do not arise again.

What has been done and what is yet to be done,
Gain and loss enter demonic essence.
These inner and outer seeds of mine,
Give rise to sentient beings according to kind.
First, called conditioned consciousness,
Clearly receiving the welcome of the gods.
Second, called receiving consciousness,
The two paths of destiny already incline.
Following discourse, entering the treasury of emptiness,
The wise and dharma are both at peace.
The enlightened take it as their field,
Whether already arisen or yet to arise.
The good spiritual friend of cause and effect
Then departs from the city of the five demons.
Following transformation without end,
Neither ceasing nor eternal.
Cause and effect without distinction,
Transformation and guidance likewise without measure.
Responding to things with a mindless penetration,
The receiver is forever without misfortune.
Where do seeds arise?
Coming and going, discourse is not forgotten.
Whether human or non-human,
Who is not liberated in measureless numbers?
Difficult to extinguish, difficult to untie,
Expounding it causes others to flourish.
The minds of practitioners differ,
Dharma teachings are likewise not constant.
The pure person has not perished,
Yet the cloud chariot’s fruit is already ascended.
Accomplishing the pure land realm,
Attaining the wisdom of the pure Way.
Manifold vows and visions,
Universally seeing things without alarm.
Practitioners can accomplish,
Following their intentions to fulfillment.
What is grasped is only consciousness,
Attaining the Way in profound obscurity.
Consciousness of form, formless consciousness,
If what is known is not at peace,
Later consciousness does not arise,
Former consciousness alone does not proceed.
Without a body, abiding in empty space,
Tamed and without suffering’s affliction.
Liberated from the bonds of demonic error,
All fetters no longer arise."

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy, hearing the words of Prince Sheng of the Square City, the Youth of Immortal Ministers, said: "Excellent, excellent, good son! You are Prince Sheng of the Square City, the Youth of Immortal Ministers, decisive in the essentials of the Dharma. You have long accumulated practice, your merit and deeds are complete—thus you are called Prince Sheng. You have contemplated the supreme emptiness of the foremost discourse, the secret treasury of the sea of emptiness, with an unshaken body and mind. For this reason, you are named Sheng.

Good son, you are skilled in medicine, curing the sick with remedies, benefiting all sentient beings, whether human or non-human. For this reason, you are named Sheng.

Good son, you act as a guide, opening the treasury of the One Vehicle, transforming sentient beings, expounding for them the treasury of wisdom of the sea of emptiness, reciting, contemplating, and deeply penetrating its secret flavor and profound meaning. As a great compassionate father, you benefit sentient beings. For this reason, you are named Sheng."

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy opened his mouth in a smile, and five-colored light radiated forth, filling the lands and great earth of the ten directions with immeasurable countries. A hundred kinds of tremors shook the ground, the five sufferings were all dissolved, lotuses bloomed in hell, a hundred kinds of fragrant incense arose, a thousand streams of pure water appeared, those burdened by sins received joy, and the dark were illuminated.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy again addressed the youth of true insight, Great Wisdom: "You have already realized the constant joy of the foremost meaning, the inconceivable, the treasury of wisdom of the sea of emptiness, and its profound virtues. Now I receive you, transformed into the Heavenly King of Great Wisdom. You are most inconceivable, skillfully accomplishing virtues, revealing the marks of the Dharma, benefiting all. Excellent, Great Wisdom! You are a child of the Dao, rare indeed, rare indeed!

Great Wisdom, you are truly the King of Physicians, reviving all children and curing all illnesses. A true field of good karma, neither barren nor defiled.

Good son, Great Wisdom, you have entered the Garden of Pure Fragrance and beheld the treasury of the One Vehicle’s sea of emptiness. Good son, it is like a person crossing the river or sea, not encountering evil winds, safely reaching the other shore. You are likewise: the sick are cured, the cold are clothed, the hungry are fed, the dead are revived, fathers, mothers, brothers, wives, uncles—separated for so long—suddenly meet again, leaping with joy.

You are likewise: having attained the pure eye of the Dharma, your power is unmatched, your wisdom unimpeded. You have penetrated the foremost emptiness, the treasury of the sea of emptiness. You benefit others without harming yourself.

Great Wisdom, your causes and conditions are long-standing, not something that can be praised or spoken of merely today."

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy spoke in verse:

Excellent, supreme immortal of the Sea of Emptiness,
Expounding all dharmas to attain purity.
Benefiting all who practice the right path,
Compassionate and wondrous Dharma abides long.

Like a bright lamp or the light of sun and moon,
Or wisdom’s eye illuminating all beings.
Relying on the threefold understanding, one gains clarity,
Penetrating without obstruction, the Dao shines forth.

The Supreme Heavenly Worthy expounds the true Dharma,
The subtle Sea of Emptiness, the treasury of wisdom.
Excellent, the truth unfolds in due time,
Dispelling the afflictions of skin, flesh, and heart.

Such sacred words, this wondrous Dharma,
Can resolve subtle principles and enlighten beings.
If the mind is scattered and forgetful, one speaks thus,
Unaware of coming and going, past and future.

Good sons and good daughters, all reverently pay homage,
Revealing the true Dao of the supreme master.
Following the treasury of wisdom in the Sea of Emptiness,
Expounding boundless, excellent, and virtuous paths.

Wisdom illuminates, penetrating true principle without remainder,
Discerning for ourselves, we naturally understand.
With sincere hearts and hands clasped in reverence,
This is our self-realized Dharma, unshakable.

If one violates the mind’s Dharma and strays from the teachings,
Or slanders the sacred texts, losing the true Dharma,
Such practitioners wander lost,
Falling into the three evil destinies.

Like clothing dyed but not truly pure,
Like flowers bright in the morning yet withered by dusk,
They enter the dark hells of the five paths of suffering,
Assuming the form of hungry ghosts, endlessly starving.

Their wails and lamentations resound like thunder,
Striking terror into humans and non-humans alike.
By my great compassion, with but a snap of the fingers,
The three paths and five sufferings are instantly illuminated.

You see the past evil causes of yourselves,
Difficult to overcome, yet vows dissolve the fetters of sin.
Thus, those in the three paths and five sufferings
All at once behold the treasury of wisdom.

I proclaim the meaning of the Great Vehicle in a single phrase,
Abiding in the three realms as the Dharma’s decree.

When the Heavenly Worthy had spoken this verse, he addressed the Youth of Victorious Causes in Square City: "Good son, such scriptures are inconceivable. This Dharma serves as medicine for all beings, circulating in the world. Like the purple radiance of flowers, rare and wondrous; like the brilliance of the sun, the pure light of the moon—likewise rare and most delightful. Such flowers are exceedingly difficult to behold.

Good son, if you and others propagate this scripture, and in future generations even one person upholds it, all mighty spirit-kings and demon-kings will guard their body, ensuring no harm or loss. Why? Because this scripture possesses vast and far-reaching power, mighty and formidable, like a lion’s roar, like thunder shaking the earth, indestructible as vajra. Those who uphold this scripture will see great spirit-kings and demon-kings join their hands in reverence, their minds single-pointed, free from afflictions.

Such scriptures are expounded by the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion, the true teaching of the One Vehicle. For this reason, they benefit all beings. Why? Because faith in the true teaching gives rise to right practice. And why is that? From right practice comes right fruition, inconceivable, attaining the true Dharma. Thus, the true Dharma abides long in the world.

My heart pities the boundless, immeasurable multitude of beings, widely delivering and rescuing them through

If one does not cultivate the true Dharma of the Real Ground, they will be beset by sorrow, grief, suffering, and affliction—all impermanent ills—bound to birth and death, with afflictions clinging to the body.

Good son, if there are beings whose minds attain clear vision of majestic wisdom and power, who can subdue what is hard to subdue, see what is hard to see, hear what is hard to hear, and practice what is hard to practice, they will perceive all dharmic appearances with sovereign freedom, yet without discrimination. For this reason, they become undivided and non-differentiated, replete with merit and virtue.

Then the Heavenly Worthy spoke these verses:

I expound the meaning of the Real Ground,
The rare and supreme Dharma,
Pervading the most excellent principle,
Ever-flowing and ungrasped.
Without distinction, without defilement or purity,
Variously explained through discriminations.
Neither increasing nor diminishing the wisdom of all modes,
The meaning of refuge in sovereign freedom.
Sovereign action yields great benefit,
Cultivating the radiant and wondrous honored one.
Emptiness and existence are without divided being,
Just as the nature of the world.

When the Heavenly Worthy had finished reciting the verses, he again addressed the youth of Victorious Causes in Square City: Good son, in the distant past, before I had realized the transcendental scriptures and teachings, I now begin to attain boundless causes and conditions, filled with great joy and ceaseless delight. By practicing this sutra, contemplating its meaning and flavor, I gradually perfect all beings.

Good son, the Treasury of Oceanic Emptiness and Wisdom, for the sake of all beings, adapts to their root capacities. With the rain of Dharma, I constantly pour forth, able to dispel the scorching heat of afflictions in beings, to wash away the dust and filth of the three obstructions, to nurture the single-vehicle roots of goodness in beings, and to benefit all—whether human or non-human.

Good son, it is like sweet rain that moistens all things, whether mountains or marshes, high or low. All grasses and trees receive its benefit without exception.

Good son, it is like rice grains that sprout stems, grow flowers and fruits, and yield sweet dew, bestowing nourishment in all directions. All beings are sated without exception.

Good son, I now expound the causes and conditions of good action, universally enabling all beings to cultivate and grow the single-vehicle Treasury of Oceanic Emptiness, just like this.

Good son, you should bestow this Dharma, expounding for others the secret treasury of the single-vehicle Ocean of Emptiness. Contemplate its meaning and flavor, teach the meaning of emptiness, so that all beings—whether good sons or good daughters—may arouse the mind of dedication, prostrate before the Three Jewels, reverently touch the honored feet, generate manifold thoughts, and form manifold intentions. Exhausting all they possess, with single-minded reverence, they offer fine blossoms and fragrant incense, presenting these in devotion and making open confession.

Good son, by such contemplation, this brings great benefit. The body becomes adamantine, forever unshakable, abiding as the Heaven among Heavens, ever dwelling in the Pure Land, attaining the subtle and wondrous fruit.

Then the Heavenly Worthy again spoke in verse:

Excellent, good son,
Victor of Square City, master of Dharma causes.
Skillfully requesting the true teaching,
Benefiting self and others.
I now speak for you,
Think well and receive it with care.
If good sons and daughters
Revere and uphold it with devotion,
Sweet dew pervades the empty body,
And they ascend to heaven in broad daylight.
But if men or women
Deceive with perverse minds and slander,
They contract red disease in life,
And at death fall into the bottomless hell.
Those who practice this sutra
Purify themselves like blue lotuses.
Through wisdom and faith,
They bow to the true and real meaning.
Mindfully invoking the universal teacher,
They ascend the city of afflictions.
For this reason,
They contemplate all dharmas as universally empty.
The wisdom of the Dao is pure,
A fine field of blessings for the world.
Those who hear the wisdom of the Victorious Teacher
Are like great physicians.
They heal the sick child,
Dispelling all afflictions.
Victor of Square City, youth of supreme wisdom,
Because of the Treasury of Oceanic Wisdom,
You are like a magically born king.
This is the foremost rarity,
Good sons, for you.
Like the magically born great king,
These causes and conditions are long-standing.
Therefore, I teach this Dharma,
To practice goodness and enter therein.
Vast as the empty earth,
It perfects the king of the world.
The pure and subtle fruit,
Good sons, is for you.
You are the teacher of the world,
With utmost sincerity, you should bow in reverence.
Seek the fruit of the eternal Dao,
Assembly of disciples on the sacred path.
You act as the world’s refuge,
As medicine for the world.
In total, you cure the arrogant and haughty,
Who abandon compassion and forsake cultivation.
Long sunk in the three paths,
Even after ten thousand kalpas, remorse is useless.
You speak of what is beneficial,
But the true principle is not what they realize.
True persons, youths, and others,
Rely on the radiance of the sun.
Illuminating all dharmic appearances,
Unmoving and transcendent.
I proclaim equally,
The true meaning of the true Dharma.
Like the pure sun and moon,
Profoundly illuminating all things.
This is my reliance on the scriptures,
Enabling the wise to enter.
With humble mind, arise in reverence,
For the subtle and hard-to-fathom Dharma.
Skillfully knowing without attachment,
Beneficial to the eight worldly concerns.
The mind is ever without defilement,
Spoken of as unobstructed renown.
Ever compassionate, ever upholding,
Known by humans and devas alike.
Bow at the feet of the great teacher,
Who discourses on the constant and inconstant.
Pouring forth the sweet dew of medicine,
Relying on and understanding according to capacity.
Like a feathered bird,
You peruse the city of concentration in order.
Selecting and embracing the Great Vehicle,
May these words bring benefit.
Disseminating to those in the sea of suffering,
To the Dharma persons and the meaning of Dharma.
Nature, summary, and extensive names,
From impurity to ultimate purity.
Thus called the peerless king,
Who thoroughly understands the goodness of the Dharma realm.
Attaining birth in the eternal Great Dao,
Through conditions of supreme penetration.
Neither forgetting persons nor dharmas,
Through the knowledge of non-discrimination.
From the wisdom of non-inversion,
As the Dao is broadly expounded.
The good Dharma established for peace,
The essence of cultivation and wisdom.
The two wisdoms dwell in tranquil repose,
Like the measureless and boundless.
The misfortunes of a hundred thousand kalpas,
Constantly cultivated in accord with number.
Now, having attained the wheel-turning king,
If one can skillfully cultivate the Dao,
In a single thought, all is perfected,
Like the Brahma devas.
Attended by the power of the Heavenly Worthy,
Universally manifesting manifold doors.
Attaining boundless and constant seeds,
Within the expedient means of the Dao.

Perceiving the eternally formless,
Names and meanings become mutual guests.
The true person should constantly practice,
In the two contemplations ever reflecting.

Ascending yet without grandeur,
From this arises true wisdom.
Attaining departure from dust’s increase,
As one sees all as non-existent.

Entering the uncollapsing,
The true person remains ever pure.
Neither delighting nor glorying,
Abandoning external dust-marks.

Entering the city of wisdom’s treasury,
What is grasped is non-existent.
Gradual expedient means arise,
Benefiting without obstruction.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy, having spoken this verse, addressed Śubhahetu:
"Good son, if there are beings who contemplate the emptiness of all dharmas—
all emptiness, the emptiness of emptiness—
there is no self, nor world, nor even empty emptiness.
For example, when beings wish to perceive forms,
the prior form is already empty, the subsequent form is also empty;
this is called empty emptiness.
In a single moment, countless afflictions arise, and so it is likewise.

Good son, first cultivate the lesser Dao, and when the lesser Dao is empty,
then cultivate the middle Dao;
when the middle Dao is empty, then cultivate the higher Dao;
when the higher Dao is empty, through this condition,
this is called empty emptiness.
Through this emptiness, one abides in constant bliss and non-action.

Good son, it is like a goldsmith refining pure gold:
first removing coarse impurities, then fine dust,
until it is called hundred-times refined true gold.
Good son, refining body and mind to seek the supreme Dao is likewise.

Good son, this is called expedient means.
Through its lack of fixation,
and because of this lack of fixation,
the true person and divine youth may accomplish the subtle Dao and dharmas at will,
responding to conditions as they wish, and abiding long therein.

Good son, those not yet attained are enabled to attain,
those attained are enabled to fulfill,
and those fulfilled do not regress.
In present and future lives,
wherever they are born and wherever they practice,
they receive manifold benefits.

Good son, all beings who practice thus
are replete with merit and virtue.
When the Heavenly Worthy appears in the world,
they hear the true Dharma—
this is called the supreme birthplace.
This arises from concentration.

The true person and divine youth,
in the supreme birthplace,
attain a dwelling and abode,
using it at will without regression or deviation,
their fame pervading the two vehicles.
All beings—human and non-human—
with one mind gaze upon the supreme birthplace of the true person and divine youth,
and must attain the wondrous and autonomous land,
transforming other lands,
without going or coming,
without birth or extinction,
autonomous and unimpeded,
abandoning birth and desiring birth,
once born, abiding in attainment.

Good son, according to the duration of their abiding,
they abandon birth and abandon extinction;
according to their births and lives,
they desire birth and desire extinction,
responding to conditions with discernment,
enabling unimpeded divine powers.

Good son, all beings in the boundless worlds,
dwelling in the city of afflictions,
each seeking birth after birth,
craving desire and clinging to form—
through these conditions,
they are born and extinguished, extinguished and born,
constantly born, constantly extinguished,
revolving in birth and death.

Out of my love for them,
I manifest unimpeded,
through the original vow of the true person,
the power of non-discrimination,
divine powers as they wish,
proclaiming the great essential Dharma to all beings,
enabling those who have not seen or heard to see and hear.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy, with great compassion,
composed his countenance, observed the conditions,
and responded to each according to their karmic connections,
then emitted radiant light,
illuminating the lands and worlds of the ten directions,
enabling all sentient beings with karmic affinity to fulfill their aspirations
and listen to the Dharma in peace.
Thus, he emitted light,
illuminating prisoners, hungry ghosts, and hell-beings—
whether kin or not—
all beheld,
and all beings saw the hells of the nine darknesses in the ten directions.

They further saw the Heavenly Worthy expounding the Dharma,
his voice pervading empty space,
manifesting as gods and humans,
transforming and delivering beings,
responding to conditions with universally manifested divine light.

The Heavenly Worthy, seated upon a precious lotus,
surrounded by manifold lights,
expounded the Dharma,
delivering beings with great kindness,
pervading the measureless realms,
manifesting various forms
to deliver all from suffering.

All these beings,
each according to their wishes,
received the true Dharma—
the wondrous One Vehicle, the treasury of sea-like emptiness and wisdom,
its merit majestic and inconceivable.

Good son, the power of divine majesty
transforms according to consciousness,
swift as lightning,
coming and going with speed beyond compare.
If even one person beholds the true realm,
tranquil and non-active,
in a single thought awakens the supreme Dao,
their mind never regressing,
all karmic defilements completely eradicated.

Good and evil karma both arise from the mind;
when the mind is empty, mental consciousness is also empty;
when mental consciousness is empty, transformation is also empty.
Through this condition,
the mind’s consciousness transforms swiftly,
surpassing the speed of wind,
difficult to see, difficult to hear.
This arises from the mind’s activity,
instantly accomplishing what is contemplated.

Such a mind,
contemplating the absence of self,
can encompass all.
Good son, it is like a mirror’s reflection,
reflecting both large and small,
nothing unseen.
My mind’s perception is likewise.
All that exists—
so very, very much—
all appears within this body.

Good son, deluded beings cling to delusion without return,
firmly attached to false doctrines.
I observe their conditions,
like a vajra guard,
enabling them to know past lives,
causes and conditions.
Some are born in famine,
some in times of disease,
some with illness and medical treatment.
Just as the true person receives peace and bliss,
I universally enable all beings
to attain equality.

Good son, if there are those with faith,
insatiable in goodness,
seeking only the Dharma,
with nothing cherished,
I shall assist and encourage them,
proclaiming the One Vehicle treasury of sea-like emptiness,
dispelling the burning city of beings’ afflictions—
like a raging fire, unbearable and invincible.
If there are beings who seek perfection,
their minds untiring,
abandoning evil and advancing in goodness,
single-mindedly upholding,
knowing when to cease evil,
insatiable in goodness—
such is the mark of the Dharma.
I shall proclaim it for them."

"Good son, now your retinue should single-mindedly awaken the great wisdom of the Mahāyāna, transcending both existence and non-existence. Through this cause and condition, existence and non-existence become empty and pure. When the root consciousness is extinguished, it too is empty. Because the root consciousness is empty, the marks of dharmas arise in continuity.

Good son, if there are beings who can do this, they will shatter all delusions. Why is this so? The Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy adapts to the faculties and afflictions of all beings, manifesting in various subtle and wondrous dharma-marks. Whether human or non-human, if even one person clings to the view of emptiness, not departing from the empty dharma, they will doubt the true Dharma. In this present life, they will gain nothing from emptiness. If one contemplates this Dharma, proclaiming it as one with the true reality, like a single flavor, they will attain peace in this life and accomplish the fruition of the Way.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy again addressed Prince Victorious Cause of the Square City: Good son, in measureless kalpas past, you cultivated the treasury of wisdom of the One Vehicle’s sea-like emptiness. Through this cause and condition, you have now realized the subtle and wondrous merit of the treasury of wisdom of the One Vehicle’s sea-like emptiness. Truly a King of Physicians—rare indeed, rare indeed! Your name is Victorious Cause, for you possess excellent methods and arts, healing the children and expounding the roots of goodness. For this reason, your name is Victorious Cause.

Good son, you have vast vows and perfect merit. What are these vast vows? First, the constant vow: to make great offerings, always offering to those of supreme merit and to the Dharma-teachers. Second, the constant vow: that I and others single-mindedly uphold the supreme and wondrous true Dharma. Third, the constant vow: to turn the great Dharma-wheel, always turning the wheel of Dharma in the great assembly. Fourth, the constant vow: to cultivate the vow of practice, always expounding the Dharma, so that all sages, true persons, and youths universally hear and see it. Fifth, the constant vow: to perfect all beings in the realm, so that they attain peace and the roots of goodness of the Three Vehicles. Sixth, the constant vow: to serve with the vow of the mind, that the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy abides in all lands, seeing all Daoists with constant reverence, listening to and receiving the true Dharma. Seventh, the constant vow: to attain a pure land, establishing the Dharma-teaching, cultivating and protecting mindfulness, so that all these beings attain peace. Eighth, the constant vow: never to depart from all beings, never to depart from the immortal Dao, practicing diligently together with true persons and youths. Ninth, the constant vow: to benefit all universally, sheltering them without fail. Tenth, the constant vow: to awaken to the true Way, transforming all beings to attain the same true fruition.

Good son, those who cultivate these ten subtle and supreme vows will ascend to the supreme ground and attain accomplishment. Why is this? Because such vows truly lead to the attainment of a pure land. Good son, I have already attained this pure land, thus emerging from the defiled land of birth and death.

Good son, it is like the Dragon King’s twelve links of dependent origination: sometimes arising from non-arising, sometimes non-arising from arising; sometimes arising from arising, sometimes non-arising from non-arising, or neither arising nor non-arising—each expounded according to what is fitting for beings. Good son, there is also dependent origination where dharmas with marks are called defiled, and dharmas without marks are called pure.

Good son, you should now know that the supreme and true matter of the wondrous true Dharma speaks of true reality and truth. How then does one speak of true precepts? Good son, these true precepts are where the *Eight Essentials* and the *Four Illuminations* converge as one. Your retinue should all contemplate this sutra, exploring its profundities. You should attentively uphold its subtle and intricate meanings. The single pure precept is the precept of nature, inherently and constantly pure. It can uphold what has been violated; once the mind confesses and reveals, purity is restored.

Next, you should observe: first, pure faith; second, pure mind; third, pure body. Awakening the supreme Way, body and mind become pure. This is the beginning of clarity and conduct, the origin of all practices. Because of this purity, great compassion arises, and all practices are undertaken. The Dharma of the Way is seen clearly, without obstruction. Through true understanding, the subtle origin is penetrated, and true principle is realized. Realm and wisdom are without discrepancy—this is called the Way. Why is this so? Because the true Way is realized. The Way responds with transformed bodies, and one should receive the teaching master.

Good son, those who uphold the true teaching and cultivate the true practice are called supreme and foremost guides, universally enabling beings to mature and understand the marks of the Way. Through various aspirations and vows, they lead all beings to seek the true and spontaneous fruition of the Way, inspiring all future beings to delight in propagating the supreme Way. They expound the treasury of wisdom of the One Vehicle’s sea-like emptiness, enabling all beings to awaken to equal benefit—rare indeed, rare indeed! Abiding in merit, they strengthen their own bodies, departing from the five dusts, relinquishing attachment and clinging, guarding their faculties, and dwelling in the unshakable realm of the supreme heavens’ constant bliss.

Good son, if there is one who relinquishes attachment and clinging, guarding the six senses and preventing evil, this person will dwell in the four fruits of mindfulness. Through mindfulness, they will thoroughly understand the profound and wondrous Dharma, without doubt or slander. Their mind will be like a lotus, radiant amidst the dust, unstained by defilements, free from thoughts of attachment and love. If one contemplates this form as empty and without substance, like a magically born prince of the great king, all virtues are pure. Born in the land of the Way, they can subdue others with the power of their virtue, seeking the Dharma and leaving the household life. Body and mind are pure, departing from the city of afflictions, ascending to the upper realms, personally attending the Divine Worthy. They deeply understand that all dharmas are empty, pure, neither existent nor non-existent, neither pure nor impure.

Why is this? Because all beings have not yet attained the understanding of emptiness. Due to the twofold contemplation of existence, they have not yet attained the subtle and profound power of samādhi and wisdom.

Good son, now that your retinue has left the household life, if you develop attachment to the profound and wondrous Dharma you have attained, because of this attachment, you will not attain purity."

Why is this so? The pure and correct Dharma has no place of existence. If one clings to the notion that dharmas possess distinct characteristics, attachment arises. Good son, this is impossible. Such attachment is the activity of ignorance—what is called "volition" is action, and action is karma. The true person, the youth, rightly cultivates the six practices, contemplating birth and death, yet has not yet relinquished them. Through abundant cultivation, one grows weary of all evils; through conditioned arising and cessation, one generates aversion toward all evils. This perception, like emptiness, has no basis and cannot endure. Each and every dharma possesses distinct meanings, yet one has not fully understood them. All beings speak differently, their causes and conditions each unique.

Good son, the Dao, through its Dharma gates, encompasses immeasurable and boundless categories of dharmas. Some take the five aggregates as a Dharma gate to embrace all dharmas. The faculties of beings are as if in the palm of one’s hand. Dull-rooted beings cannot deeply receive it. The true person, the youth, by the power of wholesome dharmas, expounds this profound teaching, enabling them to receive the supreme correct Dharma. He teaches immeasurable meanings with skillful means, wielding majestic and sovereign virtue. Again, with immeasurable and subtle correct Dharmas, he instructs in all the boundless Dharma gates. For this reason, they are immeasurable and infinite. Names, phrases, and meanings are likewise immeasurable and infinite. Subtle phrases and meanings perfect beings’ supreme eloquence. Regarding what is not difficult, they conceive difficulty, establishing all manner of challenges to confound others, leaving them unable to respond. If one answers, it enables them to attain understanding.

The ocean of emptiness, the Dao, and its fruition take the Dharma as their body. What is the Dharma-body? It has many meanings. All dharmas of the three times, whether existent or non-existent—good son, this is the gate of skillful means, the gate of great wisdom. If there are beings who lack faith, teach them the One Vehicle, the ocean of emptiness, the treasury of wisdom, cherishing and upholding it. For those who have not planted wholesome roots, nurture them with loving-kindness, strengthening their wholesome roots so all may attain accomplishment, benefiting all who have not yet accomplished, enabling them to accomplish; those not yet liberated, enabling them to attain liberation. Thus, skillful means are established in the world.

Good son, just as great wisdom augments virtue and enhances wholesome power, you have skillfully exhorted countless beings, urging them to vigorous diligence, resolutely arousing the aspiration to forever extinguish afflictions, never to arise again. Good son, Radiant Wisdom Victorious, you are rare indeed; the Dharma Realm King is also rare; the Transformation-Born Great King is also rare. Harmonious wholesome roots, beings of great wisdom—rare in the world; the Ocean of Emptiness Wisdom Treasury is also rare; the Wholesome Seed Great King is also rare.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy, with the eye of great compassion, spoke these verses:

The victorious cause of the Dharma citadel
Arises from the Dharma’s manifold nature.
Thus, among the Heaven of Heavens,
There is no Dharma of existence.

Excellent is the subtle and wondrous Dharma,
Contemplating the emptiness of form’s inherent nature.
Great emptiness and small emptiness—
Both are without existence.

Originally, there is no existent Dharma,
Yet beings, through deluded thought, conceive it so.
Thus, regarding all dharmas,
The victorious cause of the Dharma citadel:

All classes of beings
Depend on the mind’s discriminations.
Like emptiness, neither empty nor existent,
Without action, without attainment.

Not by "emptiness as emptiness,"
Is form’s emptiness non-form.
Then arises non-discrimination,
No form, no empty Dharma.

Thus, form is precisely emptiness;
If form and emptiness were distinct,
The essence of emptiness would not hold—
How could it be established or not?

For example, conditioned dharmas
Do not differ from the eternal.
If one discerns their nature,
This is called emptiness.

Emptiness is then form’s emptiness—
How can form’s emptiness be empty?
Form’s characteristics are without existence,
Yet this is both existence and emptiness.

Form’s emptiness is precisely form,
Without any non-discrimination.
This emptiness is precisely form,
Emptiness, form, emptiness, emptiness, emptiness.

True nature cannot be spoken,
As if born from a pure land.
Not apart from form is emptiness,
Thus emptiness does not become form.

Form’s essence is like empty space,
Hence named "emptiness of emptiness."
If emptiness and form were distinct,
Conditioned form would differ from truth.

There would be no meaning in sagehood,
Emptiness could not dispel form.
No meaning in leaving the ordinary,
If bound to discriminative appearances.

Then arises the impure,
If bound to true reality,
It should become pure—
Thus, emptiness cannot be spoken.

What makes form "form"?
Only the name is form.
Great indeed, good son,
If apart from name, empty form.

Truly, there is no inherent emptiness,
This is self-nature’s non-arising.
No cessation, no profound purity,
This form is without existence.

With arising comes defilement—
Thus, form has no separate characteristic.
Through "without existence," it pervades,
Opposed to the provisional to establish names.

This is the work of the illusory,
Opposed to all named discriminations.
All dharmas are fundamentally empty,
Provisionally establishing appearances.

According to conditions, dharmas are expounded—
Thus, all names are like this.
The true person sees nothing,
Not seeing, nor does it arise.

This is called the peerless pair,
By this, it is spoken as the cause.
Without division, without distinction,
Extinguishing all discriminative delusions.

Name and Dharma are not distinct,
All existent dharmas—
Form’s emptiness is not empty,
Emerging as the seed.

Entering, it is without-nature arising,
Possessing this signless principle.
The Vajra Eye of the Dharma Realm
Has no wisdom prior to names.

Many names and indeterminacy
Fulfill meaning through shared essence.
Many mixed, distinct characteristics—
Through signlessness, already existent.

Without defilement yet with purity,
Thus, it is like empty space.
Through this emptiness, the Dharma is empty,
Without self-nature or other-nature.

True reality is also absent,
Like an image in a mirror.
What is seen is without existence,
Yet wholesome and unwholesome bodily karma arises.

Form follows shadow like shape,
Like echoes coming and going.
Like light and reflections,
Like the moon in water.

The water holds nothing,
The tranquil mind is likewise.
Thus, no analogy exists—
This is the supreme Dao.

Skilled in worldly affairs,
Excellent, great sagely master.
Distinguishing and expounding the profound and hidden,
Those who awaken to the One Vehicle attain realization.

At that time, having heard the Celestial Worthy recite this verse, Great Wisdom questioned the Youth of Victorious Causes of the Jeweled Citadel: "By the great compassion of the Celestial Worthy, the rain of Dharma has poured forth these words and the place of their teaching. Excellent, Youth of Victorious Causes of the Jeweled Citadel, for what meaning did the Celestial Worthy of Great Compassion speak thus? Though the Celestial Worthy traverses all heavens in every place, how does he not perceive birth and death? In the past, within *paratantra*-nature, dependent upon true reality, the coming and going of birth and death held no distinction in meaning. I wished to inquire but dared not speak. Excellent, Perfected One, Youth of Victorious Causes of the Jeweled Citadel, I only hope that you and the great kings will proceed to the Worthy One’s abode to request the resolution of these doubts. What is the intent?"

At that time, the Youth of Victorious Causes of the Jeweled Citadel replied to Great Wisdom: "Excellent, Dharma Master. I constantly contemplate the subtle and wondrous true Dharma, aspiring to propagate and uphold it. Now that you have deigned to ask, it is most fitting for one of your virtue." Thereupon, excellent indeed, they hastened together to the seat of the Celestial Worthy, King of the Dharma of Radiant Golden Light and Supreme Faith. Making obeisance and paying reverence, they addressed the Celestial Worthy: "We only hope the Celestial Worthy will take pity and answer us."

At that time, Great Wisdom further addressed the Celestial Worthy: "All sentient beings, whether with karmic conditions or without, from whence do they come? Whether eternal or impermanent, from whence do they come? The characteristics of emptiness and existence—apart from eternal and non-eternal, do the principles of scripture and reason separate? Is what is seen as form considered conditioned and possessing form, or is it formless? At that time, the Celestial Worthy joyfully replied: "Excellent, excellent, good man. What you now ask is truly no question at all; what you now speak is truly nothing spoken. Now listen carefully and sit according to your station. I shall tell you of the original causes and conditions of the past. Good man, where the impermanent is spoken of as non-impermanent, and where non-impermanent is spoken of as neither impermanent nor non-impermanent, relying on the meaning of signlessness to expound the eternal Dao—this is called the impermanent. Good man, the characteristics of *paratantra*-nature arise from true reality; the partial abiding arises from the nature of discrimination. Thus, nature is also impermanent. From the division of these two natures, neither impermanent nor non-impermanent, the meaning of eternal and impermanent is spoken as non-dual, suffering and joy as non-dual, good and evil as non-dual, empty and non-empty as non-dual, self and no-self as non-dual, pure and impure as non-dual, nature and non-nature as non-dual, arising and non-arising as non-dual, cessation and non-cessation as non-dual. Why is this so? Because through these distinctions of perception, one sees the eternal and non-eternal, sees joy and non-joy, sees purity and impurity, sees emptiness and non-emptiness, sees nature and non-nature, sees suffering and non-suffering, sees cessation and non-cessation. Because of this perception, all views harmonize into one; because of this one view, what is seen is no seeing, nor is there non-seeing. The seeing of no-seeing follows sentient beings. Speaking of eternal and non-eternal, decisively understanding the two natures, the coming and going of quiescence and extinction."

At that time, the Celestial Worthy recited a verse:

"Bridge-like, good man,
Great Wisdom, supreme master.
The true rarity of all dharmas
Is like their manifold appearances.
Revered by all sages,
Through this Dharma and non-Dharma.
Without this Dharma and non-Dharma,
Supreme good man.
This is the unconditioned Dharma,
Thus the non-dual meaning is spoken.
Depending on one aspect, it is said
To be existent or non-existent;
Depending on two, it is said
To be neither existent nor non-existent.
Because it manifests, it is not non-existent,
Thus it is not spoken of as eternal;
Because it reveals true reality,
Thus it is spoken of as not non-existent.
By its own nature being non-existent,
Its own nature not abiding.
Constantly grasping the non-existent Dharma,
The three natures attain non-abiding.
Fields, being without nature, become
The prior support for the posterior.
Without arising or cessation, originally pure,
And self-nature entering extinction.
One mind like the blue lotus,
May it attain the true golden flower.
The unconditioned light of the seven treasures,
Abiding in the realm of the Dharma King.
Not entering the wheel of retrogression,
May it be born in the Ground of Difficult Victory.
Forever preserving the unconditioned arising,
All accomplish the supreme Dao."

At that time, having heard the Celestial Worthy recite this verse, the Youth of Victorious Causes of the Jeweled Citadel said to Great Wisdom: "By the great compassion of the Celestial Worthy, the treasury of ocean-like, empty wisdom of the One Vehicle, with its boundless flavors of meaning, is provisionally expressed through words to awaken sentient beings. I now contemplate this—rare indeed, rare indeed! The Celestial Worthy skillfully expounds the characteristics of all dharmas as neither existent nor non-existent, neither non-existent nor non-non-existent, neither spoken nor non-spoken. Through the harmonious convergence of causes and conditions, he opens the gate of expedient means to guide and instruct sentient beings. For this reason, it is inconceivable. The ultimate Dao is empty and without attainment. It is like using a wedge to remove a wedge. Why is this so? It is like treating an illness: because of the illness, medicine is taken to regulate body and mind. When the illness is cured, the medicine is dissolved, leaving nothing behind."

At that time, Great Wisdom further addressed him: "The Celestial Worthy of Great Compassion expounds the characteristics of all dharmas as neither empty nor existent, neither eternal nor extinct. Now, do we know emptiness and existence, or do we not know them? It is like someone who grasps the Dharma of equality, expounding this and that, where emptiness has no place. The Celestial Worthy is also thus—his Dharma-body of equality is established in the mind, thus he speaks in this way. It is like someone saying that the past is the present. The Celestial Worthy’s accomplishment is equality of intent. It is like someone possessing one gold coin, with which they seek to obtain a thousand. It is not that they do not obtain a thousand, nor is it that one does not obtain. The Celestial Worthy is also thus—like obtaining a thousand or ten thousand coins from one gold coin. Such is the characteristic: it is like someone reciting and upholding sutras, whose merit accrues over hundreds of thousands of kalpas. All such merits of a thousand or ten thousand are likewise thus. Obtaining one gold coin and using a thousand or ten thousand is also thus. If there are men and women seeking the Dao who are also thus, able to practice small virtues yet receiving superior reward—by whose vow do they, on the path of bliss, in a pure land, proceed to be reborn, possessing the ten reflections and accomplishing their minds?"

If there are sentient beings who accomplish the Celestial Worthy, first extolling and praising the merit of almsgiving—should there be those who, whether for wealth or treasure, damage this wealth and treasure, harboring a miserly heart, not following the Dao’s grace, yet devise skillful means to ensure all myriad beings do not transgress the Dao’s teachings—it is likewise thus.

At that time, the youth *Victorious Cause of the Square City* bowed before the Worthy, joined his palms, and spoke these verses:

The Celestial Worthy, great compassionate mother,
Well expounds the supreme meaning,
Whose words, through cultivation, give rise.
All dharmas that exist,
Thus fruition is perfected.
Whether human or non-human,
Receiving the Dao, they naturally arise.
Thus it is said: the revered Brahmā master
Swiftly completes the *Ocean of Emptiness* host.
From form and views,
One should know the dharma enters illumination.
Dependent arising’s middle discrimination
Is not without true reality.
Thus, not obtaining this medicine,
My Dharma is universally equal and level.
Upholding the Dao, abiding in merit,
Goodness flourishes with manifold meanings.
Together, we set forth on the path of wisdom,
All ascending to the Supreme Capital.

When the youth *Victorious Cause of the Square City* had finished these verses, he addressed *Ocean of Emptiness*: "Great indeed is the true being! Through causes and conditions of distant antiquity, your body radiates light, your spiritual penetrations are sovereign, you emerge into the world, your virtue and conduct are perfectly fulfilled—such cannot be praised enough. Sentient beings, sunk in defilement, by what root-nature do they pose such difficulties? Entering yet not entering, departing yet not departing, clinging to both extremes—how does this occur?"

At that time, *Ocean of Emptiness Treasury of Wisdom* replied to *Victorious Cause*: "Great being, benevolent one, entering is without duality. Seeing the Dharma as equal, it is neither one nor not-one. By these dharmas, there is no such place. Why? Shattering all demonic perversities, subduing all heretical minds and external paths, such merit is unmatched in the world. Heavenly demons and external paths speak of true principle, yet the Celestial Worthy’s teachings—subtle and wondrous true Dharma—establish their own Dharma, which also has no fixed nature. Why? The Celestial Worthy of Great Compassion teaches the supreme true Dao of original nature, the true Dharma taught cannot be altered or destroyed. Why? With wisdom perfectly fulfilled, all heavenly demons, heterodox views, external paths, and perverse minds clinging to attachments obstruct the great Dharma, giving rise to views of existence and destroying the great Dharma."

Through this cause and condition, the Radiant Light Youth manifests in various forms to expound the Dharma, liberating sentient beings and revealing his virtues—namely, by virtue of non-self, he displays pure and subtle merits. My boundless expedient virtues, like worldly dharmas, deem the higher realms as superior.

Good man, the teachings I expound exhaust the cycle of birth and death. They generate all wholesome roots in sentient beings, benefiting and bringing peace, with unimpeded merit. The Celestial Worthy of Great Compassion abides in the Dharma-realm, the supreme unconditioned Dharma.

Good man, the Dharma-realm has two aspects: first, the defiled realm; second, the undefiled realm. The undefiled realm is the purest and most supreme. Why? The Celestial Worthy of Great Compassion exhausts the limits of birth and death, benefiting and bringing peace, with boundless merit and bliss.

At that time, Oceanic Emptiness spoke in verse:

Who upholds the Dharma of great love,
Accords with wholesome roots.
Neither self nor other,
Yet brings benefit, growth, or decline.

Where does the Celestial Worthy
Expound these dharma marks?
This realm, without beginning,
Is the support of all dharmas.

If there are those on the Way
Who attain liberation,
Such original or non-original states—
Rare indeed, rare indeed.

When Oceanic Emptiness had finished speaking these verses, he further asked the Victorious Cause Youth: "You speak of Daoists and all sentient beings who initially do not comprehend, their ignorance unexhausted, bound by craving and attachment. Some drift along, now reborn as animals, now as hungry ghosts, now as humans, now as Celestial Worthies, now as Perfected Ones. Though these Daoists have left the household life, they hold inverted and perverse views, unaware and unknowing. In the world, they thus endure suffering, increasing their craving and attachment, constantly subject to karmic retribution. For what cause and condition do these Daoists remain unaware and unknowing?"

At that time, the Victorious Cause Youth replied to Oceanic Emptiness: "Excellent, true man! Though these Daoists have left the household life, they cling to attachments, their deceit and cunning ablaze. They accumulate much fraud and theft, yet claim to have left the household life, seeking fame and profit, desiring offerings.

Good man, through such causes and conditions, they constantly endure karmic retribution. Why? Whether leaving the household or remaining in it—good man, such persons constantly endure karmic retribution. The Celestial Worthy has declared this intent.

Good man, virtuous Daoists have no attachments. They seek the supreme Dharma, contemplating all dharmas as impermanent, empty, and without possession. Such leaving of the household accords with wholesome causes and conditions. Wholesome and unwholesome causes and conditions each follow their own course, unrelated to others.

Good man, the Celestial Worthy has declared: Those who uphold this admonition rely on this place, constantly without forsaking it, without any notion of self. Why? Because of the emptiness of emptiness."

The grains of sand upon the Ganges—all such merits too are without attachment.

Good man, if the treasury of the true person holds what is realized and what is not, there is no place for it anywhere. The Celestial Worthy of Great Compassion’s secret and precious treasury is neither non-being nor non-non-being, neither being nor non-being, and has no such locus.

Those who leave the household in truth rely and abide in this locus. Those who are not true renunciates cling to consciousness, engaging in many deeds, deceit, and false speech. They return to the gates of evil destinies, binding themselves, heedless of external gatherings, and cry out in lament: “Alas, suffering!”

All sentient beings are just like this.

The youth of supreme causes addressed the great perfected one, Ocean-void Wisdom-treasury, saying: “Is it thus?” He replied: “It is not.”

The true person, the great master, has causes and conditions vast and far-reaching. Today, with joyful courage, the supreme great master and his immeasurable retinue—you have aroused the mind set upon the supreme Dao, which is inconceivable.

At that time, the youth of supreme causes, amidst the great assembly, further spoke these verses:

All dharmas abide dependent on the treasury,
All sentient beings’ consciousness.
Thus it is called *kalya*—
I expound it for others.

Grasping and holding to subtle consciousness,
The seeds of dharmas flow constantly.
To the ordinary and to the “I,” I do not speak;
Let them not cling to it as “I.”

As not all activities,
All activities do not know.
The true person, in accord with wholesome consciousness,
Then departs from the five consciousnesses.

If counteracting and transforming reliance,
It does not become extinguished, thus it is not accomplished.
Cause and fruit are not distinct;
In extinction, there is encounter.

Without seeds, without dharma—
If one allows this to be transformation of reliance,
Since there is no duality and no “there is,”
The meaning of transformation of reliance does not arise.

Without residue, mind transforms dharma—
By what expedient means
Does one arrive at Ocean-void Wisdom-treasury?

Thus concludes *Scroll the Fourth of the Supreme One Vehicle’s Ocean-void Wisdom-treasury Sutra*.
*Scroll the Fifth of the Supreme One Vehicle’s Ocean-void Wisdom-treasury Sutra* begins.

**Chapter on Inquiring About Illness**

At that time, Ocean-void Wisdom-treasury rose from his seat, composed his mind, and bowed in reverence, addressing the Heavenly Venerable: "Heavenly Venerable, now free from all afflictions and ailments, beyond the suffering of impermanence, no longer subject to birth and death, you abide in constant bliss, purity, subtlety, and perfection. Greatly Compassionate Heavenly Venerable, why do sentient beings suffer from four kinds of illness? How do the four defilements—craving for sounds and forms, ignorance, arrogance, and pride—become the causes of these diseases? They drive the mind to madness, confusion, and agitation, giving rise to illness. Why is this so? Greed breeds bodily disease; attachment breeds mental disease. When body and mind are equally afflicted, the four hundred and four diseases arise: the skin withers, the flesh wastes away, the heart races in distress, the five viscera fall into discord, urine drips incessantly, eyes and ears ache, the abdomen and back throb with pain, and the four limbs and hundred joints ache ceaselessly. Such are the manifold diseases of body and mind.

The Greatly Compassionate Heavenly Venerable is forever free from illness. Yet now I see all sentient beings—whether human or non-human—suffering from disease. These very illnesses afflict me as well: abdominal disease and heart disease. I beseech the Heavenly Venerable, in your mercy toward us, to expound the healing medicines that may cure all sentient beings of the future, allowing the unseen to see and the unheard to hear."

Then the Heavenly Venerable praised Ocean-void, saying: "Excellent, excellent, good man! You know the right time, inquiring for the sake of all, moved by compassion for sentient beings, and thus speak of illness. Desiring to dispel their suffering, you ask me to prescribe the cure. Good man, you have cultivated great compassion for immeasurable kalpas, ever cherishing and benefiting sentient beings, sparing them from distress. You have offered various medicines and joys to the afflicted. Why then do you now claim to be ill? Good man, it is because you see worldly people suffering from abdominal and heart diseases, their skin and flesh wasting away, that you grieve deeply. To cure these ills, newly ordained Daoists, in their greed, hoard all manner of impure things. In truth, you are not ill; you wish only to guide all deluded sentient beings toward the single vehicle of the Ocean-void Wisdom-treasury, removing their afflictions—greed, anger, ignorance, and wrath.

Good man, the true person, the youth who cultivates great compassion, provides medicine to all the sick, constantly vowing: *May all sentient beings forever sever their diseases and attain the true adamantine body; may all infinite beings always encounter wondrous medicines, cutting off all deafness, blindness, and malignant illnesses.* By severing disease, they gain the medicine of wisdom; by the power of this medicine, they eradicate all venomous afflictions. These sentient beings, in the medicine of wisdom, attain non-retrogression and swiftly accomplish the supreme medicine of the Dao, dissolving all heavy views and afflictions. Diligent in practice, they perfect the wisdom-heart of the Heavenly Venerable. They concoct the medicine of equality, universally curing all diseases, preventing sentient beings from harboring slanderous thoughts. With the medicine of equality—its roots, trunks, branches, and leaves—this medicine of equality heals all grave illnesses, grave views, grave afflictions, and grave hearts. May all beings escape the city of afflictions, depart from the prison of craving, and accomplish the Heavenly Venerable’s pure, luminous, radiant wisdom, entering the secret treasury of Ocean-void.

Good man, the true person, the youth, has already made vast vows across the infinite worlds and lands of the ten directions: *May all sentient beings be freed from the roots, trunks, and branches of disease.* These diseases, empty, pure, cool, and blissful, are ever at ease, subtle, and perfect, equal and beyond equality in aspect."

Then Ocean-void addressed the Heavenly Venerable: "How can you say I am not ill when I am? Now I reflect: in this world, the sick cannot sit or rise, their movements labored, food and drink obstructed, their mouths unable to speak. Like a lost son managing the family estate, when the time comes, kin—parents, spouse, siblings, and friends—each scatter, knowing birth must end in death. Heavenly Venerable, I am just the same. I see sentient beings dwelling in the city of afflictions, beholding only iron pellets glowing red-hot, hungry ghosts wailing skyward, their cries thunderous, eating embers when hungry, drinking fiery essence when thirsty. Hell’s wardens, ox-headed, eyes like bright stars, wield iron forks, circling cauldrons of boiling water. They seize the damned by hand and foot, casting them in, their bones and flesh dissolving. For these reasons, I see myself as ill—abdominal disease, heart disease. How can you say I am not?"

Having spoken thus, Ocean-void composed a verse before the Venerable, entreating:

Greatly Compassionate, Greatly Virtuous One,
Rare in the Three Realms, all look to you.
I pray you expound the equal,
The root of the wisdom-medicine tree.

Now I, a child of many diseases,
From dawn to dusk, barely endure.
My abdomen aches, my heart writhes,
My spirit dims, my breath grows faint.

The lowly, foolish common folk—
How could they know the gate of good medicine?
Like the blind who cannot see the path,
Advancing a foot, they know not an inch.

Though four roads lie before them,
They gallop as they please.
Father of compassion through the three times,
You ever teach the gate of the wisdom-treasury.

When the four diseases of affliction arise,
Body scatters, spirit and soul disperse.
In the dark depths of hell,
How can they see their children and grandchildren?

Day by day, they are born and die again,
Forever parted from the Blissful Venerable.
I pity all sentient beings,
And beg for the medicine of equality.

Whether human or non-human,
Whoever partakes shall endure.
Like sweet dew raining down,
Every branch and leaf receives its grace.

Sprouts, flowers, roots, and trees,
Fruit ripens for all to consume.
I only pray, O Heavenly Venerable,
Expound the single-vehicle Dao.

For those lost in the darkness of suffering,
Who see and yet remain deluded, resentful—
Pity the multitudes yet to come,
Who bow in reverence, forgetting body and soul.

They see only the children of hungry ghosts,
Seeking kin in the three wretched paths.
Ox-heads drag them into cauldrons,
Hell’s wardens flip them with iron forks.

Their wails shake like thunder,
Their bones pile like mountains.
"

When hungry, they eat burning coals;
When thirsty, they drink flames of fire.
Only by Your great compassion’s teaching
May all escape the gates of hell.

These multitudes of sentient beings
Bow their heads to the Supreme Venerable.
Then, the Heavenly Venerable, his heart suffused with boundless mercy, answered Haikong, saying:
“Excellent, excellent, good man! You know well the time and have made this inquiry for the sake of all beings.
These sentient beings, each born from their own thoughts, give rise to manifold distinctions. Within these distinctions, they seek manifold forms, manifold sounds, manifold scents, manifold tastes, manifold touches.
From these causes and conditions arise diseases of the eye, ear, belly, heart, and body—four hundred and four afflictions in all.
You, wishing to accord with all sentient beings and to benefit them, have composed verses to make this inquiry.”

Thereupon, the Heavenly Venerable sat upright upon his throne, his countenance radiant and joyful as a red lotus, his majestic bearing luminous as the sun and moon.
Then the Heavenly Venerable emitted a great light, suffusing the empty sky. This radiance, surpassing that of a hundred thousand suns, illuminated the eastern, southern, western, and northern quarters, the four intermediate directions, the zenith and nadir, all lands, and other worlds, bestowing upon all beings the torch of the equality-medicine, extinguishing their four hundred and four afflictions, and establishing all sentient beings in unwavering steadfastness, granting them the mind of equality.

At that time, the Heavenly Venerable, in tranquil contemplation, manifested a wondrous form adorned with seventy-two marks and eighty-one excellences, his body resplendent.
From each mark and excellence upon his body bloomed a precious flower, exquisitely subtle, each with a thousand petals—a pure red lotus with a lapis lazuli stem, coral branches, amber roots, and pearl leaves, its form towering and majestic like a jeweled banner.
These precious flowers emitted manifold hues of light—azure, yellow, crimson, white, red, green, vermilion, and purple.
These lights universally illuminated the hells of ignorance, the uninterrupted hell, the wailing hell, the weeping hell, the hell of fire chariots, the hell of fire beds, the hell of iron pellets, and the hell of iron cauldrons.

At that time, within the hells were also hungry ghosts—lonely-form hungry ghosts, solitary-body hungry ghosts, solitary-bone hungry ghosts, solitary-touch hungry ghosts, withered-form hungry ghosts, withered-skin hungry ghosts, withered-bone hungry ghosts, withered-flesh hungry ghosts, empty-eating hungry ghosts, coal-eating hungry ghosts, formless hungry ghosts, and weeping hungry ghosts. Such ghosts constantly endured the suffering of cold, tormented by impermanence, their heads and faces shattered, their bodies broken and torn, mutually harming one another.
When these hungry ghosts beheld the light, all such sufferings vanished without trace, and they were immediately pacified, their bodies soothed and at ease.
They also saw within the light the secret treasury of Haikong’s jeweled terrace, where it was proclaimed that all sentient beings, even these hungry ghosts, possess the nature of the Dao.
Upon hearing these words, the hungry ghosts each repented, and at once their lives ended, and they were reborn among humans and gods. All the hells became utterly empty, with none left to suffer punishment.
Only those who disbelieved and slandered the single-vehicle treasury of Haikong’s wisdom remained, tormented by hunger and thirst, abiding in those hells for hundreds of thousands of years, never having heard the name of sweet dew, never having received the moisture of sweet rain.

At that time, the hells stood empty.
Then, within the light, appeared hundreds of thousands of perfected immortals and youths, each holding golden lotuses and jade flowers. Within each lotus sat a Daoist adept, supremely adorned, unmatched in the world.
From the flowers emerged true-form Daoists, true-aspect Daoists, true-wisdom Daoists, dharma-joy Daoists, dharma-accomplished Daoists, dharma-liberated Daoists, dharma-blessed Daoists, dharma-true Daoists, dharma-delight Daoists, wondrous-adornment Daoists, wondrous-mind Daoists, wondrous-vision Daoists, wondrous-garden Daoists, wondrous-flower Daoists, and wondrous-aspect Daoists.
These Daoists gathered together, some walking, some sitting, some reclining, some standing, each producing wondrous sounds—playing phoenix flutes, zithers, harps, zhu, and konghou, while phoenixes, peacocks, lions, and white tigers roared and sang in harmonious melody.
Whether male or female, all who followed the sound beheld the hells, the animal realms, the hungry ghosts, and all beings, human and non-human, who rejoiced as one.

Then the Heavenly Venerable expounded for all sentient beings the treasury of the single vehicle. He taught the luminous canons of the Three Caverns, the cinnabar scriptures, and the accomplishment of the three vehicles for the benefit of all.
He spoke of leaving the household life, sitting in the empty city adorned with the seven treasures, and turning the wondrous Dharma wheel.
Having turned the Dharma wheel, all the people of that land and all sentient beings received benefit: the blind saw forms, the deaf heard sounds, the mute spoke, the lame walked, the poor became rich, and poverty and wealth were equalized. Those who disbelieved came to believe.
Thus, boundless multitudes of sentient beings cultivated the treasury of the single-vehicle, Haikong’s wisdom.

At that time, gods, dragons, ghosts, and spirits—celestial dragons and aerial ghosts, the eight fierce deities of the swift steed, Qiang, Hu, Di, and Lao peoples, humans and non-humans—all joined their voices in praise, saying:
“Excellent, excellent, Supreme Heavenly Venerable! You have brought great benefit to all.”
Having spoken thus, they leapt and rejoiced, some singing, some dancing, bowing in reverence, circumambulating, and extolling him. They burned incense, scattered flowers, raised banners and canopies, and played music of manifold wondrous sounds, filling the seat with their offerings.
They made offerings to the Heavenly Venerable, the Great Compassionate Heavenly Venerable, lamenting:
“We, dwelling in borderlands, bear human form yet lack the seed of wisdom. How is it that You, upon the seven-jeweled terrace of Haikong’s vehicle, expound the treasury of the single-vehicle wisdom for all sentient beings? Such rarity is difficult to see, difficult to hear. How can it be said that even Your own body suffers illness?”

May the Heavenly Venerable deign to expound and clarify, that all may see and understand.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Venerable replied to the heavenly dragons: Excellent, excellent, good man! You have already perfected profound wisdom, offering pure and manifold incense and flowers, manifold sweet flavors, manifold music, and manifold jeweled banners. Good man, you have attained wisdom and eloquence, having made offerings to measureless and boundless Heavenly Venerables of the three times. Therefore, you now skillfully purify with incense and make manifold offerings.

Good man, in the past, through measureless and boundless ages—dim and obscure, in the Longhan and Chiming kalpas—I appeared under various names, formless and nameless, expounding for gods and humans this single-vehicle treasury of Haikong’s wisdom. I revealed and distinguished it, pondered its meaning and flavor, and for the multitude unfolded, recited, transcribed, and adorned its scrolls, disseminating it throughout the ten directions of the world, so that all sentient beings received benefit.

Good man, from that time until now, I have never harbored evil, afflictive karmic obstructions, never slandered, never disbelieved, never opposed, never destroyed. Since that time, body and mind have been at peace, free from all suffering and distress.

Good man, you sentient beings dwell in the city of afflictions, beset by manifold illnesses and torments—abdominal ailments and heart ailments—unaware of the secret treasury of the single vehicle. Following expedient speech, you say that Haikong suffers from abdominal and heart ailments. Heavenly dragons, you say that the treasury of Haikong’s wisdom is a great dharma master expounding the teaching for the multitude, yet Haikong is not truly Haikong. Heavenly dragons, you say that the treasury of wisdom is the treasury of wisdom, yet the treasury of wisdom is not truly the treasury of wisdom. Heavenly dragons, you say that the treasury of Haikong’s wisdom is a true immortal, yet Haikong is not truly an immortal. Heavenly dragons, you say that the treasury of Haikong’s wisdom is human or beast, bird or insect, grass or tree, water or fire, stone or earth, yet Haikong is not truly human or beast, not truly bird or insect, not truly grass or tree, not truly water or fire, not truly earth or stone. Such expressions are all the secret treasury of Haikong.

Good man, you say that Haikong is like the waters of the sea, yet Haikong is not truly saline. You say that Haikong is like father, mother, brothers, wife, or children, yet Haikong is not truly father, mother, brothers, wife, or children. You say that Haikong is a great shipmaster, able to ferry across the great sea, yet Haikong is not truly a great ship, nor does he ferry across the great sea. You say that Haikong suffers from abdominal and heart ailments, yet Haikong is not truly afflicted by illness. You say that Haikong dwells in a seven-jeweled city, yet Haikong does not truly dwell. You say that Haikong requests a prescription, yet Haikong does not truly make requests. Through such emptiness is the treasury of Haikong’s wisdom, the city of Haikong.

When the Heavenly Venerable had spoken thus, the assembly—men and women alike—awakened the mind of equanimity. Skillfully cultivating the karma of body, speech, and mind, at the time of death, they entrusted their parents, brothers, and spouses: when my body is taken, let my bones be cast into water, or into a pyre, or upon the mountains and wilds, where jackals, wolves, tigers, and leopards, owls, and mandarin ducks will vie to devour them. Yet their souls, minds, and consciousnesses, bright and clear, will be reborn in the good destinies, in the human realm as kings, transforming and liberating all, governing the world with benevolence, and making offerings with a good heart to the single-vehicle treasury of Haikong’s wisdom.

At that time, in the kingdom there was an elder named Fasheng, who, in the assembly, was afflicted by the four great pains, lying propped upon his bed, day and night without seeking food or drink, his life seeming near its end. His family and wife surrounded him, weeping. The elder entrusted them: Tend diligently to the household affairs, and practice compassionate giving. Now my illness has reached its source, and my life is nearing its end. Birth, aging, and death—how can death be avoided? Hearing these words, his wife and children wailed even more, stirring the assembly. Then, young and old among the multitude snapped their fingers, exclaiming: By the power of the secret treasury of Haikong, how can sentient beings grieve so bitterly?

Suddenly, the elder was cured, as if never afflicted. Thereupon, the elder thought to himself: The majestic and awe-inspiring spiritual power of the single-vehicle Haikong, the wondrous and peerless honor of the three realms, is inconceivable. Now I contemplate the single-vehicle Haikong—it is my bodily life, my vital resource, my alms-food, my dharma-drink. What shall I do? Then he selected from his family and descendants—men and women, thirteen in all, wise and sagacious—and sent them forth to leave the household life, to cultivate the *Treasury of the Single-Vehicle Haikong’s Wisdom*, burning incense, making prostrations, transcribing, reciting, pondering its meaning and flavor, and expounding it for the multitude.

He further donated golden chariots, silver chariots, jade chariots, coral, amber, and pearl chariots, as well as granaries of rice, salt, and the five grains, silks of damask, brocade, and figured weaves, all freely given. Oxen, horses, donkeys, and mules were set loose to roam. He constructed spirit terraces and seven-jeweled luminous halls, chambers and galleries, front halls and rear halls, front palaces and rear palaces, nine-tiered seven-jeweled wondrous spirit terraces, nine-tiered seven-jeweled wondrous pavilions, layered in all four directions. Zithers, harps, and konghous harmonized, their sounds deep and resonant.

Then, people of the kingdom—old and young—passing by the tranquil site, each sighed: Excellent, excellent! Such merit is majestic and inconceivable. Thereupon, each awakened their own resolve, constructing halls and dwellings, large or small, making offerings according to their means—palaces, jeweled terraces, pavilions, and galleries.

Then, within these halls, luminous masters gathered the assembly to expound the single-vehicle treasury of the Ocean of Emptiness, the secret storehouse. At that time, among the kingdom’s people—whether men or women—those of virtuous heart who recited even a single word or phrase, a single line or verse of *The Treasury of Ocean-Emptiness Wisdom of the Single Vehicle*, or who uttered its name, *Treasury of Ocean-Emptiness Wisdom*, all such persons would attain rebirth among humans and gods, enjoying carefree bliss, never falling into hell, the animal realm, or the realm of hungry ghosts. They would be freed from all afflictions and distress, entering the treasury of the single vehicle. This is called the rarity of invoking its name.

Virtuous man, if any being hears the name of this sutra and, having heard it, reveres and believes, all their afflictions and grave illnesses will be utterly eradicated. The sin of disbelief and slander is like a wondrous medicine: though it can cure all manner of grave illness, it cannot revive the dead.

Then, Ocean-Emptiness addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: How are sins extinguished and the slander of disbelief severed? How is virtue attained so that deeds and their retribution follow one another? How does one cultivate the precious treasury of the single vehicle with equanimity and single-mindedness?

The Heavenly Worthy replied: Virtuous man, what does it mean for deeds and their retribution to follow one another? Virtuous man, if any being openly confesses and repents, revealing all the evils committed from the beginning of samsara until they are without sin—by this cause and condition, this is called receiving retribution. Virtuous man, it is like a great king traveling the royal road: all within the empty city flee. So too does the revelation of all evils unfold.

Virtuous man, how are the slanderers not extinguished? If any being disbelieves in *The Treasury of Ocean-Emptiness Wisdom of the Single Vehicle*, harboring arrogance and pride, though they commit manifold evils, they never turn back from such deeds. For this reason, they do not enter the single vehicle, nor is their slander extinguished. Virtuous man, even if countless beings simultaneously enter the *Treasury of Ocean-Emptiness Wisdom* with single-minded devotion, not one among them who slanders or disbelieves will enter the single-vehicle treasury of Ocean-Emptiness Wisdom. Thus, those who do not believe cannot have their slander extinguished.

Furthermore, virtuous man, how does one cultivate the precious treasury of the single vehicle with equanimity and single-mindedness? If any being, whether walking or sitting, contemplates the Great Vehicle, seeing neither the mark of self, nor the mark of others, neither the mark of greatness nor smallness, neither long nor short, white nor black—such marks being devoid of any conceptualization—then the single vehicle is equanimous, like empty space, without great or small, without sage or ordinary. Why is this? If one claims, "This is my body," it is the seed of the Dao, the nature of the Dao. Because the nature of the Dao is present, the body possesses the seventy-two marks and eighty-one excellences. Therefore, what I say does not differ from the golden words and jade decrees of the Heavenly Worthy, the sage. Virtuous man, to speak thus is to be Ocean-Emptiness, to be the Treasury of Wisdom. After immeasurable kalpas, one is freed from all afflictions and beholds the equanimous mark of Ocean-Emptiness. Why is this? What I now proclaim is truly without the mark of self, without self or mine. By this cause and condition, the teaching accords with the text, ultimately equanimous.

Virtuous man, it is like a performer who, through various skills, follows the king’s command to travel to another land, even at the cost of their life, never daring to disobey. The wise say that all beings possess the nature of the Dao, and thus, in accord with conditions, they expound without惜ing their lives—just as the performer does not disobey the king’s command.

Furthermore, virtuous man, if any being disbelieves in the precious treasury of the single-vehicle Ocean-Emptiness, calling it unwholesome, not its teaching, not the true word—virtuous man, any being who speaks thus is an evil companion, a great offender of the five heinous crimes. Such a person must not be approached or dwelled with. Why is this?

This person in the present life immediately contracts diseases of worm-infested scabs and festering sores, with foul-smelling worms oozing forth and pus and blood flowing out, whether great or small—all keep far away. Virtuous man, if any being hears the sutra of the single vehicle and rejoices in their heart, snapping their fingers in praise, such a person comes from the heavens above, their form and marks outstanding, moving as a Dharma master, revered and looked up to by all. Such a person immediately leaves afflictions behind, is born from the body of birth-and-death, and attains the vajra body, ascending in broad daylight to the seven-jeweled mystic terrace. Virtuous man, if any woman beholds the Ocean-Emptiness Treasury of Wisdom of the single vehicle and immediately pays reverence, burning incense and making vows, in but a moment she sees her body transformed, becoming a man. Virtuous man, the majestic spirit of this sutra can cause all—whether formed or formless, with life or without—to arouse the mind if they have not yet done so; bring peace and bliss to those who lack it; and raise to heaven those who have not yet ascended.

Those who have not yet escaped suffering are all enabled to escape suffering; those who have not yet attained the Dao are all enabled to attain the Dao.

At that time, Ocean-Emptiness addressed the Heavenly Venerable, saying: "How can it be said that those who have not yet aroused the mind are all caused to arouse the mind?"

The Heavenly Venerable replied: "Virtuous man, it is like a person dreaming. If in a dream one falls into hell and suffers manifold afflictions, one immediately generates a mind of remorse, lamenting: 'Alas, my own body has brought this retribution upon itself! Now that I have escaped, I must certainly arouse the mind of great compassion. What I have witnessed is most bitter and urgent.' Upon awakening, one knows the supreme right Dharma. One thinks: 'There is a majestic spirit that can gradually bring accomplishment to us all.' This is called arousing the mind.

"Virtuous man, if there are virtuous and devout Daoists—whether men or women—or if there are heavenly demons and heterodox practitioners who can well arouse the mind, receive and uphold the *Ocean-Emptiness Treasury of the Single Vehicle*, recite and copy it, contemplate its meaning and flavor, and expound it to others, then all beings will attain liberation and depart from the city of afflictions.

"Virtuous man, those heavenly demons constantly receive from the great king various offerings—elephants, horses, chariots, kingdoms, wives, and children. They say to the king: 'I went to the mountain and saw an old man expounding the supreme great Dao to the multitude. In truth, my Dharma contains no such teachings. Now the king has heard the old man’s illusions. Perhaps he will gather people and sages from the eight directions. I and the king together transform beings. If you do not send him away, the kingdom will be destroyed.'

"At that time, the great king, having heard these words, dreamed that night of an old man in the mountains—his own father—who wished to expound the *Treasury of the Single Vehicle* to the king. Upon awakening, the king pondered: 'What is the meaning of the Single Vehicle?' He then addressed his master, saying: 'The king has dreamed of an old man in the mountains who wishes to expound the secret treasury of the Single Vehicle.'

"At that time, the heavenly demon, with a humble countenance, replied to the king: 'The kingdom is about to be destroyed.' The king’s mind became scattered. Thereupon, the heavenly demon displayed supernatural powers, causing wind, rain, and great floods for seven days and seven nights, with the rain unceasing. The king, greatly terrified, addressed his master, saying: 'The king has had an inauspicious dream, yet his mind remains unshaken. I only beseech the sagely master to dispel this calamity.' The entire kingdom then pledged to follow the master, daring not to disobey.

"At that time, the old man’s body radiated light, illuminating all the kingdoms. He then pointed his hand toward the heavenly demon. Thereupon, the demon’s supernatural powers vanished, and the wind dispersed, the rain ceased. The king rejoiced greatly, prostrated himself, and addressed the great man, saying: 'The king’s wisdom is shallow and has not beheld the countenance of heaven. Though he has served the heavenly demon, he has always longed for the Compassionate Venerable. Last night in a dream, someone expounded the *Treasury of the Single Vehicle* to the king. I do not yet understand: what is the meaning of the Single Vehicle? The king’s master, the heavenly demon, always says that the world is impermanent, that there is arising and ceasing. For this reason, kingdoms, cities, wives, children, elephants, horses, and chariots are all to be relinquished, in the hope of attaining constant bliss and escaping the suffering of impermanence.'

"At that time, the old man manifested a wondrous appearance, revealing his true form as a divine youth, adorned with the seventy-two marks and eighty-one excellences. His radiance was outstanding. He addressed the great king, saying: 'I am foolish and dull, my understanding shallow. I have always heard that the *Ocean-Emptiness Treasury of the Single Vehicle* is without self or other, equal to empty space; that the Three Clarities and all sages are impermanent in every thought-moment. How then can worldly conduct be equated with arising and ceasing? The three realms are impermanent—why is this so? Whether there is constancy or impermanence, arising or non-arising, all such categories are simultaneously obliterated. How can there be constancy that receives the offering of impermanence? If one offers the impermanent in pursuit of constant bliss, then the constant and the impermanent are unequal. How can one speak of worldly conduct as impermanent?'

"Virtuous man, it is like boarding a boat where the captain, fearing the vessel will sink, concentrates his mind, praying: 'May we not encounter wind and waves.' Then two people address the captain, saying: 'Please ferry us to the other shore.' The captain reflects: 'The weather is calm; my boat can cross.' He then loads the two passengers and sets out for the opposite shore. Once on the water, the boat immediately capsizes.

"Virtuous man, the heavenly demon ferries the king in just this way. Though he receives the king’s offerings—kingdoms, cities, wives, children, elephants, horses, and chariots—he ultimately casts the king into the hell of the impermanent path.

"At that time, the heavenly demon, having heard these words, felt shame and remorse. Fixing his attention before the Dao, he listened to the flavor of the *Ocean-Emptiness Treasury of the Single Vehicle* and immediately exclaimed: 'Excellent! Excellent! This is my true father, my true life. How could I again offer kingdoms, cities, and the seven treasures, or perform various acts of generosity and great feasts, only to wholeheartedly receive and uphold the *Ocean-Emptiness Treasury*?'

"At that time, the four assemblies, having heard these words, rejoiced greatly. They prostrated themselves before the Dao, returned to their seats, and listened single-mindedly.

"Then the *Ocean-Emptiness Treasury of Wisdom* rose from his seat. With measured and graceful steps, fearless and composed like a lion, he entered the seven-jeweled grove, prostrated himself, and addressed the Heavenly Venerable, saying: 'Such a scripture, this wondrous treasury, possesses manifold virtues and manifold wisdoms. It is profoundly subtle and inconceivable. O Greatly Compassionate Heavenly Venerable, all beings today are burdened with heavy obstructions of affliction. They commit the three evil deeds, harbor disbelief, and slander this scripture. Yet all such beings possess the nature of the Dao. How then can it be said that they will fall into hell? If these beings possess the nature of the Dao, how can it be said that they suffer the afflictions of impermanence? When beings sever their roots of goodness, this is called the three evils. If the roots of goodness are severed, how can the nature of the Dao in all beings not also be severed? If the nature of the Dao is severed, how can it again be said to be constant, blissful, and sovereign? What is to be done with such cases?'"

"If it were determined, how could one attain the paths of humans, heavens, or even the lower immortals—true persons, Daoist adepts, or the Greatly Compassionate Heavenly Venerable? If the paths from human to heavenly realms down to the lower immortals were determined, then one should also not attain the unshakable treasury of the One Vehicle’s sea of emptiness, the secret and wondrous repository. If beings commit various evils, they are not determined to attain the paths of humans, heavens, or even the lower immortals to study the true Way as Daoist adepts. Being thus undetermined, the Greatly Compassionate Heavenly Venerable is also undetermined. If the Dao is undetermined, the *Sutra of the Sea of Emptiness’s Treasury of Wisdom* is also undetermined, and all dharmas are likewise undetermined. How is this undetermined, and how are the offenses of indeterminacy removed?

If one claims that indeterminacy removes the offenses of indeterminacy, then those who have already become true immortals and Daoist adepts should also be undetermined, and those who have entered the treasury of the One Vehicle’s sea of emptiness should also exit it, falling into the offenses of birth and death. If this were so, the nature of the Treasury of Wisdom would be undetermined. Because it is not determined, it should be known that there is no secret treasury of the One Vehicle’s sea of emptiness. How then can it be said that one enters the treasury of the One Vehicle’s sea of emptiness?"

At that time, the Heavenly Venerable, out of great compassion, replied to Sea of Emptiness, saying: "Excellent, excellent, good man, Sea of Emptiness, Treasury of Wisdom. You now serve as a bridge to benefit all beings, bringing them peace and joy. Out of pity and compassion for all in the world, you seek to cultivate the mind of the Great Vehicle and ask such questions on behalf of all true immortals. Good man, you have drawn near to the heavenly and human beings of the past, planting roots of goodness in all dharmas. Long have you perfected the virtue of equanimity, subdued the hordes of demons, and caused them to retreat. You have already taught immeasurable, boundless beings, all awakening to the truth. The true immortal youths have aroused the mind of equanimity. You have penetrated all dharmas, the profound, subtle, and secret treasury. In the past, you have enabled immeasurable, boundless heavenly and human beings to hear the profound and subtle meaning of the One Vehicle. You wish to enable beings who have not yet seen to see, to benefit all beings—whether human or non-human, good men or good women, great or small.

Good man, those who inquire into the flavor of this sutra’s meaning should now listen earnestly and attentively. I shall distinguish and expound it for you. Good man, even one who slanders is not determined. If it were determined, then one who slanders would never attain the paths of humans, heavens, or immortals. Precisely because it is not determined, one can attain them. As you have rightly observed, the nature of the Dao is not severed. How then can it be said that one who slanders severs the roots of goodness?

Good man, there are two kinds of roots: internal roots and external roots. Within the nature of the Dao, there is neither internal nor external. For this reason, the arising of the nature of the Dao is neither severed nor unsevered. There are also two kinds: the conditioned and the unconditioned. Within the nature of the Dao, there is neither conditioned nor unconditioned, and thus the nature of the Dao is not constant. There are also two kinds: the truly constant and the impermanent. Within the nature of the Dao, there is neither constancy nor impermanence. For this reason, the arising of the nature of the Dao is neither severed nor constant. If it were severed, it should be regained. If it is not regained, it is called unsevered. If it is severed and then regained, that is called slander, committing various evil offenses—this too is undetermined. If it were determined, one who commits various evil offenses would never attain the paths of humans, heavens, or immortals. One who slanders the *Sutra of the Treasury of Wisdom* is also undetermined. If it were determined, one who slanders the true Dharma would never attain the paths of humans, heavens, or immortals. Committing the three evils is also undetermined. If it were determined, one who commits the three evils would never attain the paths of humans, heavens, or immortals.

Form and the characteristics of form—both are undetermined. The characteristics of the eye, ear, and touch, up to the characteristics of ignorance—all dharmas are likewise undetermined. Good man, it is like a dancer who, in the midst of a great assembly, conjures cities and palaces, elephants, horses, and chariots, adorning the body with various ornaments, villages and towns, mountains, forests, and trees, springs, ponds, and rivers. Among that assembly, there are beings without wisdom who, upon seeing these, take them to be real. But those with wisdom know them to be illusory, deceiving the eyes through the power of illusion.

Good man, all ordinary beings, even the earth immortals of the lower realms who study the lesser vehicle, perceive all dharmas as having fixed characteristics—this is likewise so. The true immortal youths do not perceive any fixed characteristics in all dharmas. Good man, it is like a child who, in the sunlight, sees the shimmering heat and calls it water. A person of wisdom, seeing this sunlight, would never falsely perceive it as real water. It is merely an illusory mirage, deceiving the eyes—it is not truly water. All ordinary beings, even those of the lower realms who study the lesser vehicle, perceive all dharmas in this way. The true immortal youths do not perceive any fixed characteristics in all dharmas.

Good man, it is like an echo in an empty valley. Foolish people hear it and take it to be a real sound. Those with wisdom understand that it is not fixed or real—it is merely a sound deceiving the ear. Good man, all ordinary beings perceive characteristics in all dharmas in this way. The true immortal youths thoroughly understand all dharmas as having no fixed characteristics, perceiving the characteristics of impermanence, emptiness, quiescence, and non-arising and non-ceasing. For this reason, the true immortal youths perceive all dharmas as impermanent. Good man, there are also fixed characteristics. What is fixed? Quiescence, extinction, purity, constancy, bliss, and sovereignty—entering the Treasury of Wisdom of the sea of emptiness. Good man, the five penetrations of earth immortals are also undetermined."

Due to their lack of determinacy, they repeatedly pass through countless kalpas of *Yankang*, attaining the paths of humans and gods—yet even these remain undetermined. Due to their lack of determinacy, after another kalpa, they attain the Dao of Sea-Emptiness.

Good man, Sea-Emptiness now abides in the Jeweled City of the Eight *Qian* Grove, manifesting the wondrous seventy-two marks. He seeks to enter the secret treasury of the One Vehicle’s Sea-Emptiness Wisdom, enabling all future beings who have not yet attained the supreme One Vehicle’s true path to do so, and also causing the four assemblies—all disciples and good people—to generate great joy. He wishes for gods and humans to prepare pure offerings, establish grand feasts, and make offerings to all, so that both humans and non-humans universally receive benefit.

Good man, at that time, all in the assembly spoke among themselves, saying: "Sea-Emptiness dwells in the Treasury of the One Vehicle." Know that Sea-Emptiness, the supreme master, abides in the treasury. Why? Because Sea-Emptiness is constant bliss, unchanging, and thus dwells in the treasury. We, the four assemblies, all reflect: if the Treasury of Sea-Emptiness is undetermined, then know that Sea-Emptiness is also undetermined. For this reason, the Treasury of Sea-Emptiness is likewise undetermined.

Good man, know that Sea-Emptiness is also undetermined. Sea-Emptiness is neither emptiness nor non-emptiness; neither sea nor non-sea; neither emptiness nor non-emptiness, neither sea nor non-sea; neither god nor non-god, neither venerable nor non-venerable; neither human nor non-human, neither ghost nor non-ghost; neither hell nor animal, neither non-hell nor non-animal; neither sentient being nor non-sentient being; neither dharma nor non-dharma, neither form nor non-form, neither mind nor non-mind; neither existence nor non-existence, neither non-existence nor non-non-existence; neither impermanent nor non-impermanent, neither illusion nor non-illusion; neither name nor non-name, neither discourse nor non-discourse.

For these causes and conditions, good man, to understand that all dharmas are empty of all dharmas—by this principle, it is called Sea-Emptiness, called Treasury of Wisdom.

Good man, why is Sea-Emptiness not Sea-Emptiness? Those who speak of emptiness and speak of Sea-Emptiness are like the kings of the ten directions’ immeasurable lands, great kings and lesser kings, who in measureless kalpas have relinquished their thrones, wandering in mountains and forests, contemplating the Treasury of Sea-Emptiness of the One Vehicle. Thus they are neither kings nor non-kings. When Sea-Emptiness arises, it arises in non-arising, yet is not non-non-arising. Why? Ascending the summit of Jade Capital, it transforms and is born below—thus Sea-Emptiness is neither non-arising in heaven nor non-Pure Heaven. Why? It cannot be defiled by any worldly dharmas, like a lotus rising from muddy water yet unstained by mud or water. Thus Sea-Emptiness, though born among dharmas, is neither those dharmas nor the Treasury of Wisdom—this is called Sea-Emptiness, this is called Treasury of Wisdom.

Good man, for this reason, Sea-Emptiness is neither true person nor youth. This Sea-Emptiness is also neither non-emptiness nor non-treasury. Why? Sea-Emptiness has long been free from human existence in measureless kalpas—thus Sea-Emptiness is neither non-human nor non-ghost. Why? It also transforms beings through ghostly forms—thus Sea-Emptiness is neither non-ghost nor hell nor animal. Why? Sea-Emptiness has long departed from all evils—thus it is neither non-hell nor sentient being. Why? It has long abandoned the nature of sentient beings. Yet it expounds the subtle marks of sentient beings—thus Sea-Emptiness is neither non-sentient being nor dharma. Why? Each dharma has its distinct marks, but only Sea-Emptiness is complete with the One Mark. Thus Sea-Emptiness is neither non-dharma nor form. Why? Its bodily form already possesses the seventy-two marks and eighty-one excellences; the illusions of form are like mirages, like echoes. Thus Sea-Emptiness is neither non-form nor mind. Why? Its thoughts are extinguished, equal to empty space—thus Sea-Emptiness is neither non-mind nor existence. Why? Sea-Emptiness is autonomous, pure, and subtly wondrous. Thus it is neither non-existence nor non-non-existence. Why? Sea-Emptiness—whether in coming or going, sitting or lying—also manifests as vajra. Thus it is neither non-non-existence nor impermanent. Why? Because it has parts—thus Sea-Emptiness is not impermanent. How is it not impermanent? Because it has knowledge. The eternal dharma is without knowledge, like the mark of empty space. Sea-Emptiness has knowledge—thus it is not eternal. Nor is it non-illusion. Why? Its vajra body is unshaken and unmoving; it divides this one body into measureless bodies, and those measureless bodies are again this one body. Sometimes it makes a great body, sometimes a small body, a male body, a female body, the bodies of youths—thus Sea-Emptiness is neither non-illusion nor non-name. Why? Without name or form, quiescent and eternally blissful—thus Sea-Emptiness is neither non-name nor non-discourse. Why? It speaks of the unspeakable, like a mirage, like lightning. Thus Sea-Emptiness is not non-discourse.

Then the Heavenly Worthy, having spoken these words, remained silent and unmoving. Again he answered Sea-Emptiness, saying: Good man, all ordinary beings do not see afflictions. All ordinary beings in the future will have doubts—do not see afflictions.

Then the Treasury of Sea-Emptiness and Wisdom addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy, how is it that ordinary beings do not see afflictions? Within afflictions, do they have a body or not? In past lives, did the body originally exist or not? In the future and present, does this body exist or not? If there is a body, is it form or not form? Does the body belong to another or not? Is it neither belonging nor not belonging to another? Is there life without a body, or a body without life? Is there both body and life, or neither body nor life? Are body and life both eternal, both impermanent, eternal yet impermanent, or neither eternal nor impermanent?

Then the Heavenly Worthy, composed and smiling, answered Sea-Emptiness: Excellent, excellent, good man. All ordinary beings have a body or no body—an afflicted body. Why? The afflicted body is skin wrapped around pus and blood, obstructing the nature of the Dao. Thus beings do not see afflictions, yet possess the true nature of the Dao. The true nature of the Dao is not in the middle, nor is it existence or non-existence. Is it not past, not present, not future? Not form or mind, not self or other? Not having life, not lacking life? Not having a body, not lacking a body? Not eternal, not impermanent?

Then Sea-Emptiness bowed and made obeisance, addressing the Heavenly Worthy: As you have said, is it neither having a body nor lacking a body? How does the afflicted body that obstructs the nature of the Dao arise—from parents? From minute particles? From illusion? From spontaneity?

From emptiness? From transformation? From good? From evil? From beasts? From hell? From heaven? If the nature of the Dao arises from parents, how can parents be afflictions or not afflictions? If they are afflictions, how can they give rise to the true nature of the Dao? If they truly give rise to it, it should be eternal—how then can the true nature arise from afflictions? If it arises from afflictions, and afflictions are delusive obstructions that cast one into hell, then the arising of the nature of the Dao would also fall into hell. If it does not fall, how can the nature of the Dao arise from afflictions? If there are no afflictions, how can afflictions obstruct the nature of the Dao? For these reasons, I only pray that the Compassionate Venerable One will take pity and explain.”

At that moment, the assembly gazed intently, eager to hear. Then the Heavenly Worthy emitted a subtle and wondrous sound, answering Sea-Emptiness:

“Good man, the nature of the Dao is the nature of no-nature—neither the nature of existence nor the nature of non-existence. The arising of the nature of the Dao is both existent and non-existent. Good man, the nature of the Dao arises neither from a body nor from no-body, nor from neither existence nor non-existence; it arises both from a body and from no-body.

Good man, how do afflictions obstruct the nature of the Dao? The nature of the Dao arises from afflictions, yet not from afflictions; it is both affliction and not affliction. How then do afflictions obstruct the nature of the Dao? Good man, it is like dark clouds obscuring the sunlight. The light of the sun is neither born nor destroyed, neither comes nor goes, neither exists nor does not exist. The arising of the nature of the Dao is likewise.

Good man, the arising of the nature of the Dao is not born from parents, yet it is born from parents. Why? If it is born from parents, once born from parents, it is born from what is unborn—the arising of the unarisen. It is like flowers and fruit: flowers arise without fruit, and fruit arises without flowers. The arising of the Dao is likewise.

How then can the nature of the Dao arise from parents? Good man, how can the nature of the Dao arise from minute particles? The nature of the Dao arises from minute particles, yet not from minute particles; from illusion, yet not from illusion; from spontaneity, yet not from spontaneity; from emptiness, yet not from emptiness; from transformation, yet not from transformation; from good causes, yet not from good causes; from evil causes, yet not from evil causes; from beasts, yet not from beasts; from hell, yet not from hell; from heaven, yet not from heaven. For these reasons, the arising of the unarisen arises from arising, yet the arisen does not arise. If it is non-existent, the non-existent does not lack, neither lacks nor exists. Therefore, the arising of the nature of the Dao is the arising of arising, yet arising does not arise.

Good man, you earlier asked: If the nature of the Dao arises from parents, how can parents be afflictions? Good man, I shall now explain. The nature of the Dao arises from parents. Good man, it is like the lotus flower, which arises from the mud, yet the arising from mud is neither mud nor not mud. The arising of the nature of the Dao is likewise—both from parents and not from parents.

Good man, it is like a person in a house: the person dwells in the house, yet the house does not contain the person. The arising of the nature of the Dao is likewise. It is like life dwelling in wood, arising with the wood, yet not from the seed of wood. The arising of the nature of the Dao is likewise—arising from afflictions, yet not from the seed of afflictions. If it were afflictions, how could the nature of the Dao be like empty space, unattainable in form? From this, you should know that it is not the root of afflictions, nor of beings, nor of neither existence nor non-existence.

Good man, all beings, if born from the causes and conditions of parents, fail to recognize those causes and conditions. They recklessly commit all evils, generate discriminating thoughts, disbelieve the scriptures, do not cherish beings, and submit to the cycle of birth and death without end. For these reasons, they discriminate between good and evil, do not restrain the six senses, and give rise to all kinds of attachments. They slander the *One Vehicle Treasury of the Ocean of Emptiness*, hearing yet not hearing, listening yet not listening, and generate all manner of thoughts. Because of these causes and conditions, some contract leprosy, some become deaf or blind, some take the forms of beasts—oxen, horses, pigs, or dogs—some receive human form with incomplete faculties, possessing human shape yet lacking sentiment and wisdom.

Good man, when I previously expounded this sutra, the heavenly demon kings came together to the assembly, generating all manner of slander and disturbing the fourfold assembly. In an instant, those demon kings, each leading their retinues, returned to their own realms and lodged along the way. That night, they suddenly encountered a poisonous rain that fell for three days and three nights. Some contracted yellow toxins, some leprosy. Then, the demon hosts were afflicted with poisonous diseases; some developed leprosy, their suffering deep and grave, and they grew greatly distressed. Each thought to themselves: *Why have I fallen into such great suffering, with sores and pain on my head and face? Surely I must die.* From body to body, from birth to birth, they generated great generosity and great merit, vowing to relinquish their bodies to attain a true human form, to abandon perverse wisdom and attain right wisdom.

As those demon kings approached the end of their lives, they fell into the mud and mire, tormented by sorrow: *Alas! What transgression have I committed? What precept have I violated to suffer thus?* Then, out of my great compassion, I emitted a radiant light that illuminated the ten directions and boundless worlds, all beings, the three paths of hell, and all the ghosts therein. None were not illuminated, and all beheld the *One Vehicle Treasury of the Ocean of Emptiness* upon its jeweled terrace.”

They beheld the Ocean of Emptiness and heard the profound, true flavor of the One Vehicle’s meaning. Awakening to the evil causes of their past lives, they recalled the manifold thoughts by which they had slandered the scriptures and conceived disbelief. Thereupon they made confession, saying:

*“I now take refuge in the One Vehicle Ocean of Emptiness, the Most High Heavenly Worthy, the Heavenly Dharma Master, the Ocean of Emptiness Perfected One.”*
*“I now take refuge in the Most High Heavenly Worthy, the Heavenly Dharma Master, the Ocean of Emptiness Perfected One.”*
*“I now take refuge in the Most High Heavenly Worthy, the Heavenly Dharma Master, the Ocean of Emptiness Perfected One.”*

Having chanted this confession thrice, from the eastern direction a great jeweled city arose, floating in the void. At the sight of the jeweled city, the demon kings’ illnesses were instantly cured. They returned to their seats, listened to the Dharma, and settled their minds in unshakable stillness. Then they beheld the One Vehicle Treasury of the Ocean of Emptiness.

Having seen the Treasury, they faithfully received every line, every word, every verse of the One Vehicle Ocean of Emptiness scriptures. Day and night they contemplated them, their minds single and reverent. Thereupon the demon kings transformed their bodies into bodies of wisdom.

At that time, the hells were emptied, and none remained to suffer punishment. The great worthies of the land gathered and deliberated: *“Has our land attained the power of the Three Treasures, thereby establishing great blessings at this time?”* Before and behind the jeweled terrace’s halls, in all four directions, chambers and galleries rose in layered pavilions. Zithers, harps, and konghous blended their sounds in harmony—so exquisitely mournful and wondrous that none could hear them without being moved.

Then, whether man or woman in that land, all who heard the music gave rise to wholesome minds and extolled the One Vehicle Treasury of the Ocean of Emptiness. Within the terrace, a great Illuminator daily expounded the One Vehicle Ocean of Emptiness scriptures, universally delivering beings—whether human or nonhuman—perfecting their wisdom of all species and benefiting all.

When the Heavenly Worthy had finished speaking the scriptures in full, he sat in silent stillness. The assembly of worthies, the king, the elders, and all—great and small—each received benefit. Together they rose, bowed in reverence, and took their leave.

*The Fifth Scroll of the Most High One Vehicle Ocean of Emptiness Treasury of Wisdom concludes.*

*The Sixth Scroll of the Most High One Vehicle Ocean of Emptiness Treasury of Wisdom: The Chapter on Upholding the Precepts.*

At that time, the Ocean of Emptiness Treasury of Wisdom, together with the assembled gods and humans, perfected immortals and divine youths, earthbound immortals and Daoist adepts, rose to bow in reverence. Kneeling with hands clasped in devotion, they addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "Greatly Compassionate Heavenly Worthy, we have now journeyed to the lower realms and witnessed the manifold beings—whether human or nonhuman—dwelling within the city of afflictions below. There, heavenly demons, wayward spirits, and malevolent ghosts torment and harm one another, leaving none at peace. Each is consumed by sorrow and distress, gripped by great fear, with nowhere to turn for refuge. How may the One Vehicle Ocean of Emptiness’ pure precepts broadly benefit gods and humans, the boundless multitude of beings, granting them peace and joy, enabling them to uphold and rely upon the wondrous, pure precepts? We beseech the Heavenly Worthy to take pity on us and expound in detail the pure and wondrous precepts, that all beings may abide in lasting peace."

Then the Heavenly Worthy replied to the Ocean of Emptiness, saying: "Excellent, excellent, good man, perfected ones and divine youths! You should all listen single-mindedly and uphold the One Vehicle’s unimpeded pure precepts, that future beings may receive benefit. Good men and good women, concentrate your thoughts on the five kinds of pure precepts. What are these five? Good man, the first is the Dao-precept, the second is the sagely precept, the third is the true precept, the fourth is the immortal precept, and the fifth is the precept of beings. Good man, perfected ones and divine youths should always cultivate these five practices."

Then the Ocean of Emptiness addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "As to the five precepts just described, how does the Dao-precept come to prevail?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied to the Ocean of Emptiness, saying: "Excellent, excellent, good man! The so-called Dao-precept is the secret treasury of the One Vehicle scriptures, giving rise to manifold forms. It is practiced as the one hundred and eighty precepts, the three hundred great precepts, the precept beyond precepts, neither existing as a precept nor lacking one; neither non-existent nor non-absent; neither eternal nor severed; neither severed nor eternal, nor neither severed nor eternal. Good man, just as the empty sky allows all wholesome dharmas to flourish, so too is the Dao-precept. All beings who hear and behold the secret treasury of the One Vehicle Ocean of Emptiness generate faith. They should contemplate the wondrous precepts of the true Dao, which are constant, blissful, self-existent, and pure, replete with merit, the supreme and correct Dharma."

Then the Ocean of Emptiness addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "How does the sagely precept serve as a bridge?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Excellent, Ocean of Emptiness, good man! The so-called sagely precept is such that from the four classes of people in the world—immortals, Daoist adepts, kings, and elders—those who attain the correct Dharma and the subtle scriptures of the One Vehicle Treasury of Wisdom should all cherish and delight in it, avidly seeking the secret treasury of the Great Vehicle. They renounce what they love: their six kinds of kin, their dwellings, gold and silver treasures, exquisite ornaments, incense, flowers, lamps, candles, music, attendants, male and female servants, young and old, elephants, horses, carriages, oxen, sheep, chickens, dogs, pigs, and the like. They further reflect: 'Living at home is oppressive, like a prison. All afflictions arise from it, and all hunger arises from it. How, then, do we continue to bear this body of birth and death, this body of afflictions, this body of filth and worms, this body like a starving tiger, enduring manifold evils? How should we leave the household life to cultivate the supreme, correct, and wondrous Dao?'

When they resolve to leave the household life, deviant demons and heterodox ways generate great sorrow and suffering. These demonic paths then wage great war against them. They constantly think: 'How can we engage in conflict with others?' At that time, they arrive at the bodhimanda, where they behold the Heavenly Worthy and his disciples, their deportment complete, their faculties tranquil, their minds gentle, pure, and quiescent. We beings then approach them, seeking to leave the household life, entering the bodhimanda and donning the great Dharma robes. Having left the household life, they uphold the prohibitive precepts, their deportment flawless, their movements composed, without transgression. Even for minor offenses, they feel fear. Their resolve to protect the precepts is like vajra. They further hear the secret treasury of the One Vehicle Ocean of Emptiness.

Good man, it is like a person carrying a lacquered tray, wishing to cross the great sea. Then, a demonic thief in the sea begs the tray from this person. Having heard the request, the person reflects: 'If I give it, I will surely drown and die.' Thus, they reply: 'Demon, you may kill me, but you shall not have the tray.' The demonic thief says: 'If you cannot give it to me entirely, then grant me half as a kindness.' The person still refuses. The demonic thief says: 'If you cannot grant me half, then please give me a third.' The person replies: 'I would rather die together with you than give you the tray.' The demonic thief says: 'I beseech your great compassion to bestow upon me even a fragment of your treasure.' The person reflects: 'This treasure of mine shall never be yours.' The demonic thief says: 'If you still cannot give me the treasure, I am now impoverished and afflicted by manifold sufferings. I beg you to relieve me, even by a mote of dust.' The person replies: 'Today, I am about to cross the sea, yet I know not whether it lies east or west, near or far. How can I give you anything? If I do, how shall I traverse the peril of the great sea? I fear I may drown midway, and regret will be too late.'

Good man, perfected ones and divine youths who protect and uphold the prohibitive precepts are like that person guarding the lacquered tray, refusing to yield it to the demonic thief. Good man, perfected ones and divine youths who thus guard the wondrous and pure precepts do so in the same manner."

The demonic thief again says: "You should trust me, for I shall never deceive you. Simply relinquish the lacquered tray and guard the other trays. For this reason, you shall safely reach the far shore." At that moment, the person reflects: "I would rather drown in the great sea than destroy the tray." The demonic thief again says: "If you cannot destroy the lacquered tray, then you may destroy the true treasure in your hand. For this reason, you shall safely reach the far shore." The person again refuses to destroy it. The demonic thief further says: "If you cannot relinquish the treasure in your hand, then you may relinquish the luminous pearl upon your body. For this reason, you shall safely reach the far shore." At that time, the person again refuses to relinquish it. Then, the demonic thief ponders for a long while, turns away, and retreats.

Thereupon, the person sails across on the lacquered tray and reaches the far shore. Reflecting, he thinks: "Now, as I journeyed, the demonic thief came to assail me. I grasped the lacquered tray firmly and did not relinquish it, thus reaching this shore. It was because my mind was steadfast and unyielding. Just so, the lacquered tray, the treasure in my hand, the luminous pearl, and the golden anklets beneath my feet—I guarded them firmly, built a treasury, and placed them securely upon the jeweled tray."

Good man, the treasury of the empty sea—if there are beings who guard and uphold the wondrous and pure precepts of the empty sea, holding them firmly, they are like that person guarding the jeweled tray. Guarding the jeweled tray is just so.

At that time, Empty Sea addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "The true Dao and sacred precepts thus expounded possess wondrous merit, inconceivable in their efficacy. From such merit arise manifold thoughts and manifold practices. How do perfected immortals receive and uphold the precepts?"

Then, the Heavenly Worthy replied to Empty Sea, saying: "Excellent is this question. Good man, if there are beings who renounce worldly glory and profit, do not engage in trade, use false weights and measures, or deceive others; who do not seize others' wealth, fields, houses, or granaries by force; who do not keep elephants, horses, carriages, cattle, sheep, mules, donkeys, chickens, dogs, macaques, peacocks, parrots, young boys or girls, adult men or women, slaves, servants, gold, silver, lapis lazuli, giant clams, or other treasures—but instead disperse them all to seek and receive the pure precepts of perfected ones—good man, if there are beings who, regarding all grains—rice, wheat, beans, millet, sorghum, hemp, and prepared or raw foods—always take but one meal a day, never eating twice; who, when observing a fast, never eat twice; who, when fasting, eat only at midday, always knowing contentment, never accepting other invitations, nor partaking of mixed foods; who do not consume the five pungent roots or strong-smelling foods, so that their bodies and minds remain free from defilement—such beings are ever revered, honored, and praised by all gods and people, never forsaken. Whether man or woman, they draw near to hear the One Vehicle, the wondrous treasury of the empty sea."

"Good man, if there are beings who do not hoard treasures—whether gold, silver, seven-jeweled golden beds, or woven mats of various colors—and do not sit or lie upon them, maintaining a tranquil mind and refraining from gazing; who do not look upon elephants, horses, carriages, fine silks, or the colors of phoenixes, peacocks, or parrots; who do not listen to flutes, lutes, zithers, harps, or other musical performances; who do not practice physiognomy of hands, feet, or faces; who do not divine by casting lots; who do not serve as princes; who harbor no deceit or flattery, no jealousy or malice, but maintain equanimity, love, and peaceful conduct—good man, such perfected immortals, who firmly uphold the wondrous and pure precepts in their hearts, ward off all demonic influences, attain the true nature of the Dao, and perceive all things with perfect clarity, without distinction."

"Good man, if there are beings who receive and uphold the pure precepts and all such prohibitions, they should make this vow: 'I would rather cast this body into a blazing fire, a deep pit, or a long trench than violate these wondrous and pure precepts of the perfected ones.' Good man, perfected youths further make this vow: 'I would rather have molten iron wrapped around my body than dare, with a body that has broken the precepts, to constantly receive the clothing of faithful benefactors.' Good man, perfected youths further make this vow: 'I would rather lie upon an iron bed than dare, with a body that has broken the precepts, to constantly receive the seats of faithful benefactors.' Good man, perfected youths further make this vow: 'I would rather endure a thousand poisoned needles piercing my body than dare, with a body that has broken the precepts, to constantly receive the sweet dew of medicine from faithful benefactors.' Good man, perfected youths further make this vow: 'I would rather cast this body into a cauldron of boiling water than dare, with a body that has broken the precepts, to constantly receive the houses and dwellings of faithful benefactors.' Good man, perfected youths further make this vow: 'I would rather have this body ground to dust than dare, with a body that has broken the precepts, to constantly receive the reverence and homage of faithful benefactors.' Good man, perfected youths further make this vow: 'I would rather have hot iron hooks pierce my eyes than allow my mind to be defiled by coveting another’s beauty.' Good man, perfected youths further make this vow: 'I would rather have hot iron stuffed into my ears than allow my mind to be defiled by listening to another’s voice.' Good man, perfected youths further make this vow: 'I would rather have a sharp blade sever my nose than allow my mind to be defiled by craving fragrant scents.' Good man, perfected youths further make this vow: 'I would rather have a sharp blade tear out my tongue than allow my mind to be defiled by craving delicious flavors.' Good man, perfected youths further make this vow: 'I would rather have an axe chop my body than allow my mind to be defiled by craving tactile pleasures.' Why is this? For such reasons, beings fall into hells, animal realms, or the realm of hungry ghosts."

Good man, perfected youths safeguard and uphold these precepts, offering them in practice to all beings. For such reasons, they wish all beings to protect and maintain the prohibitive precepts, attaining pure precepts, subtle and complete, and accomplishing the precepts of the One Vehicle’s ocean of emptiness.

Good man, when perfected youths cultivate the pure precepts of the One Vehicle, they immediately attain rebirth in the Jade Pure Palace, unshaken and unmoved, neither retreating nor scattering. Good man, just as the Jade Capital remains unmoved regardless of the wind’s strength, so too do perfected youths who uphold pure precepts and dwell in the Jade Capital.

Good man, when perfected youths constantly single-mindedly cultivate the pure precepts of the One Vehicle, dwelling in the Jade Capital, they remain unshaken and unmoved, neither swayed by the inner demons of afflictions nor cast down by outer demons. Why is this? When perfected youths sit beneath the bodhi tree at the place of the Dao, even heavenly demons cannot shake them.

Good man, how can beings with pure precepts—whether the twenty precepts, the five precepts, or the three precepts—be called the treasury of oceanic emptiness and wisdom? Such precepts are the bridge of dharma that transcends birth and death, abandoning evil and preventing transgressions. Contemplating the emptiness of dharma-nature, it is both empty and not empty; because it is not empty yet empty, this body of mine exists.

Now I observe this body: head, feet, ears, eyes, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, spleen, kidneys, heart, lungs, liver, gallbladder, intestines, stomach, the five sense organs and their repositories, excrement and urine, nasal mucus, tears, fat, marrow, membranes, pus, and blood—all are impure. Contemplating thus, who possesses this "I"? To whom does this "I" belong? Where does it dwell? To whom does it belong? Is it an animal? A hungry ghost? A human or heavenly being? A plant? An insect or fish?

Further, I reflect: Are these bones me? Or is it what is apart from the bones? Again, I reflect: The bones have different colors—blue, yellow, white—but such appearances of bone are not me. Why? The form of this body of mine is neither blue, yellow, nor white. Now I contemplate: This form of mine is not my true form.

Again, I reflect: These bones arise from causes and conditions. The bones of the feet support the ankles; the bones of the ankles support the shanks; the bones of the shanks support the knees; the bones of the knees support the thighs; the bones of the thighs support the hips; the bones of the hips support the waist; the bones of the waist support the chest; the bones of the chest support the ribs; the bones of the ribs support the neck; the bones of the neck support the jaw; the bones of the jaw support the teeth; the bones of the teeth support the skull. Further, the bones of the neck support the shoulders; the bones of the shoulders support the arms; the bones of the arms support the wrists; the bones of the wrists support the palms; the bones of the palms support the fingers.

Good man, observing thus, I see the various causes and conditions, the various appearances of bones—these are my supports, my pillars. When I contemplate this body, all its bones are separate. Having attained this contemplation, I sever all desires.

Again, I reflect: The birth and death of this body are like flowing water, and it is not me. If consciousness is not me, then sometimes it is born, sometimes it dies—sometimes it is me, sometimes it is not. Again, I reflect: Am I a transformation? Or not a transformation? Am I composed of the four great elements? Or not composed of them? Among the four great elements, which is me, and which is not me?

Good man, it is like a *konghou* harp: as the wind passes, some strings produce sound, some do not. Good man, the four great elements compose me in the same way. Thus, this body of mine is a harmony of causes and conditions, like an illusion, arising with sound, taking on various forms and creations.

All you beings should single-mindedly receive and uphold the secret treasury precepts of the One Vehicle’s ocean of emptiness.

Then, Oceanic Treasury of Wisdom rose from his seat, bowed before the Dao, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "As you have spoken, if there are beings—good men and good women—who single-mindedly, with right mindfulness, reverently praise and uphold the pure precepts of the One Vehicle, constantly mindful and protective, then should outer demons come to disturb and confuse them, my disciples will sever their lives to cut off those outer demons. For such disciples, there is no possibility of falling into hell. Why? These disciples are my divine warriors, my mighty ones, who protect beings in upholding pure precepts. How could such a person fall into hell?"

Then, the Heavenly Worthy praised Oceanic Treasury of Wisdom, saying: "Excellent, excellent, good man, just as you have spoken."

In times past, I transformed and was born below as a great king named Dharma Radiance. Constantly, I received and recited the Mahāyāna sutras with a mind of reverent faith, free from coarse malice or envy. My speech was ever gentle and kind, and I distributed wealth to the poor, the orphaned, and the solitary. With courageous diligence, I never rested.

At that time, I heard that in the eastern quarter there existed the wondrous Mahāyāna sutra *Oceanic Treasury of Wisdom*. Overcome with sorrow, I wept uncontrollably, and throughout the kingdom, the queen, the crown prince, and all the ministers wept with me. Then, dragons, unicorns, lions, phoenixes, peacocks, parrots, and white cranes all gathered in flight.

Thereupon, a great minister, gazing upon the king’s countenance—now bright and composed—addressed the king, saying: "Why do we hear the sound of weeping?" The king replied: "I have heard that in the east there is the Mahāyāna sutra *Oceanic Treasury of Wisdom*. Yet I, the king, regret that I cannot go there myself. This is why I grieve."

At that time, a great elder in the kingdom harbored evil thoughts, slandering in various ways and fostering disbelief. He addressed the king, saying: "I have heard that the *One Vehicle Oceanic Treasury of Wisdom* is but an illusion, a fabrication of the Daoists." In an instant, the elder’s body turned yellow and red, worms and foul odors flowed from him, his hair and fur fell out, his form became that of a hungry ghost, and his neck swelled like an ox’s. The king then severed his life. Through this cause, he did not fall into hell.

Good man, the majestic power and awe-inspiring dignity of upholding and cherishing the wondrous treasury of the One Vehicle sutra are thus—vast and unthinkable.

Good man, when beings abide in the world, they face the hardships of the Three Realms and the sufferings of illness. What are these sufferings? The suffering of birth, the suffering of sickness, the suffering of death, the suffering of enmity, the suffering of hatred, the suffering of separation, and the suffering of parting. Thus, beings are afflicted by the suffering of karmic hindrances. Wherever they are born, they are all consumed by desire, for they do not see old age, sickness, and death.

Good man, it is like a poisonous tiger whose mouth can kill a person, and whose paws and claws can do the same. Beings in the Three Realms, abiding in existence, are likewise.

Good man, it is like a land across the great sea where sweet dew abounds. Those who partake of it live for three thousand years, free from illness and suffering, at peace and joyful. Yet foolish people, craving its taste, prepare ships and set sail to obtain it, unaware that in the sea there are great scaled fish that can swallow ships whole. When those people set out, they do not know the great fish has already devoured their ship. Thus, the wise do not crave that taste and remain secure.

Good man, the true person, the youth, does not desire the taste of afflictions, and it is the same. Good man, the true person, the youth, abiding in the *Oceanic Treasury*, observes the suffering of afflictions just as the wise observe the fish and the ship, without delight.

Good man, people grow old and decline, yet they constantly seek joy in desire. It is like a lotus born in a pond, blooming fresh and splendid, delightful to behold. Yet when frost and hail come, all is destroyed.

Good man, the joy of human life, the desire for sensual pleasure, and the afflictions that assail the body—falling into the sufferings of the Three Wretched Realms—are likewise. It is like a broken axle, no longer of use. Old age is the same; one cannot return to youth.

It is like a land tortoise whose heart constantly longs for water. Good man, it is the same: though aged in appearance, one ever recalls the vigor of youth.

It is like the lotus in a pond in autumn, once the delight of all who saw it, suddenly withered and yellow, despised and discarded. Good man, the prime of youth and the beauty of strength are likewise—once the delight of all, yet suddenly aged and despised by all.

Good man, it is like sugarcane, once pressed, its dregs devoid of flavor. Good man, the vigor and prosperity of youth are likewise: once aged, desire is no more.

Good man, it is like polishing a mirror, which one holds daily, never parting from one’s heart. Good man, people are the same: in the prime of youth, their splendor is whole, but in old age, they become frail and emaciated, their spirit and form withered, ever longing for their youth, never parting from their heart.

Good man, the true person, the youth, cultivating the *Oceanic Treasury of Wisdom* of the One Vehicle, observes the suffering of illness with constant fear and unease. Good man, it is like an enemy, ever a source of sorrow. The true person, the youth, is likewise: observing afflictions, ever sorrowful.

It is like rice infested with borers, which die at the joints. Good man, people are the same: when illness strikes, it is difficult to cure, and in an instant, they die.

It is like a royal procession where the ministers go ahead and the king follows behind. When they near the enemy’s ranks, the king and his ministers pursue one another, unable to part. Good man, the true person, the youth, is likewise: following beings in their illness, unable to leave them, observing their suffering to bring them peace.

Good man, the true person, the youth, cultivating the treasury of the Mahāyāna sutras, observes the suffering of beings’ death and decay as a conflagration. It can consume all things, save only the jeweled terrace, beyond its reach. Good man, when a disastrous fire arises, it burns and destroys all things, yet the true person abiding in the *Oceanic Treasury of Wisdom* of the Great Vehicle remains untouched by the flames.

It is like a flood that submerges all, save only Penglai, beyond its power. Good man, the flood submerges the Three Realms, and all beings are swept away—save only the true person who abides in the great vessel of the One Vehicle, the *Oceanic Treasury of Wisdom*.

Furthermore, it is like the parrot, which can mimic sounds and speak, causing the phoenix and peacock to come and circle in dance. Good man, when the true person, the youth, upholds this sutra, all beings come to praise and extol him, just so.

Then the Heavenly Venerable, with eyes of compassion and kindness, gazed upon the beings in hell, the hungry ghosts, humans, and non-humans, each weeping and wailing: "Alas for us, born in hell! Shackles, fetters, and cangues bind and strike our bodies; day after day we die and are reborn, without respite." At that time, a hungry ghost, naked after ten thousand kalpas, reflected to himself: "How did I come to be born in this place of suffering? What did I do in the past—was it slander? Greed and attachment? Perverse views? Or wicked rebellion?" Then a hungry ghost in the form of a bare skull pondered: "Why now are my bones and flesh scattered, enduring manifold torments, dying and being reborn day after day, never knowing a moment’s peace? What did I do before—was it robbery and theft? Or abandoning others? In my suffering now, do I have parents who grieve for me alone? Where are my parents, siblings, and the hundred kin bound to me by love?" Having thought thus, each wept and wailed, beating their arms in grief.

Then the Heavenly Venerable transformed into a bull-headed being and addressed them: "Hungry ghosts, have you seen the immortals in the heavens above?" The hungry ghosts replied: "Truly, we have seen them." He asked again: "Have you seen the fragrant rice, the wondrous flavors, and the sweet dew medicine in heaven?" The hungry ghosts answered: "Truly, we have seen them." Then the bull-headed being said to the hungry ghosts: "Those immortals are your younger brothers. Once, in a royal household, you were the eldest brother, ever committing wickedness, killing without restraint, indulging in lust and desire, seizing the wives of others, relying on your strength to oppress the weak, and arrogantly asserting your own way. Your brother was ever compassionate, giving alms to the poor, delighting in mountains and rivers, and seeking the Dao and its virtue in seclusion. But you cut him off and would not walk the same path."

The younger brother attained flight as an immortal, and heaven bestowed upon him fragrant rice and wondrous sweet dew flavors. But you have become hungry ghosts, suffering unbearable hunger and thirst."

Then, upon hearing these words, the hungry ghosts wept together, their sobs rumbling like thunder. In that moment, all in hell—whether male or female, human or non-human—raised their hands, lifted their fists toward the sky, and cried out: "Alas! Alas!"

Thereupon, the torments of hell ceased entirely, and all within, whether male or female, sat in peace. Then, a celestial immortal in the sky addressed the hungry ghosts: "Now, I offer you sweet dew—will you partake?" He continued: "This sweet dew can free all beings from hunger and thirst, from birth and death, from suffering and joy."

The hungry ghosts replied: "In our desperate starvation, how could we refuse?"

The immortal then bestowed the sweet dew, and the hungry ghosts—one, two, ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten million—all were sated without exception. The immortal then said to the hungry ghosts: "I possess a wondrous medicine—will you take it? This medicine can sever all suffering and afflictions, allowing beings to dwell in bliss."

The hungry ghosts each answered: "We endure a thousandfold torment—we beg for deliverance."

The immortal then conferred the One Vehicle of the Ocean-Empty Pure Precepts. Upon receiving the precepts, the hungry ghosts instantly transformed, their forms reborn in beauty, and they gained clear understanding of the roots of good and evil across the three times.

Furthermore, good man, the Ocean-Empty Wisdom Treasury knows boundless expedient means, transforming and delivering beings, removing the city of suffering. Good man, it is like a fine medicine that eradicates all manner of illness in beings. Good man, it is like a wise person who comprehends all languages and serves as a great translator for all beings. Good man, it is like pure gold, which can be fashioned into any adornment according to one’s wishes. Good man, the Ocean-Empty is likewise: ever teaching the Dharma, discerning the varied dispositions of beings, expounding with expedient means, enabling all beings to perceive the absence of self. Because there is no self, all conditioned things are impermanent. Why? Through this cause and condition, all dharmas are without self. If there were a self, one would know it to be impermanent. Among all beings—including these hungry ghosts—there is not a single dharma that does not arise from conditions. Through this cause and condition, the wheel of birth and death turns.

Then, Ocean-Empty addressed the Heavenly Venerable: "How can all dharmas arise without self? If there is no self, there is also no enmity or kinship. If there is no enmity or kinship, why do the hungry ghosts weep together?"

The Heavenly Venerable replied: "Good man, I now expound the impermanence of all dharmas and the absence of self to enable beings to contemplate non-self and the absence of arising. Because there is no arising, what arises is already extinguished—like lightning, like a spark from stone, like a flame, like a dream, like an illusion, like a magical transformation. Good man, this body of mine arises from parents, and when the parents perish, this body of mine also perishes without arising. Therefore, know that all dharmas are without self. Through this cause and condition, all is impermanent. Good man, enmity and kinship among hungry ghosts arise from conditions. Why? It is like merchants carrying miscellaneous treasures to distant lands, seeking various gains, only to be suddenly harmed by bandits and lose their lives. Good man, it is like foolish attachment to kin and beauty, rushing east and west day and night, only to be suddenly poisoned—just so. Furthermore, it is like officials who rely on their power to oppress the people, acting lawlessly, only to be suddenly seized, shackled in cangues and fetters, their bodies bound and emaciated, as if afflicted by a century of illness. Good man, all beings who rely on the three poisons and indulge in the ten evils suddenly meet their end and transform into hungry ghosts or hell’s ox-headed tormentors, suffering ceaseless torture—just so."

Then, Ocean-Empty addressed the Heavenly Venerable: "Such teachings are difficult to fathom—subtle and supreme, the Dharma Wheel turns universally, discerning true nature with profound analogies. The Ocean-Empty Wisdom Treasury is replete with secret treasures of merit, benefiting beings and delivering all, like a benevolent ship crossing the sea of birth and death."

The Heavenly Venerable replied: "Excellent, excellent, good man! Why do you now conceive of manifold notions within the One Vehicle? Good man, the Ocean-Empty Wisdom Treasury is truly profound, its subtle merit unchanging and undifferentiated, serene and eternally abiding, like empty space. Good man, if any being regards the Ocean-Empty Treasury as their own body, then I am eternally abiding, indestructible and imperishable. I am the Ocean-Empty, and the Ocean-Empty is I; I am the Dao, and the Dao is I; I am the Heavenly Venerable, and the Heavenly Venerable is I. I am the One Vehicle of the Ocean-Empty Wisdom Treasury’s secret treasure, which expounds the wondrous Dharma, enabling all beings to listen, receive, and praise—this is my Dharma Wheel. If one claims, 'I am eternally abiding, without change,' how can it be said that the great Dharma Wheel turns? Therefore, you should declare that only the Heavenly Venerable and superior beings can turn the great Dharma Wheel. Good man, it is like the six senses: the eye depends on form, form depends on thought, and through their interdependent arising, eye-consciousness is born. Good man, the eye does not think, 'I can generate consciousness,' nor does thought say, 'I give rise to eye-consciousness.' Good man, all such dharmas arise through interdependent conditions—this is my Dharma Wheel. Good man, the Heavenly Venerable is likewise: through the six senses, he perceives all dharmas, and through the throat, tongue, teeth, lips, speech, and sound, he turns the great Dharma Wheel."

For this reason, one never thinks, "I turn the Dharma Wheel." Good man, it is like wood and fire: through the hand and the drill, fire is generated. Yet when fire arises, it never thinks, "This hand and drill have given birth to me," nor does it say, "I can generate myself." Good man, the Heavenly Venerable constantly turns the Dharma Wheel, yet never generates the thought, "I turn the Dharma Wheel." Good man, if no such thought arises, this is called turning the True Dharma Wheel. This turning of the Dharma Wheel is named the Single Vehicle’s Ocean-Empty Treasure Repository.

Furthermore, good man, long ago beneath the Kien-wood tree, I first turned the Dharma Wheel. Ninety thousand devas came together to observe and listen, all arousing faith and delighting in the Dharma, without rising from their seats. At that time, the devas immediately attained the supreme, subtle, and wondrous true fruit. Now, within this city of seven treasures, I first expound the Single Vehicle’s Ocean-Empty Treasure Repository, and again, eight million four hundred thousand devas abide in their seats, their faith unwavering. At that time, the devas immediately attained the four pure fruits of the heavenly paths.

Furthermore, good man, whenever the Heavenly Venerable expounds the Dharma, it is all called turning the Dharma Wheel. Why? It is like the precious wheel of a sagely king: this Wheel-Treasure enables beings to reach the secure city, revolving above and below without enemies or thieves. Good man, the Dharma is likewise: it transports beings to a place of peace, free from afflictions. Good man, you should now praise the Single Vehicle’s Ocean-Empty Wisdom-Treasure Repository as the True Dharma Wheel, whose meritorious virtues are subtle and inconceivable.

Then, Ocean-Empty addressed the Heavenly Venerable: "Heavenly Venerable, when you expound this Dharma, it is the great Dharma Wheel. It is not that you are unaware—my question was for the benefit of all beings, to broadly elucidate the Single Vehicle’s Ocean-Empty Wisdom-Treasure’s secret Dharma Wheel, which is not something that ordinary beings or lesser immortals and scholars can comprehend."

Then, the Heavenly Venerable replied to Ocean-Empty: "Excellent, Ocean-Empty, good man. You have already abided in the ground of the Great Vehicle, practicing the true practice and asking the true question. Good man, in the past, when I took the form of a being, I cultivated the Single Vehicle’s Ocean-Empty Dharma Wheel, fully penetrating all external demons, subduing their minds so they could not destroy it. I was able to uphold the Single Vehicle’s Ocean-Empty Wisdom Dharma Wheel and thought: 'The meritorious virtues of the secret treasure repository of the Single Vehicle’s Dharma Wheel are inconceivable. We beings should abandon this foul corpse and remove the defiled qi-body of external demons.'"

At that time, the demon kings among the assembly, having heard these words, immediately prepared a great feast, offering their wealth, treasures, beloved wives and children, houses and dwellings, elephants, horses, chariots, servants, and attendants—all scattered in offering. They adorned the place with pure incense and flowers, various ornaments, and came to the Dharma assembly to repent their past transgressions.

Then, the Heavenly Venerable, raising his hand to touch the table, replied to the demons: "Good man, all ordinary beings fail to properly restrain the six senses and commit evil, thereby generating afflictions. Drawn by evil, they reach unwholesome places. Good man, it is like a vicious horse, fierce and stubborn, which leads its rider to perilous places. Failing to restrain the six senses and committing evil is likewise, causing one to stray far from the Ocean-Empty’s good path and reach evil destinations. It is like a wild elephant whose mind is untamed: if someone rides it, it does not follow their will, leaving the city behind and entering the wilderness. Failing to restrain the six senses and committing evil is likewise, leading one far from the Ocean-Empty Treasure City into the wilderness of birth and death.

Good man, it is like a treacherous minister who teaches the king to do evil. The six senses, like treacherous ministers, constantly teach beings to commit boundless evils. Good man, it is like a wicked child who does not heed the teachings of teachers, parents, or elders, committing every kind of evil. Failing to tame the six senses is likewise, not following the good instructions of teachers and elders, committing every kind of evil. Good man, ordinary beings who do not restrain the six senses are constantly harmed by hell-beings, animals, and hungry ghosts, just as bandits harm good people.

Good man, ordinary beings who do not restrain the three poisons gallop through the five sense-objects, like a cowherd who fails to guard his cattle, allowing them to trample others’ crops. Ordinary beings who do not restrain the three poisons constantly dwell in existence, enduring much suffering. Good man, true persons and youths who cultivate the Great Vehicle sutras and practice the great sagely path constantly and skillfully regulate and restrain the three poisons, fearing greed, anger, ignorance, arrogance, and jealousy, for the sake of attaining all good dharmas.

Good man, if one properly guards these two roots of poison, one can restrain the mind; if one can restrain the mind, one can restrain the three poisons. Good man, it is like someone who protects their body and thereby protects the land; protecting the land is protecting the body. True persons and youths are likewise. If they hear and see the subtle sutras of the Single Vehicle’s Ocean-Empty, they attain wisdom; attaining wisdom, they attain focused mindfulness. If the six senses scatter, mindfulness can halt them. Why? Because of the power of wisdom."

Good man, it is like a skillful cowherd: if the cattle wander east or west and eat others’ sprouts and crops, he immediately blocks and stops them, not allowing them to eat the sprouts. True persons and youths are likewise. Through the causes and conditions of focused mindfulness and wisdom, they guard and restrain the six senses, not allowing them to scatter and stray.

True persons and youths, with the mind of focused mindfulness and wisdom, do not perceive the mark of self, nor the mark of what is perceived, nor the mark of sentient beings, nor what is received and used. They see all dharmas as sharing the mark of dharma-nature, arising with the marks of lifeless stone, tiles, and rubble. It is like a house, which arises from various conditions yet has no fixed nature. Seeing all sentient beings as established by the four great elements and the five aggregates, they discern that there is no fixed nature; because there is no fixed nature, beings revolve in birth and death.

True persons and youths do not generate attachment in birth and death. Seeing sentient beings conceive notions of affliction within affliction, they therefore invoke the secret treasure-store of the Single Vehicle’s Ocean-Empty, desiring to enable beings to create various dharmas, to make various causes, to build great ships, and to construct great Dharma bridges.

Good man, it is like a painter who, with various mixed pigments, paints many images—whether of men or women, of cows or horses. The ignorant common person, seeing them, generates the marks of men, women, and so on. The painter, however, knows there are no men or women. True persons and youths are likewise. Observing the various marks of dharmas, they contemplate the one mark and ultimately do not generate the mark of sentient beings. Why? Because of the power of focused mindfulness and wisdom.

The True Person Youth, cultivating the *Great Vehicle Ocean-Empty Treasure Sutra*, at that time observes a woman of upright beauty yet does not generate a mind of attachment. Why? Because he contemplates her form. Good man, the True Person Youth knows that desire-thought holds no joy, cannot pause even briefly—like a dog gnawing bone; like one who meets fire yet walks against the wind; like a charcoal-poisoned pool, a dream’s ill-gotten gain, a medicine tree at the borderlands cast aside by many; like meat devoured while birds compete in pursuit; like bubbles on water, like traces drawn in water; like a woven warp exhausted, like a prisoner led to market, like a borrowed thing whose power cannot endure. Contemplating desire thus, he sees its many faults and evils.

Good man, the True Person Youth sees sentient beings attached to the touch of fragrance, flavor, and sound. From time immemorial through countless kalpas, they have constantly endured suffering and affliction. For each being, the bones accumulated in a single kalpa would form a mountain like Yujing; the milk they have drunk would equal the waters of the four seas. When parents, siblings, wives, children, and kin die, the tears shed in lamentation surpass the four great oceans. Even the stars in the void could not match their number, nor could parents and siblings ever exhaust them. Through measureless kalpas, some have fallen into hells, animal realms, or hungry ghost states, enduring boundless suffering in birth and death beyond reckoning.

Good man, the True Person Youth deeply observes thus: all sentient beings endure such afflictions, and therefore, with compassionate mindfulness, he does not generate suffering in the cycle of birth and death. Good man, it is like a great assembly in the world, spanning three thousand *li* in every direction. Then the great king commands a worthy minister to carry a jar of honey through their midst, forbidding even a single drop to spill. Should he lose one drop, his life would be forfeit. The king further dispatches a fierce warrior with drawn blade to follow behind, instilling terror. The minister, accepting the king’s decree, holds the jar with utmost care. Passing through the assembly, though he sees the five sense-desires of the multitude, his mind constantly reflects: *If I indulge my senses and cling to those desires, I will lose the king’s honey jar. If I lose the king’s jar, how can my life be preserved?* For this reason, he holds it firmly, not losing a single drop.

Good man, the True Person Youth is likewise. Passing through the afflictions and cycle of birth and death, he does not lose wisdom. Because he does not lose it, though he sees the five desires, his mind does not cling. If he sees pure form, he does not generate the perception of form but only observes its suffering aspect. Likewise with perceptions of consciousness. He does not conceive of arising, does not conceive of cessation, does not conceive of causation, does not conceive of harmonious union, but generates the perception of wisdom. The True Person Youth, abiding in this state, with the five faculties purified, thus upholds and maintains the precepts. All ordinary beings, with impure five faculties, cannot uphold the complete precepts nor properly preserve the merit of true nature. Therefore, the True Immortal Youth constantly severs [afflictions], thus attaining the fruit of the unconditioned, abiding in constant joy and freedom, extracting himself from the conditioned, forever cutting off afflictions, and perfecting merit.

Good man, there is also the departure from desire. The Youth constantly practices the unsurpassed treasury of the sweet-dew Dharma, thus departing from evil and afflictive karma. What is departure? Good man, if there are sentient beings who can well cultivate the *Single Vehicle Ocean-Empty Subtle Secret Treasure Store*, transcribe, receive, uphold, recite, expound, and contemplate its meaning and flavor, they transcend the worldly cycle of birth, death, and affliction. For this reason, this is called departure from evil. Why? This sutra elucidates the Three Caverns and Seven Sections, the talismans and charts of the Dao, and scriptures such as the *Great Peace*. Good man, it is like a wise teacher guiding sentient beings. Among them, should there be one who can well contemplate, faithfully receive the teachings, and uphold the commands—whose mind does not create evil, whose mouth does not speak falsely, who departs from familial attachment and abandons the body of affliction—good man, the True Person Youth is likewise. Well contemplating the wise teacher’s command, the *Single Vehicle Ocean-Empty Subtle Secret Treasure Store*, his mind does not create evil, his mouth does not speak falsely.

Good man, it is like a fine medicine in the world. If sentient beings take it with faith, for the duration of their lives, they will not be harmed by any evil poison. Further, one who proclaims this fine medicine, even until the end of life, will be free from all evil. Good man, the *Single Vehicle Ocean-Empty* is likewise—the finest medicine in the world. If one can well receive, uphold, recite, expound, and contemplate its meaning and flavor, for the duration of their life, they will not fall into evil destinies. Further, one who proclaims the *Single Vehicle Ocean-Empty Wisdom Treasury* will attain rebirth among humans and gods, with exceptional form and marks. Good man, if there are sentient beings who can well transcribe it—with pure body and hands, arranging the characters in order like jade slips—they will surely attain the wisdom of a divine youth, standing in attendance upon the Heavenly Worthy, their form as majestic as that of a radiant king.

Good man, the *Single Vehicle Ocean-Empty Subtle Secret Treasure Store* possesses such measureless merits, difficult to conceive. If there are sentient beings who expound it for others and contemplate its meaning and flavor, know that such a person is a true disciple of mine, one who well receives and upholds my teachings, one whom I protect and cherish. Such a person can comprehend my marks. Wherever they dwell—whether in mountains, forests, remote wilderness, dwellings, fields, mansions, pavilions, or palaces—I also abide there, constantly and immovably. In such places, I always receive offerings: sometimes as a Daoist, silently contemplating; sometimes as a worthy one, skillfully expounding the *Single Vehicle Ocean-Empty True Dao Treasury*.

Or as a poor scholar, approaching doors to beg for alms.
How then may such a person come to know that I, in such places, receive the offerings of others, constantly transforming my body and manifesting in accordance with the region?

Good man, such a person dwelling therein, in the depths of night, dreams of seeing divine beings upon jeweled thrones expounding the Dharma, with jade maidens and immortal youths standing in attendance; or sees heavenly beings, Daoist immortals in their true forms, kings and sagely rulers, princes and royal figures; or beholds great mountains and lesser peaks; or sees rivers and streams, the sun and moon; or oxen and sheep, elephants and horses, carriages and chariots; or parents, siblings, uncles and elders bearing the seven treasures—gold, silver, lapis lazuli, true pearls, and other precious things—approaching the Dharma site to make offerings with faith.
At that moment, know that it is the Heavenly Worthy who receives their offerings.
Upon awakening from such a dream, filled with joy, one soon obtains all manner of subtle and wondrous things.
Thereupon, one reflects thus, the mind free of evil thoughts, universally practicing loving-kindness and delighting in the cultivation of wholesome dharmas.

Good man, the *Single Vehicle Ocean-Empty* is likewise thus, able to accomplish such measureless merits, with devas and immortals receiving its boundless, inconceivable virtues.
Good man, you should now believe and accept my words.
If there are sentient beings—good men and good women—who desire the *Ocean-Empty*, who wish to perceive true reality, who seek to cultivate the secret treasury, who constantly delight in the Dao’s domain, who cast aside the four māras, who depart from the city of afflictions, who attain the joys of humans and devas, who uphold and practice the *Single Vehicle Ocean-Empty Subtle Secret Treasure Store Sutra*, transcribing, reciting, and expounding it for others, contemplating its meaning and flavor—
you should draw near to them, rely upon them, seek their counsel, make offerings to them with reverence, honor and praise them, wash their hands and feet, prepare their seats, provide for all their needs, and ensure they lack nothing.
If they come from afar, you should go forth to meet them along the way, and for the sake of this sutra, present them with whatever you hold most precious.
Why? Because such sutras are difficult to encounter and rare to hear.
You should listen single-mindedly, receive, and uphold them.

Good man, I recall the immeasurable, boundless Heavenly Worthies of the past, future, and present, each assembling in great gatherings.
At that time, among the assembly, there was a Heavenly Worthy named *Formless*, who expounded for the great multitude this *Single Vehicle Ocean-Empty Subtle Secret Treasure Store*.
At that time, having heard it from a good friend, I grasped its meaning and flavor.
Now I shall expound for the assembly the *Single Vehicle Ocean-Empty Treasure Store Sutra*.
When the great multitude heard this sutra, their hearts rejoiced greatly, and they established a grand feast.
Within the assembly, I transformed myself into a poor scholar, wandering about offering myself for sale, yet finding no buyer, and so prepared to return home.
Along the way, I encountered a man, and I said to him: "I wish to sell myself. Would you buy me?"
The man replied: "I am in need of a purchase, but I fear you may not comply."
I said: "What task would you have me do? Why doubt my sincerity?"
The man replied: "There is a grave illness in my household. The great physician prescribed medicine requiring human eyes. If you would provide them, I shall give you seven gold coins daily for their use."
Upon hearing this, my heart leapt with boundless joy. At that very moment, I offered my pair of wisdom eyes—luminous as moonlit pupils, their brilliance manifest in their orbs.
I said: "Give me the coins. I now offer you both eyes for your use."
Thereupon, the man gave me the gold.
Having received it, I returned to my original seat, established a grand feast, made offerings with reverence, and then listened to the sutra with a sincere heart.
At that time, though dull-witted, I was able to receive and uphold but a single phrase, a single character of the *Single Vehicle Treasure Store*.
Having received and upheld it, I immediately returned to the sick household.
Though I daily bestowed my luminous eyes upon them, I constantly contemplated the *Single Vehicle Ocean-Empty Treasure Store*, my body free of pain, my daily practice unceasing, until the month’s end.
Through this cause and condition, the illness was cured, and my body restored, without wound or scar.
At that time, I beheld my body complete with perfect, subtle, and wondrous marks.
I then reflected: the power of a single phrase from the *Single Vehicle Ocean-Empty Subtle Secret Treasure Store* is already thus—how much more so for one who fully receives, upholds, expounds, recites, and contemplates its meaning and flavor?
Seeing this sutra’s power, I aroused the aspiration that in the future, all sentient beings might attain the immortal Dao, mastering the *Single Vehicle Subtle Secret Treasure Store Sutra* in its entirety.
Good man, by the power of this single phrase’s cause and condition, I am now able to expound the *Single Vehicle Treasure Store* for the devas and humans in this great assembly.

Good man, the *Ocean-Empty Wisdom Treasury* is inconceivable, benefiting all beings with boundless, immeasurable virtues.
Such is its profound, secret meaning.
Good man, if there are sentient beings who can well receive and uphold it, they will sever and depart from evil roots.
What is evil? Evil thoughts, evil intentions, evil illnesses, evil reflections—all such evils they will be able to distance themselves from, thereby growing and abiding in wholesome roots.
Wholesome roots, wholesome reflections; wisdom and skillful means—through such causes and conditions, this is called "departing from evil."

Good man, the true person, the youth dwelling in the city of afflictions, observes their own body as if it were a sickness, a wound, a poisoned arrow piercing the flesh.
Such a body is a great mass of suffering, the root of both good and evil.
For this reason, one regards the body not with attachment, for to nourish it is to sustain the body of a hungry ghost, the body of hell, the body of birth and death.
Good man, it is like a raging fire consuming withered wood, or a plantain tree struck by frost and hail, like lightning’s flash, like a flame, like an illusion.
Good man, the true person, the youth dwelling in the city of afflictions, observes the body’s marks—it is likewise thus.

If one can depart from the body of birth and death and abide in the treasure repository of the single vehicle of sea and emptiness, one will then attain the body adorned with seventy-two marks and eighty-one subtle excellences, accomplishing merit and virtue, becoming a Dharma-wheel king who forever guards the body.

Why is this so? If the body is not guarded, life is not preserved; if life is not preserved, one cannot transcribe this sutra, receive, uphold, recite, or expound its meaning and flavor. Therefore, one should guard and preserve body and life. For this reason, the true person, the youth dwelling in the city of afflictions, departs from all evil and protects body and life.

Good man, it is like beings who wish to cross the sea: they carefully guard their vessel to reach the other shore. The true person, the youth, is likewise thus.

At that time, Sea-Emptiness and the assembled devas, celestial immortals, and youths, having heard these words, rejoiced greatly in their hearts. They received and upheld the teaching, listened attentively, grasped its meaning and flavor, then all rose to pay homage. Each returned to their own realm, taking leave and departing.

*Thus concludes Fascicle Six of the* Supreme Single Vehicle Treasure Repository of Sea-Emptiness Wisdom. *Variant: Dunhuang manuscript reads "good marks" instead of "good roots."*

**Fascicle Seven: The Chapter on Equality**

At that time, Sea-Emptiness Wisdom Repository addressed the Heavenly Venerable, saying: "Today, I have but a shallow understanding. When true persons and boundless youths practice the mind of the Dao, cultivating kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity, they attain the true Dharma ground. When they cultivate the mind of equanimity, when they cultivate wisdom, what Dharma do they gain after accumulating such merits for measureless kalpas? What benefits do true persons and youths obtain by knowing these merits thus?"

"The Heavenly Venerable now speaks these secret and essential words. If one does not grasp at them, one does not know the Dharma; yet if one grasps at them, that is grasping. If one does not grasp at them, then one knows nothing—how then does the Heavenly Venerable speak of the Dharma as not to be grasped? Among this assembly, I do not recognize the fundamental principle, do not comprehend the mark of emptiness, do not understand all things. I only pray that the Heavenly Venerable will descend and graciously expound."

At that time, the Heavenly Venerable replied to Sea-Emptiness Wisdom Repository, saying: "Good man, you know the right time and perceive that I am about to speak, so you inquire thus. When true persons and youths cultivate the mind of equanimity and cultivate wisdom, they attain the unconditioned, abide in constant peace and bliss, and dwell in the true, empty, and equal Dharma ground—the inconceivable, subtle, and wondrous realm. Like the supreme Dao, it is difficult to compare, like the great sea, like the vast emptiness."

"Good man, when true persons and youths abide in the empty and equal ground, which is difficult to surpass, they do not see father, mother, brothers, relatives, acquaintances, sisters, children, or those who are hateful and resentful. Just as emptiness has no father, mother, or brothers, nor even any sentient beings or lifespans, all dharmas are likewise thus. Their minds are equal, benefiting many, like emptiness itself. Why is this? Because by practicing merits, they skillfully cultivate all the Dharmas of emptiness. This inner Dharma is empty, yet it is constant, blissful, self, and pure, attaining fearlessness. Within this inner Dharma, though there is the nature of the Dao, this nature is neither external nor internal, neither non-existent nor existent, equal and without duality. Why is this? Because the true nature is eternally abiding and unchanging. This is called a true person, a youth, contemplating inner emptiness. Because the inner Dharma is empty, they contemplate all dharmas as originally empty in nature, without permanence, suffering, or joy, without purity or impurity—this is called the emptiness of Dharma. Because of the emptiness of Dharma, it is called empty emptiness."

"Good man, true persons and youths of the ten directions constantly penetrate a fraction of this, like a speck of dust—how much more so others? Good man, when true persons and youths contemplate this gate of emptiness, which is empty yet not empty, they attain dwelling in the Dharma ground of emptiness. Good man, when I now speak of these meanings of emptiness to the great assembly, hundreds of thousands of true persons and youths immediately attain dwelling in the Dharma ground of emptiness. Good man, once true persons and youths abide in this ground, they are without obstruction, bondage, or attachment in all dharmas; their minds are free from confusion, constantly attaining self-mastery, purity, and liberation. For these reasons, it is called the pure Dharma ground of emptiness."

"Good man, Sea-Emptiness Wisdom Repository, it is like emptiness: it does not generate greed for lovable forms, nor does it generate anger toward unloved forms. True persons and youths abiding in this ground are likewise thus. In all dharmas, they demonstrate knowledge and practice, whether causes and conditions, effects and non-conditions, causes and effects, root natures, refined contemplation, the Great Vehicle, good-knowing advisors, pure precepts, or abundant giving. In all such dharmas, they know and see the supreme liberation, the profound practices, and the foremost wisdom. They see sentient beings practicing unwholesome dharmas, inevitably falling into hells, enduring measureless suffering and affliction. Like sentient beings emerging from hells and being born among humans, if they practice giving and fulfill all such acts of generosity, they will certainly enter right liberation. This is called knowing Sea-Emptiness Wisdom Repository, true persons, and youths. There are also those who see and know in other ways."

"What is seeing? Seeing the constant and the impermanent, seeing purity and impurity, seeing self and no-self. Knowing that the divine venerables are definitely not ultimately subject to birth and death, knowing that the bodies of divine venerables are indestructible like vajra, not bodies constituted by afflictions, nor bodies of foul decay. They also know that all sentient beings possess the nature of the Dao. Good man, knowing that the minds of these sentient beings are accomplished in faith, knowing that these sentient beings seek the Great Vehicle—such a person is from the stream, yet not of the stream; such a person abides rightly, knowing that at the time of birth, they have already reached the other shore, abiding in the Great Vehicle, attaining the profound flavor of the Dharma, the fundamental principle of the Dharma, and right liberation. Cultivating the mind of pure conduct, with the pure divine eye, they see sentient beings creating unwholesome bodily, verbal, and mental actions—sexual misconduct, theft, and the three unwholesome karmas—falling into hells, animal realms, and hungry ghost realms, enduring unbearable suffering, tormented by wind and blades."

"They see sentient beings cultivating wholesome actions, diligent and vigorous, who in their next lives will be born in heavenly or human realms. They see sentient beings moving from darkness to darkness, benighted and confused; some moving from darkness to light, with clear understanding and knowledge; some moving from light to darkness, abandoning truth for falsehood; and some moving from light to light. Good man, if unwholesome karma is accomplished through greed, anger, or delusion, such karma will inevitably result in hellish retribution. Such persons, by merely upholding precepts and practicing these deeds, do not fall into hells. By repenting and revealing all their evils, having repented, they dare not commit them again, accomplishing shame and remorse. Thus, with a single mind, they make offerings to the Three Treasures. For these reasons, they do not fall into hells."

Those whose offenses intersect with retribution suffer headaches, abdominal pains, eye pains, back pains, untimely calamities and deaths, rebukes and insults, whippings and beatings, confinement and strikes, hunger and hardship, unfulfilled desires, thwarted endeavors, and manifold sorrows and afflictions—these are not merely isolated cases. Enduring such boundless sufferings, they experience present-life retribution.

The Perfected Youth, the Golden Radiance Youth, and those who witness such persons, unaware of the causes and conditions, fail to repent. They do not reflect upon themselves, do not reproach themselves, do not generate shame or remorse, and harbor no fear. Thus, their offenses grow, and they receive hellish retribution. When will they attain liberation? They wander in endless darkness, cycling through bitter toil.

They see that all sentient beings possess the nature of the Dao, yet it is obscured by afflictions, preventing them from perceiving it—like a dark night where nothing is clearly seen. What they perceive are merely worldly words and speech: men and women, carriages and vessels, houses and cities, clothing and food, mountains and seas, forests and trees, the lifespans of sentient beings—these are called "what is seen."

The subtle teachings of the sages transcend male and female, extending even to forests and trees. They know what to bestow and how to offer equally, understand diligence, recognize recipients, and comprehend the law of cause and effect.

The Perfected Youth knows the eightfold assembly of the Dharma’s origin, and his merit is none other than the five virtues of the Heavenly Worthy. What he knows is as luminous as form itself.

Good man, good woman, the Perfected Youth attains the four unimpeded eloquences and can follow the names established for all dharmas. The Perfected Youth, in all his teachings, encounters no obstruction, cannot be swayed, fears nothing, and is indomitable.

Good man, this is called the Perfected One. Within a single dharma, he expounds myriad names, and even after countless kalpas, his speech will not be exhausted.

Good man, all ordinary beings cling to form, and even to consciousness. Because of clinging to form, greed arises, and thus they are bound by form, even bound by consciousness. Therefore, they cannot escape birth, aging, sickness, death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, and all afflictions.

Good man, for this reason, in teaching my disciples, I call those who strike and cling "demonic ghosts," who coil around the body and cannot be shaken off for an entire lifetime. If one does not cling, one is freed from demonic ghosts. It is like a criminal in the world who is shackled by officials, while the innocent are not. The Perfected Youth is likewise: those who cling are encoiled by demons, while those who do not are far from demonic ghosts and abide in constant freedom. The Perfected Youth is without attachment.

At that time, Haikong Zhizang addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "Your servant is like fine silk, repeatedly refined to yield manifold flavors. I, too, having heard the Dao many times, have obtained the flavor of the Dharma. This Dharma-flavor is the taste of detachment from desires, the taste of tranquility, the taste of the true Dao."

Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy, like true gold, repeatedly forged, melted, and tempered, becomes ever more radiant, pure, malleable, and lustrous, its value immeasurable. Only then is it treasured by humans and devas. The Heavenly Worthy is likewise: through earnest inquiry, one hears and sees the profound treasury of the Dharma, enabling those of deep faith to receive, uphold, and cultivate it. Countless beings awaken the mind for supreme enlightenment, and only then are they revered and honored by humans and devas."

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy praised Zhizang, saying: "Excellent, excellent! Perfected Youth of supreme, unconditioned wisdom, for the sake of benefiting all sentient beings, you have inquired into the profound meaning of the supreme Dao. Good man, for this reason, I expound the Great Vehicle in accordance with your intent, the treasury of profound, secret wisdom. It is cherished as dearly as an only child."

Then the Heavenly Worthy again addressed Haikong Zhizang: "You have deeply savored the Dharma-flavor, the foremost sublime practice, of boundless merit. Such a disciple is rare indeed." And he spoke in verse:

"Haikong Zhizang, all is indeterminate.
Provisionally gathering sentient beings—how could this not be emptiness?
The true nature of the five dusts—from where could they arise?
Since they cannot but be empty,
such matters are neither false nor deluded, neither existent nor inverted.
To speak of affliction and bondage is to give rise to perverse views.
If one does not believe in emptiness,
from where do all the leaks and dusts arise?
One then falls into the error of eternalism.
If they exist now, how could they be born?
Are they produced by conditions?
Do they dwell parasitically?
Do they arise without cause?
Or do they arise collectively?
Since they are equally unborn,
it is known that they are not real—
beyond thought and contemplation.

You have now become
the King of Virtue without limit,
without present or past,
without going or coming,
without thought or conception,
without hatred or love,
without birth or extinction.
Subduing toil and enmity,
manifesting the correct to dispel the perverse,
crushing all external paths,
eradicating all views—
profound in name and essence,
not to be sought in fixed form,
divine function beyond thought,
without any determinate appearance.

Understanding the emptiness of all dharmas,
Haikong Zhizang,
you who cultivate this Way—
your spirit shines deeply and far.
Knowing my profound mystery,
truly unshaken,
you gain the power of fearlessness,
the inconceivable,
able to know the ancient beginning—
this is called the principle of the Dao.

Previously unenlightened, now enlightened—
the seed of the Dao.
Why is this so?
The Heavenly Worthy’s wisdom
is boundless and immeasurable;
the meaning of the subtle and wondrous
is profound and far-reaching, difficult to fathom.
Forcibly describing its form,
its benevolent practice is beyond thought.

How can one attain
the manifestation of all dharmas?
All sentient beings
are deeply attached to the four perversities,
confused by manifold appearances,
not understanding, not recognizing,
indulging in greed and lust,
not practicing the four immeasurables.
Discriminating emptiness,
they can never attain it.
Returning to the root, restoring the mandate,
abiding in the Haikong Dao,
they pacify their minds—
Haikong Zhizang.

You should know
that tranquility has two kinds:
The first is tranquil with existence,
with thoughts, reflections, and contemplations,
constantly mindful of pure practice—
the One Vehicle of Haikong.
The second is empty tranquility,
thoughts vast as the sea,
constantly mindful of pure practice—
thus preserving oneness.
Next, entering emptiness,
one attains the gateway of the empty Dao,
only then reaching the profound origin,
fully realizing ultimate tranquility.
Tranquilizing all distinctions,
all existence returns to emptiness;
emptying tranquility itself,
tranquilizing all dharmas.
Thus expounding,
the principle of emptiness is true emptiness.

Why is this so?
Because all sentient beings
were originally self-purified,
but deludedly arose discriminations,
leading to wandering and transmigration,
sinking into the paths of suffering.
Whether male or female,
if one does not give rise
to manifold perverse views,
understanding that forms are empty,
one returns to restore the mandate,
becoming a child of the Dao,
pacifying the mind,
entering the Haikong Treasury,
contemplating the emptiness of all dharmas.

Haikong Zhizang,
you and the present assembly,
being unable to comprehend,
must have this expounded.
Now speaking these words
is for the sake of future ages,
that those who benefit from the Dharma,
returning to the source in emptiness and tranquility,
may become my disciples—
tranquil and constant,
attaining the Dao, eternally abiding,
unshaken and immovable.

Haikong Zhizang,
do you now understand?
What is the subtle body of the supreme Dao?
It does not long abide in the world,
fundamentally without arising or movement,
nor going or coming.
For the sake of sentient beings,
it manifests birth and extinction.
The great compassion of the true Dao
never abandons or forsakes—
why then does it manifest birth and extinction?
Because sentient beings
cannot abide constantly,
it deeply pities and sympathizes,
inconceivably.
Its mind cherishes sentient beings
as a mother loves her child.
Because sentient beings undergo birth and death,
it manifests birth and death.

The supreme Dao has no partiality,
only favoring the good.
It exhorts and awakens sentient beings,
offering them comfort.
With gentle words,
it enables them to understand and be subdued,
to seek the root of the Dao,
not to give rise to perverse views,
not to entertain evil thoughts,
to extinguish all manifold afflictions,
to practice with a constantly pure mind,
to be mindful and not retreat from the Dao.

Knowing these matters,
I now establish the precepts—
they should not go unspoken.
If one can be mindful and practice,
attaining the supreme Dao,
the virtues of manifesting dharmas
and the power of transformation and extinction are thus revealed.

You should know
that the mind’s actions become the body’s,
and four accomplishments are attained.
Whether male or female,
if one clings to perverse actions,
engaging in contention, killing, harming, and licentiousness,
giving rise to manifold evils,
like a venomous serpent,
losing the true principle—
those who seek the true, whether male or female,
must not give rise to such things.
Having attained this,
they awaken to that true source.

Those who deviate from the Dharma, whether male or female,
sink into this cycle of birth and death,
not drawing near to the ground of the Dao,
their blessed conditions receding day by day,
their evil conditions approaching.
Practicing right mindfulness,
they will surely attain
pure liberation,
unconditioned and free.

Good sons and good daughters,
when practicing these matters,
cultivate a magnanimous mind,
abandoning the four evils,
hastening to remove sorrow and affliction;
do not give rise to boasting and contention,
or to doubts and deluded thoughts.
Practice great merit,
acting with an unimpeded mind,
giving rise to the mind for all things.

Whether male or female,
if one takes this wondrous root as their source,
practicing this mindfulness,
thought after thought without retreat—
they are my true child.
Those who possess the Dao
constantly practice the supreme practice,
not dwelling in the four evils,
not engaging in perverse desires,
not entertaining any manifold perverse views;
not seeing what exists,
not seeing what does not exist;
mindful of the Dao, seeking the Dharma,
giving rise to great vows,
performing great merit.

Now this great assembly,
you should also enable them
to attain a lofty and wondrous body,
a true and upright youth,
attaining the inconceivable.
The supreme Dao pervades all knowing,
profoundly mindful, vastly universal.
Mindful of sentient beings to come,
when practicing, they will attain
the great and wondrous root,
with wisdom complete,
possessing thought and non-thought,
the greatest wisdom,
truly constant and unchanging.

You, the present assembly,
will not give rise to evil illnesses.
When practicing this Dao,
as children of supreme virtue,
possessing all marks,
understanding emptiness and existence—
when comprehending this mindfulness,
they will surely be mindful of the Dao,
attaining wondrous practice,
free and at ease as they wish.
Expounding for others
the One Vehicle of Haikong,
the secret treasury.

Haikong Zhizang,
know that these dharmas
have no bottom or limit.
Contemplating and expounding them,
their profound meanings are five:
First, good practice—
thinking of all
dark and hidden places,
all attain illumination,
the wondrous marks of the unconditioned."

Second, skillful exposition—
the mind and intent grow gentle,
without self or other.

Third, constant aspiration—
exhorting others to arouse the mind,
to seek superior power,
to distance themselves from evil paths,
to practice fearless action.

Fourth, utmost sincerity—
cutting through all delusions,
free from the net of doubt,
ever abiding in wondrous matters,
gaining the profound flavor of the Dharma,
inexhaustible throughout the day,
all beings
receive deliverance.

Fifth, right intention—
forming all manner of vows,
whether as man or woman,
those who have not seen or heard
all come to hear and know,
and shall attain the Dao.

When practicing these,
one enters the ocean of merit,
the unconditioned assembly of the Dao.
With wholehearted aspiration,
boundless causes and conditions,
the unconditioned fruit—
the name of Dao-achievement,
unobstructed liberation,
this is called "guiding things."

Three practices, three virtues,
three return to one.
Practice and understanding as one condition—
abandon the mind of conditioned doing,
arouse the mind of unconditioned being.
Empty and yielding as dust,
not opposing the honored virtue.
Contemplate the Three Treasures,
never for a moment forsaking them.
Never wavering in resolve,
obscurely aided by the child.
With the mind’s practice perfected,
fully attaining the Dao,
no longer stained or hindered.

You should know:
this great scripture,
circulating in the world,
if seen or heard,
brings boundless causes and conditions.
Good men and good women,
practicing according to its teachings,
cultivating the four equal practices,
their minds filled with joy.
Those who practice thus
rightly enter the unconditioned,
foremost children,
unretreatable causes and conditions.

All beings,
flawed by conditioned existence,
afflicted by vexations,
accumulate them all day long.
Yet once attained,
they do not endure for long.
The affliction of vexations
emptily wastes body and life,
and what is gained?
What is not gained?
What is truly not gained?

Wisdom Treasury, know this:
its meaning further unfolds in seven aspects.
First, the virtue of wisdom—
thought after thought, this mind
enters non-retreat,
its practice ever still.

Second, practice and understanding—
contemplating the Dao, leaving the household,
ever tasting the flavor of the Dharma,
diligent and steadfast.

Third, manifest benefit—
receiving and guiding beings,
enabling them to leave suffering,
ever hearing the Dao and its teachings.

Fourth, beneficial application—
contemplating the sages,
with many skillful means,
bringing benefit to all.

Fifth, wisdom—
true persons and youths
attain great spiritual power,
all achieving Dao through it.

Sixth, attainment of power—
all beings,
emerging from the world through the Dao,
gain fearlessness.

Seventh, virtue fulfilled—
spiritual penetrations, self-mastery,
coming and going, returning,
nothing firm or obstructive.

Thus this wondrousness
serves as the power of the Dharma,
delivering and saving future lives.
If good men
can attain liberation,
truly expounding the real,
recognizing the fundamental source of the Dharma,
entering the causes and conditions of the Dao,
this is where my contemplation dwells.

Why is this so?
The supreme Dao has no bottom,
profound and difficult to fathom,
neither abiding nor perishing,
neither ending nor beginning,
eternally enduring without end.
The practice that employs it
draws all things to itself,
the world entire turns toward it.
Its application is deep and far-reaching,
the tranquil abode of the Dao,
beyond contemplation—
its meanings number in the hundreds and thousands,
its mystery most profound,
a bottomless treasury without limit.

Virtuous deeds transform beings,
responses truly efficacious,
boundless and unlimited,
manifesting skillful means,
delivering from birth and death.

The practice of the Great Vehicle,
the use of lesser wisdom;
neither false nor real,
neither non-existent nor existent,
neither unconditioned nor conditioned.

Such supreme merit
has four inexhaustible applications.
Now expounded thus,
boundless causes and conditions.
The Dao cannot be said to exist,
nor can it be said not to exist—
the power of Dao-wisdom
equalizes all things.

If there are beings
who can dispel the net of doubt,
cutting the roots of vexation,
they are my disciples,
true to the Dao from beginning to end,
turning the Wheel of Dharma,
form and spirit as one,
truly wondrous bodies.
Like stone flowers
transforming into gold and jade,
once truly achieved,
only wondrous marks remain,
no coarse substance seen,
abandoning the body of beings,
attaining a separate Dharma-body.
The coarse departs, the wondrous arrives,
and the true Dao is accomplished.
First abandoning the old and decayed,
then gaining the new and enduring.
Without cause, without effect,
all arises from vows.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy having spoken this verse,
all in the assembly attained the inconceivable:
true and supreme practice,
next discerning truth from falsehood,
foremost in what is practiced,
mysterious and boundless.

At that moment,
hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions
of true immortals and Daoist adepts
were present in the assembly,
upholding the correct Dharma,
having already attained the immeasurable,
fully possessing the six penetrations,
turning toward the wondrous and true,
the unconditioned realm,
inconceivable,
supreme and perfectly true,
beyond comparison.

The true ones of supreme virtue
manifest throughout the ten directions;
innumerable forms
pervade all lands,
receiving and guiding beings,
never slackening.

If good men and good women
should know the practices of seeking the Dao and the secular,
arousing all manner of minds,
they shall attain the Dao,
supreme and perfectly true,
pervading knowledge of all dharmas.
The three realms have no support—
only the Dao can be relied upon.
Though without form or appearance,
its appearance is most true,
its name does not depart—
this is true immovability.

Within the Great Clarity,
lies my source.

As these words were spoken,
good men,
all beings without exception understood.
When true persons and youths
practice the supreme Dao,
they constantly observe beings,
never harboring resentful thoughts,
pushing straightness onto others,
drawing crookedness toward themselves,
without contention,
gaining long life.

Why is this so?
Because they skillfully know the causes and conditions of all means,
desiring to enable beings to plant all manner of good roots.

At that time,
seventy-three lesser immortals and Daoist adepts
came from the west,
all arriving at the seat.
Their names were:
Virtuous Mind Daoist,
Vast Offering Daoist,
Renouncing Love Daoist,
Skillful Exposition Daoist,
Universal Contemplation Daoist,
Faithful Practice Daoist,
Constant Protection Daoist,
Radiant Wisdom Daoist,
Supreme Mark Daoist—
such assemblies
could not all be recorded.
As retinue they came,
to hear the exposition,
all seated together.
Some aroused virtuous practice,
burning incense and lighting lamps.

Some left parents behind, journeying far into mountains and forests;
some made offerings to others, or abandoned wives and children,
devoting themselves to ascetic practice,
surrendering body, wisdom, and wealth,
harmonizing their voices to chant and praise the sacred virtue,
proclaiming the emptiness of the One Vehicle’s oceanic vastness,
extolling and expounding the subtle and wondrous scriptures.
Whatever practices they undertook,
all were performed with utmost devotion,
as offerings to the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy.
At that very moment, they all entered the One Vehicle,
attaining unimpeded liberation and inconceivable realization;
constantly abiding in the Dharma-wheel,
entering the stage of non-retreat;
constantly abiding in the Dharma-realm,
firm and unshaken in bliss.
They beheld the city of oceanic emptiness,
contemplating all dharmas with the mind,
comprehending suffering and emptiness,
impermanence, non-self,
eternal bliss, self, and purity.
Having heard the Dharma, each led their retinue back to their native lands.

Among this assembly,
there were those who had awakened to the wondrous principle,
attaining the fundamental essence of the thirty-six divisions of true scriptures.
They discerned the three marks,
understanding and proclaiming the teachings,
achieving the Dao and its fruits,
grasping causes and conditions,
gaining boundless wondrous penetrations,
turning the spirit to enter samādhi,
realizing the wisdom of the untainted,
mastering skillful means.
They were called the Great Compassion,
entering the samādhi of emptiness and quiescence,
inconceivable.

Suddenly, among this assembly,
one arose and expounded the essential teachings,
profound in meaning.
The great multitude,
each and all, roused courage,
overflowing with joy.
One among them declared:
“Today, I have been able,
in the presence of the Venerable One,
to listen, receive, and awaken to understanding—
awakening to what was unknown and unseen before.
At this moment,
a throne adorned with a hundred treasures,
vast and magnificent, appeared.
In my heart, I sighed in awe,
feeling shame and reverence.
The essential teachings I received
could never be fully expressed.
Yet, by the grace of this great assembly,
I am called to expound the teachings—
how could I remain silent?
If I did not proclaim what I have received,
it would be as if concealing the Dharma,
failing to honor the supreme teaching.”
At that time, he began to lecture and recite the sacred Dharma,
relating the wondrous deeds he had practiced.
Just as with us,
those in the assembly who had not heard or understood before
all gained thorough comprehension,
receiving boundless benefit.
From this resolve,
they together attained the true and radiant Golden Abode,
with immortal youths as attendants,
a hundred thousand musicians,
and manifold transformations guiding all beings,
enabling them to abide perpetually in the fruit of non-action.

“You, this assembly,
and those of future ages,
must wholly abandon evil conduct and practice right contemplation,
turning away from evil and drawing near to goodness,
beginning by renouncing attachment,
forsaking pleasure to seek the Dao—
this is the seed of my teaching,
the foremost and supreme practice,
inconceivable.
Those whose bodies are impure
shall be transformed to purity;
those who, through my Dharma, know the body as ever impure
shall come to understand and purify it.
If you contemplate this truth,
it is a true and reliable assurance,
not false or deceptive—
a profound path of practice,
transcending the understanding of conditioned dharmas.
Thought after thought, they change and shift,
turning the coarse into the wondrous,
shedding one body to receive another,
becoming true companions of immortals.
The six roots and seven limbs
are likewise transformed.
Attaining the true and realizing the Dao
follows this same principle.

Beings deluded by the four perversities
are disturbed by māra,
their spirits departing, their forms dying,
their souls cast into dark prisons.
They suffer myriad torments,
the five agonies and bitter poisons—
when will they find liberation?
In the endless long night,
how can they escape?
Such matters are truly terrifying.
Contemplate the Dao and leave the household life,
distance yourself from the four perversities.
Those who can both speak thus
and put it into practice
shall live in joy.
Do not cling to what was originally possessed;
simply illuminate the truth for beings:
let them renounce the five flavors,
the five colors,
and the allure of delicate, seductive women,
so that their hearts do not become attached.
Constantly hold fast to the wondrous scriptures,
never setting them aside for even a moment,
ever as if starving and thirsty,
craving food and drink.
Cherish the treasure of the scriptures
as you would your own body,
and you shall gain further awakening,
attaining supreme power,
abiding unshaken,
limitless and unsurpassed,
perfecting the wheel of transformation.
This is the guide for cultivating the Dao and practicing immortality.

When the Great Immortal speaks,
none fail to bow their heads in reverence;
when the Perfected One manifests,
none fail to bow their heads in reverence;
when the Youth manifests,
none fail to bow their heads in reverence;
when the Heavenly Worthy manifests,
the eight realms pay homage,
none fail to bow their heads in reverence;
when the Sages of the ten directions each manifest,
none fail to bow their heads in reverence;
when the Immortal Ministers and Youths manifest here,
none fail to bow their heads in reverence.

All empty space,
the provisional three realms,
the five aggregates are without substance,
the three paths are all suffering.
Thought after thought arises and ceases,
all dharmas do not abide,
neither regressing nor turning.
The Prince of Victorious Causes
is called bliss,
ever practicing purity,
attaining unimpeded liberation.
The Oceanic Treasury of Wisdom and Emptiness.

Furthermore,
the merits accumulated by those who study the true Dao
are inconceivable.
True Dharma companions,
now hidden, now revealed,
transforming empty space,
appearing and disappearing as circumstances require.
Sometimes born in the Dharma-realm,
in the palace of the Wheel-Turning King,
possessing great wisdom and power,
attaining the unborn,
realizing the name of the Dao,
entering the stage of non-retreat,
practicing purity.
For five hundred kalpas,
they expound the scriptures and teach the Dharma,
lecturing day and night,
discoursing on their meaning,
yet never exhausting it.
You should know that from this point onward,
for hundreds of thousands of kalpas,
those who cultivate thus
shall reach the realm of non-action,
without thought, without reflection,
entering emptiness and wisdom,
free from all conceptions.
From the highest to the lowest,
they bow at the feet of the Dao,
perceiving the seventy-two marks,
fully grasping the intent of the Dao,
their spiritual wisdom boundless,
like empty space,
unfathomable.

Furthermore,
the prince abandoned his body to seek the Dao.
His parents, filled with pity,
feared he would flee,
so they adorned terraces and ponds,
fortifying every place.
They secured a great gate,
called the Hundredfold Gate of Luminous Dharma.
When the prince departed,
the great king would know—
secrecy was impossible.
Once the prince had gone,
they searched everywhere,
their minds bewildered and distressed,
rushing about in all directions.
What method could they devise to find him?
On the road, they encountered five mighty ghost-spirits of the five paths.
At that very moment,
they questioned them, saying:
“Venerable ones,
I wish to seek the Dao.
I have heard that the adornments of the various paths are wondrous indeed.”

I now ask this with such intent: which Way may I follow?

At that moment, the five mighty ghost-spirits of the five paths suddenly replied: “In times past, I too once left the household life. Yet entangled in the net of doubt, the four Māras assailed me, and I lost the root of the Way, becoming what I am now—not human.

Now I have come to know and reveal all good and evil. As for your seeking the Way, I have heard of it: the supreme, correct, and true One—though only its name is heard—possesses boundless virtue. Though without form or appearance, its mark is serene and unobstructed, the supreme Dharma. Its true nature is unshaken, its majesty vast, subduing toil and enmity. Its responsive transformations are boundless, inconceivable—such is the wondrous power of the Way.”

Then the prince spoke no further and departed. With true heart and right mindfulness, he naturally understood the Dharma, entered the source and flow of the Way, and ever abided in its singular flavor. The ocean of emptiness, the Dharma-earth, stood firm and unshaken. He understood the Dharma as neither empty nor not empty.

“Good man, the treasury of wisdom in the ocean of emptiness—all suffering is inconceivable. I observe the gods as they wander everywhere and see the people: men and women whose mouths and faces fester with pus and flowing foul blood, whose necks are like twisted cloth, whose bellies swell like hanging drums. They bear iron staves, hold fire in their mouths, drag one another through mud and ashes, no longer human in form. Their feet tread upon blades, their bodies bear iron staves—pain too heavy to endure, poison too cruel to bear. How sorrowful!

Again I see men and women with ox-heads and beast-bodies, their tongues pulled out and pierced with iron awls. Mighty celestial enforcers beat them ceaselessly with iron staves, their forms no longer human. Their feet stand upon knife-mountains—pain beyond endurance.

Again I see men and women naked and unclothed, swallowing fire and eating coals, burned by flames. Their heads and faces are scorched, their bodies rotting. They wear iron cauldrons on their heads and tread upon mountains of fire.

Again I see men and women, young and old, plunged into cauldrons of boiling water, their bodies stewed in a hundred poisons poured over them. Their heads and feet are shackled, their bodies tormented. Imprisoned in dark dungeons, they see no sun, moon, or stars. Their forms are shorn and severed, bound in iron chains. They bear mountains and carry stones, walking back and forth upon beds of iron needles, unable to rest day or night. They embrace copper pillars while beasts of Mount Tai devour their flesh.”

Then the Way spoke: “What crimes did these beings commit? What unwholesome deeds led to such retribution?”

At that time, the flying devas of the three realms replied: “Such are the various sinners. In former lives, they committed every evil: red-tongued strife, unceasing conflict, slander of morality, attacks upon teachers and masters, mutual defamation. Some killed without principle, thought nothing of sentient beings, practiced cruelty and tyranny, harbored dark malice, envied those superior to themselves, suppressed the worthy and wise. They committed every kind of offense—too many to recount. Thus they now face these sufferings, enduring them for ten thousand kalpas, destined to be reborn among non-humans. Such is the consequence.”

The Way said: “Let these suffering men and women open their hearts and eyes, repent their good and evil, and attain tranquility. With gentle words, comfort them. Remind them of their past deeds and urge them to think of goodness, to enter the wheel of Dharma. Exhort them again with warnings, that they may be reborn among humans. Through the merit of understanding and practice, cultivate this Way to resolve past enmities, the boundless source of transgressions. Contemplate and practice the conduct of the Way, widely open the gate of Dharma, and establish great merit. When all practices are perfected, enter the gate of blessings, behold the great causes and conditions, the fruit of non-action. Attain extinction and liberation, and reach the truth of the Way.”

Then the Heavenly Worthy spoke again in verse:

The eye of conditions sees all—
beings human and non-human,
creating external forms,
each taking them as kin.

The mind delights in this,
thinking of sentient beings,
uttering false and ornate speech,
evil scolding, two-tongued words,
greed, anger, and deluded minds,
clinging to perverse views,
stealing, killing, and lust—
heavenly spirits do not honor them,
defiling the light of sun and moon.

All evils are like this,
various unwholesome deeds—
ghosts destroy their forms.

Arrogant toward all Dharma,
the heart does not believe in the true Way,
harming those who have left the household,
even good men seeking food and clothing without limit.

Perpetrating lawless acts,
acting against Dharma,
ghosts swiftly assail them,
good spirits do not protect.
All enmities gather,
vying to destroy their bodies.

They cannot grow old,
like barren grain.
Sounds, forms, and the five flavors—
the mind clings to them.

Believing in perverse people,
never thinking of the Way,
only practicing unwholesome deeds—
truly inconceivable.

You good men,
in the ten directions of the great earth,
where blessings and virtue abound,
there are no obstructions.
Where blessings and virtue abound,
all thoughts, great and small, are equal.

Liberating boundless suffering,
like frost meeting scorching heat.
Such is the power of wisdom—
nothing to cling to or attach to.

Attachment makes gods and humans,
eight in pursuit, one in return.
Entering and exiting neither being nor non-being,
transformations without bound.

Without a discriminating mind,
possessing all-embracing wisdom,
liberating sentient beings,
equalizing right and wrong.

Those who do not believe in causes and conditions
see success and failure through endless kalpas.
Bound by the six senses,
they know not the conditions of liberation.

Among thousands and ten thousands,
rarely is there one
who, if they cultivate mindfulness,
is truly a seed of the Way.

One should arouse various minds,
wishing to comprehend past events,
the great causes and conditions of the future.

Countless good and evil beings,
understanding past principles,
principles in the Dharma of skillful means,
boundless and infinite multitudes.

Within the realm of the great Way,
able to discern unobstructed matters,
able to accomplish all Dharma.”

Grasping the meaning of the Three Powers,
penetrating the marks of all dharmas,
without any place of obstruction,
the mind delights in practicing the Way,
and hears the supreme matters.

When all sages expound the Dharma,
one should attain eloquent speech.
With the six practices, the mind can advance;
one should aspire to attain purity.

Able to relinquish all forms,
with equal and compassionate mind,
for all suffering beings,
I am one who is destitute.
And within the five paths,
enduring all matters with forbearance,
diligent in unstained dharmas,
contemplating concentration without retrogression,
not giving rise to the four perverse intentions.

Thought after thought is the Dharma-wheel,
able to endure unrighteousness,
I harbor no resentment,
guarding virtue in the world.
Not desiring the desires of others,
with reasoned forbearance and no contention;
far removed from worldly afflictions,
concealing oneself in secluded places;
not violating the harmony of mind and mouth,
conduct not transgressing sutras and precepts.

Day and night one should practice the Way,
amidst the five foods, always with vegetables,
mixed food without relishing taste.
Delighting in the heart of pine and cypress groves,
only thinking of consuming myriad medicines,
the mind not gazing upon perverse sights.

The various boundless sufferings
of this afflicted world—
in future lives, good daughters and sons,
born into the world committing various evils,
shall fall into the great hells,
dying and transmigrating within the five paths,
exhausting their lives in retribution,
their bodies embracing bronze pillars,
hands and feet treading upon knife mountains,
forever circling amidst sword trees,
then again entering cauldrons of boiling water,
when hungry, swallowing fire,
faces and heads all scorched.

In the heavenly and human realms,
there will be no more causes and conditions.
In hells and among hungry ghosts,
boundless afflictions,
forever abiding in suffering.

In future lives, men and women
who do not awaken to the conditions of deliverance,
diligent in seeking superior power,
sacrificing the body as the Dao-ground—
as spoken in this sutra,
the profound practices,
without any falsehood.

In past kalpas and the present kalpa,
there has never been such discourse.
You all should revere with devotion,
witnessing these rare matters.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy, having spoken the gāthā, again addressed Haikong Zhizang, saying: “Good son, you and the present assembly, regarding such matters—boundless afflictions, the eight difficulties interwoven, various poisons, most terrifying—all sentient beings do not arouse the mind of the Way, do not generate the intention for the Way, do not practice the four immeasurables, are perverse and contrary, forever losing causes and conditions, not encountering the Three Treasures, not hearing the essential Dharma, not hearing the Dharma-drum, not hearing the secret treasury of Haikong Zhizang. When you attain these matters, in future worlds widely propagate them; those who have not seen or heard, all should be made to understand and awaken. Having understood and awakened, they shall enter non-retrogression, the Great Vehicle of non-action, arriving at the Palace of Longevity, the foremost and supreme cause, difficult to compare even with a wall’s inscription.”

Haikong Zhizang rose from his seat, approached before the Dao, prostrated with five limbs touching the ground, his heart joyful and delighted, his mind filled with emptiness: “Today, I have heard words and gāthās that in ten million kalpas have never been uttered. Within these few words, I have now heard and received, gaining much understanding and awakening. In an instant, Haikong Zhizang attained the inconceivable.”

Then, there were boundless and infinite true and good light-forms; the Great Wisdom Youths descended from the sky to the seat, all desiring to augment Zhizang’s merit and virtue, foremost in wisdom. Their names were: Universal King Superior Practice Youth, Three Heavens Perfected Superior Practice Youth, Great One Superior Practice Youth, Four Immeasurables Wondrous Light Superior Practice Youth, Universal Practice Equal King Superior Practice Youth, Five Eyes Penetrating Immortal Superior Practice Youth, Solemn Pure Moon Virtue Superior Practice Youth, Six Virtues Universal Light Superior Practice Youth, Sunlight Treasure Accumulation Superior Practice Youth, Flower Light Good Karma Superior Practice Youth, Heavenly King Wondrous Fragrance Superior Practice Youth—such assemblies as these, boundless great beings, arrived at the seat, rejoicing and praising, bowing at the honored one’s feet.

At that time, there were devas from the Formless Realm descending from below, their names being: Bright Court Rosy Transcendence Realm Heavenly Emperor’s Son, Profound Penetration Primordial Cavern Realm Heavenly Emperor’s Son, Flourishing Honor Wondrous Achievement Realm Heavenly Emperor’s Son, Elegant Joy Forbidden Above Realm Heavenly Emperor’s Son—these four directional heavenly sons, hearing this wondrous sound, each led their realm’s men and women, good and faithful, to listen to the One Vehicle’s Haikong Secret Treasury. Though there were men and women, there was no intercourse; coming and going, they were free and at ease, without desire, arriving at my place. Their bodies were tall and large, desiring to hear these rare discourses, the profound Dharma, attaining the turning of the Dharma-ground, the unobstructed place, liberation and purity, coming and going, uniting with the true Dao.

At that time, there were also devas from the Form Realm descending from below, their names being: Empty Transcendence Balance Realm Heavenly Emperor’s Son, Supreme Ultimate Veiled Darkness Realm Heavenly Emperor’s Son, Vermilion Bright Harmonious Yang Realm Heavenly Emperor’s Son, Mysterious Bright Reverent Splendor Realm Heavenly Emperor’s Son, Radiant Bright Ancestral Whirl Realm Heavenly Emperor’s Son, Bamboo Grove August Reed Realm Heavenly Emperor’s Son, Empty Bright Hall Illumination Realm Heavenly Emperor’s Son, Observing Bright Upright Tranquility Realm Heavenly Emperor’s Son, Mysterious Bright Reverent Celebration Realm Heavenly Emperor’s Son, Supreme Flaming Ultimate Jade Realm Heavenly Emperor’s Son, Primordial Carriage Cavity Ascent Realm Heavenly Emperor’s Son, Supreme Peace August Cliff Realm Heavenly Emperor’s Son, Manifest Concentration Ultimate Wind Realm Heavenly Emperor’s Son, Beginning Yellow Filial Awn Realm Heavenly Emperor’s Son, Supreme August Grandfather Heavy Realm Heavenly Emperor’s Son, No-Thought River Origin Realm Heavenly Emperor’s Son, Upper Gambling Joy Realm Heavenly Emperor’s Son, Boundless Cloud Vow Realm Heavenly Emperor’s Son—such realm’s people and their ministers arrived at my place, expounding the true power of supreme wisdom in due time. This realm reveres and practices the unobstructed Dharma, erects the great Dharma-banner, inconceivable. Hearing these wondrous matters, they scattered incense and formed bonds, forever severing perverse desires, without afflictions, not entering the thousand poisons of birth and death.

At that time, there were also devas from the Desire Realm, who likewise all came.

Their names were Heavenly Son of August Layered Heaven, Heavenly Son of Jade Perfection, Heavenly Son of Youthful Harmony, Heavenly Son of Level Nurturance, Heavenly Son of Primordial Luminance, and Heavenly Son of Serene Radiance. The people of their realms were largely incomplete, beset by boundless suffering and afflictions, sinking into the cycles of birth and death, torn by love and hatred, partings and enmities, malicious slayings—matters beyond conception. Yet if any turned wholeheartedly to hear the Dao, distance mattered not.

Now I expound for them the One Vehicle’s Ocean-Empty Secret Treasury, delivering all realm-dwellers according to their capacities, guiding them step by step to awakening, ensuring none regress, all attaining peace. Ministers, officials, and common folk alike gain unobstructed freedom, abiding in the joyous Dao-ground. Now proclaiming these Dharmas, ever of one taste, I enable all worlds to cultivate gradually, each attaining the Dao-fruit.

At that time, the Heavenly Venerable further spoke in verse:

The Ocean-Empty Wisdom Treasury,
The Dao’s greatness—beyond compare.
Heaven and earth, the four seas,
Insufficient as metaphor.

Without end, without beginning,
True One’s wondrous principle,
Neither increasing nor decreasing,
Without cause, without learning,
Without present, without past.

The Great Dao is non-doing,
Its depths unfathomable.
For sentient beings,
There is constant coming and going;
Though there is coming and going,
Yet no coming or going—
Inconceivable,
Its profound origin, its subtlety.

You, my retinue,
With tranquil, unified minds,
Contemplate the Dao,
The supreme, correct, and true.
Harmonious in suffering and joy,
Emptiness and non-emptiness.

The Ocean-Empty Wisdom Treasury,
Supreme immortal,
Forever severs the net of doubt,
Like extracting a poisoned arrow,
Attaining fearlessness.

The Heavenly Venerable now expounds,
Distinguishing for the assembly.
All present bow in reverence,
Unfailing.

Future beings,
Let not the four perversities arise.
Whether man or woman,
Abandoning the body to seek the Dao,
No longer clinging to bodily existence,
Ceasing all desires,
Rectifying the mind in the Dao-ground,
Extinguishing conditioned thoughts,
Without origin.

Those who practice the profound Dharma
Shall know no affliction.
They shall attain wisdom,
Adamantine virtue.

All in the great assembly,
Universally practicing the Dao’s work,
Attain the Lion of Kings,
Great compassion’s parable.
The numinous treasure’s insight,
Mindful deliverance without measure,
Augmenting adornment.

Having cultivated mindfulness,
They shatter evil, fear, and demons,
Subduing weariness and resentment,
Abiding in constant joy, self, purity,
Gaining fearless power.

Good men and good women,
In such matters,
Not conditioned by form’s arising,
Recognizing this as “name,”
Not perceiving form,
The five aggregates purified,
Thus ever unstained,
Pure and liberated.

All Dharmas
Arise from causes and conditions,
Yet possess no dual nature.

Contemplate the boundless,
The limitless divine wisdom,
Honoring it as supreme.

Those who leave home in understanding and practice
Attain true liberation.
The so-called practitioner
Is like earth, like mountains,
Like eyes, like clouds,
Like father, like mother.
All Dharmas are likewise.

Unshaken,
This is called understanding and practice.

Perfected beings and youths
Expound in manifold ways,
Yet never sated.
Joyous speech is unobstructed,
Boundless, measureless.
For countless kalpas,
Expounding words and meanings,
Never exhausted.

Sons and daughters of men,
For a thousand kalpas,
Cultivating worldly Dharmas,
Through such cultivation,
Unobstructed in Dharma,
Further, for boundless
Hundreds of thousands of kalpas,
Accumulating discourses,
Thus attaining joyous speech.

Perfected beings and youths,
To deliver sentient beings,
Cultivate thus the four unobstructed Dharmas,
The wisdom of unobstruction.

Middle-grade practitioners
Cultivate the Dharma of quiescence,
Delighting in solitude.
When transforming beings,
They manifest only spiritual powers,
Remaining silent all day,
Expounding nothing.

Ultimately pure,
The Ocean-Empty Wisdom Treasury,
Foremost in wisdom.
Immortal ministers and youths,
Foremost in spiritual powers.

Such matters are unequal:
Originally present, now absent;
Originally absent, now present.
Ancient and modern Dharmas
Are thus declared.

Now I shall again expound for you,
Broadly distinguishing and explaining.

Good men and women,
Now possessing
The bonds of afflictions,
Originally born of parents’ union.

Thus, in the present,
There is no adamantine,
Subtle Dharma-body.

Formerly, I possessed
Impermanence, no-self,
No-joy, no-purity.
Because of impermanence,
No-self, no-joy, no-purity,
What is present now is absent.

The supreme Dao-mind,
Because of non-perception,
Lacks impermanence, joy, purity.

If there are Daoists
Who speak or do not speak,
Whether men or women,
Who claim:
“The Heavenly Venerable’s supreme Dao,
Free in coming and going,
Impermanent wondrous joy,
Is my purity”—
This is impossible.

For this reason,
The present cannot
Destroy the four demons;
The present is ultimately empty,
Defiled in all Dharmas.

If my disciples,
Dull-rooted,
Cannot expound
The One Vehicle’s Dharma,
Originally lacking sharp roots,
Kings of men among elephants,
Perfected beings of wondrous practice,
Equal in no-self roots—
According to circumstances,
They reveal the Three Vehicles.

All learners
Who claim:
“The supreme Dao,
In past, present, or future,
Ultimately expounds
Non-doing”—
This is impossible.
They speak according to time and circumstance.

If beings
Cannot attain this,
The primary condition:
The divine, wondrous Dao
Ultimately has no expounding,
Nothing to be gained.

At that time, Ocean-Empty Wisdom Treasury,
Having received this wondrous matter,
Opened his mind and understood,
All becoming perfectly clear.
His body grew vast,
Adorned with seventy-two marks,
Eighty-one excellences,
Without root or foundation.
The profound, subtle, non-doing,
Supreme power of Wisdom Treasury
Filled him with boundless joy,
And he spoke in verse:

Great compassion pities sentient beings,
Thus now I take refuge.
Skillfully extracting the poisoned arrow,
Hence called the Great Physician King.
Worldly physicians’ treatments,
Though healed, relapse.
The Heavenly Venerable’s cure
Is ultimately never reborn.

The Heavenly Venerable’s sweet-dew medicine
Is bestowed upon sentient beings.
Once beings have partaken,
They neither live nor die.

The Heavenly Venerable now for me
Expounds the great wisdom.
Beings who hear this secret treasury
Attain the unborn and undying,
Body and mind both at peace,
Clearly beholding the City of Ocean-Empty.

Having spoken this verse, Ocean-Empty Wisdom Treasury again addressed the Dao, saying: “Heavenly Venerable, what has now been expounded—all in the world neither know nor perceive it, yet those who see the True Person can know, see, and perceive it. If the True Person were of the world, one could not say the world does not know, does not know or perceive. Yet if not of the world, what distinguishing marks does the True Person possess?”

“Moreover, good son, the True Person is both of the world and not of the world. What do you mean when you say the True Person has distinctions? Reflect carefully. I shall explain further for you—wait but a moment, and I will expound its meaning separately. This is not the day to exhaustively speak all that can be said or fully express its intent. I will now tell you, one by one, the profound roots of the Dao. You should comprehend and awaken to the singular condition.”

Thereupon, Ocean-Empty Wisdom Treasury and the entire assembly each bowed once, took their leave, and withdrew.

*End of Scroll Seven of the Supreme One Vehicle Ocean-Empty Wisdom Treasury Sutra*

*Scroll Eight of the Supreme One Vehicle Ocean-Empty Wisdom Treasury Sutra*

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy dwelt in the Great Jeweled City, expounding the essentials of the Dharma for all sentient beings. There was an elder who resided in the western part of the city, devout in faith and offerings, named Good-Seed Great King. Together with thirty-three of his kind, they served as great bridges and beams for the world, relinquishing their bodies and forsaking their wealth. Rising from their seats, they bowed in reverence, prostrated with their heads to the ground, and knelt to gaze up at the Heavenly Worthy, tears of sorrow streaming down. They addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “We only pray that the Heavenly Worthy and all Daoist masters will compassionately accept our humble offerings of the poor, so as to deliver the immeasurable hosts of heavenly beings. Greatly Compassionate Heavenly Worthy, we now have no lord, no kin, no savior, no protector, no refuge, no destination—poor, hungry, and destitute. We seek from the Heavenly Worthy the food of the future. We only pray that you will compassionately accept our meager offerings, so that all beings—whether human or non-human—who receive our offerings may attain peace and happiness. Thereafter, the Heavenly Worthy will return to the realm of non-action, to the quiescent and unmoving ground of stillness and extinction. Our offerings now are like those in all lands who, through diligent farming, obtain great oxen and level fields free of mounds, wastelands, brambles, thorns, and poisonous grasses. Such good fields await only the rain from heaven. Greatly Compassionate Heavenly Worthy, our bodies are just the same—we await only the sweet dew of the One Vehicle’s Dharma-rain to nourish the fields of our bodies. We, poor and destitute, beseech the Heavenly Worthy, our father of great compassion, to take pity and remove our poverty, distress, and suffering, and to rescue the immeasurable multitudes of beings from their afflictions. We now make these offerings, praying that the Great Compassion will equally bestow sufficiency upon all—whether human or non-human—and that all heavenly immortals and the great assembly may gain great benefit and abide in constant peace and joy.”

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy, with a heart of great compassion and wisdom of many kinds, addressed Good-Seed, saying: “Excellent, excellent, good son, Great King and Elder! I shall now remove for you the notions of poverty, hunger, thirst, and exhaustion. The rain of the Great Compassion’s Dharma shall nourish the fields of your bodies, and the sprouts of the Dharma shall grow. If you seek from me longevity, peace of body and mind, and boundless eloquence, I shall grant you longevity and peace, all without obstruction. Why is this? Good-Seed Elder, your offerings are pure and equal toward all. Such giving yields a karmic reward without distinction. What does it mean to be equal, without distinction? First, upon receiving, one abides in the treasury of the One Vehicle. Second, upon receiving, one returns to the quiescent ground of the spirit’s stillness and extinction. I now accept your earnest offerings and bestow upon you the complete treasury of the secret and wondrous One Vehicle Ocean-Empty.”

Thereupon, Good-Seed Great King and Elder advanced, knelt, and prostrated, addressing the Heavenly Worthy: “As the Venerable One has said, the karmic reward of equality is without distinction—this is what we ourselves have reflected upon. Yet this principle is not so. Why is this?”

"If there are beings who first receive offerings—while their afflictions remain unexhausted, their omniscience not yet perfected, and they have not yet enabled all beings to fully attain the treasury of the One Vehicle—then those who subsequently receive offerings have extinguished all afflictions, already realized the secret and wondrous Ocean-Empty treasury of the One Vehicle, and can universally enable all beings to fully attain the equal One Vehicle, the constant bliss of purity. The former recipients partake of impure food; their bodies, bound by afflictions, are bodies of birth-and-death, impermanent bodies, hungry ghost bodies. The latter recipients are bodies of wisdom, adamantine bodies, true bodies, Dharma bodies, bodies of constant bliss. Given such distinctions, how can you speak of the One Vehicle as equal, its karmic reward without difference?

Now, when the Venerable One receives offerings first, having partaken, they enter the belly and are digested, sustaining life, enhancing complexion, and bringing constant, enduring bliss, with boundless eloquence. Yet those who receive offerings later partake of impure, mixed food, devoid of superior fruits. How then can you say their karmic reward is without difference?"

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy addressed Good-Seed: "Elder, Great King, good son, as for those like me who partake—since limitless, boundless kalpas ago, we have had no body of food, no body of birth-and-death, no body of afflictions, no body of poisonous craving. My body is the constant body; your body is the constant body; the adamantine body. Among all beings who will receive offerings later, they have not yet seen my body—it is a body of afflictions, a body mixed with craving, a body of birth-and-death, a hungry ghost body. Yet for these four assemblies, whether human or non-human, I partake equally with them. Once the food is consumed equally, upon its digestion, they immediately perceive my form abiding in the treasury of the One Vehicle. Therefore, I say the karmic reward is without difference.

If beings shatter worldly dharmas, universally eradicate the four Māras, and enter the Ocean-Empty treasury of the One Vehicle, for this reason, I say the karmic reward is without distinction. If there are good people who, though not broadly expounding all scriptures, have already fully realized the secret and wondrous Ocean-Empty treasury of the One Vehicle and extensively explain it to beings for their discernment, their merit is boundless. Therefore, I say the karmic reward is without difference.

Good son, beings like me—since limitless, boundless kalpas ago—have not partaken of the mixed food, mixed forms, or mixed appearances of the world. For the sake of beings, I speak of receiving offerings, just as those highest perfected ones receive garlands and only afterward return to the quiescent ground. I now do likewise: receiving your offerings, I shall then return to the secret and wondrous Dharma ground of the Ocean-Empty One Vehicle. I now receive offerings, yet truly do not receive offerings; I now receive a body, yet truly do not receive a body; I now praise, yet truly do not praise; I now expound, yet truly do not expound. For the sake of this great assembly, I thus receive your equal offerings—yet truly do not receive them."

Thereupon, the four assemblies, having heard the Heavenly Worthy speak thus, understood that he compassionately accepted the offerings of the impoverished Elder Good-Seed Great King on their behalf. Then the four assemblies prostrated, touching their heads to the ground, rejoicing and exclaiming in unison: "Excellent! Excellent! The Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy, out of pity for us, has accepted these offerings—how rare! How rare! Excellent! Excellent! The name you bear is not in vain. To be called 'Good-Seed' is to embody wondrous meaning. You now establish such wholesome dharmas, sowing seeds that flow through the three realms. Thus, in truth, your name is derived from goodness—you are Good-Seed. Great King, you now gain great benefit in this present life, your merit and vows fulfilled, your depth fully realized. Good-Seed Great King, your birth among humans and gods is most rare! Excellent, Good-Seed—beyond conception!

In this present life, to follow the Great Compassionate Worthy as he traverses other realms is also most difficult to encounter, as is the faith in the Dharma that inspires such offerings. This wholesome cause and condition, this offering born of faith, can yield sweet fruit—this too is rare."

Then the great assembly, with one mind, prostrated, knelt, and addressed Good-Seed: "Your wisdom now shines like the full moon, free of clouds. All beings in your realm gaze upon you without exception. Just so, you are the one upon whom we four assemblies gaze. The Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy has accepted your offerings, and now you have fully attained great merit, the secret and wondrous Ocean-Empty treasury of the One Vehicle. Therefore, we say your light is like the full moon, and all beings in your realm—whether great or small, old or young—gaze upon you without exception. Though you bear a body, it is an adamantine body, an adamantine mind. Good-Seed Great King, you are the seed of the Three Jewels’ wisdom, the protector who upholds the flow of the Dharma."

Thereupon, the four assemblies rejoiced and exclaimed in verse:
*"Excellent, Good-Seed King,
Compassionate father of the world,
Though born in the human realm,
You transcend the three realms’ existence.
We and all beings now bow our heads in reverence.
Great Compassionate Worthy of the three realms,
Now return to your original abode.
May you pity us,
And swiftly consent to remain,
Lingering long in the world,
Benefiting all beings,
Expounding the city of wisdom’s treasury,
Universally showering the rain of sweet dew."*

Thereupon, Elder Good-Seed Great King, having heard these words, rejoiced: "Excellent! Excellent! What I have heard is like one whose parents, thought dead, suddenly revive, restored to their former state. My joy now is likewise. What I have heard is like a poor man encountering a golden vase. My joy now is likewise. It is like one weakened by loss, wandering in a foreign land, parted from parents and homeland, long separated by love and affection—then suddenly reunited, seeing their homeland again, parents and siblings, filled with great joy. My joy now is likewise."

Then Good-Seed rose from his seat and spoke in verse:

"Excellent! I have gained great benefit,
Universally benefiting all beings,
Severing the afflictions of the Three Poisons,
Forever departing the Three Wretched Realms.

Encountering the great benefit of the Dharma,
All protect this vajra-body.
Meeting the Primordial Honored One,
I fear not falling into the beastly realm.

Like the jeweled city in the empty sea,
Rare to see, rare to hear.
Having seen it, I plant the roots of goodness,
Forever departing the hungry ghost realm.

Attaining entry among the Four Peoples,
Together receiving the light of compassion.
Rare indeed, most rare—
The Great Compassionate Honored One who appears in the world,
Whose body and mind are perfect in wisdom,
Delivering humans and non-humans alike.

Rare indeed, most rare—
The Great Honored One who appears in this age of decline,
Whose body emerges like the lotus,
Adorned with subtle and wondrous marks of virtue.
Severing the ailments of the conditioned,
Forever transcending the day of death.

To be born in this world is difficult,
To encounter a teacher is even more so.
Like the waters of the great sea,
Once cast adrift, return is harder still.

I now offer this devotion,
Wishing to attain the supreme fruit,
Shattering all knots of affliction,
Leaving none unbroken.
In this realm, I seek not
The Heaven of Heavens.
Through skillful means, I gain great benefit,
My heart harboring no regret.

May the Compassionate Honored One accept my offering,
My joy boundless and eternal.
Like the great lion
Emerging from the celestial jeweled forest,
My body is as the lion’s—
The Honored One of Decline accepts my offering,
Emerging from the celestial jeweled forest.
Thus, I rejoice.

My heart is like the lotus within the lotus,
A pure and subtle flower.
All the heavenly youths
Come together to serve and attend me.
The people of this world and land
Are all beset by great suffering.
Having known the Great Compassionate Honored One,
You shall soon return to your original abode—
The realm of neither death nor birth,
The compassionate father beyond the world.

With resonant voices, all chant in unison:
‘In this world, there is no compassionate father.
From birth, none can be relied upon,
Alone and exposed, without refuge.’
Wiping their tears, they bow and plead for you to stay.

We only beseech the Great Compassionate Honored One
To remain long in the world,
Universally expounding the supreme path
For all Daoists.
Like that city of seven treasures,
Abiding steadfast in the sea,
With wisdom, you skillfully sever,
And we, enlightened, dwell in light without darkness.

Like the great radiant light
Shining upon the vaidūrya gem,
With this wondrous and excellent light,
Universally dispel all afflictions,
Forever melting them away.

O Great Compassionate and Great Merciful Honored One,
How can you return to your original place?
We, all sentient beings,
Are overcome with longing and sorrow,
Gazing upon you with tears of grief,
Flowing like rivers.
We only beseech the Great Compassionate Honored One
To remain long, strengthening our faith,
Severing the delusions of affliction,
Skillfully expounding the bridge of Dharma."

Thereupon, the Heavenly Honored One, having heard these verses, addressed Good-Seed Elder Great King: "Excellent! Excellent! Good son, it is just as you have said. My appearance in this world is most difficult, most difficult. Why is this so? The Jeweled City in the Empty Sea is hard to see, hard to enter; even to encounter it and generate faith is most difficult. I shall now return to the realm of non-action. That you can serve as a bridge, offering sustenance to beings, and perfect the subtle and wondrous marks of virtue—this, too, is most difficult. Good-Seed, do not grieve so deeply. Be at peace and rejoice, deeply celebrating the great benefit of the Dharma you have attained. Your offering today has accomplished merit, perfecting the single vehicle of the Jeweled Treasury of the Empty Sea. You should not beseech me to remain long in the world. You must understand: the Three Clarities’ realm is momentary and impermanent. The nature and characteristics of all dharmas are likewise—like shadows following form, now present, now gone. How can you ask me to remain in the world?

I observe myself—even I am empty;
Because I am empty, others are also empty;
Because others are empty, this is called ‘emptiness of emptiness.’"

Then the Heavenly Honored One, moved by great compassion, spoke in verse:

"All dharmas born in the world,
Those born must return to transformation.
Lifespan is like empty space,
It must come to an end.
Prosperity and decline have their time,
Union and parting are inevitable.
Youth and strength do not abide,
Each moment swiftly passes.
Life is the cause of death,
Four Māras, four illnesses afflict.
The constant and inconstant—do they endure?
Loved ones and strangers alike depart.
Suffering turns without end,
Flowing ceaselessly.
The Three Realms are all impermanent,
All conditioned things are without abode.
Even the Dao is empty and nonexistent,
All is utterly empty.
How can one cling to the turning of the Dharma,
Ever beset by sorrow and affliction?
Fearful of sins and evils,
Aging, sickness, death, and decline.
Amidst these afflictions,
One is also assailed by enmity.
Bound by afflictions,
Like a silkworm in its cocoon—
What wise being
Could delight in such a state?
This body is an assemblage of suffering,
All dharmas are impure.
All desires are impermanent,
Thus, I do not cling to them.
Departing desire, contemplating wisely,
One clarifies the Jeweled Treasury of the Empty Sea.
Ultimately bright and pure,
Forever free from calamity.
I ride the ship of the Empty Sea,
Surely reaching the other shore."

Thereupon, Elder Good-Seed Great King, having heard these verses, rose and bowed, addressing the Heavenly Honored One: "So it is, just as you have said. I am foolish and dull-witted, my wisdom shallow, like a blind moth—how could I fathom the profound meaning of the single-vehicle Jeweled Treasury? Now, together with the heavenly sages, perfected immortals, divine youths, dragon kings, and all my retinue, I have departed afflictions and attained ordination. Though I have not yet perfected the precepts of the single-vehicle emptiness, I have already fallen into the rank of immortals. Likewise, though I lack great wisdom, I have entered the royal station. By the majestic power of the Great Compassionate Heavenly Honored One, I am unimpeded in understanding—this is the mark of a great sage. Therefore, I now beseech the Great Compassionate Heavenly Honored One to remain long in the world, not to return your spirit to the realm of non-action. We are like thirsty ones who, having tasted the sweet dew, could never reject its flavor. We only pray that the Heavenly Honored One will abide and expound, just as before—remaining in the world, pouring forth the sweet dew and the flavor of the single-vehicle Dharma, enabling us to hear what we have never heard, see what we have never seen, and accomplish the secret Jeweled Treasury of the Empty Sea."

At that time, among the assembly there was a perfected one named Dharma Joy, who addressed Good Seed, saying: "Excellent, Good Seed, elder and great king, you ought not utter such words, beseeching the Heavenly Honored One to remain forever in the world. Why is this? You should know that all conditioned things are impermanent, empty of self-nature, empty of abiding marks, with nature and marks both void. Contemplate the three realms—past, present, and future are all empty. You should understand that to seek abiding in the world is to study this truth."

Thereupon, Good Seed, smiling, asked in reply: "Dharma Joy, wise one, you say the Compassionate Honored One’s conditioned things are impermanent, empty of self-nature, with nature and marks both void, and that contemplating the three realms reveals all three times as empty. Yet you should know: how is it that the Great Compassionate Heavenly Honored One is the most revered and supreme in the heavens and the world? Is not such a mark one of true existence? If it is existent, is it subject to arising and ceasing, or not? If it is subject to arising and ceasing, like bubbles or lightning—swiftly appearing, swiftly vanishing—coming and going in flux, like a turning wheel, then all conditioned things are likewise. Yet I have heard that the Heavenly Honored One’s lifespan is vast and distant, at ease and free, eternally abiding in purity, the Heaven among heavens, the Immortal among immortals. How then can you say the Great Compassionate One’s lifespan is brief, not even a hundred years? Like a radiant king who attains sovereign power—by virtue of that sovereignty, he can restrain others."

The wealthy man shall later become poor and lowly, despised and discarded by others, made to serve as another’s drudge. Why is this? Because he has lost his power and strength. The Great Compassionate Heavenly Honored One is likewise. If he were the same as all conditioned things, he could not be called the Heaven among heavens, the Immortal among immortals. Why? Because all conditioned things are subject to arising and ceasing, bound to birth and death. Those of dharma-joy and wisdom, do not observe the Compassionate Honored One as identical to all conditioned existence and claim he is impermanent.

Furthermore, I ask: O you of dharma-joy and wisdom, do you know the Heavenly Honored One and thus speak these words? Or do you not know the Heavenly Honored One and yet utter such speech? If the Great Compassionate One were the same as all conditioned things, then being conditioned, he would not be imperishable—how then could he be divine? If the Heavenly Honored One were the same as all conditioned things, he could not be called the Great Compassionate Heavenly Honored One, the Heaven among heavens, the Immortal among immortals. It is like the Dharma King of the three realms below, who possesses a great warrior capable of defeating enemies and foreign adversaries. When battle is joined, among the ranks of soldiers there suddenly appears one man whose strength equals a thousand. Thus, all foreign enemies submit without exception. For this reason, this great king is said to have the strength of a thousand. Such a warrior is cherished by the king, who bestows upon him treasures and emoluments, grants him rank and recompense, and provides him with natural sustenance—a realm of constant joy, peace, and fearlessness. For this reason, he is called one who equals a thousand. Yet this man does not necessarily possess the strength to overcome a thousand; rather, through various skillful means and expedient methods, he is able to surpass the strength of a thousand, and so is called one who equals a thousand.

The Great Compassionate Heavenly Honored One is likewise. He is skilled in extinguishing all afflictions, the demon of defilements, and the demon of birth and death for all beings. For this reason, the Great Compassionate Heavenly Honored One is the Heaven among heavens, the Honored One of the three realms, like that warrior who equals a thousand. Through these causes and conditions, he perfects and fulfills immeasurable, true virtues—the treasury of the One Vehicle, the ocean of emptiness, the secret storehouse.

O you of dharma-joy and wisdom, you should not conceive or discriminate, thinking the Great Compassionate Heavenly Honored One to be the same as all conditioned things. It is like a wealthy king or elder who begets a son. At that time, skilled physiognomists come to examine him and find the mark of short lifespan. Upon hearing this, the parents know he is unfit to inherit the family line and no longer cherish him, regarding him as worthless as straw. If one knows that the lifespan is short, he will no longer be revered by all beings throughout the ten directions and all lands. If the Heavenly Honored One were the same as all conditioned things, he likewise would not be venerated by all beings of the three realms in the world. The Dharma he teaches would not be unchanging, unaltered, true, subtle, and ultimate.

O you of dharma-joy and wisdom, if there are beings who single-mindedly receive and uphold this Dharma, guarding and protecting it, never allowing it to depart from their hearts, day and night dwelling upon it—it is like a destitute woman without parents, whose original dwelling place and protectors are gone. Suddenly afflicted by illness, tormented by hunger and thirst, she wanders begging for food. At another’s house, she gives birth to a child, but the master of the house drives her away. Then, the destitute woman carries her son, intending to go to another land. On the road, she encounters a fierce storm with wind and rain, enduring bitter cold. Carrying her child, she crosses a deep pool with swift currents, yet she does not let go. Thus, mother and child both drown together. Yet by the power of this woman’s compassion, she is reborn in the blissful realm above.

O you of dharma-joy and wisdom, if there is a man or woman who receives and upholds the treasury of the One Vehicle, the ocean of emptiness, guarding it carefully, you should not say whether it is the same as or different from conditioned things. You should only reproach yourself: “I am now foolish and lack the wisdom eye to perceive the inconceivable One Vehicle true Dharma of the Compassionate Honored One. Therefore, I should not propagate or expound it.”

Is the Great Compassionate Heavenly Honored One truly conditioned or unconditioned? If one attains the mind of right view, one should say: The Great Compassionate Heavenly Honored One is definitely the true fruit, constant and blissful, unconditioned. Why? Because he gives rise to wholesome Dharma for beings and engenders love and cherishing. It is like the woman in the fierce storm who, out of love for her child, sacrifices her life and drowns with him. We, too, should be thus: we would rather sacrifice our lives than say the Compassionate Honored One is the same as the conditioned. We should constantly contemplate the Great Compassionate Heavenly Honored One as unconditioned, attaining the treasury of the One Vehicle, the ocean of emptiness. Like that woman who was reborn in the blissful realm above, why? Because of her love for her child.

Now, my love for the Dharma is likewise thus. What is this love for the Dharma? It is to declare that the Great Compassionate Heavenly Honored One is identical with the unconditioned—seeking neither bliss, nor liberation, nor permanence, nor the return of spirit, yet bliss, liberation, and permanence arise of themselves, freely and spontaneously. Just as that woman sought not the blissful realm above, yet heaven came to her of its own accord, so too is my reverence for the Honored One.

Dharma-joyous true ones, it is like a traveler on a distant journey, weary and exhausted along the way, who takes shelter in another’s dwelling. As he lies asleep, suddenly a great fire erupts in the house, flames rising on all sides. Startled awake, he immediately reflects: “Now I shall surely die without doubt.” Stirred by shame and remorse, he wraps himself in his robe, and thus his life ends. Reborn in the realm above, he dwells there for eighty years, then becomes a celestial king for a hundred thousand years, and later descends into the human realm, transforming into a wheel-turning monarch. Never again does he fall into the three evil destinies; the wheel of his rebirth turns ever in blissful realms. For this reason, those who possess shame and remorse should not regard the Great Compassionate Honored One as identical with conditioned phenomena.

Dharma-joyous true ones, the teachers of the lesser vehicle and external paths, those of perverse views, declare that the Great Compassionate Heavenly Honored One is of the world, conditioned and afflicted by defilements. Now, true adepts should not be thus—they should not conceive of the Great Compassionate Heavenly Honored One with thoughts of defilement. If any external teachers or those of perverse views utter falsehoods and various evil words, know that such persons, upon death, will enter hell, suffering in dark confinement for ten thousand kalpas, long submerged in the three paths and five torments.

Dharma-joyous true ones, know that the Honored One is the true reality. He should not today abandon his body and return his spirit, leaving behind his many disciples. Therefore, we gaze upon him with tears, entreating him to remain and expound for us the secret treasury of wisdom of the One Vehicle’s ocean of emptiness, that we may all forsake ignorance and seek the true and right fruit.

Then, the Dharma-joyous ones spoke in unison, praising: “Excellent, good seed! You have now attained a blissful realm, for you rightly know the Compassionate Honored One as eternal and blissful, unchanging and unaltered, having realized the unconditioned Dharma. Moreover, you are able to offer him pure sustenance, inviting him to teach the conditioned Dharma of the world, manifesting the marks of the conditioned. Like the man engulfed in fire who, stirred by shame, wraps himself in his robe and perishes in the flames, by the power of his virtuous mind, he is reborn in the blissful realm above, in a pure land, and later descends to be born as a wheel-turning sage-king, forever removed from evil destinies, dwelling in the city of the ocean of emptiness. You, too, are thus—well guarding the Compassionate Honored One, inviting him to remain and receive offerings. We, the lesser immortals below, shall reap profound benefits, and before long, we shall attain the treasury of the One Vehicle.”

Then, the Heavenly Honored One again addressed the Elder Good Seed and the Great King: “Good son, you are now well able to distinguish the marks of the Dharma, no different from myself. You may swiftly prepare and offer pure sustenance at any time. Among my assembly, there may be flying immortals, devas, noble sages, true ones, youths, earthbound immortals, and Daoists—both men and women—who follow me as I traverse the lands, their divine minds weary and exhausted. Whatever they require, you should provide with pure offerings at the proper time. Such giving is the perfect fulfillment of the city of equality of the One Vehicle’s ocean of emptiness.”

Again, he addressed the Elder Good Seed and the Great King: “If one offers with a mind of perfect equality, whether noble or base, whether much or little, whether sufficient or insufficient, it should be given in due time. Now, I shall return my spirit to the principle of the unconditioned, abiding in the unmoving, quiescent ground of extinction.”

When Good Seed and the assembly heard these words, each clasped their hands, raised their heads, and let out long cries, wailing and lamenting, snapping their fingers so that the sound resounded through the ten directions. Then, all the devas and earth-bound spirits, every forest and tree, mountain and river, valley and hill—whether human or non-human, bird or beast—all joined in mournful cries, weeping and shedding tears without cease.

Then, from among the assembly, an immortal rose from his seat, bowed his head in reverence, wiped his tears, and again prostrated himself, addressing the Heavenly Honored One: “How can you suddenly abandon your original vow, leaving the world bereft and without refuge? And now, as the great king Good Seed makes offerings, how can you return your spirit to the unconditioned? In the past, Heavenly Honored One, you toiled for countless years, enduring the turning of kalpas, dying and being reborn, succeeding and failing, yet you still sustained the taste of wondrous delicacies, offering them equally. Whether human or non-human, all were sated at once. How much more so now, when Good Seed makes his offering, do you speak of returning your spirit? Moreover, you tell Good Seed: ‘You now truly believe that the Great Compassionate Heavenly Honored One receives this offering.’ Is this truly receiving or not receiving? Is this truly a body or not a body? As I reflect, if the Great Compassionate Heavenly Honored One receives this food, it is certainly not receiving food; if he receives this body, it is certainly not receiving a body. Such a body is a body yet not a body; such food is food yet not food. Why then do you all weep and lament without end?”

Then, the Heavenly Honored One addressed the immortal: “So it is, so it is, just as you have said. This body is not a body; this food is not food. Cease your sorrow. Now, I shall return, yet in truth, there is nothing to return. You have already well understood the subtle and wondrous treasury of the One Vehicle’s ocean of emptiness—there is no ‘is’ or ‘is not,’ no thought of love or attachment. Constantly, with the mind of great compassion and equality, one contemplates beings as a mother cherishes her child. Wherever there is a place, one should uphold the One Vehicle’s ocean of emptiness, and one will clearly perceive that my body is not a body, that there is no body at all. It is like the great ocean, whose watery nature is luminous, reflecting the depths so that fish, turtles, dragons, and aquatic creatures are all made visible.”

Just as the great ocean, though its watery nature is without fish, reveals fish through its water, so too am I now without body, yet reveal a body through myself—precisely thus. Then, out of great compassion, the Heavenly Worthy emitted radiance, sending forth from his mouth manifold lights. Their brilliance leapt forth, illuminating all within the fourfold assembly. Once this light had passed, they understood the matter.

The virtuous seed then spoke: “The Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion, in his mercy, has manifested this auspicious sign—these manifold lights, rare and wondrous indeed! Such an event surely portends that soon he will return to the unconditioned Dao.”

“Should you make offerings, reverently serving all beings, whether human or non-human, know this: the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion has emitted his great radiance, illuminating the three realms and the beings of hell. Wherever the light reaches, once it has fully opened, all are overcome with sorrow, falling silent in grief, prostrating and bowing their heads.”

Then the Heavenly Worthy again addressed the elder Virtuous Seed and the great king: “Good son, the offerings you have brought for me and the four assemblies—whether human or non-human—are most fitting for this moment. Now I shall indeed return to the unconditioned principle of the Dao. The bodily form of the past is not something you have seen, nor something you may seek.”

When the elder Virtuous Seed and the great king heard this, they raised their voices in wailing, choked with sorrow and lament: “Alas! Alas! Now we are orphaned, the three realms all empty!” Then, addressing the assembly, they said: “Our children, the Heavenly Worthy’s past bodily form is about to depart the world. Let us all together entreat the Heavenly Worthy.” Thereupon, all the children rose, prostrating themselves fully, and with one voice pleaded: “We beseech the Heavenly Worthy to take pity on us, to remain in the world, and not to speak of departing.”

Then the Heavenly Worthy addressed Virtuous Seed: “Good sons, do not weep so bitterly, scattering your minds. You should know that when you observe this body, it is like a body of great fire, like a body of great wind, like an echo in a valley, like a reflection in water—never at rest for even a moment, like a thread once spun, with no way to trace or continue it. You should contemplate all conditioned things as poisoned food, full of many faults and afflictions.”

Thereupon, Virtuous Seed thought to himself: “The Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion does not wish to remain in the world. He urges us to cease our weeping. His parables and words leave no room for doubt. How then can I not weep? Alas! Alas! The world is empty and void! I beseech the Heavenly Worthy to take pity on his children, to remain long in the world, and not to return to the Dao.”

Then the Heavenly Worthy again addressed the elder Virtuous Seed and the great king: “Good son, you should not speak thus, entreating me to remain long to expound for you the ocean of emptiness of the One Vehicle. Good son, it is out of great compassion that I take pity on you and linger until now to expound the subtle treasury of the One Vehicle’s emptiness. I am always without self. How could there be a self? Why? All dharmas are suffering, empty, without self, and even ‘without self’ is not a self. Because there is no self, it is called ‘my return.’ Virtuous Seed, you and all should contemplate all conditioned dharmas as impure, without self, impermanent, not abiding in this body, full of many faults and afflictions—like bubbles on water, like mirages, like transformations. For this reason, you and the four assemblies should not weep. Instead, calm your minds in due order, and do not be alarmed or doubtful about me or the great assembly.”

Then the elder Virtuous Seed and the great king bowed their heads and said: “So it is, just as you have taught. All existence is impermanent, without self, without body, yet through skillful means, a body is manifested where no body exists. But we, unable to comprehend, cannot help but grieve. When I reflect on this sorrow, I realize there is no true sorrow, and joy arises instead. Though I weep now, there is no true weeping, and gladness arises.”

Then the Heavenly Worthy, pleased, praised him: “Excellent, excellent, good son! You have understood that I, through the power of skillful means, appear as one among beings, yet there is no arising where arising seems, no self where self appears. Now you rejoice, and sorrow has no hold on you. You have grasped the marks of dharma. It is like climbing a tower in spring to gaze in all directions—all who come to gather look up from afar at the tower. I am now like one who has ascended to those clouds, like one upon a tower, seeing all beings and enabling their awakening.”

He further praised Virtuous Seed: “Now you are also able to contemplate the marks of dharma as illusory, as transformations, and through the power of skillful means, remain unstained. Why? The nature of dharma is pure. Because it is pure, there is no self, no sorrow. Good son, I now accept your offerings of equality, wishing that you and all beings may escape the perils of birth and death, that all afflictions may come to rest in the unshakable ground of the One Vehicle, and that you may constantly abide in bliss, subtle and complete, becoming good fields for the world.”

Then the elder Virtuous Seed and the great king, having heard this teaching, bowed and said: “Excellent, Compassionate Worthy! If I am capable of abiding and serving as a field of blessing, then I shall be able to understand all dharmas. But now, we and the four assemblies are like mantises, truly unable to fathom the constant principle. How then can we be considered fields of blessing for the world? We, with our retinues, grieve and weep, encircling you with incense, wholeheartedly reverent, humbly presenting great offerings and provisions for your sustenance. We beseech the Heavenly Worthy to show mercy to us all.”

Thereupon, the four assemblies spoke in verse:

We bow our heads to the unsurpassed master,
The four assemblies, with four conditions, together entreat.
All the highest perfected ones and divine youths,
Forever cut off from existence and non-existence, ever our refuge.

Having seen the great jeweled city of the One Vehicle,
We children are drowning in suffering.
Our hearts are heavy with longing and sorrow,
Like calves who have lost their loving mother.

Poor, without dharma, without refuge,
Like sick children, like those with afflicted minds.
Without physician, without medicine, tormented by the heart’s afflictions,
All that we seek, all that we eat, is fulfilled.

Though we have taken the lesser physicians of the worldly Small Vehicle,
None of their views, none of their doubts, could ever be resolved.
We beseech the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful Worthy,
For our sake and for the sake of conditions, to expound horizontally.

Now we are like a kingdom without a lord, a land without a ruler,
All beings in the four realms suffer from hunger and famine.
We four assemblies are likewise:
The Heavenly Worthy entrusts us, then returns to his divine form.
Serene and eternally abiding, beyond birth and death,
We are left orphaned, like grieving children.
Having lost the Dharma, lost the Worthy, like withered vines,
We weep and wail, certain of our death.

We only pray that you do not forsake your great compassion,
But universally expound the City of the Treasury of Wisdom of the One Vehicle.

At that time, Haikong, having heard the verse, rose and said:
“Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy, your words are like a parable—
Just as a king raises his many children,
Their forms upright, their hearts vast with love and care,
Teaching them the classics until all are thoroughly versed,
Then the great king entrusts them to govern separate lands and guide their people.

I am now likewise, like a prince,
Having received the complete teachings of the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy,
I shall return to my divine form.
We bow our heads to the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy,
Only praying that you do not abandon the beings of the Two Vehicles.
If the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy remains long in the world,
Expounding the Treasury of Sweet Dew, filling all things,
Then beings will not conceive thoughts of fear or fall into hell.

It is like a man who first studies the arts,
Only to be seized by officials and imprisoned.
His fellow prisoners ask: ‘For what crime have you come to this prison?’
The man replies: ‘I am deeply afflicted.
If I could but escape, I would surely find peace and attain great dharmic power.’

Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy, you are likewise:
For the sake of all beings, dwelling in the city of suffering,
Revealing that suffering is not yet exhausted,
Manifesting in accordance with the inclinations of beings.
The Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy teaches and shows the good seed,
Like a physician who thoroughly understands the properties of medicine,
And again administers wondrous medicine to his child.
All other external students who receive instruction
Cannot perceive it.
Now our Heavenly Worthy is likewise:
Alone, he teaches the profound and subtle treasury of the precious Dharma to the good seed.
How can we not be seen and pitied?
The wondrous Dharma of equality should not be kept secret or hoarded.
Like that physician who teaches only his child and not external students,
One might think the great master’s affection has preferences,
That the Dharma treasure is kept secret,
But the heart of great compassion ultimately has no preferences.
Why is this?
We four assemblies do not see your teachings.
We only pray that you remain long in the world and expound for us.

It is like beings whose bodies suffer illness,
Who abandon the distant, level path and take the perilous road,
Where dangers and hardships abound, and they endure manifold sufferings.
If there were no other person to take pity on them and teach them,
They would be shown the level path.
We four assemblies are likewise:
The Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy, for the sake of great compassion,
Points out to us the treasury of the One Vehicle.
For this reason, we come to understand the equal marks of emptiness and existence.”

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy addressed Haikong, saying:
“Do not let your minds be like those of ordinary people, speaking of preferences.
You should each put aside your sorrow and no longer grieve.
Be diligent and vigorous, maintaining right mindfulness.
If you have any doubts, freely ask and I shall resolve them.
Whether I am empty or not empty, constant or not constant,
Suffering or not suffering, dependent or not dependent,
Abiding or not abiding, departing or not departing, returning or not returning;
Whether suddenly existent or suddenly non-existent, neither constant nor inconstant,
Neither blissful nor non-blissful, neither annihilated nor non-annihilated,
Neither real nor non-real, neither extinguished nor non-extinguished—
Such and other countless aspects within the Dharma,
Whatever you ask, whatever you doubt,
I shall explain for you accordingly,
And I shall also expound for you the flavor of equality.

After I pass away, it will be exceedingly difficult to encounter my manifested form in the world,
Difficult to encounter the body of wisdom, difficult to trust in your own body.
Such difficulties—hard to see, hard to hear.
You have long since perfected the great precepts,
Fulfilled all virtues, and your practice is without flaw,
Thus you have been able to see my form—rare indeed, inconceivable!

Good son, Haikong Treasury of Wisdom,
You have long since departed from the eight difficulties of birth and death,
Attained the vajra body,
And thus encountered me—this should not be in vain.
Good son, in the past, during former kalpas,
I underwent manifold hardships,
And now have attained this unsurpassed fruition of the Dao.
For your sake, I provisionally manifest the abandonment of this body,
And shall return to the divine form of the non-action One Vehicle,
The Dharma city of Haikong, replete with all manner of virtuous treasures,
Which you may take as you will.
Therefore, you shall adorn the true Dharma,
And comprehend the meaning of emptiness.
You shall be of one mind, accumulating manifold virtues,
Encompassing them like the sea, fulfilling the treasury of the heart of wisdom and virtue.
For this reason, you are now named ‘Haikong Treasury of Wisdom of the One Vehicle.’

Good son, it is like merchants who encounter a treasure city,
Personally gather its riches, and return home to become greatly wealthy.
You are likewise:
Having encountered my form and attained the One Vehicle,
Deeply comprehending the treasury of the Dharma,
You accomplish the Dharma body—just so.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy addressed all the earth immortals:
“Do not let your minds be complacent and conceive thoughts of satisfaction.
Though you students have now left the household life in this Great Vehicle,
Do not covet the ranks of the earth immortals and the like.
Though you four assemblies have donned the robes of great compassion—
Yellow-brown garments and dark headcloths—
Your hearts have not yet been imbued with the treasury of the One Vehicle Dharma.
Though the four assemblies of earth immortals practice gentleness and weakness,
Wandering through famous mountains,
Their hearts have never sought the treasury of the One Vehicle Dharma.
Though they have left the household life, they have not attained the true Dharma;
Though they wear the five flowers, their fetters are not yet severed.

Now, out of great compassion, for the sake of Haikong Treasury,
I expound the true teaching of the One Vehicle.
You four assemblies, while I am still present,
In the midst of the great assembly, I harmoniously resolve
The Dharma-nature of the One Vehicle, true and unshakable.
For this reason, you four assemblies should gather your minds,
Be courageous and vigorous, shatter all fetters and afflictions,
And attain the clarity and purity of the Dharma.”

At that time, the earth immortals, hearing the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy expound these profound teachings, were filled with shame and remorse. Overcome with deep sorrow, their body hairs stood on end, tears streaming down their faces. They bowed their heads to the ground, prostrating at the Worthy’s feet, and knelt to address him, saying: “Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy, swiftly proclaim the supreme teaching of emptiness and the absence of self, to assuage the sorrows of the Haikong Treasury. Just as among all beasts, the elephant king is supreme, so too is the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy foremost among all the heavens across the ten directions. If there are beings who arouse great diligence, they can eradicate the three fetters of affliction and the ignorance of the three realms—just as a farmer, in the autumn month, diligently plows the deep earth to remove noxious weeds. If even one among us four assemblies arouses such great diligence, it is likewise. Though the sufferings of the three realms—whether constant or inconstant—are difficult to endure, for this reason, Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy, though the constant and inconstant abide, the reversal of spirit is supreme. Just as a king, knowing his life is nearing its end, mercifully pardons all under heaven, releasing prisoners from their bonds and shackles, allowing them to go free before he departs this life, so too does the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy teach us and all beings, enabling us to awaken to the One Vehicle of the Haikong Treasury. Thus, the four assemblies, having received the benefit of the Dharma, aroused great diligence. Together, they rose, paid homage, and took their leave.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy wandered to the south of the city, where he gathered with an innumerable assembly of heavenly perfected ones, youths, and divine youths upon a seven-jeweled mystic terrace. Then, from the ten directions, supreme sages, boundless divine kings, and the thirty-two great and lesser heavenly kings, each accompanied by five hundred fifty-five thousand five hundred fifty followers, assembled at the Dharma site. As one, they paid homage, gazing upon the Heavenly Worthy, and took their seats in due order.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy, seated upon a seven-jeweled mystic throne within the city, expounded the One Vehicle of the Haikong Treasury. Within the city, the heavenly musicians played zithers, zhu, and konghou, their melodies plaintive and exquisite, their sounds rare and refined. Together, they scattered flowers and burned incense, their fragrance wafting and flowing, perfuming the boundless expanse, both within and without, naturally evoking the Daoist intent. Then, the Heavenly Worthy, in deep contemplation, his body and mind unmoving, emitted a great radiance that pervaded the ten directions and the boundless worlds. Even in the hells and among the hungry ghosts, none failed to behold it. Thus, the four assemblies—whether human or non-human—and all beings, though seated together, each received benefit. All whose faculties were stained by attachment to the light’s appearance awakened in their hearts, aroused great diligence, and single-mindedly listened with reverence.

At that time, Haikong Treasury of Wisdom rose from his seat, adjusted his robes, stepped forward, and bowed to the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “Virtuous One, I have attended upon you for countless kalpas, yet never before has there been a day like this. The Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy has emitted a great radiance that pervades the ten directions without exception, universally encompassing all—heaven above and heaven below, all beings, whether human or non-human, each receiving benefit. I wonder, Heavenly Worthy, what extraordinary sign this is, benefiting all beings in such a manner.”

Then, the Heavenly Worthy, moved by great compassion, replied to Haikong Treasury of Wisdom: “Excellent, excellent, good son. Return each to your seat, and I shall explain this for you. Good son, in the past, I expounded the One Vehicle of the secret treasury with great compassion, broadly unfolding the Dharma teachings for gods and humans, universally delivering all to receive the true Dao. Reverently observing the three grades, they traversed the ten directions and the five billion heavens. I opened the great kalpas, transforming and delivering beings, in past kalpas and future kalpas, adapting to each realm. Contemplating emptiness and the emptiness of appearances, utterly unattached, they received the samādhi of emptiness, yet without any fixed appearance. For this reason, I shall now return to the realm of formlessness, naturally united in root.

Haikong Treasury of Wisdom, you should now request the essential teachings in a timely manner. I observe that beings dwell in the city of afflictions, deeply attached to evil appearances, each tormented by their own sorrows. Thus, out of compassion, I manifest a responsive form—not a body of afflictions, nor a body of the five turbidities. You should know that the One Vehicle of the Haikong Treasury observes beings and teaches the Dharma accordingly.”

Then, the Heavenly Worthy, wishing to proclaim this meaning, spoke in verse:

The Haikong Treasury is inconceivable,
Formless, naturally responsive.
All beings arise from the wisp of smoke,
Never losing the causes and conditions of birth.
Causes and conditions each have their counterparts,
Enduring kalpas of suffering, unceasing,
Difficult to escape, difficult to avoid.
Attachment to appearances makes liberation hard,
Following the kalpas like a turning wheel.
In the jeweled city, I abide,
Contemplating and expounding the One Vehicle.
Because beings differ,
My compassionate heart arouses pity.
The Haikong city is hard to enter,
Thus I repeatedly expound these wondrous words.
Those who see the Daoists
Naturally attain the true Dao.
Gathering to see the Daoists,
Diligently study and enter the city of emptiness.
Daoists cultivate the immortal Dao,
In one lifetime, no rebirth.
The immortal Dao gathers and endures,
Unobstructed and without interval.
The distant great immortal king
Roams and delights in the Great Mystery.
I shall now depart,
My body of quiescence and unobstructedness.
All sufferings have their causes,
Only the wise know the truth.

Then, the Heavenly Worthy, having spoken these verses, addressed Haikong Treasury, saying: “Good son, Haikong Treasury of Wisdom, you have long since planted the roots of virtue in past lives, ascending the supreme Dao. Your fame is equal and impartial, like the great sea that receives all streams. You are likewise—responding to the lower realms, establishing the great treasury for all beings, inconceivable in its vastness. I observe your heart, possessing skillful methods, desiring to heal the illnesses of beings. Good son, in the future, beings will be constantly afflicted by great bodily diseases—ailments of the mind, the abdomen, the head, the hands—treat them as you see fit. I shall now return my spirit to the realm of non-action and immutability.”

At that time, Haikong, having heard these words, grew sorrowful in his heart. Prostrating himself with his head to the ground, he wept and bowed, then addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “How can you suddenly depart from the world and return to the realm of stillness and extinction? I only beseech the Heavenly Worthy to stir the great wind of compassion, universally revealing all—whether human or non-human—so that all may know nurturance and sustenance, delivering beings from the city of afflictions and securing them in the treasury of peace. May all beings, upon seeing the sick, be instantly released. With the great rain of the Dharma, shower all afflicted beings, guiding and illuminating all existence—this I shall never refuse.”

Then, the Heavenly Worthy smiled and replied to Haikong: “Excellent, good son! You are able to establish the great vessel spanning the Three Realms, serving as the great bridge for all gods, humans, and beings in the boundless worlds—those suffering in distress and all moving creatures—ferrying them into the City of Plum Void, comforting those in the realm of death and form. Furthermore, I instruct you, Haikong: contemplate the secret treasury of the One Vehicle, the *Haikong*, and expound it for others, traveling to the boundless worlds in the ten directions. Such lands are beyond conception. With diligence and joy, Haikong Treasury of Wisdom, all beings—dull-rooted and slow to awaken—do not comprehend that all, whether human or non-human, return to emptiness. Emptiness is without the mark of self; yet through the absence of self, false distinctions arise.”

Thereupon, Haikong rose and again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “Greatly compassionate Heavenly Worthy, how is it that all these beings shall be utterly empty? If all is empty, how then can there be sin and merit, suffering and joy?”

The Heavenly Worthy replied to Haikong: “Good son, you should know that all beings shall return to emptiness. Precisely because they return to emptiness, they falsely create manifold sins. Where sin is not empty, this is called the suffering of sin; where merit is not empty, this is called the joy of merit. The mind, stained by sin and merit, knows suffering and joy, hatred and love. Through these causes and conditions, sin and merit arise. If one observes one’s own body—since the body is empty, all dharmas are also empty—where then is the form of sin, and in what place does it reside? If it resides in affliction, the mark of affliction is empty; if it resides in merit, the mark of merit is also empty. Thus, know that sin is empty and merit is empty; since sin and merit are empty, this is called ‘emptiness of emptiness.’ Good son, you are able to skillfully transform, adapting to the responsive forms of beings—hence the name *Haikong*. Cause all beings to diligently contemplate and recite the *One Vehicle Treasury of Haikong*, word by word, line by line, verse by verse, with single-minded devotion. Know that such a person is the Heaven among Heavens, ever abiding in the meaning of the One Vehicle’s emptiness, ever dwelling in the City of Emptiness of the One Vehicle. Good son, if there are beings who know my formless nature, naturally sharing the same root, know that such a person comes ‘from the heavens above,’ having fulfilled the immortal Dao. All people of every land will together take refuge and praise them with kind words, calling it the Land of Eternal Joy and Immovability.”

Again, the Heavenly Worthy addressed Haikong Treasury, saying: “Good son, if there are beings born in the lower realms, dwelling in the city of afflictions, who recognize the body as suffering and awaken their minds to tell the people: ‘We beings all dwell together in the fiery city of afflictions, poisoned by the three toxins—how can we escape and leave the city of birth and death? How can we enter the Dharma-city of the One Vehicle, the Land of Eternal Joy, a place without afflictions, a realm of peace?’”

At that time, the beings, having heard these words, were each filled with dread and thought to themselves: “How is it that we were born in the lower lands, within the city of afflictions, tormented by the fire of the three poisons? How can we be reborn and reach that land? That land of great peace is separated by vast seas. How can we cross and arrive there?”

Then, one among the assembly said: “I have seen three ships in that sea: the great ship can carry countless beings, the medium ship can carry hundreds of thousands, and the small ship can carry tens of thousands. These three ships possess great spiritual power, unafraid of wind and waves, with oars and rudders all newly sturdy. If we ourselves board these ships and sail across the waters, we shall reach the other shore with great joy.”

Thereupon, the four assemblies, having heard these words, rejoiced greatly and each prepared themselves. One million two hundred forty thousand people, with one mind, desired to depart for the other shore. Yet there were fifty million who chose not to go, each bidding farewell at the seashore. After parting, fifty thousand among the assembly boarded the great ship, ninety thousand boarded the medium ship, and one hundred thousand boarded the small ship, each according to their preference, finally embarking. Raising the sails, the wind was favorable, and in an instant, they traveled a thousand miles.

Then, those who remained on the shore laughed and sighed, saying: “How foolish are these people! Why seek death by entering the great sea, hoping to reach the other shore? How could they possibly arrive, even at the cost of their lives?”

At that time, those aboard the ships sailed forth, gliding upon the waters. Now, within this sea were great islands, and upon these islands were lands. The three ships arrived together at one such land—a vast and abundant country with natural food and drink. The people of this land were all of good heart, and their cities and dwellings were made of gold, silver, and the seven treasures.

Then, those on the small ship said to one another: “The ship we ride is weak in strength and cannot sail further. We have already traveled a hundred thousand miles from our homeland, and this land’s abundance is sufficient for us. We wish to remain here.” Thus, the small ship stayed in this land. The medium and great ships raised their sails and continued onward.

They passed another land, level and just, filled with the seven treasures, with natural clothing and food. None died prematurely, and all lived out their years.

Then, as their lives ended, their souls ascended to heaven, and their bodies did not turn to ash.

Those on the medium ship said to one another: “The ship we ride is weak in strength and cannot advance further. Let us remain in this land, where the rewards of our merit are sufficient for us.” Thus, they begged to stay in this land, and so they remained. Those on the great ship raised their sails and departed, arriving at the farther shore—the Land of Utmost Bliss. In this land, the people’s ground was of gold, their steps of jade, and rows of seven-jeweled trees bore sweet fruit. Their palaces were of the seven treasures, their lifespans long, and their virtue in harmony with the Dao. There, they were reborn and attained the Dao by nature.

Then, the Heavenly Venerable addressed Haikong, saying: “Good son, as for the three ships and their travelers of whom I spoke—some near, some far—what do you think?”

Thereupon, Haikong replied: “I do not understand, Heavenly Venerable, the meaning of your earlier words. Do the three ships truly differ in their carrying capacity? And yet, when sailing upon the waters, do they also differ in strength? How can it be that some travel near and some far? How is it that the three ships, raising their sails at the same time, arrive at different distances? What is the Heavenly Venerable’s intent?”

Then, the Heavenly Venerable answered Haikong, saying: “Good son, what do you make of my words about the three ships’ journey? Good son, the path may be strong or weak, high or low, far or near, great or small. Why is this so?”

The lands vary in distance, in rank, in poverty, in wealth. Why is this so? Those born in near lands dwell in the most wretched of realms, for the lower-bound beings who take birth there sink into the five sufferings, never again to plant the seeds of humanity. Their souls drift and wander, cut off from the root of human rebirth. Thus do all the sages, moved by great compassion, divide the One into Three, guiding beings along separate paths, that they may escape suffering and gradually enter the Great Vehicle. Hence the distinction of great lands, middle lands, and small lands—some near, some far. By this cause and condition, the Way manifests in refinement or coarseness, each matched to its corresponding affinity, naturally received as such.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Venerable, his heart suffused with boundless compassion, spoke in verse:

With the eye of Dao I behold,
All good and evil in the world—
Originally one with the great mixed qi,
Defilement and attachment make them so.
Turning, they fall upon the paths of the Three Wretched Realms,
Once gone, they cannot return.
I plant the wisdom of the One Vehicle,
With compassionate heart I urge and pity,
Dividing it to teach the Three,
Guiding each by affinity to return.
Passing through the city of Haikong,
What worry is there not to ascend as immortals?
The small ship escapes the Three Wretched Realms,
The middle ship avoids the Eight Difficulties,
The great ship ascends the cloud-bound path.
The three ships follow my grace,
Riding the Great Vehicle to Jade Capital,
Bodies ascending the Seven Jeweled Mountain.
This body is of great wisdom,
Anxious for all roots.
If all roots are not delivered,
I shall not realize true fruition.
My heart holds the overflowing virtue of the Dao,
Through kalpas I rescue from calamity’s causes.
The middle ship plays amidst the clouds’ net,
Its mind at ease, universally embracing.
The Small Vehicle feasts in Crimson Numinance,
Yet may attain self-benefit through care.
Small and middle lack wisdom and awakening,
Cut off from hope of the Seven Jeweled City.

At that time, among the assembly there was an immortal named Miao Si, who rose from his seat, bowed his head to the ground in reverence, and addressed the Heavenly Venerable, saying: "Great Compassionate Heavenly Venerable, why do meritorious virtues and practices vary in weight, some great and some small, with corresponding differences in karmic reward? What is the meaning of this? Can one awaken to the causes and conditions behind it?"

At that time, the Heavenly Venerable replied to Miao Si, saying: "Good son, as for meritorious virtue, it arises from wisdom in practice, opening the gates of all dharmas and revealing the Dao to all beings—whether human or non-human. Contemplating the single-vehicle treasury of the sea of emptiness, one attains decisive insight, emptily comprehending all dharmas across the boundless lands and worlds of the ten directions, seeing them as clearly as the palm of one’s hand, with nothing left unseen.

Good son, if there are beings who single-mindedly perform prostrations, meditating on the wisdom-treasury of the single-vehicle sea of emptiness, forgetting sleep and food, fasting past noon, and upholding the precepts without fail—

Good son, it is like a filial son whose parents have died: embracing the coffin, he wails in grief, beating his breast and crying out to heaven, moving all within the kingdom, human and non-human alike, to weep with him. Thereupon, his parents immediately revive. Then, all the children rejoice together, leaping with boundless joy. My joy is likewise thus.

If there are beings who contemplate the wisdom-treasury of the single-vehicle sea of emptiness and expound it to others, forgetting to eat, I will guard and protect them, never abandoning my original vow, and my joy will be boundless. It is also like the filial son who does not lose his parents—so too is it thus.

Good son, if there are beings whose hearts abide in gentle yielding, whose bodies and minds endure humiliation, whose speech avoids evil, whose six senses are pure, and who do not join with humans, devas, or any beings to create an ‘evil city’ or accumulate wicked karma—it is like a compassionate mother who nurtures her beloved child, holding him close and never parting from her lap, always guarding and protecting him, never allowing him to quarrel with others. So too do I guard and protect their body, mind, speech, and intention.

Good son, if there are beings who practice great generosity, giving away their household wealth, kingdoms, wives, children, beloved kin, the seven treasures, and all precious things, bestowing them upon others and scattering blessings to all beings of the ten directions, human and non-human alike—it is like sweet rain that moistens all, so that every plant and tree receives its benefit. My compassionate giving is likewise thus."

At that time, Miao Si and the fourfold assembly, having heard these words, gained great dharma benefit. They each resolved to cultivate diligently, rose together, and approached the Heavenly Venerable. With single-minded devotion, they bowed in reverence, took their leave, and departed.

Thus concludes *Scroll Eight of the Heavenly Venerable’s Single-Vehicle Treasury of the Sea of Emptiness and Wisdom*.
*Scroll Nine of the Heavenly Venerable’s Single-Vehicle Treasury of the Sea of Emptiness and Wisdom* begins.

**The Chapter on Abandoning and Receiving**

At that time, the Heavenly Venerable addressed King Good-Seed: "Good man, great king and elder, you have relinquished your wisdom and wealth, come from afar, and entreated me to expound the *Single-Vehicle Treasury of the Sea of Emptiness and Wisdom*, abiding in the jeweled city within your kingdom upon the seat of the true adept.

"Good man, great king, having heard the true adept of the *Treasury of the Sea of Emptiness and Wisdom* inquire after illness, how does it appear to you?"

Thereupon, King Good-Seed and the elders, having heard the Great Compassionate Heavenly Venerable speak these words, rose from their seats, prostrated at the Venerable’s feet, and addressed the Heavenly Venerable: "That true adept from afar possesses profound wisdom, making repayment difficult. He fully comprehends the marks of dharma and is unhindered in eloquence. All the immortals and adepts have resolved the *Single-Vehicle Treasury of the Sea of Emptiness and Wisdom*, and none fail to enter the gate of wisdom. Moreover, he subdues the hosts of external paths and demonic forces, manifesting divine powers and skillful means—all have attained liberation. His wisdom is unfathomable, wondrous and subtle, rare indeed, rare indeed!

"The Great Compassionate Heavenly Venerable, for the sake of all beings, instructs the true adept to dwell in the jeweled city and expound the *Single-Vehicle Treasury of the Sea of Emptiness and Wisdom*. At that time, all the disciples, the people of the world, the great kings, and the elders together aroused wholesome minds, relinquishing their bodies, wisdom, and wealth—houses, mansions, servants, and attendants—all were scattered in offering. Now, as that true adept expounds the Dharma, among those seated in faith are over eight thousand true adepts, seven hundred immortals, three hundred great kings, and hundreds of millions of devas and humans—both men and women—all following in attendance. Hearing the essential teachings of the *Single-Vehicle Treasury of the Sea of Emptiness and Wisdom*, they become great bridges and Dharma stairways.

"Then, the true adept and his disciples employed their spiritual power, and within the jeweled city, all the palaces to the left and right became utterly empty. At that time, the true adept sat in the empty city, having removed all possessions, resting only upon a jeweled couch due to illness. All his disciples—both human and non-human—gathered around, gazing upon him with tears streaming down in a hundred rivulets, sighing in unison: 'The Great Compassionate True Adept abandons us, leaving us exposed and desolate! Alas, the true adept forsakes us, resting due to illness. Now we reflect: from whence does the great master’s illness arise? Can it be cured? If it may be healed, we, his disciples, would rather relinquish our bodies and lives to restore the great master, that he may accomplish for us the *Single-Vehicle Treasury of the Sea of Emptiness and Wisdom*, comforting us and abiding in the great jeweled city, where we may hear his teachings.'

"At that time, the *Treasury of the Sea of Emptiness and Wisdom* proclaimed: 'My illness arises for the sake of all beings. It is not the mark of illness, yet it is called illness; it is not the mark of seeing, yet it is called seeing; it is not the mark of emptiness, yet it is called emptiness; it is not the mark of speech, yet it is called speech. Our minds remain doubtful and unclear—how is this so? We only pray that the Great Compassionate One, for our sake, will distinguish and explain it.'

"Thereupon, the Heavenly Venerable, with great compassion, replied to King Good-Seed: 'Good man, great king and elder, as you have said, the true adept of the *Sea of Emptiness* fully comprehends this mark of illness—there is no dharma of illness beyond it; he fully comprehends this mark of abiding—there is no dharma of abiding beyond it; he fully comprehends this mark of emptiness—there is no dharma of emptiness beyond it.'"

"He fully comprehends this mark of speech—there is no dharma of speech beyond it; he fully comprehends this mark of tranquility—there is no dharma of tranquility beyond it; he fully comprehends this mark of departure—there is no dharma of departure beyond it. Why is this so? Illness arises from nowhere; abiding finds no resting place; emptiness has no attachment. If there were a dharma, it would be unseen upon inspection; if it were an empty dharma, it would exist upon following it. For this reason, that which abides has nowhere to be placed, and that which departs has nowhere to arrive. Now, what is called illness has nothing to be ill; what is called abiding has nothing to abide; what is called emptiness has nothing to be empty; what is placed has nothing to be placed. Great kings, hold these words with a virtuous mind, and you shall attain understanding."

Thereupon, the great King Good-Seed among the assembly, having heard these words, rejoiced greatly in his heart. He bowed at the Venerable One’s feet and addressed the Heavenly Venerable: "If this is so, can the illness of the *Sea of Emptiness* be treated? Would healing it cause harm, or would it not worsen the affliction?"

The Heavenly Venerable of Great Compassion, amidst the boundless assembly of true immortals, divine youths, and earthbound Daoists, was earnestly questioned: "What is the cause of the illness of the *Sea of Emptiness* adept? How may it be extinguished, and its causes exhausted? May this bring joy to the assembly, that all may arouse a virtuous mind and delight in hearing the treasury of the single vehicle of *Sea of Emptiness* wisdom."

Thereupon, the Heavenly Venerable replied to King Good-Seed: "Good man, you ask from whence the illness of the *Sea of Emptiness* arises. Good man, the illness of the *Sea of Emptiness* arises from the convergence of conditions, and thus there is affliction. If all beings were free from illness, the adept of the *Sea of Emptiness* would likewise be free from illness. Why is this so? The treasury of *Sea of Emptiness* wisdom enters the body of birth and death for the sake of beings. With the body of birth and death, there is the cause of illness. If all beings were free from illness, then the *Sea of Emptiness* would no longer suffer affliction. Good man, it is like a compassionate mother with but one child: if the child falls ill, the parents also fall ill; if the child recovers, the parents also recover. The adept of the *Sea of Emptiness* is likewise. Now, the *Sea of Emptiness* loves all beings as a child. For this reason, when beings are ill, the *Sea of Emptiness* is also ill. Good man, you ask from whence the illness of the *Sea of Emptiness* arises. Great kings, I now reflect: the illness of the *Sea of Emptiness* arises from great compassion."

Thereupon, King Good-Seed in the assembly, having heard these words, addressed the Heavenly Venerable: "Heavenly Venerable of Great Compassion, how is it that the adept of the *Sea of Emptiness* treasury of wisdom dwells in the jeweled city, yet the city is empty, without even a seat or throne? I now reflect upon this with great trepidation."

Thereupon, the Heavenly Venerable replied to King Good-Seed: "Excellent, excellent, good man! You speak of the city’s emptiness—the Three Clarities’ Jade Capital and the Land of Eternal Bliss are likewise empty and void. King Good-Seed again addressed him: "If this is what is said, by what is it empty, that it is called empty and void?" The Heavenly Venerable replied: "It is empty of emptiness." He further asked: "By what is emptiness empty?" The Heavenly Venerable replied: "Emptiness has no distinctions. Why is this so? Distinctions are also empty, and thus it is called emptiness of emptiness." Good-Seed again asked: "Does emptiness distinguish or not?" The Heavenly Venerable replied: "Distinctions are also empty." He further asked: "If emptiness has no distinctions, of what dharma is it empty?" He replied: "It is empty of dharma-marks, empty of the six dusts. Since the six dusts are empty, dharma-marks are also empty." Good-Seed again asked: "What are dharma-marks?" He replied: "Dharma-marks are precisely liberation, and liberation is precisely dharma-marks. For this reason, since dharma-marks are empty, liberation is also empty." He further asked: "What is liberation?" He replied: "Afflictions are precisely liberation, and liberation is precisely afflictions. Since liberation is empty, afflictions are also empty." Good-Seed again asked: "If afflictions are illness, are they not illness? If they are illness, from whence does illness come? Does it come from the body, or not from the body? If it comes from the body, since the body-dharma has afflictions, how can it be called empty?" The Heavenly Venerable replied: "What I call illness is precisely afflictions; since afflictions are empty, the dharma of illness is also empty. Since the dharma of illness is empty, the dharma of the body is also empty. Why is this so? The afflicted body is like an illusion, like a dream. For this reason, it is empty of emptiness." Good-Seed again asked: "Among the four great elements—earth, water, fire, and wind—which great element is the body?" He replied: "The afflicted body is not born from the earth great, yet it does not depart from the earth great. It is likewise with the water, fire, and wind greats. The afflicted bodies of all beings arise from the four greats, and this is called illness. Thus, the true adept follows and is ill with them."

Thereupon, Good-Seed, having heard these words, rose and bowed, praising the single vehicle of the *Sea of Emptiness* treasury of wisdom: "This is my great teacher, who speaks to us of illness, that all conditioned things are impermanent, that the body-dharma is without self, and does not speak of the *Sea of Emptiness* as weary of the body; who speaks of the body’s suffering, and does not speak of the eternal bliss of the Jade Capital of the Mysterious Metropolis; who instructs the three vehicles and acts as a great bridge for all beings, ferrying them across the sea of birth and death. Dwelling in the empty city, he takes on illness in his body, pitying those beings, that they may recognize the suffering of countless kalpas in past lives. He urges the cultivation of vast merit, that all beings may be benefited, and that none may be caused distress. He exhorts and aids all beings to diligently practice vigor. As the great king of physicians, he treats the roots of all illness in beings, comforting and consoling them, lying ill in their stead."

Thereupon, the treasury of *Sea of Emptiness* wisdom addressed King Good-Seed: "Do not doubt that my body is ill, yet there is no illness. The illness I now have arises from past-life causes—deluded thoughts, inverted views, and the arising of afflictions. There is no substantial dharma in it, yet it is called illness."

"Why is this so? The four great elements combine to form what is provisionally called a 'body'; the four great elements have no master, and the body likewise has no attachment. The illness I now have arises entirely from attachment to the body—thus one should not generate attachment to the body. King Good-Seed, having understood the root of illness, should eliminate the notion of 'I' and the notion of afflictions, and extinguish the notion of dharmas.

You great kings should contemplate thus: this body is merely composed of various dharmas; this body of mine arises only from dharmas and perishes only through dharmas. This dharma-body does not know one another—when arising, it does not say, 'I arise, you perish'; when perishing, it does not say, 'I perish, you arise.' My thoughts of beings are likewise thus.

King Good-Seed, you should know and contemplate thus: this dharma-body is also inverted. This body of mine is the great affliction. You should be weary of and turn away from this body. How then can one be free from 'what is mine'? To be free from 'what is mine' is to be free from the two dharmas; to be free from the two dharmas is to be without thoughts of inner or outer, and all dharmas are equal.

How are they equal? We are eternally blissful, eternally blissful and pure; there is no self within or without, and I too am pure. These two equalities are all utterly empty. What is emptiness? It is merely names—emptiness arises from names. These two dharmas have no fixed nature in sequence. Attaining this equality, there is no other illness, only the illness of emptiness. The illness of emptiness is also empty; having understood the illness of emptiness, this is my having illness.

Now my illness is without reception yet received; I speak of the body as impermanent, yet the marks of dharmas do not perish. To establish faith and conviction, I provisionally posit a body, universally contemplating beings, arousing great compassion, and expounding the treasury of the One Vehicle. Taming this body of mine, I shall also tame all beings, removing manifold illnesses.

Now I speak of illness to sever the roots of clinging in beings. Having severed the roots of illness, there is nothing to be obtained. If there is nothing to be obtained, then clinging is severed. When all faculties are exhausted, this is my being without illness."

King Good-Seed, having heard this discourse, bowed his head in reverence, knelt, and praised: "Excellent! Excellent! Great compassionate one, for the sake of severing my attachments, you have spoken thus, taming this body of mine, and shall also tame all beings' suffering of old age, illness, and death. If not for this, we beings would live without benefit, bound by afflictions. The true one of the Sea of Emptiness has spoken to me—like one victorious in dharma, who may be called brave, and who can also remove the suffering of old age, illness, and death, abiding in the city, I have heard your discourse.

The true one of the Sea of Emptiness is likewise thus: for my having illness, you speak of having illness. My body's illness is neither real nor existent. The Treasury of Sea of Emptiness Wisdom is likewise neither real nor existent. If there are beings who contemplate this illness and do not generate attachment or views, such a person is the Treasury of the Sea of Emptiness, long since freed from the ailing body of birth and death.

Why is this so? The Treasury of Sea of Emptiness Wisdom has long since severed the afflictions subtle as dust, yet arouses great compassion. For those who love and grieve, it is weariness of mind in birth and death that causes one to lie ill. If there are beings who can generate weariness and turning away, following whatever they love, such persons, wherever they are born, are not covered by attachment or views.

Having understood the marks of dharmas, wherever they are born, they are not struck; moreover, with wisdom, they expound the dharma to beings, untying bonds—just as the Sea of Emptiness expounds the One Vehicle. All bonds are untied; having freed the body from bonds, they can free others from bonds. The bonds of self and others are all purified.

If there are beings who greedily cling to the flavors of goodness, the Sea of Emptiness strikes the notion of being bound. Afflictions have no master, and the body likewise has no self. Contemplating thus is the arising of skillful means—this is the Sea of Emptiness' liberation."

King Good-Seed, having spoken thus, gazed up at the honored countenance, bowed, and withdrew. Thereupon, the Sea of Emptiness, hearing Good-Seed's words, rejoiced greatly and addressed King Good-Seed: "Excellent! Excellent! Good man, you noble ones are my true children, with profound wisdom and unobstructed eloquence, able to understand the marks of dharmas. You are my great teacher—your wisdom is unfathomable, surpassing even my discourse.

I now reflect: King Good-Seed, your name is not in vain. You are truly able to establish the seeds that remain in the three realms—thus you are called Good-Seed. Good man, you should listen carefully as I distinguish and expound for you.

Good man, what is the bond of skillful means? It is the mind attached to views, the lesser vehicle and lesser views, adorning the Three Jewels. The seven-jeweled palace adorns the body, and one tames oneself, transforming beings, practicing dharmas of existence together, adorning the dharma within emptiness and formlessness with manifold embellishments. Such a person is bound by skillful means.

What is liberation through skillful means? Without attachment or views, one does not cling to the body as beloved, adorning it with subtlety and wonder, perfecting beings together, having understood the One Vehicle Treasury of Sea of Emptiness Wisdom, abiding unmoved, realizing emptiness as non-emptiness, speaking of existence as non-existence. With the power of skillful means, within emptiness and formlessness, one transforms the dharma, also guiding beings to tame themselves, weary of the body, not receiving any attachments. Such a person is liberated through skillful means.

Good-Seed King, if there is one lying ill, you should contemplate thus: all dharmas are without self; my body is impermanent, suffering, empty, and not-self. Though the body is ill, within birth and death, one transforms and liberates all without weariness—this is skillful means.

You should also contemplate this body of mine: the body does not leave illness, and illness does not leave the body. This illness and this body are neither new nor old—this is the skillful means of wisdom. If the body is ill yet tranquil, this is the skillful means of wisdom."

Good-Seed King, if there are beings who, though ill, entertain thoughts of unrestrained minds, not wearying of the body, and craving love and attachment—such persons follow the way of fools. Know that these beings do not depart from the suffering of birth-and-death and the torments of hell.

If there is one lying ill, contemplating all dharmas as suffering, empty, and without self—this illness of mine is within birth-and-death, yet not of birth-and-death. Since there is no birth-and-death, birth-and-death is without self. I, within birth-and-death, bear no defiled conduct, abiding in constant bliss, yet not in constant bliss, for it is not tranquil—this is the practice of oceanic emptiness.

Such a person forever departs from the city of birth-and-death and afflictions. Though possessing this body, they do not rely on body or mind; though within the three realms, they do not grasp at dharma-nature; though practicing emptiness, they hold no notion of emptiness.

Then the Great Compassionate Heavenly Honored One addressed Good-Seed Elder-King: Though my body is ill, lying for the sake of all beings who suffer; though practicing formlessness, for those beings I ferry all across; though practicing non-action, for those beings I manifest a received body; though practicing non-movement, for those beings I display movement.

Through various expositions, though practicing the single vehicle of the oceanic emptiness treasury of wisdom, for those beings I manifest bodies throughout—even bodies as minute as motes of dust. Though practicing wisdom and turning the great Dharma-wheel, for beings in the dark chamber of ignorance, I reveal the great jewel-light, illuminating their afflictions, all arousing wholesome minds and practicing the single-vehicle practice.

Having spoken thus, Good-Seed King and his eight thousand ministers all aroused wholesome minds, joyfully paid homage, took their leave, and returned to their seats, awaiting further discourse.

At that time, among the assembly was a youth named Marvelous Thought. Rising from his seat, he held a lotus flower, faced the Heavenly Honored One with dignified steps, approached, and bowed, saying: "Great Compassionate Heavenly Honored One, how does Oceanic Emptiness abide in the empty city, lying ill upon a seven-jeweled bed? In such a city, all is empty and nothing exists. We, along with the heavenly kings and the people of the world, have come together to hear the single-vehicle treasury of oceanic emptiness. Where does such a one constantly sit?"

Then the Heavenly Honored One replied to Marvelous Thought: "Excellent, excellent, good son! Noble and virtuous one, what is your intention in asking this? Have you come among this assembly for the Dharma or for a seat? Good son, in the past, in the great Floating-Ri Kingdom, I sat within a jewel no larger than a millet grain, expounding the essential Dharma for all beings. At that time, the fourfold assembly—both human and non-human—all entered the jewel, without obstruction or number. The beds and seats within the jewel were neither cramped nor narrow. How then do you say the city is empty and without a seat?"

Then Marvelous Thought, having heard this teaching, knelt and replied: "Great Compassionate Heavenly Honored One, I came here to hear of the single-vehicle treasury spoken of in this city. I did not expect Oceanic Emptiness to lie ill in an empty city without a seat."

Thereupon, the Heavenly Honored One replied to Marvelous Thought: "Good son, those who seek the Dharma spare neither body nor life, do not cling to notions of existence, do not perceive any form, and are free from sensual desire. Now, your teacher lies without illness, sits without a bed—neither non-existent nor existent. The city is empty and without treasure; only Oceanic Emptiness remains. Not seeking, yet seeking—the mind seeks the Dharma. Not seeing the body as seeking, not seeing form as seeking, not seeing speech as seeking; not seeing seeking as existent, not seeing seeking as non-existent, not seeing seeking as both existent and non-existent, not seeing seeking as neither existent nor non-existent, not seeing seeking as neither neither-existent-nor-non-existent, not seeing seeking as neither not-neither-existent-nor-non-existent.

Those who seek the Dharma do not see suffering as seeking, do not see bliss as seeking, do not see the cessation of accumulation as seeking, do not see the cultivation of the path as seeking. Why is this? The Dharma is free from idle discourse; to speak of it is to posit existence. Therefore, the great teacher seeks the Dharma in accordance with various seekings, in accordance with various existences. If one says that the true man Oceanic Emptiness lies ill, such a person engages in idle discourse and does not seek the Dharma.

Marvelous Thought, good son, you should know that the Dharma is called oceanic emptiness, yet oceanic emptiness is not the Dharma. If beings practice oceanic emptiness with their bodies, such persons seek oceanic emptiness, not the Dharma. Good son, the Dharma is called the single vehicle, yet the single vehicle is not the Dharma. If beings practice the single vehicle with their bodies, such persons seek the single vehicle, not the Dharma. Good son, the Dharma is without attachment, yet attachment is not the Dharma. If beings practice attachment with their bodies, such persons seek attachment, not the Dharma. Good son, the Dharma is called formless, yet formlessness is not the Dharma. If beings recognize by following forms and seek forms accordingly, they do not seek the Dharma. Good son, the Dharma is without abode, yet abode is not the Dharma. If beings abide within the Dharma, know that such persons practice abiding in the Dharma, not the Dharma itself."

At that time, the fourfold assembly, seventy heavenly kings, and eight thousand koṭis of beings—both human and non-human—received the benefit of the Dharma. In all dharmas, they became clear and pure, understanding suffering, emptiness, non-self, the impermanence of all conditioned things, and the absence of self in arising and ceasing. In the Dharma, all was purified for them.

Then Oceanic Emptiness, having heard these words, sat up in full, emitting subtle and wondrous light. Each hair on his body radiated light, each with various rare and supreme virtues. From his lion throne, light shone upon the thirty-six kingdoms of the eastern direction, where it transformed into great kings and sons of elders. It also illuminated the southern, western, and northern directions. Wherever the light reached, all beheld the body of Oceanic Emptiness—sixteen feet in height, seated upon a lion throne, adorned with supreme and wondrous majesty.

What the people of these lands had never seen before, they now beheld; what they had never heard, they now heard; what they had never understood, they now understood. This city’s jeweled dais, vast and all-embracing, held thirty-two thousand lion thrones, yet the thirty-six kingdoms remained unobstructed, and all who came found ample space to sit at ease. The youth Miao Si then addressed the Heavenly Venerable: “How is it that the adornments within this city are so rare and wondrous? Is this Oceanic Emptiness, or is it not? The city’s treasures are all extraordinary, its lion thrones beyond count, its great and lesser kings all dignified and majestic, seated together upon lion thrones. The assembly is filled with doubt—never has such a thing been seen. This city’s halls contain boundless lion thrones, yet nothing is hindered. What is your explanation? We wish to hear your discourse and resolve our questions.”

Thereupon, the Heavenly Venerable replied to Miao Si: “Excellent, excellent, good man! This city is emptiness—it is not nothingness, yet it is not something. For this reason, there is the true being Oceanic Emptiness, who is called liberation, beyond all thought. These kings, great and small, are also liberation, beyond all thought. Good man, it is like the devas entering a jewel: nothing is added or diminished. The celestial beings remain at ease as before, unaware that they have entered, yet those who are to be delivered see it clearly—they behold the devas entering the jewel, beyond all thought. The lion thrones entering the city of Oceanic Emptiness are likewise.

Good man, it is like the ocean entering a single mote of dust: the dragons, fish, and sea creatures within remain at ease as before, unconstrained, their watery nature unchanged, as it was originally. Oceanic Emptiness’s body, transforming into these kings—great and small—is also thus.

He further told Miao Si: “All beings who make offerings to Oceanic Emptiness of the One Vehicle Treasury cause the Threefold Heavenly Venerables of the past, present, and future to appear within a single mote of dust. Moreover, within a single subtle mote, they behold all the suns, moons, and stars of the ten directions. If a great wind arises, uprooting grasses and trees, all is shattered and broken—yet by recalling Oceanic Emptiness’s skillful power, one draws it into the mouth, and the body remains unharmed, at peace as before. If a fierce fire burns the kalpa to its end, by contemplating Oceanic Emptiness, the fire enters the belly, yet one remains at ease as before, untouched by heat, the fire unchanged, causing no harm.

He further told Miao Si: “I dwell within the city of Oceanic Emptiness, manifesting boundless skillful means beyond thought. At times, by divine power, I appear as Oceanic Emptiness’s subtle and wondrous body; at times as my true form, at times as an aged figure, at times as a king’s body, at times as a Dharma King’s body, at times as a body of poverty and sickness, at times as a golden body, at times as an ordinary body, at times as an animal’s body—innumerable transformations. I expound the Dharma in countless ways, teaching impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and non-self. All beings who hear these teachings come to understanding, together arousing the mind of goodness, relinquishing body, wisdom, and wealth to seek the supreme fruit. Though these bones may turn to dust, within a single mote of dust, great virtue arises again, beholding Oceanic Emptiness preaching within the city. They hear my discourse, and I listen to theirs, perfecting the profound wisdom of the One Vehicle. They reflect: ‘From whence did this body come? How can the evil roots of birth and death be severed, so as to enter the mysterious gate?’ The path of liberation is beyond all thought.

Some beings, upon hearing this inconceivable One Vehicle Dharma gate of Oceanic Emptiness’s skillful means, weep aloud. Their cries shake the ten directions and the boundless worlds of all lands, moving great and lesser kings, ministers, elders, men and women—each according to their kind—to arouse faith and receive this great Dharma, reciting it day and night without cease. Such people together attain the equal wisdom gate of Oceanic Emptiness.”

As he spoke these words, among the boundless assembly, a great king named Square City rose from his seat, raised his fists, and wept, making this great vow: “I wish to relinquish this body, offering it to all who beg. Let them take as they will—my hands, feet, head, eyes, ears, nose, marrow, brain, flesh, skin, bones—I give it all in offering. I offer my dwellings, palaces, beds, curtains, wives, children, servants, elephants, horses, chariots, gold, silver, lapis lazuli, mother-of-pearl, agate, coral, amber, pearls, and other treasures; clothing, food, and drink—I scatter them all. May this body, by relinquishing and receiving form, come to dwell in the wisdom gate of Oceanic Emptiness, the ground of liberation, to hear together the subtle sutra of the One Vehicle.”

Having spoken these words, they heard his discourse, and I listened, never growing weary.

Then the Heavenly Venerable, having heard King Square City’s words, rejoiced greatly and said to him: “Excellent, excellent, good man! Because of your compassion, you have aroused this great vow, becoming a bridge and ladder of the Dharma for all beings. King Square City, now your body is the ship of Oceanic Emptiness, ferrying all beings from the city of afflictions. Now your eyes are the lamp of Oceanic Emptiness, illuminating the paths of affliction for all beings. Now your hands are the strength of Oceanic Emptiness, severing the city of afflictions for all beings. Now your feet are the chariot of Oceanic Emptiness, transporting all beings across the three realms. Now your mind is the treasury of Oceanic Emptiness, expounding the sutras of wisdom and the treasury of teachings for all beings. Now your ears are the voice of Oceanic Emptiness, so that they hear my discourse, and I listen to theirs. Now your nose is the wind of Oceanic Emptiness, fanning the Dharma teachings so that all beings come to understand the One Vehicle Dharma gate of Oceanic Emptiness.”

Then the Heavenly Venerable further addressed King Great Citadel: "Elder, you have now entered the One Vehicle Dharma gate, abiding in the inconceivable realm, observing beings dwelling in the city of afflictions—like the flash of flint and stone, suddenly appearing, suddenly vanishing. For this reason, you are able to offer your body, hands, eyes, head, elephants, horses, chariots, gold, silver, and all treasures, scattering them all without reserve—what is hard to give, you give; what is hard to relinquish, you relinquish. You become the bridge for all beings to depart the city of birth and death. Your merit and virtue are inconceivable."

The Heavenly Venerable again addressed King Great Citadel: "Elder, good son, you practice compassion for the sake of all beings; you practice relinquishing the body because you are free from afflictions; you practice generosity because you are free from poverty; you practice purity because you are free from greed and anger; you practice listening to the Dharma because you are free from ignorance; you relinquish the royal throne because you are free from notions of noble and base; you relinquish wife and children because you are free from attachment and love; you practice great compassion to reveal the One Vehicle; you practice diligence to ferry all beings; you practice wisdom to understand all beings; you practice skillful means to manifest the Dharma; you practice merit and virtue to liberate all beings; you practice upholding precepts to extinguish the three poisons; you practice Oceanic Emptiness because you fear birth and death; you practice right mindfulness to eradicate evil causes; you practice construction to generate blessings and virtue."

Having spoken these words, suddenly from the four directions of the city, thirty-three celestial youths and jade maidens, hearing the Great Compassionate Heavenly Venerable expound the Dharma to the king, instantly manifested their forms. Descending from the sky, they scattered lotus blossoms over the assembly, swirling and drifting like a great snowfall, filling the entire seating area. Then came wondrous sounds of fragrant flowers, zithers, harps, and lutes—resonant and harmonious, softly echoing throughout the gathering. Phoenixes, peacocks, and parrots soared in orderly flight, circling the assembly.

King Fangcheng and his ministers, seized with great awe, addressed the Heavenly Venerable: “Great Compassionate Heavenly Venerable, why do these celestial beings, youths, and jade maidens scatter such wondrous flowers? Is this fragrant blossom from heaven, or does it arise naturally? Does it grow from trees, or does it exist in empty space?”

Then the Heavenly Venerable, having heard these words, replied: “Not so, great king. These flowers are all pure and inconceivable blossoms. Why? When I speak of purity, it is neither internal nor external, neither born of heaven nor arising naturally, neither growing from trees nor existing in empty space, neither born of being nor born of emptiness. Because it transcends both emptiness and being, this flower is said to arise. Why? All teachings are pure; this purity is the wondrous flower. For this reason, it is neither born of heaven nor arising naturally, neither born of emptiness nor being, nor growing from trees. Why? If there were a birth of birth, there would be verification and faith; with verification and faith, slander would arise. To know this teaching is to destroy the *One Vehicle Great Compassion Sutra*.”

The Heavenly Venerable further addressed King Fangcheng: “Noble one, within this city, such flowers are ever-present, and celestial beings and jade maidens from other realms gather here without cease. Phoenixes, peacocks, parrots, zithers, harps, and rare wonders are always here. Do not doubt. These pure and inconceivable flowers, these rare blossoms, are difficult to conceive and express.”

Hearing this, King Fangcheng rejoiced greatly and asked: “How does the Compassionate Venerable say that celestial flowers are born of purity and freedom from afflictions? If this is so, then all beings who offer these celestial flowers to the Compassionate Venerable would attain realization of birth free from afflictions. If realization is attained solely through flowers, why speak of cultivating Oceanic Emptiness to attain realization?”

The Heavenly Venerable replied to the king: “Good son, when I speak of realization, if one offers these celestial flowers to Oceanic Emptiness, then to say one attains realization is to speak of Oceanic Emptiness itself. Oceanic Emptiness is realization, which is this flower. If one cultivates Oceanic Emptiness and attains realization, one is free from afflictions. Even in hell, there are no afflictions; though manifesting in hell, there is no hell, no body to suffer punishment. Though manifesting as a hungry ghost, there is no hungry ghost, no hunger or thirst, only the perfection of merit and virtue, no body of a hungry ghost. Though manifesting in desire, there is no thought of desire, abiding constantly in radiant light, illuminating the body of afflictions. Though manifesting in anger, there is no thought of anger, only pure and subtle contemplation, no root of anger. Though manifesting in stinginess, there is no thought of stinginess, only vast joy and great compassion, relinquishing the body in generosity, no thought of stinginess. Though manifesting in laziness, there is no thought of laziness. Though entering the demon realm, there is no thought of demons. Though manifesting in teaching the Dharma, there is no thought of teaching. Though dwelling in a jeweled city, there is no thought of a jeweled city. Though manifesting illness, there is no thought of illness. Such a practitioner is one who has realized Oceanic Emptiness. You should make offerings to this flower, for it is the offering to the One Vehicle Oceanic Emptiness, the path of constant bliss. Through skillful means, one enters the city of Oceanic Emptiness and abides immovably.”

Having spoken these words, King Fangcheng and his assembly rose, bowed, knelt, and prostrated, addressing the Heavenly Venerable: “How is it that the Oceanic Emptiness true person of great virtue is our great teacher, expounding for us the wondrous Dharma with various parables, beyond conception? Who are the parents, wife, children, relatives, friends, companions, brothers, and sisters of the Oceanic Emptiness being? Who are the servants, attendants, elephants, horses, chariots, cities, villages, and dwellings? Where are they? Who are the sovereign, the people, the queen, and the crown prince? To whom do they belong? We beseech the Compassionate Venerable to explain and clarify for us.”

Then the Heavenly Venerable, having heard these words, smiled faintly, leaned on his armrest, and replied to the king: “Excellent, excellent, good son! Great king, you have skillfully inquired about the being of Oceanic Emptiness. I shall explain and clarify for you, so that all may understand the *Oceanic Emptiness Sutra*.”

Then the Heavenly Venerable responded in verse:
“You, King Fangcheng,
Listen single-mindedly,
For I shall expound for you.”

“To hear and see directly is already difficult,
How then to realize the empty city of wisdom’s Oceanic Emptiness?
Liberation is taken as mother,
Skillfully expounding the marks of the Dharma—
All are the Oceanic Emptiness’s compassion.
Virtue is taken as wife,
Compassion as eldest daughter,
Great filial piety and wisdom as sons.
The empty city is their dwelling,
Good faith their servants and companions,
Cultivation their spiritual friends.
Quiescence is their kin,
Penetrating understanding their good fields,
Clouds and dragons their galloping elephants and horses.
The constellations are their attendants,
Sun and moon their chariots,
The Six Perfections their neighbors,
The Four Immeasurables their children and grandchildren.
Chanting and singing are their family,
Eternal joy their abode.
The gardens of the Seven Treasures,
The dark capital’s forests,
Coral and wondrous blossoms,
The sweet fruits of expedient means.
The pools of Eightfold Refinement,
The great dew of the Six Superknowledges.
The One Vehicle is their body,
Complete with marks of adornment.
Teaching is their great kindness,
Absorbing essence their Dharma food,
Swallowing saliva their Dharma drink,
Repentance their garments.
Extinction is their funeral director,
Heaven and earth their coffin and outer casket,
The jeweled terrace their tomb,
Wisdom’s sun and moon their light,
Dew and mist their funeral robes and hearse,
Gold and silver their bricks and foundations.
Temporarily ashamed of compassion and filial piety,
Preaching the Dharma to repay kindness—
Pines and cypresses their great wealth.
Yellow essence on clear islets,
The quiet mind their bed and seat,
Extensive learning their marrow of wisdom,
Pure mind their bathing.
Contemplating Oceanic Emptiness in sleep,
Upholding precepts to guard the wise.
The formless is their sovereign lord,
Immortal youths their people,
Sages and perfected ones their ministers,
The Jade Capital their golden city.

You, King Fangcheng,
With a good heart as your companion,
Simply extinguish the thieves of affliction,
And bravely know the Way yourself.
Dispel the four kinds of Māra,
And triumphantly lay the foundation for ten thousand paths.
Oceanic Emptiness has no arising or ceasing,
Yet manifests when there is birth.
Universally appearing in all lands,
Like the sun shining without partiality.
Preaching the Dharma to liberate the ten directions,
Countless beings attain deliverance.
Compassion for others and oneself—
No discriminating thoughts.
Though knowing the eternal honor of eternal joy,
The lands and beings are empty,
Yet constantly practicing purity,
Teaching and transforming sentient beings.
With the power of good expedient means,
All can be accomplished as wished.
Sometimes manifesting old age, sickness, and death,
Perfecting the bodies of beings,
Understanding the Dharma as illusion.
Devas, humans, immortals, and jade maidens,
Attendants scattering flowers.
Princes and ministers,
Seeing the flowers, all are astonished and doubtful.
Comforting all beings,
Offering celestial flowers and food.
Beings cling to permanence,
Yet now realize impermanence.
All beings gather,
Together entering the empty city,
Surrounding the Oceanic Emptiness’s bed,
Asking after illness with sorrowful weeping.
To console and instruct beings,
Expounding the order of Oceanic Emptiness.
Scriptures and mantras,
Benefiting all beings.
The world’s heterodox teachings—
At that time, all leave the household life.
Thereby attaining right wisdom,
False views all vanish.
Sometimes as the light of sun and moon,
Pervading the three realms’ abodes;
Sometimes as wind, water, or fire,
Withering trees so they do not bloom.
When the world suffers from epidemics,
Manifesting as good physicians.
Those who can take the medicine
Dispel illness and the three poisons.
When beings suffer hunger and famine,
Manifesting bodies to provide food.
Dry bones can live again,
And quench thirst in times of drought.
Kings and people,
All rejoice and pay reverence,
Abiding in the Oceanic Emptiness’s city,
Listening to the Dharma without fixed time.”

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy, having spoken this verse, addressed King Fangcheng: “Good son, you should know that the Oceanic Emptiness Body is truly ineffable. The body of past, future, and present abides ever in the city, unshaken and unmoved, neither going nor coming, neither born nor dying. For all beings, it expounds the treasury of teachings, the manifold doctrines and subtle scriptures, ever constant as before. Yet it is not aware, nor holds notions of going or coming.

Sometimes it appears in the form of an elder, revealing to beings the Dharma of impermanence—birth, aging, sickness, and death. Sometimes it takes the form of apes, monkeys, elephants, or horses. Sometimes it manifests its true body, adorned with seventy-two marks and eighty-one excellences, its appearance wondrous and unique, its wisdom unmatched, its virtue profoundly deep. Skillfully expounding the Dharma, for all beings it employs manifold expedient means to transform and guide the Three Vehicles. Following the needs of beings, it manifests bodies, proclaiming the One Vehicle Treasury, universally ferrying beings to transcend the body of afflictions and rebirth, all entering the gateway of Oceanic Emptiness wisdom.”

Thereupon, the four assemblies, having heard this teaching, all rose to bow and praise: “The One Vehicle Oceanic Emptiness True One, for our sake, has distinguished and expounded it. Within our assembly, each of us pays reverence, all receiving the teachings, transmitting and transforming what was unheard before, universally enabling mastery of the unimpeded scriptures, profound comprehension of their mysterious meaning, and realization of the true Dharma ground.”

Then, the four assemblies, having heard the Great Compassionate Venerable One conclude the sutra, gazed upon the honored countenance, took leave, and withdrew.

Thus concludes *Fascicle Nine of the Supreme One Vehicle Oceanic Emptiness Wisdom Treasury Sutra*.
*Fascicle Ten of the Supreme One Vehicle Oceanic Emptiness Wisdom Treasury Sutra* begins.

**Chapter on Universal Record**

At that time, the Heavenly Venerable manifested divine power within the Jeweled City, transforming it into a mysterious terrace, supremely subtle and wondrous. Upon this terrace appeared seven treasures, exquisitely adorned and uniquely splendid, with hanging silken banners and canopies filling the entire space.

Then, the Heavenly Venerable radiated great luminosity from within the terrace, illuminating the ten directions and boundless worlds, so that all lands in the ten directions became resplendently bright. At that moment, the celestial great sages, flying deva-kings, cinnabar immortals of the primordial beginning, supreme celestial lords, the August Emperor of the Fusang Jade Dawn, all heavenly perfected ones, the left and right perfected ones, perfected youths, earthly immortals and Daoist adepts, demon-kings of the three realms, dragon-kings of the myriad seas, good men and good women, both human and non-human, all gathered at the seat to hear the Great Compassionate Venerable expound the *Oceanic Emptiness Wisdom Treasury of the One Vehicle*. Overjoyed in their hearts, each brought hundred-fold blended incense that emitted fragrance without burning. Celestial musicians played in unison, circumambulating and praising, offering priceless treasures.

Then, the Heavenly Venerable, wishing to withdraw the divine radiance, returned to the unshakable abode of the Jade Capital’s Ever-Joyful Lodge. He addressed Oceanic Emptiness, saying: “If any have doubts, now is the time to ask and resolve them swiftly. The supreme Dharma treasure will soon enter samādhi. Among you, if any harbor uncertainties, speak now without regret.”

At that time, among the assembly was a Daoist named Precious Radiance. Hearing the Great Compassionate Venerable’s words, he wept bitterly, unable to restrain himself: “Alas, Compassionate Venerable, why do you return to the unshakable abode? We lesser immortals are left desolate and exposed.”

Then, from among the assembly arose a divine youth of inconceivable, supreme perfection. Rising from his seat, he bowed deeply, prostrated twice, and knelt to address the Heavenly Venerable: “I wish to ask a question—will there still be time? I pray the Compassionate Venerable will not deem it an offense.”

Thereupon, the Heavenly Venerable praised the youth, saying: “Excellent, youth! Your merit and virtue are inconceivable. You are the wellspring of human and divine wisdom, fully equipped to transform and guide all beings.”

Then the youth addressed the Great Compassionate Heavenly Venerable: “After the Great Compassionate Heavenly Venerable’s passing in the past, all beings no longer beheld the Compassionate Venerable’s physical form, nor could they hear the true Dharma of Oceanic Emptiness. Why is this? In the future world, people will grow shallow and insincere, wholesome Dharma will gradually decline, and unwholesome Dharma will flourish.”

At that time, teaching all beings to cultivate the fruits of merit and virtue was most sublime, enabling them to cross beyond the city of afflictions. Yet I pray the Compassionate Venerable will take special pity—though they expend vast wealth, the share of merit and fruit is meager, not even matching a fraction.

Good man, if there are beings who make offerings to the Heavenly Venerables of the ten directions and the Three Realms, to all the Great Sages, the Three Heavenly Perfected Ones, and the earthbound immortals and Daoist adepts, such offerings do not compare to one who, with a heart of compassion for all, gives even a single mouthful of food to a beast, saving its life and ensuring its peace. Such merit is most supreme, surpassing the former by a hundred thousand myriad times. Such a mind of giving yields boundless, immeasurable merit and virtue.

Good man, in all the true scriptures of the Dharma where I expound on giving, my aim is to inspire newly practicing earthbound immortals, Daoist adepts—whether ordained or lay—good men and good women, to awaken the mind of Oceanic Emptiness, cultivate the practice of compassion, and give alms to the poor, the orphaned, the aged, the sick, the distressed, the imprisoned, those suffering from hunger and cold, and all who are destitute and starving, so that all may be fully sated. Such givers are called bridges, ferrying beings across the sea of birth and death.

Good man, in the future, beings will fail to comprehend my Dharma, focusing solely on the Field of Reverence while neglecting the Field of Compassion. Good man, what is the Field of Reverence? When beings pay homage to the Heavenly Venerables of the ten directions and the Three Realms and make offerings to the Three Treasures, this is called the Field of Reverence. What is the Field of Compassion? Good man, when beings make offerings with a heart of compassion, without discrimination, even to beasts, this is called the Field of Compassion.

Good man, of these two fields, the Field of Compassion is most supreme. If one gives to the Field of Compassion, such a person’s merit and virtue are vast beyond measure, unbounded by the empty sky.

Good man, if there are beings with abundant wealth who practice giving alone, from birth until old age without ceasing, such a person does not compare to one who, regardless of poverty or wealth, nobility or lowliness, wisdom or folly, whether ordained or lay, exhorts others together, each contributing money and goods, pooling them in one place, and distributing them as needed to the poor, the orphaned, the aged, those with grave illnesses, the severely sick, and those in dire straits, ensuring all are treated equally. Such merit is greatest and immeasurable. Even if one does not give, with every thought, the power of giving constantly arises, never exhausted.

Good man, in the future, my disciples—newly practicing Daoist adepts—will delight in fine clothing, crave rich flavors, seek profit and support, hoard with stinginess, and fail to cultivate a heart of compassion, indulging instead in anger and resentment. Seeing others do good, they harbor jealousy, feigning mockery and scorn, claiming such people seek fame and gain, not the way of our Daoist adepts. When they see alms given to the poor and beggars, they grow even more resentful. Such thoughts are not the mind of one who has left the household life.

Those who follow my Dharma yet practice stinginess, clinging to defiled attachments, seek only immediate results to sustain themselves. Seeing my true Dharma, they utter all manner of evil words, generating disbelief. They lead households and convert the people, yet only cultivate the lesser vehicle’s conditioned practices. Why trouble others with such disturbances, causing them to see only superficial clarity?

Then the Heavenly Venerable addressed the youth, saying: “You are able to inquire thus, building bridges of Dharma, constructing stairways of Dharma. Excellent, good man! The beings of the future world are most pitiable. Why is this?”

All beings, though they possess faith and exert themselves in ascetic practices, fail to grasp the true principle. Though they amass merit ever more, their reward remains meager.

Good man, in the world to come, Daoists of the Three Realms—male and female officials, kings and great ministers, the wealthy and the honored, men and women, humans and non-humans—will scorn my Dharma, belittle the Three Treasures, and regard them as insubstantial. Though they perform many good deeds, they seek only fame and profit, or strive to surpass others. Not one among them will generate a single thought of transcendence.

Good man, it is like an entertainer who displays various skills to delight the crowd—yet such an entertainer does not act from a heart of true joy. Good man, the Daoists of the Three Realms who practice the Dharma in its latter age are likewise.

After my passing, the true Dharma will fade and vanish, while demonic forces arise. Perverse minds flourish, cunning schemes proliferate, and calamities and poisons vie to emerge.

Good man, what constitutes perversity? All Daoists and laypeople, ignorant of the Dharma’s norms, perform good deeds by hosting gatherings in their homes. They invite masters out of attachment, listing names for separate invitations, sending attendants to guard the gates to bar outside masters from entering. Even the poor or sick who come seeking alms are blocked and denied entry. Such gatherings waste food and drink, yielding no merit whatsoever.

There are also those who seek only their own goodness, refusing to teach others. Seeing others perform good deeds, they cannot rejoice or contribute even a small portion. The merit of such people is meager and inferior.

Others, upon seeing temples, images, or scriptures in disrepair, refuse to restore them, instead uttering evil words: “This was not built by my ancestors’ legacy. Why repair what is already ruined? I would rather build something new than restore what stands.” Such people act from self-regard, not from regard for me; their merit is self-serving, not for my sake.

Why is this? For all beings, building anew does not compare to repairing what exists—the merit is far greater. Those who restore the old will behold my form and enter the boundless treasury of the Dharma, the empty and true ground.

Good man, there are also beings who, seeing others gather to perform meritorious deeds, seek only fame and renown, expending their entire households’ wealth in giving. Yet when they see the poor and destitute, they scold and drive them away, offering not even a hair’s worth. Such people are inverted in their goodness, deluded in their practice of giving, falsely cultivating the mind of generosity while harboring no true compassion or intention to give. Their giving is not true, their merit not pure. They sow the seeds of hell and reap the fruits of the three evil destinies.

Such beings are most pitiable. Their efforts are futile, their merit lost. Better to guard and transform the people’s resources—this is the greatest merit.

Good man, those who harbor such thoughts are not true renunciates; they are minions of Māra, their minds those of outsiders, not my disciples. When such people die, they fall into the great hells, enduring suffering for ages. Emerging from hell, they enter the realm of hungry ghosts, suffering great torment. Leaving the hungry ghosts, they take five hundred births as oxen, horses, pigs, or sheep, or even as dogs. After leaving the dog’s body, they endure five hundred lifetimes in poverty and lowliness, afflicted by hunger, thirst, and manifold sufferings, never knowing a moment of ease. Why? Because when they saw others giving, they did not rejoice.

Good man, my attainment of the Dao arose from countless eons of practicing compassion and giving, aiding the poor and those in distress. All the Heavenly Venerables of the ten directions who have attained the true Dao did so through giving, thereby reaching the realm of eternal joy and immovability.

For this reason, I expound in manifold ways to all beings, teaching equanimity, compassion, joy, and renunciation as the foundation for beginners.

Good man, it is like a man whose legs are both broken, yet who wishes to travel far. He cannot advance, but instead falls in one place, and no matter how he strives, he cannot proceed.

Good man, stingy Daoists are likewise. Though they practice as Daoists and don the great Dharma robes, even after eons of practice, if they do not give, they cannot reach the empty and true ground of the Dharma.

Good man, if a Daoist does not practice giving, their Dharma is incomplete. If their Dharma is incomplete, they lack the heart of compassion. Without compassion, they lack the heart of forbearance. Without forbearance, they lack the heart of diligence. Without diligence, they lack the heart of skillful means. Without skillful means, they lack the heart of wisdom. Without wisdom, they will constantly endure afflictions, taking birth as oxen or horses, subject to others’ commands, unable to speak, walking on four legs, devoid of human consciousness, ever suffering.

Good man, if even one person gives of the Dharma, all the Heavenly Venerables of the ten directions will praise, revere, and honor them, teaching them the true treasury of the One Vehicle. For this reason, among all meritorious deeds, giving of wealth is supreme.

Good man, I have also taught in manifold skillful ways: entering fire to temper the body and receive the Dharma; entering the great sea to transform the dragon kings; manifesting as the sick to harmonize medicine; appearing as the poor to share in dedication; expounding talismans and diagrams to subdue the cunning and violent; exhorting the acceptance of precepts to protect my Dharma; encouraging forbearance to refine the mind and cultivate diligence; praising wisdom to skillfully teach all beings and lead them out of the city of afflictions.

Good man, in the future, Daoists will not understand my intent. They will employ various expedients, each clinging to their own views, proclaiming their own abilities, deceiving and confusing the people, and envying one another. Such people are evil Daoists, not to be approached. They extinguish the true Dharma and destroy my empty nature.

When assemblies gather to expound the Dharma, if they fail to grasp its profound meaning and merely assert their own interpretations, slandering the One Vehicle’s treasury of oceanic emptiness and wisdom—claiming that one should cling to the text alone, thus violating true reality and the supreme true Dharma, while boasting, “My words alone accord with right principle”—good man, such evil Daoists who speak thus are demonic kin, masters of external paths, practitioners of the lesser vehicle who lead households to convert the people. Those who do so will forever sink into the three wretched destinies, shuttling back and forth beneath the wind’s blades, dying and being reborn day after day, beaten relentlessly with metal cudgels, never resting to eat or breathe. Hungry, they eat charcoal; thirsty, they drink fiery essence. After ten thousand kalpas, they may be reborn among humans, yet deaf, blind, mute, and dumb—possessing human form but lacking human sentiment.

Good man, these evil Daoists further declare, “Such people are foolish, like stumps or stones. You seek fame and reputation—yet the Dao resides in the heart. Why study scriptures and treatises? What practice do you cultivate?” Those who speak thus are evil companions, not to be approached; they are demonic deviants, taking demons as their kin.

Good man, these evil Daoists, for the sake of fame and profit, slander one another, disregarding the scriptures and Dharma. They insist on their own views, taking falsehood for truth, unable to distinguish right from wrong. They go among Daoists and laypeople, declaring, “I know what is right; I alone can recognize what is wrong.” Those who speak thus destroy my Dharma; they are evil companions, not to be approached.

Good man, when evil Daoists fail to grasp the profound meaning of the scriptures, they claim, “In the Great Vehicle, I am permitted to eat meat.” Those who speak thus are evil companions, teachers of perverse views, not to be approached.

Good man, if there are Daoists who comprehend my true nature—emptiness without the form of eating, emptiness without distinction—who employ various expedient means to transform beings: for those who can be liberated through a lustful form, they manifest a lustful form; for those who can be liberated through an ordinary form, they manifest an ordinary form; for those who can be liberated through a sick form, they manifest a sick form; for those who can be liberated through the form of a king, they manifest the form of a king; for those who can be liberated through the form of a Daoist, they manifest the form of a Daoist. For those who can be liberated, they manifest the appropriate form, constantly expounding the Dharma. Though their minds remain unmoved, they display movement; though they do not manifest a body, they display manifestation; though they do not assume a true body, they display true appearance; though they do not transform beings, they display transformation. Those who speak thus are great Dharma masters, eternally abiding in the “Seven-Treasure City” within the oceanic emptiness, expounding the Dharma for others, liberating beings, and guiding them into the treasury of the One Vehicle’s true emptiness.

Good man, today, among the countless youths in this assembly, each perceives me differently. Some see my body on Mount Xuandu, serene and unmoving; some see my body dwelling in the world, expounding the Dharma; some see my body, sixteen feet tall, supremely dignified; some see a small body, some a large one; some see my body seated upon a jeweled lotus; some see my body liberating beings, guiding them into the treasury; some see the inconceivable oceanic emptiness.

Good man, my teaching and transformation adapt to impermanent forms, whether wandering, abiding, or acting—all far removed from worldly appearances, yet without departing from worldly manifestations, unfolding the forms of Dharma-expounding. Even if one speaks but a single verse, a single line, or a single phrase of the oceanic emptiness Dharma, should someone chant it with kind words and great joy, such merit, suited to the roots of beings, brings manifold benefits: flourishing households, prosperous descendants—merits beyond reckoning.

Good man, evil Daoists who do not understand my meaning expound the Three Caverns and the thirty-six divisions of scriptures, clinging to the text for meaning and forming fixed views on existence and non-existence. Know that such people destroy my Dharma.

Good man, newly ordained Daoists who boast, “I am capable,” calling themselves Dharma masters, liberation masters, or scripture masters—those who, within my Dharma gate, engage in mutual praise or slander—these three kinds of people will enter hell without relinquishing their minds. Such beings are truly pitiable.

Then, the four assemblies, having heard the Great Compassionate Venerable One speak these words, each rose, weeping and bowing, kneeling to prostrate themselves and receive the prediction.

At that time, among the assembly, the youthful Perfected Ones again addressed the question: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, you have expounded that evil Daoists destroy my Dharma. When will such Dharma appear? When will these evil Daoists perish? We beseech the Heavenly Worthy to explain this for our sake.”

Then the Heavenly Worthy replied to the youths: “Good man, after my passing, the true Dharma will spread universally, the people will flourish, kings will practice the Dao, free from premature death, harm, killing, greed, and love. The people, men and women alike, will be without jealousy. Good man, after eight thousand years, the true Dharma will retreat into hiding, and evil Dharma will gradually arise. Kings will lack the Dao, the people will delight in harm, jealousy will prevail, greed and malice will lurk in the shadows, attacking roots and overthrowing rulers, killing without measure. After eight hundred and seventy years, evil Daoists will pervade the land, failing to practice the Dao and Dharma, seeking wealth instead, engaging in unlawful acts, amassing the eight kinds of impure goods. Lacking talent and wisdom, they gather disciples, create their own teachings, transmit inappropriate ordinations, fabricate scriptures, and disseminate them throughout the realm. For these reasons, all laypeople will despise the Three Treasures, defile and insult the Heavenly Lords, slander in various ways, cultivate disbelief, destroy heavenly texts, shatter talismans and diagrams, and demolish halls, dwellings, images, and Dharma bodies.”

For these reasons, the sun and moon will lose their radiance, yin and yang will fall out of harmony, the five grains will fail to ripen, wind and rain will come unseasonably, and dragons will long remain in the depths. The people will harbor malice and envy, delight in killing, vie in ostentation and extravagance, and covet wealth and rank. Benevolence and righteousness will cease to be practiced, and even those with meager riches will be grudged. The noble and the base, each according to their station, will be consumed by thoughts of sensual desire.

At such a time, even if one person should arouse the slightest good intention—erecting halls, fashioning images of the Three Treasures, transcribing true Dharma scriptures, or constructing terraces, halls, and cloisters—such a person will still be unable to generate a heart of reverence, unable to cultivate the mind of offering to Dharma masters, and unwilling to relinquish food, clothing, or bedding. Instead, they will further borrow and beg, consuming the master’s sustenance, without ever reflecting in dread upon the suffering of the three evil destinies in future lives.

Good man, when all laypeople set their minds to doing good, they do so solely to encroach upon and diminish the property of the Three Treasures. Such people, though they feign merit-making, will forever fall into the bodies of the three evil destinies and hungry ghosts.

Good man, in the future age, all laypeople will falsely assume official titles, disbelieve in the consequences of sin and blessing, and show no reverence for the Three Treasures. They will plunder the belongings of masters—food, clothing, and utensils—even levying taxes on the grain, rice, and prepared meals of the monastic community, seizing so much as a single hair of the Three Treasures’ property. Or they will forcibly drive the Three Treasures’ servants and slaves, or compel the Three Treasures’ oxen and horses to bear them, greedily taking slaves and servants for their own use, coercing monastics into becoming wives and concubines, without ever reflecting upon the copper pillars and iron beds that await them in future lives, nor considering that their own bodies are like dead dogs on the road, like illusion, like dream, like lightning, like a flash of light.

Good man, if in this evil age there should be one person who, through manifold expedient means, liberates sentient beings, cultivates the heart of compassion and the heart of wisdom, receives and upholds the *Sutra of the Ocean-Emptiness Treasury of Single-Vehicle Wisdom*, and recites it single-mindedly day and night without cease—such a practitioner is one who truly brings forth the Dharma to act in the world.

Good man, after the reign of the Three Dragons, the Dharma King will appear to govern and transform. Then I, too, will once more expound the Dharma for sentient beings. At such a time, the true Dharma will prevail in the world.

Good man, in the future age, the reason all monastics and laypeople will despise the Dharma is precisely because those evil, greedy, and lustful Daoists fail to practice the Dharma. Though they don the robes of the Dharma, they pursue worldly entanglements: some haunt markets and bazaars, selling goods to sustain themselves; others travel the roads, trading for profit; still others take up the work of painters or skilled artisans.

Some act as physiognomists, divining the fortunes of men and women; others serve as diviners, revealing to people good and ill omens; still others pose as spirit-mediums, compelling others to bow in worship. Through manifold deceptions, they drink wine to the point of intoxication and disorder, singing and dancing for pleasure. Some, flattering and distorting the Dharma, preach to curry favor; others chant spells and incantations to cure diseases; or else they dwell in the mountains yet cling to worldly greed, employing perverse meditative methods to divine fortune and misfortune. Some practice acupuncture and moxibustion or compound various medicines to secure clothing and food. For these reasons, when such evils are extinguished, my Dharma too shall perish—hence it is called the extinction of the Dharma.

Good man, after my passing, when eight hundred million kalpas have elapsed, all such evil Daoists will at last be utterly destroyed.

Good man, in the future age, monastics and laypeople will fashion images—some large, some small, of gold, silver, bronze, or wood—and sell them for money to sustain themselves. Therein, the foolish, unable to discern sin from merit, will purchase and make offerings to them. Such people, both buyer and seller, incur guilt, and for three lifetimes shall be sold by others, reduced to slavery and servitude, beaten and abused at will.

Good man, if there are beings of even the slightest good intention who fashion images yet fail to complete them, leaving them lacking in proper features—some half-formed, with hands and feet unfinished—or who begin new images elsewhere without finishing them, such people shall suffer the torments of the three evil destinies, reborn as serpents without limbs.

Good man, if there are beings who, within their kitchens, jointly decree prohibitions, barring mendicants from approaching their places of food, such people, upon death, shall be reborn in hell, as hungry ghosts, or among beasts, forever partaking of filth and walking on all fours.

Good man, if there are beings who treat the Three Treasures as their own possessions, taking and using them at will, consuming them untimely and without restraint, and who, having left the household life together, regard one another as spiritual companions—such people, in future lives, shall be born far from the realms of humans and gods, dwelling perpetually among border tribes, never hearing the Dharma. Upon death, they shall fall into the three evil destinies, with no ground for repentance.

Good man, if those who have left the household life dwell with such people, though they may perform meritorious deeds in their hearts, their merit shall not come to fruition, and they shall be broken by others. Such people, upon death, shall enter the great flaming cart of hell, burned and boiled by others, with no possibility of repentance. Even if someone advocates for their rescue, that person too shall incur guilt.

Good man, if there are beings who, seeing Daoists cultivate compassion and, upon witnessing living creatures being bought and sold, release them, mock them, saying, “These Daoists seek fame. What merit lies in the lives of these creatures that you would set them free?”—such people shall meet with sudden death, their souls reborn as starving vultures in desolate mountains.

Good man, if in this evil age there is one who arouses the resolve to cultivate and study, embodying great compassion and forbearance, enduring the vexations of others, and diligently reciting the scriptures, let them reflect thus: “All sentient beings, from beginningless time, have been my parents; all sentient beings, from beginningless time, have been my brothers, my sisters, my wives and children, all my kin. For this reason, all sentient beings are my flesh and blood, all sentient beings are my very life.” In accordance with their capacity, let them refrain from consuming raw or cooked meat, abandon the thought of killing, cultivate great compassion, abstain from impure flavors, eat but once a day, refuse additional offerings, and rescue sentient beings from distress and suffering through manifold expedient means, sparing neither body nor life.

Then, the gods, kings, and ministers shall all rejoice, and with their divine powers, they shall protect and assist such a person, ensuring they do not regress. They shall also lend their strength to prevent evil people from obstructing them or seizing their possessions. The merit of such assistance is beyond measure.

Good man, if there is one who, with a heart of compassion, practices equitable giving to all the destitute and distressed, without partiality, such merit is supreme and foremost.

Good man, were I to expound the gates of merit through giving for kalpas unending, I could not exhaust them. Now, as the wheel of impermanence turns, I vow to enter extinction for your sake, briefly entrusting these words to you. You must apply yourselves diligently to ascetic practice, uphold and contemplate the teachings, fathom their profound meaning, expound them to others, and distinguish the gates of meaning, that they may attain the foremost.

Thereupon, the assembly of the Fourfold Assembly and the Perfected Youths, having heard the Great Compassionate One speak these words, foreseeing the future age when the true Dharma would decline, beset by manifold calamities and evil Daoists who would defile the true Dharma gate, stood with hair standing on end in reverence. Gazing upon the Honored One’s countenance, they wept in sorrow, unable to restrain themselves: “Alas, O Compassionate One! We are orphaned and exposed, bereft of the root of the Dharma, bereft of our great refuge and teacher. What shall we do? What shall we do?”

Then the Heavenly Worthy addressed the great assembly: “Perfected Youths, restrain yourselves, do not weep. You must understand that the world is impermanent: the good must turn to evil, the flourishing must decline, the existent must become nonexistent, the strong must grow old. Again, I say to you, set aside these matters. By what marks do you perceive my embodied form that you weep? By what marks do you perceive the bodies of sentient beings that you lose the root of your lineage? By what marks do you perceive all dharmas that you lament thus?”

Thereupon, the Perfected Youths wiped their tears, rose, and knelt, addressing the Heavenly Worthy: “We observe that the Compassionate One does not arise from a prior limit, does not reach the other shore, does not abide in the world, nor is he existent or nonexistent, neither existent nor nonexistent, neither non-existent nor non-nonexistent. He is neither manifest nor hidden, neither form nor formless, neither conditioned nor unconditioned, neither in birth-and-death nor in cessation-and-permanence. He is equal to empty space, without marks of discrimination.”

From the first attainment of the Dao to final quiescence—
I have never seen the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy utter a single word of dharma.
Yet when I observe sentient beings, I see the Great Compassionate One emerging and vanishing, expounding the dharma to liberate them.
The boundless realm of joy of the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy is inconceivable, unknowable by cognition, ungraspable by discernment.
For this reason, tears flow.
I only beseech the Heavenly Worthy to expound and distinguish these matters for us.

Now, observing sentient beings again, I ask: which of the four great elements constitutes the self?
They are like clouds in empty space, like mirages in the heat, like the flash of flint, like the moon in water, like illusion, like transformation, like reflections in a mirror, like echoes in the void.
Form, perception, volition, and consciousness—all are thus.
The nature of sentient beings’ minds is inconceivable, beyond the ken of the Two Vehicles.
The nature of sentient beings, O Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy, is likewise:
neither coming nor going, neither existent nor nonexistent, neither internal nor external.
Coming from nowhere, going nowhere, yet constantly flowing and turning,
falsely suffering affliction—all because sentient beings, from beginningless time, have clung to the notion of a self,
nurturing evil roots and enduring boundless afflictions.

The nature of sentient beings is the source of smoldering delusion,
yet the spirit’s essence is originally pure, serene and unstained.
All dharmas arise from this.
For this reason, all the good and evil karma of sentient beings is created by the one mind alone; no other dharma exists.
Thus, sentient beings neither come nor go, neither exist nor do not exist,
equal to empty space, without discriminating thoughts.

O Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy, such is my observation of the nature of sentient beings and dharmas.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy praised the Perfected Youth, saying:
“Excellent, excellent! O Perfected Youth, you have spoken well.
Among all who understand the dharma, you are foremost.
One who comprehends the nature of sentient beings is most venerable,
skilled in expounding the marks of the dharma, no different from myself.
I approve and confirm your teaching, which brings benefit.
You shall be named *Sea of Empty Dharma Treasury*, a Heavenly Worthy accomplished in the dharma.

Good son, you have understood that sentient beings have neither coming-and-going nor existence-and-nonexistence.
You should know that equanimous giving is called for.
When giving, observe whether the field is one of merit or not.
If you see impoverished, suffering, or ailing beings, bestow upon them the finest medicines.
When practicing giving, contemplate thus:
neither giver nor recipient is seen; the wealth is likewise empty.
At that time, the three factors—giver, recipient, and gift—are all empty, equanimous, and unimpeded.
Why? All dharmas are pure and selfless.
When giving, do not expect reward, nor seek future joys in the human or heavenly realms.
Rather, seek the great fruit of liberation and supreme peace for sentient beings.
When giving, do so to gather in evil beings and establish them in wholesome dharmas.

Further, contemplate thus:
the Three Realms are empty, the Three Times are empty.
Knowing the Three Times are empty, one’s own body is also empty.
Knowing one’s body is empty, all dharmas are also empty.
Because dharmas are empty, this is called *Sea of Emptiness*.
Relying on scriptural words, one liberates sentient beings,
abiding in the true ground of the *Sea of Emptiness*,
attaining spiritual powers and perceiving manifold forms.

Good son, it is like a man dreaming at night of various events:
he dreams of being bound by officials, enduring manifold sufferings, filled with great sorrow and distress, then suddenly freed.
Moments later, he dreams of becoming a great king, wielding sovereign power and enjoying boundless bliss.
In the dream, he thinks: ‘Just now I suffered so, and now I am free, experiencing such joy.’
Having thought thus, he suddenly awakens—
the suffering and joy of the dream vanish without a trace.
Such dream-events are neither existent nor nonexistent.
All dharmas are likewise.

Good son, having attained spiritual powers and comprehended the nature of sentient beings—
this is right contemplation, this is right view.”

Now you have advanced to the *Sea of Emptiness* dharma-position, and countless youths have entered the seat of the One Vehicle’s wisdom treasury. Whatever they cultivate, they all attain the gateway to superior wisdom. Countless beings arouse the mind to leave the household life; countless beings arouse the mind of generosity. Whether human or non-human, male or female, all attain spiritual powers.

Then, having spoken these words, the Heavenly Venerable addressed the youths: “Good son, in the future, if even one being hears this sutra and generates a joyful mind, the merit such a one gains will be boundless and immeasurable, beyond all speech. If, moreover, someone delights in receiving and upholding it, seals it within the heart, memorizes it with clarity, and contemplates it day and night—reading, reciting, expounding, and teaching it for the benefit of beings—receiving the prediction of enlightenment, know that this sutra universally bestows upon the solitary and destitute. Such a person is my true child; all their words are my own speech. Through this causal condition, the words and language become my boundless [expression].

I shall now return my spirit to the quiescent samadhi-position. Moved by compassion for all beings, adrift and exposed, I entrust this to you, to succeed me as Dharma King and broadly proclaim the true path for all beings. Good son, it is like a king who, wishing to travel through his realms and inspect his myriad subjects, entrusts the treasuries of his domain to the crown prince, to succeed him in the royal enterprise.

Good son, I now entrust this to you in the same way.”

Upon hearing this entrustment, the great assembly rose, made obeisance, wept and wailed, their heads touching the ground, their voices shaking the realm—whether human or non-human—snapping their fingers and lamenting: “Alas! Alas! How could the Venerable One abandon us, losing the root of the Dharma?” Then, having wept and grieved, each knelt in sorrow, their lamentation stilled.

At that time, the youth of Auspicious Marks, from within the great assembly, stepped before the Venerable One and offered this gatha:

“Supreme Venerable One of the primordial heavens,
Marvelous, subtle, most true mark—
Manifesting bodies upon bodies in manifold forms,
Permeating the true Dharma, eternally boundless.

For me, for conditions, universally equal,
Ultimately resolved, entering impermanence—
Entrusting the Dharma King, foremost in the Dharma,
Your skillful words of instruction—do not forget!

Among us, the four assemblies of conditions,
Weeping and shedding tears, utterly without thought—
How could the Great Compassionate, Great Merciful One
Abandon conditions, abandon us, quiescent and formless?

Alas! We are ever adrift and exposed—
Only wish for your compassion, pity us!
Like a newborn calf,
Feeble in drinking the Dharma-milk, weak in strength—
How could you, in a single moment, forsake your original vow?
The world’s exposure cannot be compared!

We beseech the true Dharma-taste of the *Sea of Emptiness*,
Universally sprinkling the sweet dew-medicine upon all beings.
Whether human or non-human, equally benefiting,
The four demons and three poisons extinguished without remainder.

Benefiting humans, devas, and those among humans,
No longer dwelling forever in hell or empty space.
Karmic retribution clearly and distinctly understood—
Together transcending birth and death, ascending to the celestial abode.

O true one of the *Sea of Emptiness*, through great compassion,
For us, beseech the Great Master—
Universally benefiting all beings to perfect fulfillment,
The demon kings of the three realms extinguished without end.

Devas and jade maidens come to praise and admire,
The Jeweled Terrace Mountain manifests marvelous marks.
Fragrant flowers fill the empty sky and fall,
At that time, the assembly of humans and devas all pay reverence.

Suddenly ascending to the ninefold heavens,
Bowing in homage to the Master of the Mystic Capital of Eternal Joy.
Looking down upon the city of beings below,
All aspire to the treasure realm of the *Sea of Emptiness*—
Universally receiving, whether human or non-human.”

Then, having spoken this gatha, the youth of Supreme Perfection knelt, prostrated, and addressed the Heavenly Venerable: “Great Compassionate Heavenly Venerable, for our sake, you return your spirit to impermanence, expounding the Dharma of no-self. For the sake of no-self, you speak of self. Through this, there is permanence and impermanence, joy and non-joy, birth and non-birth, lord and non-lord, emptiness and non-emptiness. For this causal condition, you entrust the Dharma King to succeed in guiding beings, that they not grow lax, exhorting them to seek future wisdom and broadly proclaim the One Vehicle’s treasury of *Sea of Emptiness* wisdom.

We reflect: the Great Compassionate Heavenly Venerable,
Unborn yet born—birth has no dharma to abide;
Undying yet dying—death has no dharma to extinguish.
For our sake, there is birth and death;
For our sake, there is the return of spirit,
Entering the treasury of the *Sea of Emptiness*,
Abiding in the realm of eternal joy, beyond thought.”

Then, having heard these words, the Heavenly Venerable emitted a subtle and wondrous sound, praising the youth: “Good sons, your wisdom surpasses even mine. You are worthy to be Dharma Lords, to succeed in guiding beings, causing them to dwell in the city of bliss within the *Sea of Emptiness*, and to accomplish the source of all beings’ wisdom. Now, wait but a moment, and you shall see me.”

Having spoken thus, he suddenly vanished, seated in emptiness without a master.

The four assemblies wept in unison, their eyes straining in all directions, yet unable to see him. Lifting their heads to the heavens, they wailed in anguish: “Alas! We are now orphaned and exposed, having lost the root of the Dharma, without refuge or resting place—like newborn infants bereft of their great compassionate mother, cut off in the prime of life. The Great Compassionate Heavenly Venerable! We are now as they are, having lost the Great Compassionate Venerable, severed from the milk of the Dharma, just so.”

Then, having heard these words, the four assemblies snapped their fingers in unison, paid their respects, and withdrew.

*The Supreme One Vehicle Sūtra of the Treasury of Wisdom in the Sea of Emptiness, Scroll Ten, concludes.*
