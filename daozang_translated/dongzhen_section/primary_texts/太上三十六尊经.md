**Jade Clarity Realm, Supreme Clarity Scripture** (First)

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy spoke: When all perfected beings and boundless great spirits cultivate the mind of the Dao and practice the acts of compassion, they attain the realm of true dharma. When they cultivate the mind of relinquishment and practice the acts of wisdom, through these merits—even after immeasurable kalpas—what dharma do they again attain?

All the sacred hosts of heaven, all great perfected beings, and boundless great spirits who practice these merits can attain the inconceivable.

The Heavenly Worthy now expounds this dharma, enabling all to know this teaching.

The Precious Dharma Perfected One said: Your servant has yet to comprehend the essential dharma, has yet to recognize the fundamental source, has yet to fathom the mark of emptiness, has yet to understand all things.

The Dao replied: Excellent, excellent! You know the time well and understand my exposition of the dharma. You now inquire of the perfected beings, great spirits, and boundless sacred hosts who cultivate all practices and all wisdoms. They attain effortless peace and abide in the palace of true emptiness, equality, and self-mastery over all dharmas—the realm of unexcelled joy, the land of merit and virtue, the kingdom of radiant sovereignty.

You should know that all sentient beings endure immeasurable suffering and manifold sorrows. Yet now, all equally restore their bodies to their original state, receive every bliss, and escape birth and death. They neither change nor differ, truly and rightly abiding in the skillful means of the dharma. In future ages, they will possess skillful arts and techniques, establish abundant meritorious deeds, cultivate the practice of generosity, and honor with reverence.

Speaking thus, excellent indeed!

All of you can also, within the heaven of heavens and in the world, greatly augment and benefit all matters, enabling sentient beings to attain immeasurable lifespans.

You are now the third of the great physicians, skillfully treating the immeasurable grave illnesses of sentient beings. You skillfully administer remedies and prescriptions, healing everywhere without pause. For sentient beings, you eradicate the roots of illness, employing skillful means to treat all manner of diseases. Gradually wandering, you benefit sentient beings with immeasurable joy.

Among all assemblies, you are the most supreme and revered.

By what causes and conditions have you now attained such wisdom and encountered such merit?

Holding precepts and cultivative concentration—most difficult indeed to attain such supreme fields of merit. All such matters arise from past karmic conditions, spanning past, future, and present, yielding vast and distant karmic retribution: forms refined and wondrous, appearances singular and distinguished, majesty and virtue fully endowed. They enable all to dwell in peace and receive joy, then relinquish all manner of illnesses—countless hundreds of thousands of fears—able to dispel them, able to establish for sentient beings great merit and transgression.

Unborn and illusory, the world’s emptiness and existence—this body is impermanent, this body is impure, this body is like an illusion, this body is like a dream, this body is like a bubble’s reflection, this body is like floating clouds, this body is like fierce fire, this body is like wind and dew, this body is like frost and snow. Contemplating thus, most fearful indeed, most loathsome indeed. Seeking the supreme quiescence of Nirvāṇa, forever parted from sorrow, most supremely pure, beyond the mutations of impermanence, resting from the cycle of birth and death, free from all dust-like burdens, with immeasurable focused thought, wisdom, and merit—perfecting the wondrous Dharma-body, adorned with the hundred virtues, praised by all devas.

Thus, boundless and immeasurable, making this great vow, he spoke in verse:

In past kalpas without measure,
for all sentient beings,
I illuminated the true Dao.
Surveying all things,
like the unmoving,
yet unharmed,
by the power of liberation.

Were one to speak of it,
endless kalpas would not suffice.

If there be a perfected one,
or one still learning:
let them relinquish what is hard to relinquish.
Because it is hard to relinquish,
with body unharmed—
this is the true Dao.

The *Wondrous True Scripture of the Jade Clarity Realm*, Chapter Two

Such is the supreme Dharma, boundless in great compassion. Cultivating the mind, cultivating all dharmas, it is foremost in courage and vigor among all learners—unfathomable, wondrous, like the supreme Dao, beyond all comparison, vast as the great sea, equal to empty space.

Countless devas and great sages, innumerable perfected ones and divine spirits, all rejoiced and spoke thus, desiring to seek the supreme, correct, and wondrous Dharma.

The Heavenly Worthy said: "You dwell in the realm of empty equality, difficult to surpass, where there is no perception of father or mother, brothers or kin, acquaintances, sisters, children, or those of love and hate—just as empty space has no father or mother, no brothers, and even no sentient beings or lifespans. All dharmas are likewise. With a mind of equality, benefiting many, like empty space itself—why? Because by practicing virtue and skillfully cultivating all the dharmas of emptiness, the inner dharma of emptiness is attained: constant bliss, true self, purity, and fearlessness.

Within this inner dharma, though the nature of the Dao exists, this nature is neither inner nor outer, neither above nor below, neither existent nor nonexistent. Its true nature is eternal, unchanging—this is called the true teaching. Observing inner emptiness, outer emptiness, and the emptiness of the original nature of all dharmas—impermanent, suffering and joyful, pure and impure—this is called the correct Dharma.

You, all boundless and immeasurable holy assemblies, perfected ones, divine spirits, and devas, constantly penetrate the wondrous principle herein, broadly extending it to all—those present now, those of the past, and those of the future—so that they may attain this gate of emptiness, profound beyond profundity, and dwell in empty space.

When I spoke of these meanings of emptiness among the great assembly, hundreds of thousands of millions of beings, upon hearing this teaching, immediately dwelt in the dharma equal to empty space. Having abided in this realm, they were free from all obstructions, fetters, and attachments in all dharmas, their minds without confusion or distress, constantly delighting in freedom, pure and without action.

For this reason, all dharmas are named equal to empty space. Just as empty space does not generate greed for lovely forms, nor anger toward unloved forms, so too, having dwelt in this realm, are you all likewise. In all dharmas, you see and know. Whether in action, conditions, causes, roots, essences, thoughts, vehicles, encounters with good teachers, upholding precepts, or practicing generosity—all such dharmas are fully known and seen, leading to the supreme liberation, most profound.

The wisdom of their practice sees all beings who commit unwholesome acts, inevitably falling into hells, enduring boundless suffering. Knowing beings who emerge from hells and are born among humans—if they practice generosity and fulfill all virtues—such givers will surely enter correct liberation. This is called the correct, true, and wondrous Dharma.

There is also seeing and knowing. What is this seeing?"

What is this knowing? Whether existent or non-existent, suffering and affliction do not arise; there is constant bliss, true self, and purity. Calamities and hindrances vanish; all is non-action. Those who attain the divine samādhi of the honored ones do not enter the cycle of birth and death, steadfast and indestructible. Having already achieved accomplishment, they also know that all beings possess the nature of the Dao.

And a verse says:
I recall past lives—
all is impermanent,
provisional among dharmas,
yet not empty.
The five sense treasures—
from where do they arise?
They cannot but be empty,
the gateway to liberation.
How wondrous, never before seen!
At all times, the multitude
cannot grasp its meaning—
such is its nature.
Those with wisdom who hear this,
the gateway to liberation,
should all revere it,
receive this Dharma with their crowns.

*Marvelous True Scripture’s Numinous Talisman*
*End of the Marvelous True Scripture of the Jade-Pure Realm*

*Third Chapter of the Scripture of the Great One of the Jade-Pure Realm*
The Great Dao’s Illuminating Words:
All dharmas, boundless wisdom—
they cause all gods and humans, great sages, immeasurable perfected ones, and all dharma-realms—whether form or formless, with characteristics or without—to each attain faith in their hearts.

Knowing that these beings seek the true teaching:
some flow with the current, some do not;
some abide rightly, some do not.
When one knows this Dharma,
they have reached the shore of the Dharma,
dwelling in the supreme realm,
gaining the profound flavor of the Dharma,
obtaining the root of the Dharma,
attaining correct liberation.
Cultivating all right practices,
with the pure heavenly eye,
they see all beings whose three karmic actions of body, speech, and mind are unwholesome,
falling into hells, animal realms, or hungry ghost realms,
enduring unbearable suffering—
blades of wind coming and going,
unceasing day and night.
They see beings who cultivate wholesome karma,
advancing with vigor and diligence,
practicing and upholding the Dao,
striving to save others.
Know that such beings will be born in the heavens,
enjoying boundless bliss;
if born among humans,
they will be surpassingly wise.

Through immeasurable kalpas,
I have seen beings pass from darkness to darkness,
confused and deluded,
unable to awaken;
some pass from darkness to light,
gaining knowledge and insight;
some pass from light to darkness,
abandoning truth for falsehood,
unable to recognize the Dao;
some pass from light to light,
like the full moon of true suchness.

Yet all may be due to:
the fruition of evil karma,
or the deep-rooted karma of greed, hatred, and delusion—
such beings inevitably fall into hells,
receiving all manner of retribution.
If such beings can arouse the mind to cultivate the body and precepts,
practice various dharmas,
awaken and reflect,
they will not fall into hells.
They repent and reveal all their past evils;
having repented today,
from this day forward,
they dare not commit them again.
With shame and remorse fulfilled,
they escape the three evil destinies,
make offerings to the Three Jewels,
and through these causes and conditions,
they do not fall into hells,
obtaining great blessings,
various karmic rewards,
adornments to their bodies,
attaining the wondrous marks of the heavens,
pure and at ease,
like the blue lotus,
fulfilling all fruition.

If, however, they give rise to thoughts of disbelief,
all evil karma and transgressions will follow,
their desires unfulfilled,
their wishes unmet,
their deeds unaccomplished,
their hopes unachieved,
endless sorrows and worries,
not just one kind.
They receive such immeasurable suffering,
experiencing retribution in this very life.

The perfected ones of boundless great compassion, great wisdom, and great insight see such beings,
unaware of causes and conditions,
unable to repent,
unable to reflect,
unable to awaken,
unable to feel shame or remorse,
without fear—
their transgressions grow,
they receive retribution in hells.
When will they attain liberation?
Endlessly lost in darkness,
enduring every kind of suffering.

Yet such beings also possess the nature of the Dao,
but it is obscured by afflictions,
unable to perceive the light of wisdom,
the immeasurable merits and virtues—
like a dark night,
what they see is not true.

All worldly men and women,
whether known or unknown,
whether coming or going,
whether near or far,
their dwellings, cities, and villages,
clothing and food,
mountains, seas, and forests,
the lifespans of beings—
all are the root of the Dao,
without other characteristics,
without other forms,
supremely wondrous and pure,
utterly quiescent and non-active,
eternally living, eternally blissful,
without hindrance or obstruction,
greatly penetrating and perfectly complete.

And a verse says:
At this time,
with luminous great wisdom,
I expound the subtle and wondrous,
revealing it to all beings.
Having heard these words,
may they be steadfast,
practicing tirelessly,
with pure and true hearts.
Joyful and without regret,
without fear,
neither inward nor outward,
neither anger nor hatred.
At such a time,
there is no inversion.
All natures and characteristics
are unobstructed and at ease.

*Numinous Talisman of the Scripture of the Great One*
*End of the Scripture of the Great One of the Jade-Pure Realm*

*The Wondrous Grove Scripture of the Jade-Pure Realm, Chapter Four*

The great Dharma-seas are boundless and infinite, pervading the Dharma-realm without end. The roots of all dharmas and their meritorious virtues are none other than the limitless wisdom of the Heavenly Honored One—truly, this cause cannot be fathomed by the wise or the sagely.

Those who attain this Dharma encounter no hindrance, no wavering, no fear. Within a single Dharma, myriad scriptures arise under countless names; even expounded for kalpas unnumbered, its perfection cannot be exhausted. This Dharma cannot be grasped by wisdom, nor can it be known by sagacity. It is supremely wondrous, beyond the reach of hearing.

All ordinary beings cling to form, and in clinging to form, greed arises. Thus they are bound, unable to escape birth, aging, sickness, death, sorrow, lamentation, and the great suffering of all afflictions. For this reason, those who hear this Dharma are delivered from all calamities, and measureless beings together attain liberation.

If one, throughout a lifetime, accumulates heavy karmic obstructions and grave retribution yet never hears this Dharma, they are said to be enwrapped by demons and ghosts, unable to speak of it even at life’s end. But if they relinquish attachment, they break free from demonic entanglement.

It is like a guilty person in the world, shackled by officials; the innocent, however, are not bound. So too with all of you: those who cling are enwrapped by demons, while those who cling to nothing find demons and ghosts far removed. They abide in freedom, naturally detached from all forms and characteristics, liberated from the nets of dust. No afflictions remain, no obstructions persist—they attain mastery of the Dharma. Thus do all benefits arise.

From the Dao comes the Dharma, without alternative teachings, without divergent thoughts. Desire naturally fades, and true quiescence is realized. All dharmas are subtly radiant, resplendent as priceless treasures, beyond measure.

If you see or hear of this, teach others in turn, employing skillful means so that all may encounter the profound and wondrous meaning of these true words. Let those who deeply believe receive and uphold them. Countless beings will arouse the unsurpassed mind of the Dao, and thereafter be revered by all gods, honored and venerated in ways beyond conception. Truly awakened and clear, they shatter all doubts, discern truth from falsehood, and enter the unfathomable mystery.

At that time, hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of true immortals and Dao-masters will be seated among them, upholding the true Dharma. They will have perfected boundless mastery of the six penetrations and great wisdom, turning the Wheel of Dharma to the realm of non-action—an unsurpassed, perfectly true, inconceivable, and inexpressible state.

Those who attain the highest truth will perceive below them the boundless forms of all lands, guiding and receiving beings without the slightest pause. If one arouses the unsurpassed mind of the Dao, practicing myriad benefits and limitless wisdom, further upholding the fruits of the Dao—though their form is without appearance, its principle is most real; though its name is without substance, its function is most real. Those who know this Dharma enjoy long life. Their cultivation of merit is tireless, and at this time they constantly exhort all beings: do not harbor thoughts of resentment, do not indulge in desire, abandon all greed and attachment, all dreamlike delusions, all perverse views. Thus they attain the true and complete nature of reality.

And a verse says:
If perverse views arise,
it is because they do not believe in emptiness.

From whence do all defilements and dusts arise?
If they were originally existent, how could there be non-action?
If they arise now, how do they come to be?
Are they produced by conditions? Do they dwell as guests?
Do they arise without cause? Or do they arise together?
Apart from all questions and answers, equality is non-arising.
Thus we know they are not existent—beyond thought and discussion.

*Transformation Sutra of the Jade Pure Realm, Chapter Five*
The Dao’s model spreads and expands, opening the path to deliver all beings, enabling them to ascend the Dao’s shore. Therefore, within this Dharma, teachings are broadly proclaimed to instruct all beings in cultivating merit and virtue. If you act thus within this Dharma, you shall attain long life. Why is this so? By skillfully knowing causes and conditions and all expedient methods, you plant roots of goodness for all future beings, enabling them to understand that all dharmas are provisionally arisen to ferry beings across. Thus, all in the world diligently practice the three karmas and cultivate the fruits of blessed action. Then, ten immortals and ninety-six kinds of beings, together with their retinues, all come forth, assembling in the same Dao-field to accomplish merit and virtue.

Within this, if one tames the mind, then even externally, one constantly seeks merit with a single mind. When this Dharma was expounded, those who heard these matters rejoiced in their hearts. Each turned to the other, their voices choked with emotion, saying: “Such guidance has never been before—hard to encounter indeed!” At that time, immeasurable perfected supreme sages, transcendent great spirits, boundless perfected ones, and limitless holy assemblies—extending throughout the ten directions and the great encompassing Dharma-realm—such multitudes could not all be recorded. By virtue of past conditions, they now met in assembly, all seated together. Each reflected inwardly, contemplating the sutra’s Dharma, seeking the Dharma-body, relinquishing what is hard to relinquish. Again, through sound they chanted the sagely virtues, offering incense and flowers in praise of all practices, all perfectly fulfilling their intentions as offerings to the supreme venerable ones. At that moment, all entered fragrant purity, attaining unobstructed liberation, gaining the inconceivable, obtaining good karmic retribution, constantly abiding in the Dharma-wheel, entering the stage of non-retrogression, and ever dwelling in the Dharma-realm.

Having received these matters, their minds, upon hearing the Dharma, understood suffering, emptiness, impermanence, and non-self; and the constant, bliss, self, and purity. Having heard the Dharma, each led their retinues back to their original lands. Within this assembly, some attained liberation, realizing the wondrous principle, grasping the root of the Dharma, the twelve links of dependent origination, and discerning the three characteristics. As they saw the Dharma being expounded, they attained the Dao and its fruits, causes and conditions, boundless wondrous penetrations, wheeling spirits into samādhi, and expounding the wisdom of the untainted. With skillful faith in expedient means, they called this great compassion, entering the samādhi of emptiness and quiescence—beyond thought and discussion.

Within this assembly, some were able to master rare Dharma, elucidating the essentials of liberation amidst the assembly—most difficult to attain, most difficult to attain, the profound meaning. Each in the great assembly was courageous and exuberant, rejoicing and leaping with joy, praising without limit, all extolling the karmic retribution. At this time, they reverently listened to the venerable one, the supreme Dharma most excellent, awakening to what was yet to be awakened. Never before had they seen such majestic conduct in great compassion and great mercy, all equal in demeanor. They aroused understanding of what was unknown, along with its methods and remedies. Such rare and hard-won fruits—immediately, they and their retinues should relinquish what is hard to relinquish, exhorting all others to together arouse this unsurpassed, unattainable mind, lest regretful thoughts arise. All equally, at that moment, adorned vast seats with a hundred treasures of every kind.

Once the adornments were complete, the assembly bowed their heads in reverence, inquiring and prostrating, gazing upon the compassionate countenance. Each lamented their past lives’ misfortune, now having heard this teaching. Extolling the great compassion, they widely proclaimed it, and spoke this verse:

Supreme Perfected, limitless virtue’s culmination,
Quiescent realm, most exalted and wondrous,
Within the limitless, the honored one—
I attained immortality through the Dao.
Supreme Great Dao, without past or present,
Without going or coming, without thought or conception,
Constantly with right teaching, instructing all in the world,
All attain good fruits, the greatest benefit,
Without hatred or attachment, together receiving wondrous power.

*The Jade Pure Realm Immortals’ Sutra*
*Chapter Six: The Wondrous Fruit of Jade Perfection, Rare and Majestic*

Rare indeed is this Dharma—heaven among heavens, yet even the heavens cannot contain it. Within the Three Realms and throughout the world, how could such a thing exist? How could it be conceived? I am unworthy of its excellence.

Then all the perfected great sages, the boundless divine spirits, and the assembly of holy beings spoke: "We and our retinues have come from afar. If even the Divine Lord deigns to reveal these secret and essential words, it is like the sun and moon whose light knows no concealment. We, with our retinues, take refuge and bow at your feet. We only pray that you, in your compassion, accept our shared resolve to follow and uphold your teachings. Should we fail in this, our hearts and vows shall ever remain reverent."

At that moment, their hearts again sighed in awe, humbled before such honor. The essential words they had received could never be fully expounded, nor could they be grasped even by the vastness of empty space—most difficult, most difficult. Yet in this difficulty, by the grace of the great assembly, they were called to expound the teaching. They thought to themselves, "I dare not remain silent. If I do not proclaim these words, future generations will not attain good fruit; without good fruit, they will not cultivate the field of merit. If I do not reveal the words entrusted to me—this profound and secret Dharma—disobeying the command of the exalted ones, then at this very moment I shall witness their majesty: the celestial spirits in attendance, the divine dragons bearing their chariots, the hundred thousand kinds of arts and harmonies, all arising at once."

Then the foremost seat began to recite the various Dharma teachings, exclaiming: "Profound is the Dao, most subtle and empty, vast and boundless as the abyss. Those who do not believe are like the heavens in drought—no flowers or fruits arise, nor any beings of water or land, all wither and fade, devoid of moisture, unable to grow. All herbs lose their potency. So too are those who lack faith: they wither of their own accord, without blame from others.

"Yet if one initially holds faith but does not firmly establish it, it is like spring blossoms when they first open: swarms of bees arrive, drawn by their color, fragrance, and delicate sweetness, never sated. But when the blossoms fall, the bees depart. So too are those whose faith is not steadfast.

"Among this assembly, O good retinues, you have heard this Mahāyāna sutra, an immeasurable and inconceivable gathering of virtues. That you now follow the ways of the world and speak thus is most rare. Excellent! In the ages to come, may this sutra spread widely, showering the great Dharma rain to fill every place, complete and unobstructed, bringing benefit and peace to all beings.

"It is like gold hidden in sand: only after refining away the impurities and smelting it does it become true gold, priceless in value. Or like a merchant possessing a jewel beyond price who takes it to market to sell. A fool sees it and asks the owner, ‘What is the price of this jewel?’ The owner replies, ‘Its value is hundreds of millions.’ Hearing this, the fool scolds, ‘What is this thing? You deceive me—this is no jewel!’ They say to one another, ‘This is not real treasure.’ So too are those who do not believe in the Dharma.

"O good assembly, you are like those fools who do not recognize true treasure. So too are those among you who, though they hear this Dharma, lack true faith—like one who recognizes a treasure but has no means to acquire it. Yet if one encourages others to cultivate good deeds tirelessly, true faith will become clear."

And they spoke this verse:

The great Dharma is boundless, unborn and undying,
Subduing demonic obstructions, revealing the essential truth,
Crushing all external paths.
By the power of good fruit, one attains freedom.
The supreme Dao is profound and mysterious,
Its name and essence deeply wondrous,
Not to be sought in fixed forms,
Its divine function beyond thought,
Without fixed appearance,
Without hindrance or affliction.
There are skilled physicians
Who relieve suffering and bring natural peace.

*The Yellow Grove Sutra of the Jade Pure Realm* **Chapter Seven**

The true teaching is vast and boundless, without limit or measure. Both humans and heavenly beings take refuge in it without end. In all present and future ages, it equally bestows the inherent true nature. If in past lives one has not yet heard the Dharma, now all may naturally return to the teaching, free from obstruction.

Should one leave the household life to follow the Dao, knowing faith and devotion, thereby nurturing growth—once the body is thus nurtured, yet the nature of the Dharma remains unrecognized, one may indulge in frivolous speech, flattery, and deceit, forcibly seeking fame and honor, hoping for others’ reverence. Yet what is gained? How can one benefit others? Though one may claim that leaving the household life brings clarity to the true nature, one remains deluded, like a blind man who sees nothing, leading others astray, deepening confusion without awareness.

If one practices generosity, it is met with forced praise, all born of greed and devoid of true benefit. In every thought, affliction arises without respite. As the saying goes: "The Dao speaks with a single voice," yet each being, each assembly, is complete in itself, each attaining liberation. All praise it, yet fail to awaken to their own nature.

The Heavenly Worthy then addressed the assembly: "When I expound the Dharma, I first enable all to illuminate their original nature, then instruct them to uphold it as I have taught. For this reason, all Dharmas become luminous, and in turn, one teaches others."

Those beings who receive this teaching are like children finding their parents. Thus, in all praise of this wondrous Dharma, virtue increases like the waters of the great ocean, endlessly circulating. Upon hearing these words, the great assembly rejoiced. Such rare and wondrous causes and conditions moved all retinues who heard the Dharma to exclaim its rarity. Even those who had not heard or understood before now grasped it fully, gaining immeasurable benefit. From this resolve, all attained true perfection.

The immortal youths and attendants, with hundreds of thousands of musicians, offered myriad fragrant flowers and received their karmic rewards, all entering the fruit of the great teaching, the unconditioned. "You, the present assembly and those of future ages, must wholly abandon evil deeds and practice the true Dharma, shunning evil and embracing goodness, renouncing worldly pleasures to seek the Dao—these are my true disciples. Such right conduct is truly inconceivable. Those who are impure are transformed to purity, upholding my Dharma. If still impure, they are made pure. Thus it is, thus it is.

If one possesses true wisdom and the true wondrous treasure, it is no falsehood. Welcome, disciples of the profound and wondrous Dharma! Through the convergence of causes and conditions, thought by thought, one transcends the ordinary to enter sageliness, leaving the coarse for the sublime, shedding one body to receive another, becoming a true companion of immortals. The sixth and seventh stages are likewise; attaining true perfection and the Dao is likewise.

Should beings be afflicted by demons, their form and spirit parted, long bound to the gates of yin, without liberation—such matters are truly terrifying. Those who contemplate the Dao and leave the household life, escaping the dust and defilements as I have taught—if they also practice thus, they find joy in this life, escape the cycle of rebirth, avoid perverse views, eliminate all attachments, constantly uphold the true teaching without pause, ever as one who hungers and thirsts seeks food and drink."

And they spoke this verse:

The wondrous cause of purity pervades all.
Those who have not aroused the mind are made to arouse it.
Those who lack faith are also guided toward it.
Great waves of goodness arise, each advancing with diligence.
Those who skillfully expound the Dharma are like skilled physicians.
With wondrous medicine, they treat the blind,
Enabling them to see the sun and moon—
This is the great scripture.
It opens the eye of wisdom, allowing one to abide in peace.

Naturally free from stray thoughts, supreme and boundless, pervading all without limit, all heavenly and human beings revere and hold fast to its teachings, cherishing them as precious treasures, honoring them as their own bodies, loving them as their own children, never forgetting for a moment. Thus, you shall swiftly attain awakening, gain the supreme power, abide in immovable constancy, transcend all bounds, and accomplish the transmission—becoming the guiding masters of those who cultivate the Dao and tread the path of immortality.

When they expound the Dharma, none fail to bow in reverence;
When they engage in debate, none fail to bow in reverence.

Those who come to hear the teaching all attain understanding. The three realms and empty space are but provisional names. The sages, possessed of such majestic virtue and power, practice the wondrous Dharma, revealing to all beings these profound matters. Yet the ignorant and base, lacking strength, cannot fathom such truths and thus remain deluded, unable to enter.

Therefore, the sages employ the gates of wisdom and skillful means, guiding all beings to perfect goodness and ascend to the supreme realm. Through steadfast teaching and transformation, they may escape the paths of suffering. Moreover, the five aggregates are without substance, and the three paths bear much suffering. Thoughts arise and perish in an instant; all dharmas are impermanent.

Those who gather here, unwavering and unshaken, shall attain the blessed fruition—this is called the cause of supreme joy. Ever practicing purity, unobstructed and free, they receive the good reward. You, within this assembly, must weigh the lightness and heaviness of merit and its benefits, and further awaken to the truth.

If Daoist priests or nuns accumulate merit beyond conception, with thirty-six thousand true Dharma companions—all known to the multitude—cultivating great wisdom and perfecting their practice, the majestic power of the Great Dao becomes their fortress of Dharma protection. Upholding the true teaching, their fame spreads in the ten directions, and all people seek their counsel. They uphold and propagate the Three Treasures, ensuring their continuity, subduing demonic obstacles, and restraining external paths. Through purity, they forever sever the bonds of desire, their minds constantly abiding in unobstructed liberation.

In every thought, they uphold the totality, their eloquence unbroken. They perfect giving, uphold precepts, endure humiliation, and cultivate concentrated thought. Subtle wisdom and the power of skillful means are all fully possessed. Whether hidden or revealed, they dwell in empty space, their great wisdom attaining the patience of non-arising. Their names are recorded as those who have attained the Dao, entered the stage of non-retreat, and entered the practice of purity.

In brief, even if the Great Dao were expounded for five hundred kalpas, preaching the Dharma day and night without cease, the meaning could never be exhausted. You must know that from this point onward, for hundreds of thousands of kalpas, if one cultivates and reaches the realm of non-action—whether formless or with form—wisdom enters samadhi, and the patience of non-arising is not stirred. From the highest to the lowest, all bow in reverence, bow in reverence. The thirty-two marks are clearly perceived, the meaning of the Dao is realized, and spiritual wisdom is boundless, like empty space, immeasurable.

Furthermore, in times past, the perfected ones sought the true teaching of the Dao, pitying sentient beings as a mother loves her child. The Dao is most profound and distant, not of this present day. If one can diligently uphold it, never forgetting for a moment, and spontaneously declare, "Excellent! Excellent!"—this is called skillful means. The revered deities of the ten directions, moved by this mind, bestow the power of the wondrous Dharma. At that very moment, the five paths become open, demonic forces retreat into hiding, and all then clarify their true vows, each attaining accomplishment.

And they spoke this verse:

What I now behold is the true Dharma.
Its great fruition is beyond compare.
As one in darkness finds a great lamp,
All are illumined by this light.
The body attains peace, free from affliction.
Through this cause and condition, all is fulfilled.
Excellent is the wondrous Dharma, truly profound.
By this meaning, the fruit is perfected.

Hearing that the supreme Dao is wordless, wondrously concealed within the mystery of mysteries, one inquired, saying:

The Heavenly Worthy then addressed the assembly of celestial immortals, boundless and infinite perfected great spirits, gathered in the wondrous and singular court to expound the teachings. "You all seek the Dao, yet claim to have heard its coarse and subtle aspects in abundance. Now that you raise this question, it is the fruit of hearing—yet if you merely arouse this mind to seek the supreme Dao, it shall never be attained.

Just as the mighty ghost-spirits of the five paths, though born and transformed alongside heaven and earth through the kalpas, entangle themselves in the web of doubt, seeking libation priests to dwell forever in the earthly realm, they cannot heed the precepts and thus lose the root of the Dao.

If your minds truly desire to hear my true teaching, you must at this moment arouse the mind of supreme, inconceivable wisdom—only then may you hear it. Now that you seek the Dao, having once heard it—how rare! How rare!

The Dao is not sought within form, nor is it sought beyond form. It is not sought by clinging to existence, nor by clinging to non-existence. For the sake of all beings, it provisionally manifests in various dharmas, following what is established and forcibly assigning names. Yet once a name is obtained, in truth it departs from that name.

The supreme, perfectly true [Dao]—merely hearing its name—brings immeasurable virtue, beyond conception. How much more so for those who receive and uphold it! Though it has no form or appearance, dim and obscure, within it lies the utmost essence, the unobstructed supreme Dharma. The true nature remains unmoved; its power is like the sea, vast and boundless. It subdues afflictions and adversities, restrains external paths, and is most difficult to attain. Its responsive transformations are infinite, beyond conception.

This Dao is profoundly mysterious—such words speak of rare matters. Now that I expound these dharma-aspects, I accept your request. You must believe and contemplate, without thoughts of retreat, without doubts, without fear, without trusting other notions, without saying it is powerless, without saying it is too difficult. Simply maintain a straightforward mind and right mindfulness, plant the roots of goodness, and naturally you will comprehend the Dharma and enter the source of the Dao. Always abide in singularity; if there is nothing to attain, do not generate dharma-endurance. Diligently cultivate wisdom, constantly exhort all beings, universally enabling them to attain the Dao without obstruction from birth. Do not give rise to jealousy, but offer a single mind, teaching equally. The supreme cause and condition are truly inconceivable, without end.

Expound broadly on cause and condition without negligence, constantly making the sound of the Dharma, praising and chanting, so that all beings together generate the aspiration to turn toward it. Arouse the supreme, perfectly true, unattainable mind, accomplish great perfection, cultivate the true teaching, and universally deliver the boundless.

Each wields the inconceivable power of great wisdom and spiritual penetrations. At this moment, receive the Dharma and attain the good karmic conditions of deliverance. Thus it is, thus it is.

If there are beings who, even briefly in kalpa after kalpa, hear the Dharma, it is likewise without limit or boundary—all are seeds. Yet if one fears the seeds and does not plant them oneself, it will be difficult to bear fruit. All of you are most rare and precious, able to follow and turn with it, never retreating from the wheel, all perfectly complete.

Knowing how to plant the roots of goodness, all the celestial assembly attain fearlessness, virtue, and wisdom. Cultivating their minds, their forms are adorned with excellent marks, perfectly complete and foremost. First attaining the good fruit, they abandon all fine reputations and lofty renown in the world, their aspirations high and far-reaching, without further practice."

And they spoke this verse:

By this good Dao,
It is shown to the world.
Like heavenly rain,
It moistens and nurtures growth.
All the multitudes
Attain fruition.
Hunger and famine are wholly dispelled,
Abundantly receiving joy.
The divine treasure of the honored ones,
Immeasurable wisdom—
All evils are forever extinguished,
Myriad deviations do not intrude.
Spiritual illumination reaches far,
Attaining its profound mystery.
Truly unmoving,
Gaining fearless power.

The Dao spoke: "In this assembly, the immeasurable assembly of sagely beings has gathered—all the celestial perfected ones, the boundless and infinite perfected great spirits. All dharmas are equal and unequal; beings are likewise equal and unequal. There are moreover immeasurable, inconceivable [realms].

I constantly observe the heavens and the gates of the evil destinies, where six palaces govern transgressions and blessings:

1. The Palace of Zhou Jue Yin,
2. The Palace of Tai Sha Liang Shi Zong,
3. The Palace of Ming Chen Nai Fan Wu Cheng,
4. The Palace of Tian Zhao Zui Qi,
5. The Palace of Zong Ling Qi Fei,
6. The Palace of Gan Si Lian Wan Lü.

There are also twenty-four hells:

1. The Hell of Boiling Cauldrons,
2. The Hell of Copper Pillars,
3. The Hell of Iron Plows Tilling Tongues,
4. The Hell of Knife Mountains and Sword Trees,
5. The Hell of Grinding Mortars,
6. The Hell of Poisonous Snakes Devouring Hearts,
7. The Hell of Molten Copper Pouring into Mouths,
8. The Hell of Furnace Coals,
9. The Hell of Iron Wheels,
10. The Hell of Transporting Stones to Build Mountains,
11. The Hell of Iron Beds,
12. The Hell of Sword Forests,
13. The Hell of Frigid Ice,
14. The Hell of Fierce Fire,
15. The Hell of Iron Rods Beating at Random,
16. The Hell of Great Stones Crushing Bodies,
17. The Hell of Iron Awls Piercing Bodies,
18. The Hell of Iron Pellets,
19. The Hell of Swallowing Fire and Eating Coals,
20. The Hell of Grinding, Crushing, and Pounding,
21. The Hell of Iron Juice,
22. The Hell of Tongue Extraction,
23. The Hell of Iron Chains,
24. The Hell of Sawing Apart."

Additionally, there are Five Gates of Suffering, encircling twenty-four hells:

1. The Gate of Suffering from Sensory Attachments Disturbing the Mind,
2. The Gate of Suffering from Craving Entangling the Spirit,
3. The Gate of Suffering from Greed Burdening the Body,
4. The Gate of Suffering from Vanity Exhausting the Essence,
5. The Gate of Suffering from Corporeal Bonds Oppressing the Soul.

The Three Paths—Upper Corpse, Middle Corpse, and Lower Corpse—along with the Five Sufferings, form the Eight Difficulties’ Gates.

Furthermore, the Nine Dark Hells and Nine Prisons are distributed across the four directions:
- In the East, the Thunder Hell of the Wind,
- In the South, the Obscuring Fire Hell,
- In the West, the Diamond Hell,
- In the North, the Frigid Abyss Hell,
- In the Center, the Universal Torment Hell,
- In the Southeast, the Bronze Pillar Hell,
- In the Southwest, the Dismemberment Hell,
- In the Northwest, the Fire Chariot Hell,
- In the Northeast, the Cauldron of Boiling Liquid Hell.

Countless men and women fall into these realms, enduring unbearable torments without respite, day or night.

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate bowed in reverence and prostrated, addressing the Heavenly Worthy. The Heavenly Worthy declared: "These sinners, having disbelieved in the Three Treasures and devoted themselves solely to transgression, have thus fallen here without hope of escape. I now expound for you the Orthodox Teachings and the Supreme Jade Canon, that all beings may attain liberation."

The Lord of Jade Void then pledged his utmost sincerity, requesting the extraction of the precepts and scriptures from the Jade Canon—all inscribed in yellow on blue scrolls, containing essential doctrines and the talismans of salvation from suffering. He addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "Your servant has heard these teachings and received this Dharma, forever freed from the sufferings of hell. Holding fast to the Jade Covenant, I shall ascend through the Golden Gate without hindrance."

Within the assembly, a single lamp’s light was divided among the Eight Latter Hells, dispelling the darkness of the Nine Prisons. All who heard these essential teachings and reverently listened to the Dharma’s sound were filled with joy.

And he spoke in verse, saying:

The Heavenly Worthy declared:
All these realms of suffering
Are entered by oneself.
If one attains to hearing the Dharma,
This too is most fortunate.
You now proclaim it—
Hold fast and firm,
Advance with courage and vigor.
Again, with radiant light
And the pure Dharma-water,
Shatter all obstacles,
Break open the Eight Hells,
And the Five Sufferings within—
All shall naturally dissolve.
The iron city of ten thousand leagues
Collapses like sand.

Refining the Scripture of Numinous Talismans in the Jade Clarity Realm

Thus concludes *The Scripture of Supreme Virtue in the Jade Clarity Realm*, thirty-sixth among the *Thirty-Six Venerable Scriptures of the Jade Clarity Realm*.

*The Scripture of Supreme and Wondrous Virtue in the Jade Clarity Realm*, Chapter Eleven

The Dao spoke: Excellent, excellent!
If within this assembly there are boundless Heavenly Perfected Ones, Great Sages, and Most Perfect Great Spirits—
The Flying Heavenly Lords of East, West, South, and North—all bow their heads,
Each with their own karmic conditions of Dharma, beyond full expression.
The four directions abound with great wisdom,
Enabling these boundless, measureless beings.
If any man or woman awakens a virtuous mind,
Generates great wisdom,
First tames and subdues their mind,
And cultivates the essential practices—
Such essential practices
Convey one into the Dharma-wheel,
Where the Flying Heavenly Ones revolve.
The true canon of the Great Treasury,
Over five thousand characters,
Eighteen thousand chapters,
All return to the Treasure Repository.
The Eight Flying Heavenly Spirits exert their power in rotation,
The four golden dragons spin the pillar and the Dipper’s pearl,
Pearls hang from eight sides,
Thirty-two pavilions,
Thirty-two Heavenly Emperors encircle the eight directions,
Five-colored auspicious clouds spread across the earth and emerge,
Radiant light illumines all—
Within the treasury’s heart is inscribed *The Scripture of the Numinous Chapters on Birth from the Nine Heavens*,
While the remaining scriptures return to the pavilions.
The wheel turns thrice,
Enabling all beings to perceive their true nature,
To receive admonitions within the Dharma-wheel,
To attain rebirth,
To return and be born among humans,
To clearly perceive all dharmas,
Without doubt,
And to plant manifold roots of goodness.
Cultivating this essential Way,
Boundless wisdom,
Immeasurable teachings—
All are contained within,
Practiced for ten thousand generations
Without hindrance.
Such merit and virtue
Are without end,
Truly beyond thought or discussion.
Among this assembly, those who comprehend this principle—
All who see and hear—
Shall have their wishes fulfilled.
Those who have not yet heard this essential Dharma
Should also awaken the mind and take refuge,
Following the turning of the Dharma-wheel,
Briefly listening to the true sound,
And thus attain liberation.
Cultivate this essential Way,
Never waver or regret,
Advance diligently in recitation,
To hear the profound and wondrous Way of the Supreme Perfected,
And again, with radiant light,
Save and deliver all beings,
Freeing them from the realms of suffering,
Creating great benefit,
Employing manifold expedient means.
Advance in the practice of deeds,
So that gods and humans take refuge.
For hundreds of thousands of kalpas—
Those already born, to be born, or yet unborn—
If they awaken a virtuous thought,
They must revere and uphold it,
Be guided into the Dharma-gate,
So that in this life, or in lives to come,
They may gradually hear the Dharma,
Without demonic obstacles,
And also encounter this Dharma.
If there are those who have already heard this teaching within the Dharma
And yet do not practice diligently from beginning to end—
Though they initially attain the Way,
Later they waver and regret,
Clinging to worldly entanglements—
They shall not attain liberation.
You must rely on my words,
Listen and receive,
Broadly open the Dharma-gate,
Cultivate your original practice,
And also enable those who have not awakened to awaken,
Those who have not heard to hear,
Establishing great merit and virtue.
All practices perfected,
Cross over into good fruition,
Perceive the great causal conditions,
Universally enter the fruit of non-action,
Further enter refinement and deliverance,
To attain the perfection of the Dao,
And enter the fruit of purity.
All that is done
Shall be supremely good.
Thus, all these qualities,
All powers of merit and virtue,
Boundless and immeasurable,
Are all fully possessed in their subtlest aspects.
If the sprouts of Dharma
Are not well cultivated,
One loses the root of the Dharma
And cannot attain long life.
If one can accumulate practice,
Merit and virtue shall be without limit.
At the time I expound the Dharma,
There is neither existence nor non-existence.
For this reason,
All dharmas respond accordingly,
Without self or other,
All that is seen and heard is perfected.
Through this wondrous power,
Great and beyond thought or discussion.

And he spoke in verse, saying:

To know the ancient beginning
Is called the record of the Dao.
To enable the unenlightened to awaken
Is the seed of the Dao.
Why is this so?
The Heavenly Worthy’s wisdom
Cannot be measured or exhausted,
The meaning of the subtle and wondrous
Is profound and distant, difficult to discern—
Forcibly described in its aspects.
The practice of wisdom is hard to fathom,
Yet all dharmas should be perceived.
Why then do these beings
Fail to attain?
Clinging and ignorant,
If enlightened, all awaken.

The Numinous Talismans of *The Scripture of Supreme and Wondrous Virtue*

Thus concludes *The Scripture of Supreme and Wondrous Virtue in the Jade Clarity Realm*, thirty-sixth among the *Thirty-Six Venerable Scriptures of the Jade Clarity Realm*.

*The Yellow Grove Scripture, The Scripture of Supreme Perfection, The Daoist Scriptures, The Scripture of Supreme Refinement, The Scripture of Supreme and Wondrous Virtue,* and *The Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*—these six scriptures form a single scroll.

*The Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue in the Jade Clarity Realm*, Chapter Twelve

I declare that all things are subtle and wondrous.
You, all Perfected Ones, possess boundless wisdom
In the past, future, and present lives,
Yet do not comprehend it.
Eight paths intersect in confusion,
Manifold karmic conditions—none are true mindfulness.
Some, though of the highest grade,
Do not perceive their true nature,
Have not fully entered the Great Vehicle,
Still cling to incense and flowers,
Do not generate virtue or power,
Do not awaken wisdom,
Do not practice good faith—
They too may fall.
How much more those who are deluded and perverse,
Forever losing their causal conditions,
Never encountering the Three Treasures,
Never hearing the essential Dharma,
Never hearing the Dharma-drum,
Never hearing the secret treasury?
Such people, even if they hear me expound the Dharma,
Cannot discern it,
Nor can they distinguish their own actions,
Nor the characteristics of dharmas.
Devoid of self-nature,
Devoid of other-nature.
If one can hear and comprehend this teaching,
Then in all dharmas one attains perfection,
Reaching non-arising and non-ceasing,
And again perfects all dharmas,
Departing from all dharma-characteristics,
All speech,
And all that is spoken of—
Neither speaking nor silent,
This is the illumination of the essential Dharma.

To tread the Great Dao, do not point to narrow paths;
Do not liken the waters of the vast sea to petty streams,
Nor compare the sun’s radiance to mere flickering light.

In my exposition of the Dharma, there is no obstruction,
All is perfectly complete—truly beyond thought,
Truly beyond discourse.
Pervading the three-thousandfold great-thousand worlds,
Encompassing all dharma-realms,
As if seen within the palm of one’s hand,
Without duality,
Without delusion,
Pure and unconditioned,
Without present or past,
Without end or beginning.

I widely exhort all beings to seek the root of goodness,
To relinquish this body and life in pursuit of awakening,
To steadfastly cultivate the teachings—
All shall attain perfection,
Bringing vast and boundless benefit to all beings.

At this very moment, in future ages,
This teaching shall spread.
Those who have never seen or heard,
Those in distant lands,
The benighted and unenlightened,
All shall, through this present exposition,
Come to understanding.
Having attained understanding,
They shall enter the unretreatable, unconditioned great endeavor,
Reach the realm of longevity,
The supreme and victorious cause—
Beyond all comparison.

Then, among the assembly, all bowed their heads in reverence,
Prostrating with limbs outstretched,
Overjoyed and exultant,
Voicing loud praises:
“Such inconceivable merit,
Boundless and immeasurable!
We have heard this teaching today—
In ten million kalpas, never has there been the like.
A single word herein is limitless.”

Having heard this discourse,
The true ones gazed upon the golden countenance,
Bowed to receive the sacred precepts,
And all attained understanding.
In but a moment,
They gained the inconceivable.

Then, from the sky descended
Countless, boundless deva-kings and holy multitudes,
All desiring to augment their virtue and power,
To perfect the wondrous, true, and tranquil.
Innumerable great spirits and immortals
Bowed as one,
To the supreme, correct, and true,
The subtle and essential teaching—
All was of the Great Brahmā.

Those who see or hear this
Shall all receive benefit—
How much more those who uphold and recite it,
Who transmit the precepts,
Who widely exhort beings to equally receive this wondrous Dharma,
Attaining great perfection,
Fulfilling the dharma-nature,
Free from the six desires,
With the three poisons extinguished,
Mind and consciousness purified,
Achieving great, all-penetrating wisdom,
And in turn teaching others.

Such merit knows no limit—
This true teaching is beyond full expression.

And he spoke this verse:

Know this, all of you: stillness has two kinds.
The first is *stillness with presence*—I contemplate the subtle and refined,
Ever abiding in stillness and practice.
The second is *emptiness-stillness*—
Thoughts like the sea, ever abiding in pure conduct.
Only by preserving unity
Can one reach the profound source,
Attain ultimate stillness,
And find refuge in the exhaustion of being.
Through this, one gains mastery over all dharmas,
And may thus become inexhaustible.
For all sentient beings
Were originally self-luminous.

(These six scriptures are contained in the same scroll.)

*The Scripture of the Cavern Mystery of the High Clarity Realm* begins here.

The first chapter, *"The Utmost Wondrous and Mysterious"*—
Supremely true, profoundly hidden, and difficult to fathom.
Thereupon, all the devas spoke in unison,
Bowing to the Heavenly Worthy,
And entreated the revelation of the essential Dharma.

At that moment, from within the assembly,
All rejoiced,
And boundless radiance
Awakened every rank of beings.

Then came the deva-princes of the Formless Realm,
From their abodes:
The Heavenly Prince of the Luminous Court of the Cloud-Crossing Realm,
The Heavenly Prince of the Abyssal Cavern of Primordial Pervasion,
The Heavenly Prince of the Realm of Wondrous Flourishing Grace,
The Heavenly Prince of the Realm of Forbidden Joy and Elegance—
Such were the four deva-princes.
Having heard of this rare and wondrous sign,
Each led their people,
Wise men and upright women,
To gather as one.
The four kinds of celestial beings—
Ascending Victory, Brahmā-Pervasion, Splendid Prosperity, and Eternal Harmony—
All declared:
Through such profound causes and conditions,
One attains the unobstructed realm of sublime abodes,
And the truth of the Dao.

Then came the deva-princes of the eighteen heavens of the Form Realm:
The Heavenly Prince of the Transcendent Conduct Realm,
The Heavenly Prince of the Veiled Brilliance Realm,
The Heavenly Prince of the Harmonious Yang Realm,
The Heavenly Prince of the Reverent Splendor Realm,
The Heavenly Prince of the Ancestral Drifting Realm,
The Heavenly Prince of the August Flute Realm,
The Heavenly Prince of the Hall of Radiance Realm,
The Heavenly Prince of the Solemn Tranquility Realm,
The Heavenly Prince of the Reverent Celebration Realm,
The Heavenly Prince of the Ultimate Jade Realm,
The Heavenly Prince of the August Cliff Realm,
The Heavenly Prince of the Ultimate Wind Realm,
The Heavenly Prince of the Filial Aura Realm,
The Heavenly Prince of the Venerable Weight Realm,
The Heavenly Prince of the River Origin Realm,
The Heavenly Prince of the Joyful Obscurity Realm,
The Heavenly Prince of the Cloud Vow Realm—
Such were these kings.
Together with their ministers, princes, and people,
They came before me,
And I expounded for them,
According to their time,
The true Dao and its supreme power.

Their realms revered this,
Practicing the unobstructed Dharma,
Erecting great Dharma-banners,
Beyond all thought or conception.
Having heard this wondrous matter,
Their hearts rejoiced,
Marvelling at what had never been before.
Attaining such excellent fruit,
So rare and precious,
They gained the condition of purity,
Forever free from sound and form,
No longer troubled by afflictions,
Turning the wheel of no-retreat,
Forever beyond birth and death,
Achieving great perfection.
This truth is subtle and wondrous,
Beyond full expression.

Then came the deva-princes of the six heavens of the Desire Realm,
All extolling such inconceivable merit,
Truly difficult to encounter:
The Heavenly Prince of the August Layered Realm,
The Heavenly Prince of the Jade Perfection Realm,
The Heavenly Prince of the Youthful How Realm,
The Heavenly Prince of the Peaceful Nurturance Realm,
The Heavenly Prince of the Literary Elevation Realm,
The Heavenly Prince of the Māyā Realm—
Such were these deva-princes.
Their ministers, crown princes, and people,
Though numerous,
Were not yet complete,
Enduring boundless suffering,
Wandering in birth and death,
Torn by love and hate,
Separation and enmity,
Violence and malice—
Beyond all thought or conception.

Those who turned their hearts sincerely
To where the Dao was taught,
Regardless of distance,
I now expounded for them the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination,
Enabling all to turn toward it,
To be born together in the true realm,
And to deliver all their realms,
According to their conditions—high or low—
Guiding them step by step to awakening.
Thus, their retinues immediately received the true fruit,
All attaining the stage of no-retreat,
Gaining peace and bliss.
Their ministers and officials,
Together with the people,
All attained the unobstructed Dharma,
Entering the true and correct,
Assembling at the gate of pure wisdom,
Arousing the supreme mind,
And transcending to the bodhimanda of peace and bliss.

I teach all dharmas,
Ever guiding and exhorting,
So that all in the world
Gradually enter the true teaching,
And all attain the fruit of the Dao.

And he spoke this verse:

This Dharma is radiant,
The most wondrous scripture.
Whether in the present age
Or in ages to come,
In every place—
Cities, towns, and villages,
Mountains, marshes, and empty spaces,
Or royal palaces and dwellings—
Wherever this scripture spreads,
I, with my great power and divine might,
Shall go to those places,
Following and protecting.
For those who teach this Dharma,
I shall ensure their fulfillment.

*The Scripture of the Cavern Mystery and Spirit-Talismans*
*The Scripture of the Cavern Mystery of the High Clarity Realm* concludes here.

The *Supreme Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures of the High Clarity Realm*
*The Scripture of the Cavern Mystery*
*The Scripture of Primordial Yang*
*The Scripture of Primordial Celestial Cycles*

*The Scripture of the Inner Sound*
—The above six scriptures share a single scroll—

*The Scripture of Primordial Yang of the High Clarity Realm*   Chapter Two

At that time, the sacred multitudes of the heavens, the great deities of the heavens, and the boundless perfected ones rejoiced in their hearts, having heard the Celestial Worthy expound thus at length for the great assembly, teaching the step-by-step cultivation that leads to perfect fulfillment. This creates immeasurable and boundless fields of vast merit, serving as the root of life for all beings. If one can skillfully harmonize the principles of nature and life, one will naturally attain harmony and well-being, preserving the integrity of the body. Adapting to the seasons and employing expedient means, diligently cultivating one’s practice, in such fields will sweet rain ever fall, nourishing year after year abundant harvests, free from harm. Such great benefit is inconceivable, universally delivering all beings, bringing about such fulfillment. Through this, one attains self-mastery, mighty vigor, and unrelenting progress.

Having heard the Dharma to its conclusion, they then aroused within this scripture a mind of purity, a mind of spontaneity, a mind of fearlessness, and a mind of compassion. Reverently engaging in cultivation, they again heard this teaching. Even the non-Buddhist paths of foreign lands, upon hearing and receiving the prophecy, were all likewise granted prophecy—the greatest of causes, yielding boundless fruit. Having attained such matters, their minds opened and their intentions arose, all becoming clear. Their bodies attained the vastness of heaven without limit, pervading the Dharma-realm without end. The thirty-two marks filled the empty space, and the eighty excellences brought benefit through every gate. Manifesting or concealing, appearing or vanishing, boundless and profoundly subtle, wondrous and unconditioned.

Overwhelmed with joy beyond measure at such teachings, they declared this to be the good medicine, capable of rescuing all suffering and delivering beings through expedient means. Skillfully discerning the depth and shallowness of illnesses, applying remedies according to symptoms, one comes to know the waxing and waning of the four great elements. Constantly arousing great compassion, pitying all beings, one thus enables them to take refuge together, teaching all beings. Expounding the great wisdom, one desires that all beings deeply enter the Dharma-gate, hear the secret treasury, and immediately attain non-arising and non-ceasing. All in the world neither know nor see—boundless and immeasurable. Yet the faithful multitudes of the heavens can all know and see; those who awaken are called true persons. Those who know the correct awakening proceed directly to the supreme vehicle. If not of the world, what difference would there be? Yet it is also of the world, and also not of the world. As the saying goes, to speak of difference requires some approximation.

Thus, you should proclaim and practice the essential Dharma, creating great good causes for all future beings. You must constantly expound it—not only today or at this hour. The ultimate good Dharma should never be exhausted; the great wisdom of universal penetration can never be exhausted. How much less could those who expound it ever exhaust it? You should accept this in faith. I shall now explain to you, one by one, the profound roots of the Dao, so that you may attain liberation—the foremost cause.

If you possess the wisdom of universal penetration and great compassion, pitying all beings, you become a cause for the Dharma and a benefactor to the world. Excellent indeed, beyond all thought! First establishing this Dharma, universally rescuing all sentient beings, one observes how all beings are defiled by form, defiled by desire, unaware and unenlightened, bringing upon themselves such suffering. Moment by moment, they take this to be joy, engaging in false speech, divisive words, harsh scolding, greed, anger, ignorance, and perverse views. Though they hear this Dharma, they do not diligently practice, thus bringing such suffering upon themselves, forever without liberation. I teach all dharmas so that all may attain fulfillment.

And he spoke this verse:

Hearing this Dharma now, make no distinctions.
Should distinctions arise, you sink into evil destinies.
Whether man or woman, all who give rise to faith and devotion,
who take refuge in body and life, become children of the Dao.

You have received these words—thus you must expound
this rare and precious Dharma,
for the sake of future generations,
for the good and benefit of Dharma-children,
that they may return to emptiness and stillness, to the source.

Become my disciples, serene and eternal.

**The Primordial Yang Scripture of the Numinous Talisman**
*End of the Upper Scripture of the Primordial Yang in the Upper Clarity Realm*

*Six Scriptures in One Volume:*
*The Scripture of the Upper Clarity Realm, The Primordial Yang Scripture, The Primordial Chronogram Scripture, The Great Kalpa Scripture, The Scripture of Opening the Upper, The Inner Tone Scripture*

**The Primordial Chronogram Scripture, Third Chapter**
The essential purport of the Great Dao is profound and wondrous,
hidden in rhythm, ineffable.
Abiding in unmoving serenity,
it attains constancy of its own accord.

If there are sentient beings who do not know the root of the Dao,
who fail to examine their origins,
indulging in greed, anger, and ignorance,
in deviant lust, theft, and the killing of living beings,
disrespecting heavenly spirits and earthly deities,
neglecting the teachings and laws,
defiling and scorning the sun, moon, and stars—
all evils converge,
and they commit every kind of unwholesome act.
Their forms are ground away by ghosts,
and they are constantly perverse.

Arrogant toward all wholesome Dharma,
their minds do not believe in our Dao.
They recklessly act without the Dao,
engaging in what is not Dharma.
All ghosts despise them,
and good spirits scatter,
no longer coming to protect and sustain them.
All evil karmic conditions gather,
sickness and suffering follow unbroken,
and they cannot attain long life.
Like morning dew,
they do not draw near the sun.

Having abandoned all wholesome Dharma,
without a single wholesome thought at the time of the Dao,
they increase in evil destinies,
committing unwholesome acts.
Truly difficult to repent,
when the day of death arrives,
there is no time of release,
and they sink forever into hell.

If in such a household there is a disciple of the Dao,
a wise man or upright woman,
who diligently cultivates the Great Dao,
giving rise to every wholesome thought,
and invites a Daoist master to purify the home,
erecting the green and yellow banners,
each nine feet in length—

the green banner is raised on the left,
inscribed with the *Nine Heavens’ Response Perfected Scripture* in large script,
the character *Dao* written at the top,
with thirty-six talismans on the four streamers of the banner’s crown,
and the body of the banner inscribed with four lines from the *Nine Heavens’ Response Perfected Scripture*:
*Talismanic command pervades the boundless,
The numinous banner stirs the dawn wind.
The spirit ascends beyond the Northern Bureau,
Flying sandals mount to the Southern Palace.*

The yellow banner is raised on the right,
inscribed with the *Five Immortals’ Qi of the Nine Heavens’ Scripture of Generating Spirit*,
the character *Immortal* written in large script,
with thirty-six talismans on the four streamers of the banner’s crown,
and the body of the banner inscribed with four lines from the *Scripture of Generating Spirit*:
*The Great Tenuous returns the Yellow Banner,
The Peerless commands the Numinous Pennant.
It summons the Long Night’s Bureau,
Opening deliverance for the souls awaiting rebirth.*

Both banners are erected at the entrance of the gate.

Strike the Emperor’s Bell to summon the ten directions,
those who awaken the mind to repentance—
thus may wisdom be perfected,
all former karmic obstructions utterly dissolved,
and within the ten directions and ten stages,
blessings and virtue fill every realm,
the land of spontaneity pervading all,
equal to empty space, without hindrance.

The mighty gods of the heavens,
the boundless great spirit-kings,
arouse vast compassion and boundless goodwill,
delivering all beings—
great and small alike—
from every suffering and affliction,
as boiling water melts ice and snow.

Such is the power of this great wisdom,
unobstructed in all ways.
For all gods and humans,
let the same true vow arise:
entering and departing beyond being and non-being,
responding and transforming without limit.

Without divergent thoughts,
possessing all-embracing wisdom,
they deliver sentient beings.
Those who cultivate mindfulness
are truly the seeds of the Dao.
Let them generate manifold good intentions,
vowing to fulfill the greatest karmic conditions
of past and future,
resolving all measureless evil karma,
so that past and future abide forever.

Practice skillful means,
and amidst the boundless multitudes,
each may arise in reverence,
hearing the essentials of the Dao.

And he spoke this verse:

Now you have attained the Dao,
preserving it eternally.
Unmoving and unobstructed—
this is called the true Dao.
It neither arises nor abides,
nor comes nor goes.
Yet beholding sentient beings,
all are subject to birth and death.

The true Dao, vast in compassion,
never abandons or forsakes.
How could there be birth and death
for the sake of sentient beings?
Unable to abide forever—
how pitiable indeed!
The subtle and wondrous Dao
is boundless in all ways.

The realm of the Great Dao pervades all,
boundless and infinite,
filling the entire expanse of empty space,
without end or limit,
beyond kalpas and eons,
east and west, south and north,
the four directions, above and below—
no obstruction remains.
It perfects all dharmas,
resolves the three karmas,
and opens the essential path to liberation.

In all dharmic phenomena,
nothing is left obstructed.
The heart’s vows are fulfilled,
and boundless joy without hindrance is attained.
One gains the Dao and its methods,
hearing the supreme matters of the assembly,
and broadly expounding the essential causes and conditions of the Dharma.

The great Dharma is limitless—
its inconceivable profundity cannot be exhausted in words.
Cultivate the six practices with diligence,
and one may enter the unconditioned.

Further generate such pure and vast wisdom-vows,
great compassion-vows,
to renounce all form,
all desire,
all greed,
all anger,
all ignorance.
With skillful means and equanimity,
compassionately deliver all suffering beings.

Now I bestow upon you the forbearance of the Three, Five, One, and Four,
all matters of patience and purity,
untainted practice,
unwavering mindfulness,
forever free from perverse thoughts.
Each thought is the king of all dharmas,
able to contemplate and receive all teachings.

All deluded and confused beings
harbor no resentment.
Yield virtue to the world,
desiring not what others desire,
yet accommodating all,
neither disputing nor arguing over principles.
Distance yourself from worldly afflictions and illusions,
concealing the body in non-action,
dwelling in profound stillness and tranquility.

Let the heart not betray its words,
and conduct never stray from scripture and precepts.
Day and night, constantly practice the fruits of the Dao.
In eating, drinking, and sitting,
ever illuminate the Dao and its methods.
Do not cling to the five flavors,
and untie the knots of the six senses.
Though the mouth may partake of varied foods,
the heart remains unmoved by taste.

In all matters of nourishing life and gathering qi,
do not rely on medicinal substances—
the body naturally generates flesh,
and true yang grows strong.
Never indulge in idle thoughts
or dissipate the spirit.
The eyes do not gaze in vain.

All manifold evil karma
and every affliction
are completely dissolved.

In future kalpas, men and women born in the final era,
meeting no enlightened masters,
receiving no true teachings,
shall commit boundless evil deeds,
give rise to every deluded thought,
lightly betray the good and virtuous,
and amass measureless grave sins.
Unable to repent,
they die and enter the endless great hells,
sinking into the five sufferings of the evil destinies.
Their bodies embrace bronze pillars,
their feet tread upon knife mountains,
their hands grasp sword trees.
Again they plunge into cauldrons of boiling liquid,
swallow fire and devour coals,
their heads and faces scorched and charred.

In the Dao of Heaven, the Dao of Earth,
the human realm, the animal realm,
the realm of hungry ghosts, the hell realms—
whether born from womb, egg, moisture, or transformation—
they shall have no karmic conditions
to escape these evil destinies,
never again beholding the light,
forever unable to emerge.

Yet if any awaken the mind of supreme wisdom,
widely proclaiming and expounding the teachings,
they shall attain these karmic conditions,
awaken to the true cause,
and restore the luminosity of their original nature.
This great goodness today is beyond conception.

Thus proclaimed, you, the boundless assembly,
hear the Dharma never before heard,
see the Dharma never before seen,
first ascending the Dao platform,
all by virtue of wondrous power.
Whatever is seen or heard
shall fulfill every wish,
no longer subject to inversion or delusion.
All of great wisdom shall attain the Dao,
universally practicing the true teaching.

And he spoke this verse:

With a heart that cherishes beings as a mother loves her child,
beings in birth and death drown in the wheel of rebirth.
Having no escape, the true Dharma is hard to discern.
Yet if any see or hear it, they too may diligently advance.
The supreme Dao has no kin—only the virtuous.
Exhort and protect all beings,
with body and mind guide them to harmony and mastery,
seek the root of the Dao,
and the wisdom of truth.

*Fifth:* **The Upper Opening Scripture of the Upper Clarity Realm**

Within this scripture, the great perfection of nature knows no bounds,
all essential teachings expounded without limit.
The upper realm’s utmost truth is profoundly subtle and wondrous,
without falsehood or deceit.

In kalpas past, present, and future,
all such teachings—
you must each reverently believe,
cultivate a mind of great compassion, great悲, and boundless freedom,
a mind of great unattainability,
and surely witness rare and marvelous events.

Now, all under heaven who aspire
must still the mind in tranquility,
listen and believe with reverence,
never commit evil deeds,
nor indulge in greed, poison, or perverse views,
nor engage in idle chatter.

The revolutions of the celestial bodies—sun, moon, and stars—
all govern the causes and conditions of fortune and misfortune,
whether favorable or adverse,
lingering or concealed,
bright or dim,
ascending or descending,
sinking or desolate,
moving through the zodiac or crossing the heavens—
all preside over good and ill.

The twenty-eight lunar lodges traverse all heavens.
Thus, the people below
must cultivate reverence and respect,
observe their celestial movements,
pray and perform expiatory rites,
and thereby escape all calamities and hardships.

Now I expound for you the method of expiating and transcending the stars:
Prepare incense, flowers, lamps, and candles,
and in a pure and quiet hall,
sculpt or paint the forms of the Eleven Luminaries,
the Twenty-Eight Constellations,
the Golden Well, the Silver River,
the Purple Palace’s fields of destiny,
auspicious and inauspicious omens,
portents, and the true forms of obscure stars.
Recite the scriptural texts,
establish the jiao altar,
use the five grains to arrange lamps,
determine the year, month, day, and hour of one’s birth,
and employ the five directional colors to stabilize the altar:
one foot of black,
two feet of red,
three feet of blue-green,
four feet of white,
five feet of yellow.
Extol the ritual proceedings,
and all stellar deities shall turn their radiance,
transforming misfortune into fortune,
changing ill into good.

If any man or woman,
though never having heard these essential teachings,
can perform the fast and establish the Dao platform,
each should teach others in turn,
never obstructing the path.
The merit and virtue therein are likewise inconceivable.

If any lack the means to perform such rites,
yet cultivate reverence and faith,
praising and extolling the merit,
their roots of goodness shall also grow,
and all calamities shall be dispelled.

If any good person can arouse the practice of great compassion,
then within their realm, the power of merit shall be widely bestowed,
altars established,
offerings abundantly made,
so that all may receive the grace of the Dao.
Such merit and virtue are without limit,
without end.

Can one arouse a good heart
to perform expiatory rites for others?
Never grow lax—
it is the same.

Among the assembly,
if any see others establishing Dao platforms
yet harbor disdain,
disbelieving the precepts and Dharma,
dismissing them as empty words—
when calamity strikes,
they may wish for a fleeting escape,
but if they then arouse a good thought,
it shall not ascend,
nor shall their kin hear the Dharma.
All such suffering is self-inflicted.
In future lives,
they shall forever lose the root of virtue and Dao.
All obstructions and afflictions shall stretch endlessly,
lifetime after lifetime without escape.
In the end, great harm shall befall them,
extending to generations of descendants—
truly pitiable.

Now I speak the Dharma,
that all may believe and receive it.

And he spoke this verse:

You must revere and uphold this—never grow lax.
Let no resentment arise, nor harbor ill will.
Sever all bonds and burdens of every kind.
Keep the heart ever pure, the conduct ever wise.
Extinguish the fires of affliction,
and let no thought stray from the Dao.
In all such matters,
hold fast to the precepts.
Never transgress again—
thus are all Dharma teachings revealed,
that all may believe and follow,
attaining the supreme Dao.

*Inner Tone Scripture of the Upper Clarity Realm* VI

The transformations of heaven and earth follow fixed destinies;
the cycles of yang and nine, six, and hundred-six bring calamity.
When omens and portents manifest,
they serve as clear signs and proofs.

Now, all people and their six relations receive their *qi* and nature from heaven and earth,
borrowing their parents only for birth and nurture.
In truth, they are endowed by heaven and earth,
which are their true father and mother.
Disasters and blessings arise from the purity or turbidity of heaven and earth’s *qi*.

All who cultivate the supreme Dao and advance in wisdom,
if they broadly exhort others to reverence and practice,
shall understand the causes of fortune and misfortune—
all rooted in the transformations of heaven and earth.
With diligent prayer and devotion to the supreme Dao,
each arousing such lofty vows,
upholding the Daoist canon,
all shall return to the true teaching.

When heaven and earth are obstructed,
their great wrath gives rise to calamity:
grains fail to ripen,
people perish,
weapons clash,
plagues spread,
the sun, moon, and stars lose their proper courses.
Such is a year of heaven and earth’s great inauspiciousness,
when sins and evils cannot be named.

Yet by heeding the most wondrous and perfect essential Dharma,
all evils shall be utterly extinguished.
You know the profound mysteries of heaven and earth—
their meanings are beyond full expression.

Great calamities and strange omens arise from heaven and earth’s great wrath;
moderate calamities and omens, from their moderate wrath;
minor calamities and omens, from their minor wrath.
This is like human affairs:
great matters call for great words,
moderate matters for moderate words,
minor matters for minor words.
No word is empty,
no sign is false,
no deception is wrought.

When great auspices appear,
they correspond to heaven and earth’s great joy;
when moderate auspices appear,
to their moderate joy;
when minor auspices appear,
to their minor joy.

When no calamity or auspice appears,
heaven and earth’s *qi* is concealed—
no image, no form,
no omen, no transformation.
Know then to return and revere the supreme realm of the Most High,
clearly comprehending all Dharma’s hidden inner tones and jade verses,
that all good affinities may be fulfilled.

There are also great, moderate, and minor discourses of heaven and earth,
each with its manifest signs.
Among the eleven luminaries, only the Purple *Qi* shows no image—
thus it never gives rise to calamity.
The sun displays the Red Rooster,
the moon the White Hare.
The sun meets in spring the Azure Dragon,
in summer the Vermilion Bird,
in autumn the White Tiger,
in winter the Dark Warrior.
Within the moon’s hare are the Green Cassia and the Mortar and Pestle,
unchanging through the four seasons.

The Star Lord of Wood Virtue has the head of a hare, the body of a boar, and the tail of a tiger.
The Star Lord of Fire Virtue has the body of a horse and the tail of a snake.
The Star Lord of Metal Virtue has the head of a monkey and the body of a rooster.
The Star Lord of Water Virtue is a black ape holding brush, ink, and inkstone.
The Star Lord of Earth Virtue has the horns of a ram, the head of a dragon, the ears of a dog, and the body of an ox.
The Star Lord Rahu has the horns of a ram, the claws of a dog, the tail of an ox, and the body of a dragon.
The Star Lord Ketu is a tortoise.
The Star Lord Moon Comet is a snake.

When these proper images appear,
they do not portend calamity.
If aberrations arise—
darkness, obscurity, lack of luster—
and the sun, moon, Wood, Metal, Purple, and Water show no pattern,
they do not bring disaster.
If they deviate from their proper courses,
their brightness is slightly diminished.
When Fire deviates, it reddens and exposes its eye;
when Earth deviates, it moves sluggishly;
when Rahu, Ketu, and the Comet deviate,
they change forms according to the twelve palaces—
then they portend calamity.
Meeting the Metal Star is auspicious.
If one follows the proper rites of exorcism, it shall be favorable.

And he spoke this verse:

The rites of exorcism and transformation
are the mechanisms of response.
You must know this:
Purify body and mind,
cultivate the supreme practice,
first with reverence,
then with right faith,
fulfilling the four virtues.
Only then is refuge complete,
whether man or woman.
Follow the teachings without doubt,
comprehending the true source,
penetrating the profound and obscure.
Further, believe and receive,
and in turn deliver others.

*Scripture of Refining Life in the Upper Clarity Realm* VII

The radiance of the Dao’s orthodox lineage,
from ancient times to the present,
has illumined all—
upper, middle, and lower adepts,
all who see and hear—
without limit,
pervading the empty sky,
boundless and vast,
silently unfolding.
All beings receive its benefits.

When people prosper,
it is often because they embrace goodness;
when they decline,
it is often because they embrace evil.
Those destined for fortune are easily guided;
those destined for misfortune are hard to enlighten.

The Way of Heaven ever aids the good;
the Great Dao establishes laws,
that those who seek may attain.
The Way of Heaven ever distances the wicked;
the Great Dao displays its majesty,
refusing to protect them.

If one can cultivate the supreme Dao,
revere the master,
receive the scriptures and Dharma,
and return the refined *qi* to irrigate the field of the body—
inscribing secret talismanic seals with cinnabar,
swallowing them into the belly—
one shall see within the belly’s script,
greatly auspicious,
and all evil spirits depart.
The five organs govern,
serving as the foundation of the Dao,
the ancestors of the spirits.
The hundred joints, sinews, bones,
the four limbs and eight vessels—
all unite with the true primordial *qi*.

Gates and doors, when entered and exited, scatter evil *qi* of their own accord; the true Dao flows freely, and inner and outer become luminously clear. Guarding this over time, the celestial physicians descend of themselves, and all ailments dissolve entirely, bestowing longevity.

The foolish, ignorant of the natural, discard wondrous methods; though they may have accumulated past goodness, it turns to misfortune. The wise regard it as a priceless treasure, revering and honoring it. This may be called the Way of eternal abiding.

To prize the natural alone, body and spirit both wondrous, form and appearance ever joyful—guard this spirit and *qi*, and nature and life are attained of themselves. Roaming freely in the fruition of the Dao, one ascends through the Golden Gate.

If one fails to grasp its secret essence and clings instead to strange thoughts, it becomes a fault, losing the natural, and the Way of long life cannot be attained.

If you now wish to cultivate as before, it is better first to nurture the mother, then cherish the infant. The five essences all ascend to the *Niwan* Palace, returning to the origin and restoring life. Thus one naturally preserves and guards, never again suffering loss.

Only then may one refine the practices of cultivation, entering and exiting the Flowery Chamber. The forest of existence flourishes in lush abundance, sheltering all beings—this is true quiescence, true samādhi, Great Perfection, Great Wisdom, the boundless and inexhaustible adornment of the Dharma-body, universally saving all, pervading the Dharma-realm, the four directions and four borders, myriad myriad leagues beyond.

Far and near, many bear karmic entanglements; good and evil are evenly matched, and few awaken to liberation. Relying solely on the one mind, one reveres the true lineage, seeks the master, and yearns for the Dao, arriving of oneself before the Emperor.

With long-accumulated practice, one may transcend the mundane and enter sagehood, far removed from evil destinies, attaining purity and stillness.

You who come after have not yet entered the gate of the Dharma. If in the future you all plant seeds in this field of merit, the hundred grains will ripen year after year, untouched by drought or blight.

All the heavens assemble, boundless and immeasurable, filling the empty sky—hard to conceive, vast and perfect in blessings. Myriad sages and a thousand perfected ones join in unison to praise this excellent cause, benefiting all beings.

The divine immortals of all heavens gather at once, ever filled with joy, speaking thus: If a person of attainment remains steadfast in resolve, never regressing, without hindrance, then through all lives and kalpas of samsara, they shall encounter enlightened masters who impart the profound teachings. Such Dharma teachings are too vast to recount fully.

And so a gāthā says:
The virtue of transformation is beyond all praise.
You of good wisdom, each uphold the teachings.
Awaken to the true origin, revolving in the good Dao,
Without cease, pure and liberated.
In non-action, at ease, ever practicing right mindfulness—
You shall surely attain this.
When engaging in these practices,
Let your mind be spacious, casting off the four evils.
Perform great merit, cultivate an unimpeded mind.
Refine the *Lingfu* of the *Liangsheng Jing*,
In the Upper Clarity Realm, refine the *Liangsheng Jing* to its end.

**The Supreme Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures of the Upper Clarity Realm, Lower Scroll: The Scripture of Refining Life, The Scripture of Numinous Secrets, The Scripture of Dispelling Demons, The Immeasurable Scripture, The Scripture of Subduing Demons, The Scripture of Upper Communication** *(The above six scriptures share a single scroll)*

**The Scripture of Numinous Secrets of the Upper Clarity Realm, Chapter Eight**

Man dwells between Heaven and Earth. Since the opening of creation, he has borne the name of "human." Humanity is the *qi* of central harmony, the foremost of all beings. Noble and revered, he resembles Heaven and Earth. Yet he cannot endure as long as Heaven and Earth, for he fails to cultivate the Dao of gathering and refining, thus bringing about his own ruin.

The perfected person, understanding this principle, unites form and spirit, refines truth, and cultivates *qi*, attaining the realm of perfect subtlety. There, he may roam freely in his true nature, enter the Golden Gate, forever sever the cycle of rebirth, transcend and attain the Dao, vow to deliver all beings, and create boundless good causes.

Know this: the human body is hard to obtain, yet the true Dao is often obscured. If one loses this human form, it is difficult to regain even after ten thousand kalpas. Now, with a single death, one may wander endlessly through heaven and earth, never knowing the cause. After death, none know their destination. The soul is gathered, the spirit assembled, the body reunited—yet in an instant, all returns to darkness. How grievous! How lamentable!

I now tell you: awaken to right view, comprehend life and death, and cease all sorrow. All karmic grievances shall be dissolved, never to burden you again.

Thus, the laws of Heaven and Earth decree that they, the parents of all things, fear that within their midst, beings may bring suffering upon themselves, weeping in vain, giving rise to afflictions and false evil karma—truly, not by Heaven and Earth’s calamity are these woes bestowed. The bitterness is unbearable; they cry out to Heaven above and knock upon the Earth below, mourning their own sorrow, proclaiming their grievances.

Therefore, Heaven and Earth generate the true Dao, endlessly teaching all wondrous methods to refine the soul and forge the spirit, enabling transformation and self-preservation to attain a modest longevity. Yet there is no great wisdom of the true Dao, no essential method to comprehend and align with Heaven and Earth’s eternity, to match the sun and moon’s radiance, to follow the stars’ revolutions, or to turn with the kalpas’ cycles. Though one may gain a modest lifespan, it brings no true benefit.

All beings endowed with form between Heaven and Earth are subject to decay. How much more so for man, entangled by the seven emotions and six desires, ensnared by wealth and arrogance, self-satisfied and unaware of yearning for the true Dao; or by poverty and lowliness, breeding resentment, scorning the Dao, and feeling no shame, only generating evil karma.

Those who study the Dao, though initially guided by wisdom, may not yet grasp worldly mechanisms. Still bound by afflictions and desires, they refuse to diligently learn the true Dao and its virtuous methods, growing careless and remorseful, mocking the true Dao as false, seeking petty gains to disrupt the heavenly order, deceiving the upright and true, and thus hastening their own demise.

All foolish people know they will die, yet they prepare tombs, seeking permanence, arranging funerary pacts, crafting mourning garments for descendants, amassing treasures to display grandeur—all according to worldly custom, yet utterly without benefit. They do not consider: when this body dies and is reborn, what karmic retribution will follow? If you do not heed my words, you too shall act thus.

In all Dharma, I clarify the true Dao, revealing it to all beings. Responding to conditions and resonances, I am free from attachment, joyful and at ease.

And so a gāthā says:
With all your heart, give your utmost intent.
Whether man or woman, you must fathom the wondrous origin.
At this very moment, let each thought be unwavering.
Such are my disciples, those of the Dao.
Ever practice the highest conduct, never dwelling in the four evils.
Do not indulge in depraved desires, nor any misdeeds.
See not what exists, nor what does not.
Focus your mind on the Dao, seek the Dharma.

**The Scripture of Dispelling Demons of the Upper Clarity Realm, Chapter Nine**

Man’s life in the world should always know its return. The cycle of life and death turns without cease, like the sun rising in the east and setting in the west. Even the ancient sage-kings and worthies were no different.

Yet in every era, one should reflect deeply, cherishing life and fearing death, constantly seeking rare knowledge, vainly relying on strange methods and arts to prolong life—only to harm one’s nature. Revering spirits and ghosts, flattering for blessings, they seek fortune but invite misfortune.

Those who claim to possess the Dao’s arts, feigning auspicious omens, boast of moving Heaven and Earth, gaining longevity, and transcending the world. Once such desires arise, delusion follows. Trusting the false, they corrupt the true, sinking into evil destinies, never awakening. They do not cultivate the true Dao, nor understand its causes, nor meet good teachers, nor sever the roots of evil. Unable to plan wisely for the future, they bring upon themselves sorrow and confusion.

Such actions reverse the Dao and harm the teachings, creating boundless sin. Without repentance, their false doctrines solidify, and the true Dao cannot enter—thus they persist in error.

The sages of old, wise and far-seeing, established models for all under Heaven and future generations. They wished for posterity to recognize false paths and demonic obstructions of the good Dao, thus illuminating wisdom. They also sought to dispel all demonic spirits, that all might hear the true Dao. The benefits are beyond conception.

In those times, many worthies gathered in flourishing assemblies to expound the essential Dharma, serving as guides. They thoroughly understood the beginning and end of Heaven and Earth, deeply explored the cycles of return, yet did not speak of life after death, nor of life and death as separate paths. They did not explicitly state that life, death, coming, and going are illusory, but taught the essential Dharma of non-arising and non-ceasing. Thus, those who attained the Dao could themselves grasp the profound mechanism, comprehend the Dharma of life and death, and their wisdom became boundless. The principle of life and death naturally held no fear, and the wisdom of all things spread to future generations.

Upon hearing this Dharma, all may cross to the supreme, most true essential path, ascend the great Dharma bridge, and directly transcend to the Dao’s shore. Should there be those who revere the true teaching and possess perfect wisdom, they too shall likewise forever cast aside greed and attachment, with demon kings as their guarantors, ascending to the imperial court. Should emperors and kings attain this, they may govern with effortless virtue, and the realm shall govern itself. Should the worthy attain this, they shall fulfill filial piety, fraternal duty, loyalty, and trust, aiding their sovereign above, stabilizing the nation’s destiny. Disasters shall not arise, malevolent omens shall forever vanish, auspicious stars shall ever shine, inauspicious stars shall self-destruct, weapons shall not be raised, spring pestilence shall not spread, summer epidemics shall not arise, autumn plagues shall not stir, winter epidemics shall not invade. Wind and rain shall be harmonious, crops shall flourish abundantly. Throughout the land, men and women shall rejoice in great peace, its vastness filling all without end. Should one further devote oneself to upholding it with utmost sincerity, the three paths, five sufferings, and eight adversities shall be forever extinguished. Grasping the talisman and holding the register, one shall ascend directly to the Jade Capital, carefree and at ease; ascending into the Vermilion Palace, refining and transcending the bodily form, one’s name shall be inscribed on the Purple Register, receiving the mandate of the Crimson Empyrean.

The Five Emperors, great demons, all celestial immortals, demon kings of the Three Realms, flying heavenly deities, and boundless great spirits shall together receive grace and pardon, all attaining the wondrous Dharma. They shall traverse the heavens, jointly safeguarding and elevating, ascending to the Supreme Clarity.

Then a gāthā was spoken:
With the heart’s great vow, this merit’s power,
Now extending to the great assembly, all should believe and hold fast.
Attaining the lofty and wondrous, true and subtle Dharma,
Gaining boundless goodness, the Dao’s wisdom pervades all.
With right mindfulness widely propagated,
For future beings who practice in due time,
They shall attain the eternal root and enter the wondrous,
Their wisdom complete.
Whether with form or without,
The greatest wisdom,
Free from all other thoughts.

*The Immeasurable Scripture of Supreme Clarity*, Scroll Ten

The orthodoxy of Heaven and Earth shall forever dispel calamities. The sun, moon, and five planets shall radiate brilliant light. The people shall thereby flourish, each awakening to virtuous thoughts. Yet when the people grow restless and the customs of the age shift, harming the harmonious qi, Heaven and Earth shall greatly rage, the three luminaries of the sun, moon, and stars shall lose their brightness, and Heaven and Earth shall contend, no longer in harmony. The signs shall be untimely winds and thunder, harming the nature of things so that none may grow; the people shall perish and be injured. Yin and yang shall contend, no longer in harmony, the five grains shall not ripen, water and fire shall lose their measure, and disasters shall arise together. For yin and yang were originally united, mutually aiding to generate harmonious qi, yet now contend instead.

Thus, I clearly reveal the essential Dharma, expounding the causes of expiatory rites, that all may be spared from calamities and all people come to know the root of the Dao. Thereupon, the perfected great spirits, innumerable hosts, all celestial perfected ones, and the boundless, immeasurable assemblies of sages from the ten directions all bowed their heads and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “We have yet to fathom the subtleties of the true Dao. We humbly beseech your great compassion to broadly proclaim it. We dare ask: when there is severe drought, all grasses and trees wither, and the people suffer and die of hunger, what is the extraordinary cause?”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “The disaster of severe drought arises from the sun losing its measure, the six yang forces all resentful, thereby causing harm. The yang nine cycle spans one thousand eight hundred years, and when it encounters *jiǎ*, it is the great yang nine. The hundred six cycle spans one thousand six hundred years, and when it encounters *shēn*, it is the great hundred six. If the yang nine does not meet *jiǎ*, or the hundred six does not meet *shēn*, it shall not be a disaster. The lesser yang nine spans one hundred eighty years, the lesser hundred six one hundred sixty years; only when their cycles converge on *jiǎ* and *shēn* shall it be a disaster. If not *jiǎ* and *shēn*, it shall not be a disaster.”

“We dare ask about floods?”
The Heavenly Worthy said: “Floods arise from the moon losing its measure, the six yin forces all resentful, thereby causing harm. The cycles are the same.”

“We dare ask about fires?”
The Heavenly Worthy said: “Fires arise from the fire star deviating from its path, transgressing its proper position and passing through regions beyond its domain. Below, it manifests as children’s rhymes: if auspicious, it brings fortune; if inauspicious, it brings misfortune. When it descends in the *yín*, *shēn*, *sì*, and *hài* positions, it shall burn prefectures, counties, ferries, and towns. When it descends in the *zǐ*, *wǔ*, *mǎo*, and *yǒu* positions, it shall burn temples, palaces, ancestral halls, and dwellings. When it descends in the *chén*, *xū*, *chǒu*, and *wèi* positions, it shall burn the people’s homes, cities, mountains, marshes, and boats.”

Thereupon, the assembly all entreated: “If such calamities occur, how may they be saved?”
The Heavenly Worthy then addressed the assembly, saying: “Floods, droughts, and fires all arise from whether the people practice goodness or not. If a village practices goodness, disasters shall turn to fortune; if a village does not practice goodness, fortune shall turn to disaster. Furthermore, the two stars of Heavenly Usurpation and Heavenly Plunder descend, bringing bandits and chaos, plundering possessions and taking lives. If one does not perform grand jiao rites and submit memorials in worship, the calamities shall not be averted.”

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy revealed the rites of the Great Unity jiao, commanding the Treasure Virtue Perfected One to descend and transmit them, that all people might be spared from calamities, forever free from floods, fires, drought demons, bandits, and disasters. Such benefits shall extend broadly to all. If in a given place one lacks the means to perform the rites, one may fast, bathe, and purify oneself, then invite a Daoist to recite this scripture exclusively, even a hundred times, and the calamities may still be averted.

Then a gāthā was spoken:
The Dao’s methods are nameless,
Dependent on human cultivation.
The most true and wondrous Dharma,
Rare to encounter.
You now encounter it,
A blessing from past lives.
Teach others in turn,
Creating great merit’s power.
Disasters shall dissolve,
Fortune shall swiftly arrive.
If one can revere and uphold it,
Ever shall there be harmony and prosperity.
Heaven and Earth, yin and yang,
All shall harmonize their qi.
All people
Shall attain freedom and ease.

*Shangqing Realm Scripture of Subduing Demons*, Chapter Eleven

After Heaven and Earth divided their forms, they were distinguished as pure and turbid: the pure became Heaven, the turbid became Earth. What marked their beginning? At the inception of the ten poles and thousand realms, perfected beings attained their stations, divided their forms to teach and transform, and only then did the measures of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, sun and moon begin to operate. Once these measures were fixed, qi was then divided.

The East holds nine qi, where the Wood phase is gentle and compliant; the South holds three qi, where the Fire qi blazes fiercely. Though Fire qi is but three, it equals the nine qi of the Wood phase, together making twelve qi. The West holds seven qi, where the Metal phase is firm and solid; the North holds five qi, where the Water qi surges boundlessly. Though Water qi is but five, it equals the seven qi of the Metal phase, together making twelve qi. The remaining qi of the four directions—northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest—are gathered as Brahma qi. The qi of the southeast is balanced, the qi of the northwest is balanced, harmonizing with the qi of the four directions. The qi of the northeast generates mountains, stones, great trees, and mighty beasts in abundance, while the qi of the southwest is scant, producing only treasures. The upper and lower positions, that is, the Earth phase of the Center, divide twelve qi. Rising, they form Heaven; stored, they become Earth. Thus, Heaven and Earth each possess thirty-six qi, and only then can they generate the myriad things.

Thereupon, the great deities of the ten poles and perfected beings, the celestial perfected and great sages, simultaneously bowed their heads and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “We are fortunate to hear the true teaching, yet have not fathomed its profound mechanism. We only pray for your compassion to broadly expound it.”

The Heavenly Worthy said to the assembly: “The qi of Heaven and Earth moves in accord with numerical cycles, and these cycles also have their ends. Even the sun, moon, five planets, all celestial bodies, and the most sagely beings cannot escape calamitous cycles—how much less those of shallow learning who wish to avoid illness and harm?”

Thereupon, the entire assembly was struck with awe and fear. They bowed their heads and prostrated themselves again, asking: “If such calamities exist, how may they be averted?”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “You have all been fortunate in past lives, encountering good causes and hearing these teachings in manifold ways. Yet those born between Heaven and Earth are all deluded by the seven emotions and six desires, which confuse body and mind. Thus, they fail to hear the true Dao or awaken to the wondrous Dharma, and only accumulate transgressions, even when they repent. I shall now proclaim the true teaching for you, unfold the jade tones, turn the wheel of the true scriptures, and broadly present offerings. Whether on the *jiazi* day, the *gengshen* day, in the first month, the seventh month, or the tenth month—along with the eight solar terms, your life-destiny days, and birthdays—you should strictly maintain incense and fire, diligently uphold the Dharma, cultivate and gather the qi of the utmost truth, harmonize yin and yang, connect the blood vessels above and below, commune with Heaven and Earth, absorb the upright qi, dispel defilement and evil, prevent the arising of disasters and illness, eradicate ghosts and demons, ensure the five paths are unimpeded, and promote the flourishing of the six livestock. You should listen and receive these teachings, then teach others in turn, so that all later learners may hear of these good fruits, all attain auspiciousness, and every household and family share in the supreme goodness.

This scripture is named *Inconceivable*, and its merit and power are likewise inconceivable.”

Thereupon, the celestial immortals, the boundless perfected beings, the great sages of the utmost truth, the innumerable celestial deities, and the countless multitudes all heard these words and rejoiced. They vowed to uphold and protect the teaching, disseminate it throughout the world, and universally bestow its boundless benefits upon all. They cautioned that it must not be carelessly disclosed or treated with irreverence by unenlightened commoners of later ages, lest they fail to attain its blessed fruits.

Then a gāthā was spoken:
The true and constant, unchanging—
This is called the true Dao.
All manifold evils
Shall be wholly cast far away.
It is like the lotus flower,
Which does not grow on dry land.
Only in moistened places
Does this flower arise.
From the turbid mire,
It emerges unstained.
Free from all craving and attachment,
You walk in purity.
Like the lotus flower,
When you practice this Dao,
The child of supreme virtue
Shall possess all marks in full.

*Scripture of Ascending Communication of the Shangqing Realm*, Chapter Twelve

The qi of emptiness and spontaneity gives birth to Heaven and Earth; the upright qi transforms and communicates, while the deviant qi is dispelled. When upright qi is scant, Heaven and Earth are obscured by deviant qi. It is only because deviant qi abounds that it can harm upright qi; when upright qi abounds, it can restrain deviant qi. This is the spontaneous qi of Heaven and Earth.

All deviant qi arises because upright qi does not circulate, allowing deviant qi to enter. Those who cultivate the true Dao must cause deviant qi to dissipate and practice the supreme, most perfect Dao to attain the method of prolonging life and avoiding death.

Humans receive their mandate from Heaven, which has its own norms. Heaven and Earth privately grant thirty years; if this is exceeded, it is like the intercalary days added when the cycles of Heaven, Earth, sun, and moon align. If one cultivates the supreme Dao, the most perfect Dao, and the methods of exhaling, inhaling, and concealing the spirit, one ascends and descends with Heaven and Earth and thus attains immortality.

Those who rigidly guard their bodily form without adaptability will ultimately suffer no less harm than those who harmonize spirit and gather qi, unite with the Dao, and merge with the true, appearing in accordance with things without losing their true nature—only thus can they endure long.

Human life—all calculations, numbers, clothing, and food—has its allotted portion. Though this portion is fixed, it also depends on one’s cultivation of the supreme Dao to increase blessings and prosperity. It is like one who does not plow in spring yet expects a harvest in autumn; when nothing comes of it, they say it is Heaven’s portion. Those who do no good yet seek blessings differ not at all from this.

If today you eat another’s food, then tomorrow go to eat theirs, this is not called eating another’s food but "borrowing provisions." If today you carry another’s burden, then tomorrow go to have them carry yours, this is not called carrying another’s burden but "borrowing labor." If today you join another in planning, then tomorrow go to join them again, this is not called helping another but "exchanging merit." If today you praise another, then tomorrow receive their praise, this is not called praising another but "taking turns in commendation." Such comparisons are countless and beyond reckoning.

Yet people perform a small good deed and immediately expect blessings in return—how is this different? The perfected and superior person does not act thus. If others do not aid me, I alone secretly aid them, and I will surely receive good karmic retribution. If all others commit evil deeds, I alone do good, and I will surely receive good retribution. If others do not contribute to me, I alone delight in contributing to them, and I will surely receive good retribution. If others do not share food and drink with me, I alone share with them, and I will surely receive good retribution. If all others practice deceit and hypocrisy to deceive me, I alone treat them with sincerity and trust, and I will surely receive good retribution. Such comparisons are countless and beyond reckoning.

If today I show kindness to another and expect repayment, yet they do not repay, I grow resentful—this must not be. The perfected and superior person seeks the grace of Heaven; the middling person seeks the grace of others; the foolish do not perform good to respond to Heaven, nor do they exert effort to respond to others, yet vainly seek blessings—truly, this is shameful.

If one is wealthy, noble, and wise in this life, it is because they performed good deeds in a past life and now receive this blessing. If, in this life of wealth, nobility, and wisdom, one grows greedy and refuses to give alms or act in accordance with cause and effect, then in the next life they will return to poverty, lowliness, and ignorance—present karmic conditions are no different.

Then a gāthā was spoken:
Understanding the empty principle,
All thoughts are resolved.
When the meeting occurs,
Together you enter the wondrous gate.
At ease and as you wish—
Such are these methods.
Without end,
Briefly, the essentials are made clear.
You should know:
Simply practice good thoughts.
Contemplate all things,
Even in dark and hidden places.
All attain illumination,
The wondrous form of non-action.
All are made complete,
Such are the benefits.

*Chapter One*

The qi of August Heaven descends to give life,
The dark qi of Primal Earth ascends to nurture.
The qi of the Five Phases all generate one another,
The qi of the Four Seasons all interpenetrate.

All people under Heaven share the same nature.
The nature of Heaven is good—it gives birth to the myriad things without exception.
The nature of Earth is good—it nourishes the myriad things without exception.
The sage delights in ordering the world, yet truly models himself upon Heaven and Earth,
Thus the myriad things all receive his merit.

The great and good, the divine immortals and perfected persons,
Assist Heaven and Earth and dare not treat them lightly.
They revere, honor, cherish, and protect them,
All in harmony with the primordial qi,
In accord with the mind of Heaven,
In resonance with the earth’s terrain.
Thus they alone enjoy enduring fortune and know no misfortune.

The sages and worthies of antiquity pondered deeply and planned far ahead,
And so came to know the Dao of Heaven.
Thus they devoted themselves to good and dared not do evil.
Later generations, cunning and false, devoted themselves to evil deeds,
Yet wished to avoid misfortune and keep harm at bay—this cannot be.

Now I shall show you a method by which you may nurture yourself for all time,
And those who attain its utmost must never forget it for even a moment.
If people today wish to avoid misfortune and keep harm at bay,
To attain long life,
They should preserve self-love, self-regard, and self-affinity,
And by these means nurture themselves—only then can they be free from harm,
And their bodies long preserved.

Eating and drinking in due season, neither too much nor too little,
This is self-love and self-nurturance.
Closing the gates and dwelling within, not engaging in worldly affairs,
This is self-love and self-nurturance.
Seeking the root of the Dao all day long, content in poverty and lowliness, free from care,
This is self-love and self-nurturance.
If you take these as self-love and self-nurturance, it cannot be so.

The Dao of self-love lies in sincerity:
Though responding to the world, one is not seen to be disturbed;
Though abiding in stillness, one is not seen to be constrained.
Seeing others’ faults, one does not take them as faults,
But instead turns the gaze inward,
Never departing from this even for an instant—
This is the Dao of self-love.

The Dao of self-nurturance lies in freedom from care:
Moving by day and night, yet never enslaved by the heart-mind—
This is the Dao of self-nurturance.

If you can trust in this and practice it,
You will enjoy its benefits for ten thousand kalpas, without end.
Since before the separation of Heaven and Earth,
Beyond the Great Clarity,
Its measure cannot be reckoned.
Empty and spontaneous, it merges with true principle—
All things are without existence.

Were it not for my establishment of the Great Dharma and its universal proclamation,
You would never again hear such essential teachings.
It cannot be seen, cannot be heard;
If one speaks of its existence, no form is to be found.

If one speaks of its nonexistence, all things receive it to come into being.
A hundred million transformations, vast and boundless,
Without before or after, without roundness or squareness,
Without going or coming, without birth or extinction,
Without form or image, without high or low—
Naturally empty and mysterious.

Only after the division of forms did Heaven and Earth arise,
Along with the sun, moon, and stars.
The Dao’s dharma unfolds in clarity.
All sentient beings who hear this teaching
Rejoice spontaneously, without limit.
Their fundamental nature is all empty—
Not through contemplation or illumination,
But equal to emptiness itself.
Awakening to the causes and conditions of their original nature,
Without other thoughts,
Equal and free from discriminating notions.

If one can single-mindedly recite and deeply uphold it,
All past obstructions will be extinguished,
All will harmonize,
All hardships and calamities will dissolve,
And body and mind will become pure.

Thus a gāthā says:
Delight in seeking the supreme Dharma,
Cut off form, cut off consciousness.
Fulfill these practices,
Distance desire, distance greed.
Such are the karmic fruits—
Unobstructed, without hindrance,
Pure and spontaneous,
Without remnant defilement.

Let the Dharma be your wife,
Cherish the sutras as jade.
With a heart of shame and repentance,
Constantly dedicate merit.
The heart-mind becomes gentle,
The teachings practiced as spoken.
Wisdom increases manifold,
Leading to awakening.

To study the Dao and cultivate authenticity, to exhaust the Dao and deliver beings, one must first generate the heart-mind.

In studying the Dao, from beginning to end, thought after thought, maintain purity; heart after heart, never retreat. Forget the heart-mind, extinguish the heart-mind. From start to finish, direct intention. Whether in movement or stillness, in action or form, be as still as cold ashes, as silent as withered wood. Extinguish all perceptions, extinguish all thoughts, extinguish all heart-minds. Then, with each arising thought, let it be forgotten at once—spirit moves without hindrance.

Return the heart-mind to stillness, truly arrive at the Dao-ground. This is called turning the heart-mind toward the Dao, revering the profound and true Dao. Blessings descend without end, disasters dissolve before they manifest.

Practice according to one’s capacity, exhausting wholehearted devotion. With a cinnabar heart, gaze toward the ten directions. Burn incense, prostrate in worship, move body and heart-mind, surrender body and life, reverently honor the Dao Ancestor and the Three Treasures. Offer pure wealth to purchase various incenses, oils, the eight delicacies, and a hundred flavors. Prepare feasts for offerings, invite and command Daoist masters, return the heart-mind in supplication, earnestly beseech the Perfected.

Through such directed heart-mind, wash away all dust and burdens. Past-root transgressions, karmic afflictions, the errors of life and death—all are purified by utmost sincerity. Through fasting and myriad good deeds, inner and outer become thoroughly illuminated, universally illuminating the ten directions, enabling all beings to gain penetrating vision. Such merit is boundless, beyond conception.

If one observes the fast and precepts, concentrates the mind upon the supreme Dao, and dissolves the ten thousand concerns, forgetting both self and others, then in the empty chamber, clarity arises—true numinous response. This is the cultivation of the most supreme Dao.

If one generates the unsurpassed heart-mind, desiring to return and turn toward the Dao, one must first uphold the fast, awaken the original heart-mind, rescue the impoverished souls of the seven ancestors above, and extend to one’s own body below. Dispel disasters, cross over calamities, increase and prolong blessings and longevity. With solitary utmost sincerity, establish the fast and open the way for deliverance. Necessarily, souls transcend the nine nights, spirits refine in the Three Clarities. Life becomes distant and long, immortals attain the Dao. Aspiring to worthies, yearning for the Dao, use their abundance to open one’s lack, use their virtue to dispel one’s ignorance. Break through stinginess and greed, accomplish lofty conduct. Purify body and heart-mind, circulate spirit and qi. Coming and going without end, without obstruction or blockage.

Pray to Heaven and Earth, supplicate the luminous spirits. One must sever demonic influences, purify inner and outer. All desire to dissolve the ten thousand conditions, still the six emotions. Universally wash the troubled heart-mind, universally realize all perceptions.

Thus, those who study the Dao but do not diligently practice, who do not cultivate fasting and precepts, will find it difficult to reach the Perfected—idly laboring in the mountains and forests.

All who uphold the fast and strictly observe the precepts must desire to practice the Dao, return and honor the Supreme Clarity. Seek the true, study the Dao, refine qi, and prolong life. Universally extend to humans and heavens, universally aid the ordinary and the sagely.

Yet the conduct of superior practitioners is not something the common can uphold.

The Golden Register’s regulations and standards protect and secure the nation’s destiny, dispel disasters, and prolong life.
The Jade Register’s essential standards safeguard the altars of soil and grain, eternally ending warfare.
The Yellow Register’s correct model opens the way for souls, universally extending to life and death. Sages and ordinary alike cultivate together, naturally broadly delivering the hidden and manifest, universally rescuing all the solitary and obstructed, universally saving all suffering souls in the nine dark realms.

On the Three Primes, the eight solar terms, one’s original destiny, and birthdays, study the Dao and cultivate the body. Repent transgressions, seek blessings, rescue those in the three paths, the five sufferings, the eight difficulties, the calamities of imprisonment, illness, and death. Uphold and recite divine incantations to repel and expel pestilence, seasonal epidemics, demonic influences, and perverse qi.

Furthermore, there are scriptures such as the *Golden Chamber*, *Celestial Treasure*, *Orthodox Unity*, *Great Peace*, *Five Refinements*, and *Essential Teachings*. Diligently practice the Dao, follow the correct models, each possessing its own scripture.

Thus a gāthā says:
Burn incense, establish the fast—
Merit boundless.
The sweet dew of Dharma-food,
Liberation as its broth.
Manifest their abundance,
Reveal all lands.
Make offerings to the ten directions,
Boundless Dao-treasures.
And all beings,
Cultivating pure lands.
Teach and transform beings,
Mastering dignified conduct.
Bestow fearlessness,
Generate the unsurpassed Dao.
Universally extend supplication,
Demonstrating its practice.

All who practice the Dao possess the utmost conduct; they must cultivate utmost reverence. They mobilize will and heart, invoking the descent of true numina. They circulate qi and spirit, causing their influence to pervade heaven and earth. Thus, entering the oratory to ascend the altar, reciting scriptures and prostrating, paying homage to the Perfected and repenting transgressions—all these are comprehensive Dao-practices. Circumambulating the altar thrice, they follow the original methods for all assemblies of repentance, supplication, or gratitude.

Whether for heaven and earth, the emperor, the realm, the people, ancestral generations, oneself, one’s family, the Three Wretched Paths and Five Sufferings, or the Six Destinies and Four Births—all require the establishment of fasts, the practice of the Dao, the burning of incense, and prostration with scripture-recitation and hymns. For all supplications, one must observe the fast. When the realm suffers calamities—war raging on all sides, the people afflicted by pestilence, drought, flood, or death—all dire perils necessitate the observance of fasts.

When creating scriptures or images, constructing halls, palaces, monasteries, grottoes, or mountain retreats, establishing Daoist sanctuaries, or crafting bells, chimes, ritual instruments, or celestial music—all such meritorious deeds require reverence. One must broadly establish pure fasts, earnestly extend supplications, recite scriptures and invoke the Dao, sever all evil thoughts, augment inner and outer goodness, and extol boundless merit.

For all scripture-recitation, prostration, and incense-offering, one must follow the scriptures precisely: thrice offering incense, thrice bowing, thrice performing the ninefold prostration, straightening the body and touching the head to the ground, chanting the jade-like tones in harmonious accord, ensuring no discord. Thus, all who see or hear shall rejoice together, praising in unison, propagating the Dao and its teachings. Such merit is inconceivable, an immeasurable and boundless wisdom.

Moreover, through this merit, past ancestors ascend to pure realms, present kin enjoy bliss, and future rebirths dwell perpetually in blessed pure lands, where clothing and sustenance arise naturally. Therefore, cultivate this pure heart and universally adorn all. Array myriad incense, flowers, lamps, and candles as offerings, universally presenting them to the deities of the Three Realms, the Four Offices and Five Emperors, the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, and the one hundred twenty divine ministers. Earnestly extend supplications to invoke blessings, prolong life, dispel disasters, and transcend calamities, safeguarding this servant’s body and universally benefiting all sentient beings—those of the heavenly, earthly, human, animal, hungry ghost, and hellish destinies—dissolving all suffering.

Further, by maintaining fasts with focused intent, relinquishing greed and attachment, abstaining from sensory indulgence, and donating scriptures or images according to one’s means, one encourages others to broadly cultivate karmic affinities. Such benefits are inconceivable: seven generations of parents escape suffering and ascend to heaven, enjoying carefree bliss; households live in harmony, flourishing across generations; karmic bonds with the Dao dissolve transgressions, perfecting virtue and wisdom; the world attains great peace, all nations harmonize; and all beings escape suffering, entering the true and correct.

With utmost sincerity, bow to the Supreme, Correct, and True Three Treasures, extolling their merit. For all future lives, establish karmic affinities of goodness, dispelling ignorance and receiving sagely grace. A hundred blessings adorn, ten thousand virtues gather like clouds, benefiting all beings, liberating them from suffering. Make offerings and pay reverence to the compassionate teachings. May one forever uphold them, burning incense morning and night to seek blessings. May they circulate throughout the world without negligence.

A gāthā says:
With skillful expedient wisdom,
Manifesting as one wills,
Accomplishing all beings,
Unobstructed and thorough.
Beyond existence and non-existence,
Without self or other,
Constantly uphold good vows,
Encouraging others to awaken.
Let them seek supreme goodness,
Far from evil paths.
Attain fearlessness,
The pure fruit of the Dharma.
All unobstructed,
Universally enter the Dharma-gates.
All who possess this heart
Shall all attain liberation.

**Taiqing Realm *Cavern Abyss Scripture*** (Chapter Four)

Within the *Great Cavern Taiqing Scripture*, jeweled clouds and jade thrones, five-colored auspicious clouds fill the empty sky without end. The great sages of heaven and the assembled immortals gather therein, illuminating profound principles. Celestial youths and maidens present treasures in offering, venerating the Correct and True, beseeching the Great Compassion to broadly extend expedient means, expounding the scriptures and disseminating the Dao’s currents. Even myriad scriptures and ten thousand treatises—all are wondrous meanings, enabling all to attain understanding and awakening.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the assembly: After Daoist priests and nuns leave the household life, they must uphold scriptures, precepts, and ritual codes, seeking transmission from a master. They must exhaust utmost sincerity. After receiving scriptures, they dare not resent the Dao or blame the master, nor carelessly divulge or slight sacred texts, lest calamity befall their seven ancestors, subjecting them to judgment in the netherworld courts.

If there are those of utmost integrity who exhaust their cinnabar sincerity, whose virtue and conduct are pure and simple, whose actions are upright, and whose generations are renowned—whose bodies and minds are both pure—yet have not encountered the secret essentials of the Dao’s canon, they should earnestly turn toward the Dao, seeking a master to initiate and deliver them, ascending to blessed fruits and advancing toward the unsurpassed Dao.

Once possessing scriptures and methods, they must unite in heart and intent, awaiting numinous response. They must not outwardly feign dignified conduct while inwardly harboring complacency, falsely praising themselves and disparaging others, claiming this is right and that is wrong, or envying those superior to themselves. They should constantly encourage and guide, never mocking the unenlightened. Such wisdom shall grow day by day, culminating in boundless wisdom, difficult to extol.

The great scriptures of the Three Caverns are transmitted only after set durations: the highest sages bestow them upon perfected transcendents and superior immortals after forty thousand kalpas; divine immortals after four thousand years, or a thousand years, or seven hundred years; and in the mundane world, after forty years. Should one truly comprehend these scriptures, it would be deemed inconceivable. Even the wise and discerning deem them rare to encounter—how much more so for those of shallow learning in the Dao, who could scarcely attain them? If there be scholars who wholeheartedly devote themselves to a single assembly, they must exert their utmost sincerity, uphold their vows in perpetuity, and with refined devotion move the divine spirits, never betraying their original resolve. Persisting without slack, they too may ascend to the ranks of immortality and attain the unsurpassed Dao. Yet one must fear the lack of resolve, lest halfway they abandon themselves, repeatedly harming the Dao—not only achieving no merit, but incurring transgression. You all should trust my words, adhere to the teachings and precepts, and widely propagate them.

For all invocations and petitions, one must receive and uphold them in accordance with the method: compose the mind, assume a dignified demeanor, arrange the sequence in order, proceed with graceful steps, heed the twelve double-hours’ bell, hold flowers and lead with hymns, grasp the ritual tablets and wield the censer, raise the banners and establish the truths, and ascend the altar with solemn composure. Whether Daoist priests or female officials perform rites for themselves or others—seeking blessings, repenting sins, or dispelling calamities—they must do so with wholehearted sincerity, earnestly praying, addressing and invoking with clear and harmonious speech, ensuring the text and reasoning are upright. They must not jest with melodies, modulate their voices in exaggerated rises and falls, or mingle their words and tones to provoke astonishment. Whether conducting rituals, offering thanks, chanting praises, or expounding teachings, all must be practiced until fluent. They should not falter or break off midway, leaving the text and reasoning disjointed. Such lapses not only disrupt the solemnity of the invocation but may also invite misfortune. In every matter, one must concentrate, adhere to the original forms and rituals, and thereby gain boundless, immeasurable blessings and manifold benefits. The celestial perfected will rejoice, all methods will harmonize in beauty, and through such merit, eternal felicity shall be attained.

And the gatha says:
Purity is the fruit of the Dharma, greatly to be extolled.
Purity is the medicine of the Dharma, curing all ills.
Purity of heart is supreme, tranquility and bliss are ultimate.
Purity and solemnity are equal, boundless and without limit.
The worldly methods of the Dao dispel all poisons.
First, they relieve hunger and thirst, transforming all beings,
Enabling them to achieve perfection and sever all delusions.
Ever abiding in good deeds, one attains profound depth in the Dharma.

The merits of all scriptures have been concealed for kalpas within the jeweled treasuries of the Flowery Hall Palace, never lightly disclosed to the lower world. Now, by good fortune, they may be heard. Those who receive and uphold them, practicing the Dao, expounding their teachings, and reciting the true scriptures, should place five-colored flowers in a container. With each practice of the Dao and chanting of goodness, scatter them into the empty void—this is called "scattering flowers," offered to declare one’s vows.

When reciting this scripture, one should first circumambulate it once, hold incense, bow in reverence, perform the three prostrations, sit upright, purify with water, and waft incense to sanctify the scripture. Concentrate the spirit, gather qi, praise and take refuge, and humbly make entreaties—only then may one attain blessings beyond conception.

The celestial perfected keep their secrets hidden, unknown to the world, which is why those who cultivate truth and nurture qi rarely grasp these essential texts. I shall now briefly elucidate them; you must listen and receive without distraction, that you may truly hear.

The superior adept regards silence as the cultivation of qi—this is preserving qi, yet it leads to dullness. To inhale purity and exhale impurity is the exchange of qi, yet it leads to emptiness. Dullness scatters qi and maddens the spirit; the true numen grows weary and finds no refuge. Emptiness leaves the cinnabar field barren; breath control is labored in vain, and qi cannot abide. These are not true methods of nurturing qi but invite illness, mistaken for "embryonic breathing," harming one’s nature and life. Many err in this way.

Swallowing and gulping, gathering qi to refine the spirit, pointing to it as "returning the elixir"—this harms one’s nature and life. Many err in this way.

To exist as if continuous, entrusting qi to harmonize with the spirit, exhaling and inhaling with intent to abide, drawing qi inward without release, sealing breath to temper the form—one swallow after another, gathering both flanks, taking empty swallowing as the method—this is borrowing qi to draw water, an irrigation technique, yet deemed a means to secure the body’s field, only to deplete oneself. Many err in this way.

Sitting upright, raising the body, filling the four great elements with qi, circulating the blood and channels, nourishing and protecting with harmony—this is the method of "dispersing qi to burn the body." Yet these are not true ways of nurturing qi but are mistaken for "congealing the spirit in seated oblivion," only to lose the body and harm life. Many err in this way.

All such practices are mere techniques; where technique is established, the Dao vanishes. Those who cultivate truth must use technique to illuminate the Dao and thereby attain it. Seeking the Dao through the generation of heaven and earth, one may grasp it. Those who lose the Dao rely on the qi of emptiness and spontaneity to engender chaos, yet chaos alone preserves the Dao. When chaos is pierced to form the seven apertures, chaos dies, and heaven and earth arise. Once heaven and earth are divided, the Dao is difficult to preserve in full.

Heaven and earth unite yin and yang to move; spirit and qi activate, giving rise to humans and beasts. When spirit and qi are still, grasses, trees, mountains, and stones emerge. Yet when humans are born through the union of male and female, and grasses and trees through seeds, the mechanism of heaven and earth’s transformation is already extinguished. To rely on technique is to lack the mechanism of heaven and earth—how can one speak of the Dao?

Cultivating truth and nurturing qi is to preserve the Dao in full. Aligning with the qi of heaven and earth to cultivate truth and nurture qi, one may attain profound stillness, ever-responsive yet ever-quiet, abiding in non-action as if in action, and in action as if in non-action—only then may one speak of the Dao.

And the gatha says:
This Dao is practiced as one,
Yet without form.

How can there be techniques? Only a rough outline may be shown. All sentient beings may attain liberation. By exhorting and guiding others, one leads them into the gate of truth. This is rare and wondrous, manifesting boundlessly, inexhaustible in its use, and thus employed to guide others. Bestowing fearlessness and rectifying the intentions of learners, let none be deluded by a single technique or entangled in manifold vows.

The *Inner Secret Scripture of Talismans* within the Taiqing Realm concludes here.

**Taiqing Realm Scripture of the Thirty-Six Venerable Scriptures**
*Taiqing Scripture, Thorough Vision Scripture, Assembly of Immortals Scripture, Cavern Abyss Scripture, Inner Secret Scripture, True One Scripture*—the above six scriptures share a single fascicle.

**Taiqing Realm True One Scripture, Chapter Six**
The qi of the True One arises from the Dao, receives qi to come into being, and is perfected by qi—this is called *ming* (life-destiny). From the True One, form is endowed, and one’s *xing* (nature) may be preserved whole. The movement of *xing* and *ming* is governed by the heart. When the heart engages in thought, it is called *yi* (intention). The movement of *yi*, when it involves contemplation, is called *zhi* (will). When contemplation culminates in accomplishment, with nothing unconsolidated, it is called *zhi* (wisdom). Wisdom that encompasses all things is called *lü* (deliberation). That which moves to nourish the body is called *hun* (ethereal soul). That which stills to stabilize the body is called *po* (corporeal soul). That which flows through bones and flesh is called *blood*. Preserving form, nurturing spirit, and gathering qi is called *jing* (essence). When spirit harmonizes and delights, and qi is pure and unburdened, it is called *he* (harmony). When spirit gathers qi and thereafter engages in nurture and protection, encompassing the hundred bones, it is called *shen* (body). When all images are fully manifest, it is called *xing* (form). When inert and unmoving, it is called *zhi* (substance). When form and appearance are regulated, it is called *ti* (frame). When small and large are distinct, it is called *qu* (trunk). When myriad thoughts cannot grasp it, it is called *shen* (spirit). When vast and transformative, it is called *ling* (numinous). When qi enters the body, it is called *sheng* (life); when qi departs from form, it is called *si* (death). That which pervades life is called the Dao.

The Dao exists yet has no form; it is formless yet possesses essence. Its transformations are unfathomable, pervading the numinous. All living beings naturally attain their life and sustenance, thus preserving the Dao in its rough outline. They also attain their generation and completion, all of which should be natural and not contrary to principle. You should follow my words to broadly propagate the teachings, without allowing deviant views to arise and disrupt true reality. Exhort others to cultivate the Dao, which is to cultivate the heart. Teach others to cultivate the heart, and the Dao may be seen thereby. The Dao cannot be seen directly—it is seen through the heart. The Dao cannot be heard directly—it is heard through the heart. All hearing and seeing of the Dao arise through the heart. The heart cannot be constant; it is guarded by the Dao. If not guarded by the Dao, and one follows the heart’s hearing and seeing, this is to enter a heterodox school, never to attain liberation or hear the Dharma.

Thus, the multitudes of heavenly immortals, the great sages and perfected beings of the heavens, and the countless hosts of celestial perfected ones—having heard my teachings—came to know the Dao. If one can further empty the heart to dispel its substance, be without heart to dispel its existence, stabilize the heart to render it unmoving, still the heart to render it unconfused, rectify the heart to render it unerring, purify the heart to render it unstained, and cleanse the heart to render it unpolluted—you are not unaware of this. Yet you must constantly diligently practice, without allowing retrogression or obstruction. Know that all dharmas should be thus. If, within this, deviant views arise, one strays from the true Dao, loses all insight, and generates separate thoughts, mistaking them for wisdom—confusing body and mind, one turns away from the Dao and harms the true qi.

Such multitudes, due to their shallow karmic conditions in past lives, create obstructions to the true teaching. I now expound this so that you may all understand the heart, and in turn teach others, guiding their hearts to be upright, without reversal. When the heart is level, without high or low; when the heart is bright, never dim or obscure; when the heart is unobstructed, without hindrance—then, in the purity of body and mind, one awakens to all hearts and perceives all things clearly. Such merit is complete, inconceivable, immeasurable, and perfectly fulfilled.

And the gatha says:
You who have not seen, have not heard—
From this day forth, all shall see, all shall hear.
When you take refuge in the Dao and practice this,
Praise its merit, enter the ocean of merit.
In non-action, meet the Dao;
With mindful resolve, the mind arises.
Boundless causes and conditions,
Boundless karmic retribution.
The Dharma of non-action
Is called the name of Dao-perfection.
Unobstructed liberation—
This is the true Dao.

**Taiqing Realm Collected Spirits Scripture** (Chapter Seven)

The Heavenly Perfected Great Sages, the Utmost Perfected Great Spirits, the Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings of the Ten Directions and the Boundless Immeasurable, and all the assembled immortals gather in this place. Now that you have attained the Dao, you should know the supreme and victorious causes, which are the wondrous fruits. Together, turn your merits toward the gathering of spirits to aid the Dao, so that spirit and qi unite as one.

If you wish to hear these essential principles, you must uphold and practice my teachings, guiding all beings of the future to know my doctrine. All human bodies share the same original nature, yet through the seven emotions and six desires, they harm their fundamental nature and thus fail to hear my Dharma.

Now that you have vowed to deliver all beings, you have gained such immeasurable wisdom and true heart. Cultivate few thoughts, few intentions, few desires, few affairs, few words, few laughs, few sorrows, few joys, few likes, few dislikes. Only then will your spirit-light remain undisturbed, your spirit and qi unconfused, and you may properly follow the Dao.

Among the multitude, those who think excessively will surely endanger their spirit; those who contemplate excessively will scatter their will; those with many desires will deplete their qi; those entangled in many affairs will exhaust their form; those who speak excessively will weaken their qi; those who laugh excessively will harm their viscera; those who grieve excessively will disperse their blood; those who indulge in excessive joy will cause their qi to overflow; those who rejoice excessively will disorder the hundred spirits; those who rage excessively will unsettle the hundred meridians; those who covet excessively will fall into confusion and disorder; those who hate excessively will become emaciated and joyless. Their original nature will be impure, their studies imprecise, and their qi will scatter of itself.

Even if they encounter an enlightened teacher, they will not comprehend the true principle. Though they may know the methods of nurturing life, they will not awaken to the practice of cultivation. Thus, all they see and hear will not be the true Dao. Though they may understand the intent of refining the spirit, if they do not grasp the essentials of attaining the Dao, all they study and expound will not be the correct teaching.

One need not speak at length to obtain the Dharma. Therefore, those who cultivate the truth set their minds on the mysterious origin and willingly embrace solitude. Though active, they always appear serene and settled; though settled, they always appear active. When their qi is full and their merit complete, the five qi harmonize and flow smoothly, ascending to the origin. The Three Flowers gather at the crown, blood congeals and qi collects, the ten thousand spirits pay homage to the Perfected, all dwelling in the Upper Palace. There, wealth and honor flourish, pavilions and halls rise in splendor, jade lads and heavenly youths, jade maidens and heavenly maidens, the twelve celestial lads and twelve celestial maidens—all play celestial music, waft incense and flowers, unfurl banners and canopies, array reed pipes and flutes. Such magnificence transcends the mortal world, known as the Supreme Perfected Upper Realm, the Upper Palace of one’s own body.

If one cannot achieve liberation and remains attached, the hun-soul will scatter and the spirit become disordered. Should even a single thought arise in this state, one will fall into the deluded ford. Those who aspire to higher learning must, at this moment, remain unmoved by all circumstances. Only generate the supreme mind; only cultivate boundless merit. Only generate the supreme mind; only cultivate boundless wisdom. Only generate the supreme mind; only cultivate boundless goodness. Only generate the mind of unobstructed freedom, desiring to widely reach the ten directions, so that all beings of the immeasurable and boundless future may hear the true Dao. Do not arise any greedy thoughts, any perverse views, any delusive dreams, any obstacles, any afflictions, or any defiled attachments to desire.

Such is the true Dharma—vast beyond conception, beyond description. Only then will one know that the orthodox tradition emerges from the profound and obscure, not seeking petty confirmations that delude the true nature.

And the gatha says:
All returns to reliance—
It is but a single condition.
If there is one whose virtue and conduct are complete,
Who abandons the mind of action and generates the intent of non-action,
Who does not distance themselves from revered virtue,
Nor draw near to the unkind,
Who contemplates the Three Treasures without ceasing,
Never wavering in resolve,
All practices perfected,
Virtue fully attained,
The Dao accomplished without defilement or hindrance—
You should know this scripture thus.

**Talismans of the Collected Spirits Scripture**
*Taiqing Realm Collected Spirits Scripture* concludes here.

**Taiqing Realm Central Essence Scripture** (Chapter Eight)

At that time, wishing to illuminate the true Dao, I emitted a five-colored radiant light, pervading the three thousand great thousand worlds. Within it, all manner of different worlds, heavens and hells, were fully revealed. The Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions and all the Great Perfected Immortals were also seen within it. The sufferings and joys of birth and death, the measure of karmic retribution, the stages of Daoist cultivation—all were seen within it. The lands of suffering and bliss were likewise revealed.

The assembly from the ten directions, as numerous as motes of dust and beyond counting, all beheld this radiant light. The boundless, immeasurable sufferings of hell-beings were also seen within this light. Then, the True Person of the Great Ultimate, through the power of great compassion, great mercy, and great wisdom, took pity on sentient beings, seeing their differing experiences of suffering and joy, the varying karmic retributions of heavens and hells. He only wished that the Heavenly Worthy, the Utmost Sage, would proclaim the teaching for the sake of all, delivering great benefit, enabling liberation, forever severing evil conditions, and swiftly rebirth in the Pure Land.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, saying: "Now, by means of my qi, transform your bodies and descend to the Eastern Direction. If the people of a kalpa see the world’s suffering, then say: *The Heavenly Worthy of Jade Purity, who Bestows Blessings, delivers all from calamity.* For the wandering souls of the departed who have not yet transcended rebirth, say: *The Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure, Supreme August One, delivers all from stagnation.* In the Southern Direction, the Heavenly Worthy who Prolongs Life and Augments Destiny saves the living; the Heavenly Worthy of Mysterious Perfection and Myriad Blessings delivers the dead. In the Western Direction, the Heavenly Worthy of the Eight Trigrams who Protects the Body saves the living; the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Mystery delivers the dead..."

In the Northern Direction, the Heavenly Worthy who Dispels Disasters and Resolves Misfortunes saves the living; the Heavenly Worthy of Mysterious Supreme Jade Dawn delivers the dead. In the Northeastern Direction, the Heavenly Worthy of Purple Purity who Bestows Blessings saves the living; the Heavenly Worthy who Delivers Immortals and Supreme Sages delivers the dead. In the Southeastern Direction, the Heavenly Worthy of Longevity who Protects Life saves the living; the Heavenly Worthy of Compassionate Deliverance delivers the dead. In the Southwestern Direction, the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Blessings saves the living; the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Numinous Emptiness delivers the dead. In the Northwestern Direction, the Heavenly Worthy of the Nine Palaces who Shields from Misfortune saves the living; the Heavenly Worthy of Infinite Great Splendor delivers the dead. In the Upper Direction, the Heavenly Worthy who Protects Life and Guards the Body saves the living; the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Emptiness and Luminous Sovereignty delivers the dead. In the Lower Direction, the Heavenly Worthy who Augments Great Blessings saves the living; the Heavenly Worthy of the Grotto Spirits and True Sovereign delivers the dead.

The life of all people is born of the qi of Heaven. In the true north, the Central One qi generates water, and all things are born through water. Thus, the Northern Dipper resides at the center of Heaven, revolving through the Four Directions, governing the life, death, fortune, and misfortune of all people. The first star of the Northern Dipper, Greedy Wolf, and the third star, Wealth Repository, form the Eastern Dipper, which governs destiny. The second star, Great Gate, and the fourth star, Literary Brilliance, form the Western Dipper, which records names. The sixth star, Military Brilliance, rightfully occupies its position as the Northern Dipper, presiding over death. The fifth star, Integrity and Chastity, forms the Southern Dipper, which bestows life. The seventh star, Breaking Army, rightfully occupies the central position as the Great Chief of the Central Dipper, overseeing all spirits. All things in the myriad realms, in life and death, belong to the Northern Dipper. The External Assistant stars encircle it, the Hidden Origin stars inwardly assist it, and they point to the twelve earthly branches. When saving the living, they are collectively called the Jade Armillary Sphere; when delivering the dead, they are collectively called the Vast and Open. If sentient beings encounter disasters or misfortunes, they may perform expiatory rites, offer prayers, and hold jiao rituals according to the direction, and no good deed will go unanswered.

Then a gatha is spoken:
By this essential Dharma,
disseminated throughout the world,
if there are those who see or hear,
boundless karmic conditions arise.
Good men and faithful women,
practice in accordance with these affairs.
Cultivate the practice of equality,
with minds filled with joy.
Those who practice thus,
will all attain accomplishment,
rightly entering the non-action,
and the unretreatable karmic conditions.
All sentient beings,
should believe these words,
receive this true teaching,
and diligently uphold it.

**The Scripture of Immeasurable Meaning from the Taiqing Realm, Ninth Chapter**

When I expound the Dharma, I shall speak to you thus: you must remain silent, settle your spirits, and cast aside all distracting thoughts, only then may you hear this Dharma.

The Dharma is fundamentally without Dharma; its principle returns to spontaneity. The mind, disturbed by circumstances, gives rise to the notion of establishing Dharma.

You should generate such vast, inconceivable, and immeasurable good causes, and not entertain divergent views.

In the Jade Purity Realm, I do not speak of all Dharmas. The Dharma categories of the Highest Purity Realm consist of eighteen gates illuminating seven stages. The Dharma categories of the Great Purity Realm consist of twenty gates illuminating nine stages.

The Orthodox Categories of the Numinous Treasure do not speak of all Dharmas. The Auxiliary Categories of the Numinous Treasure consist of fifty gates illuminating thirty-six categories. The Dharma categories of the Jade Void consist of twenty gates illuminating one stage, including esoteric methods of altar divination and augury.

The Dharma sections of the Northern Culmen of Heaven comprise twelve stages and categories. The seventh category, the *Illumination of the Four Sages*, also pertains to the third category of Fengdu, hence it is called the *Fengdu Summons and Inquisition*. The *Illumination of the Four Sages* and Fengdu together comprise twelve categories.

The seventh category, the *Three-Five Conjoint Illumination*, pertains to spirit possession. The fifth category of Fengdu pertains to summons and inquisition. The *Illumination of the Four Sages* comprises seven stages, the *Fengdu Illumination* five categories, and the *Numinous Writings Below the Dipper* thirty-six gates illuminating four stages, including mirror-water incense illumination, *Three-Five Paper Illumination*, and *Fengdu Earth Illumination*—all serve universal purposes.

Cultivators of the Dao who have not yet attained the wondrous realm should generate such a mind, delivering all living beings, concentrating their thoughts on the utmost truth, without arousing greed or seeking karmic rewards. Through gradual accumulation and long practice, they may gradually enter the initial vehicle.

If, within the Dharma, they again generate greed and craving, they will lose the true Way and incur immeasurable transgressions.

At that time, the Heavenly Perfected Great Spirits, the Utmost Perfected Great Spirits, the Immeasurable Flying Heavenly Great Spirits, and all the sagely hosts of the heavens, having heard this exposition, each rejoiced and spoke thus: If there are Dao-adherents who can generate such a mind, desiring to deliver all beings from suffering, we shall transform our bodies and descend, commanding the great generals of the heavens and the divine officers and soldiers of the ten directions and four quarters to assist in upholding the Dharma, enabling all sentient beings and the immeasurable beings of the six paths and four births to prolong their lives, the dead to revive, the sick to recover, and ghosts, demons, and malevolent spirits to attain liberation. Enmities and grudges shall each be dissolved. Such benefits are indeed inconceivable.

Having thus generated good thoughts, they bowed their heads in reverence and gave thanks.

The Heavenly Worthy then addressed the great assembly, saying: You are fortunate from past lives, having been born among humans and gods, enjoying all pleasures, clothed in celestial silks, and nourished by sweet dew. You are free from the cold and heat of the four seasons, from the darkness of day and night, and from the names of birth, old age, sickness, death, the three evil destinies, and the eight difficulties. The earth is level as a mirror, adorned with the seven treasures. The bodies you receive are pure in the six senses, unstained by the six dusts, and you constantly hear me expound the Dharma, increasing your wisdom.

Now, having generated the mind of supreme wisdom, desiring to deliver all beings from suffering and enable all sentient beings to hear the Dharma, this is the greatest benefit.

Only those of meager merit, whose roots of faith are weak, though they hear this Dharma, encounter many obstacles, sinking into the苦 realms with no hope of escape. Such persons are difficult to deliver.

Then a gatha is spoken:
Behold the people of the world,
all their obstacles and difficulties,
the afflictions of vexation—
hard indeed to describe.
Unknowing of turning toward the good,
they accumulate day and night,
and having once obtained,
again generate greed and craving.
The various transgressions,
immeasurable and boundless.
Some encounter grave illness,
dying in vain.
After death,
they return to the wheel of suffering.
If they do not hear the Dharma,
they shall never awaken.
The *Numinous Talismans of the Scripture of Immeasurable Meaning*
**The Scripture of Immeasurable Meaning from the Taiqing Realm concludes here.**

**The Scripture of Gathering Palaces from the Taiqing Realm, Tenth Chapter**

When I expound the Dharma, all the gods and immortals of the heavens, all the great perfected ones, and all the sagely hosts, through the wondrous Dharma, shall attain lofty and luminous wisdom, becoming of one kind without distinction. Their countenances shall be subtle and wondrous, their Dao-conduct spontaneous, their voices harmonious and refined. Their palaces and abodes shall vary in height as they wish. At the arising of a thought, immeasurable jeweled nets and all manner of jeweled trees shall fully cover the ground. A natural, pure wind shall blow through the jeweled nets and trees, producing subtle and wondrous sounds. Those who encounter this wind shall find all their toils and defilements stilled. As the wind brushes their bodies, they shall naturally attain coolness and immeasurable bliss. Fragrant flowers shall scatter and fill the ground, arranged in order of color without confusion. In that realm, the limitless Perfected Ones shall abide.

All the perfected ones, heavenly immortals, and great spirits shall each emit hundreds and thousands of rays of light, universally expounding the wondrous Dharma for the dust-mote worlds of the ten directions, universally delivering sentient beings.

If there are those whose right wisdom is complete and who are born in that realm, they shall immediately abide in right concentration. According to the gravity of their evil karma, they shall be taught the superior, middle, or lesser vehicles, each according to their wisdom and vows.

At that time, the immeasurable perfected ones and immortals of the ten directions shall all come to this place to reverently make offerings, listen to the scriptural Dharma, and propagate the transformation of the Dao.

All sentient beings who come to this realm and arrive at its palaces shall possess wisdom.

At that time, the perfected ones and immortals, by virtue of the immeasurable power of great merit, the immeasurable power of great wisdom, and the immeasurable power of great spiritual penetrations, shall come and go without obstruction, pervading the immeasurable worlds of the ten directions. They shall spontaneously transform and manifest, arriving as soon as a thought arises.

The perfected ones emit wondrous sounds, extolling virtuous deeds. As they listen to the scriptural Dharma, their joy is boundless. They tread upon the void, walking through emptiness, and those who hear them find their minds opened and their understanding liberated, attaining the right fruit in accord with these virtuous sounds.

Then a gentle breeze arises, and from the seven-jeweled trees issue subtle and wondrous tones, playing the celestial melodies of the gods. Spontaneous bliss arises, beyond all description.

The teachings expounded are of vast meaning, benefiting all sentient beings. In that realm, there is no self, no person—only purity, non-action, and wisdom ever triumphant. Such is the reward they attain.

Yet if there are those who, though born in human form, lack wisdom, their roots of faith feeble, who never hear the true Dharma nor behold the wondrous Dao, their reward is thus—due to the shallowness of their past accumulations.

Thereupon, the Perfected of Supreme Truth, the Celestial Perfected of Supreme Truth, and the immeasurable flying celestial spirits, having heard these words, all arise in reverence. They bow their heads, kneel in obeisance, and address the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "We, having received the gift of your teaching, have gained such benefit. We humbly beseech your great compassion to broadly extend salvation and protection, that all who have not yet heard may hear, and all who have not yet seen may see. May all sentient beings suffering in affliction attain liberation."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Excellent! You have aroused this virtuous aspiration—such merit is inconceivable. Now, for your sake, I shall proclaim the true Dharma and the various rites of offering and repentance, that on the days of *jiǎzǐ*, *gēngshēn*, the Three Primes, the Eight Festivals, one’s life-destiny day, and birthdays, you may pray for blessings, repent of transgressions, and avert calamities, all attaining joy together."

Then he spoke in verse:
*"I reveal this Dharma,*
*Speaking thus directly."*

With hearts filled with joy, all manner of afflictions are swiftly dispelled, and one’s condition returns to its original state. All dharmas are likewise—yet there is nothing to be gained, nothing to be gained? What then is gained? Is there truly no attainment?

The wise attain through wisdom; with each thought, this mind constantly savors the flavor of the Dharma, advancing in diligence and attaining sagacity.

*The Scripture of the Yellow Court of the Supreme Clarity Realm (Chapter Eleven)*

Beings take diverse forms, yet their birth arises from a single qi. The hun-soul is received from Heaven, while the body and po-soul are received from Earth. Without form or image, they come from the emptiness of space, merely borrowing father and mother to transform non-being into being. After three hundred days, the fetus is complete; once the gestation is fulfilled, birth occurs—thus does non-being become being.

Therefore, the spirit takes qi as its mother, and qi takes form as its dwelling. Refining qi gives rise to spirit; refining form returns it to qi. If the yang-spirit has not gathered, the Three Flowers will not enter the Mud Pill Palace. If the true qi has not ascended, the Five Colors will not arise in the Cinnabar Field.

Thus, though Heaven and Earth are vast, they cannot escape the signs of light purity and heavy turbidity. Though the sun and moon are bright, they cannot avoid the forms of waxing fullness and waning darkness. The accumulation of yang gives birth to spirit, which ascends to adorn Heaven as stars and constellations. The accumulation of yin gives birth to form, which descends to strengthen Earth as soil and stone.

Within water, qi rises, becoming mist and clouds. Within qi, water descends, becoming rain and dew. All phenomena and myriad beings cannot be without form; they gather numinosity to live and rely on the Dao to be perfected.

Thus, below the Three Clarities are the Three Supremes; within the Three Supremes are the Two Modes. Once the Two Modes are divided, the Five Emperors are arrayed; once the Five Emperors are established, they unite in a single realm. Within this Heaven and Earth, the qi of above and below—only in humans is essence the mother and qi the master. Each of the five viscera contains essence, and from essence qi is born. Each of the five viscera contains qi, and from qi spirit is born. Spirit can generate longevity, preserving life and destiny.

Refine essence into the elixir; nurture qi into spirit. True immortals and sagely beings cultivate truth and nurture qi, naturally and spontaneously, with inner reality responding to outer signs. What they undertake is surely accomplished, ascending from the mundane to the sacred.

In the birth of a male, the right kidney forms first, enclosing external essence within internal blood—this is the wrapping of yin. In the birth of a female, the left kidney forms first, enclosing external blood within internal essence—this is the wrapping of yang.

The kidneys generate the spleen; the spleen generates the liver; the liver generates the lungs; the lungs generate the heart; the heart generates the small intestine; the small intestine generates the large intestine; the large intestine generates the gallbladder; the gallbladder generates the stomach; the stomach generates the inner kidneys; the inner kidneys generate the bladder; the bladder generates the Three Primes; the Three Primes generate the Triple Burner; the Triple Burner generates the Eight Vessels; the Eight Vessels generate the Twelve Channels; the Twelve Channels generate the Fifteen Collaterals; the Fifteen Collaterals generate one hundred eighty subsidiary collaterals; one hundred eighty subsidiary collaterals generate one hundred eighty encircling collaterals; one hundred eighty encircling collaterals generate thirty-six thousand grandchild collaterals; thirty-six thousand grandchild collaterals generate three hundred sixty-five bones; three hundred sixty-five bones generate eighty-four thousand hair pores.

Once the gestation is complete, the numinous radiance enters the body, and the child separates from the mother to become a person. Speaking of inner and outer: within the channels and collaterals is the inner; beyond the muscles and skin is the outer.

To nurture life is to nurture the five viscera, for the five viscera are the root—when the root is firm, the leaves flourish of themselves. To nurture form is to nurture the five qi, for the five qi are the source—when the source runs deep, the flow lengthens of itself.

The great circulation of true qi follows the primordial qi of Heaven; the minor circulation of true qi follows the primordial qi of the sun. Among the five viscera, the kidneys are the sea of essence, and the heart is the palace of qi. True essence resides in the kidneys, while surplus essence naturally returns to the lower Cinnabar Field. True qi resides in the heart, while surplus qi naturally ascends to the middle Prime, all converging in the true scene of the Yellow Court.

Then he spoke in verse:
*"Contemplate the Dao and leave the household,*
*Guiding and receiving sentient beings,*
*That they may escape suffering*
*And hear the teachings of the Dao.*
*Bestowing benefit upon all,*
*Immeasurable multitudes of beings,*
*Attaining great spiritual power,*
*All from the perfection of the Dao.*
*Gaining fearlessness,*
*Supernormal powers and freedom,*
*Coming and going, returning,*
*Without obstruction.*
*Thus exists this Dharma,*
*To ferry across the multitudes.*
*Recognize the root of the Dharma,*
*And the causes for entering the Dao."*

*Scripture of the Lesser Kalpa of the Supreme Clarity Realm* – Chapter Twelve

Heaven and earth divide their forms and undergo transformations, revolving in accord with the reckoning of qi, thus giving rise to prosperity and adversity. The sun and moon revolve by virtue of heaven and earth, hence their brightness and dimness, fullness and waning; the constellations likewise follow their celestial paths, thus some halt while others proceed. Since humans receive the qi of heaven and earth to come into being, how could they be without calamity or fortune?

Therefore, I expound the Dharma, ever urging you to broadly proclaim the true Dao, illuminating its essential teachings, that all the heavens and immortals, the immeasurable flying devas and great spirits, and the boundless assemblies of sages may together arise in praise, attaining the hearing of this teaching.

Then the one above addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "I venture to ask—when the people below encounter calamity or adversity, what meritorious deeds should they perform, what practices should they cultivate, to escape all suffering and affliction and realize the supreme Dao?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "If one seeks all forms of liberation, to forever escape the cycle of rebirth and depart from the snares of doubt, there is nothing but to reverently recite and turn the scriptural texts, cultivate all meritorious deeds, perform prostrations and repentance, offer praise and extolment, burn incense and light lamps, fashion the Ten Absolute Banners, circumambulate and lecture on the scriptures, distribute alms to the poor and destitute, and liberate all living beings. Let the six desires and seven emotions remain ever unstained; let the three karmas and six senses never again be enacted. With concentrated thought and serene stillness, cast aside all distracting thoughts. Thus may one be reborn in the celestial realms, delighting in bliss and freedom, born into the halls of great fortune.

If there are those who suffer from illness, official entanglements, imprisonment in cangues and fetters, ensnarement in nets, pestilential toxins, seasonal epidemics, or prolonged misfortune—who find no means of escape—and if the consciousness of the departed still lingers in the depths, enduring the torments of hell, the merit of this scripture is indeed immeasurable. If one further broadly arouses the true heart, widely bestows the power of blessings, establishes Daoist altars, hangs banners and canopies, observes purification and repentance, and arranges vegetarian feasts, extending these to all the six paths and four modes of birth, to the host of orphaned souls and lingering spirits without refuge, to offer deliverance and salvation—if one does so with day and night reverence, with a sincere heart and earnest prayers—then all suffering and misfortune shall be dispelled in due time.

The immeasurable perfected ones bow their heads in praise, all acclaiming the excellent fruit, the benefit to sentient beings, and the great supernormal powers—such as these are indeed difficult to encounter even in a hundred thousand kalpas.

The intent of this scripture comprises seven aspects:
1. **Attainment through wisdom**—each thought is the heart-mind;
2. **Understanding through practice**—seeking the Dao and leaving the household;
3. **Manifest benefit**—guiding and receiving sentient beings;
4. **Beneficial application**—contemplating the sages;
5. **Wisdom**—attaining great spiritual power;
6. **Attainment of power**—gaining fearlessness;
7. **Virtue fulfilled**—supernormal powers and freedom.

These seven aspects allow coming and going, returning without obstruction, thus possessing such subtlety and wonder. They serve as the medicinal Dharma for all sentient beings, delivering them from all calamities, illnesses, and sufferings.

If good men and women can attain understanding, receive the true and authentic discourse, recognize the fundamental power of the great Dharma, and enter the causes for the great Dao, then from the place of their thoughts, they shall gain immeasurable causes and conditions, attain the supreme, most true, and great wisdom—profound and wondrous beyond conception.

From beginning to end, uphold and maintain this without slackening, forever preserving it without end. By practicing thus, all shall return to their true nature. The application shall yield profound and far-reaching effects, with true and real responses, boundless and unlimited.

Reveal to all sentient beings the power of such expedient means.

Then he spoke in verse:
*"The supreme Dao is all-pervading,*
*Equal and without obstruction.*
*What the Great Vehicle practices,*
*The Lesser Vehicle employs.*
*Neither false nor real,*
*Neither existent nor nonexistent.*
*Turning the Wheel of Dharma,*
*From beginning to end, it is accomplished.*
*Only wondrous appearances exist,*
*Non-action yet nothing left undone.*
*Immeasurable causes and conditions,*
*Sometimes departing, sometimes arriving.*
*Thus is right awakening attained,*
*Truly the wondrous body.*
*All become subtle and marvelous,*
*All arising from vows."*
