The *Scripture on Attaining the Dao and Perfecting the Body* Spoken by the Celestial Venerable of Original Beginning

**Title:** *Scripture on Attaining the Dao and Perfecting the Body* Spoken by the Celestial Venerable of Original Beginning. Also known as *The Scripture on Ascending to Heaven, Attaining the Dao, and Perfecting the True Body*.

At that time, the Celestial Venerable of Original Beginning manifested within the Jade Purity Sacred Realm, in the Palace of the Clear and Subtle Heaven upon the Terrace of Yu Luo Xiao, above the Forest of Purity and the Pure Abyss. There, he revealed his true and sacred form of the Void and Spontaneous Action, unfolding the Great Dao of the Original Beginning and the Boundless, expounding the profound and wondrous discourse on the primordial mysteries before the division of the chaotic, and the Great Dao of Purity, Stillness, Non-Action, and Perfected Truth. To the assembled hosts of heaven and immortals, he spoke this *Scripture on Ascending to Heaven, Attaining the Dao, and Perfecting the True Body*.

Now, in the cultivation of perfecting the body, one must regulate diet and conduct. Seal the mouth in solitary sitting, lips lightly touching, teeth aligned. Let the eyes not behold deviant sights, the ears not hear lewd sounds. Purify the heart and cleanse the mind; facing circumstances, forget them. Let the myriad conditions fade away—external thoughts do not enter, internal thoughts do not arise. Do not stir a single念 (niàn), and all affairs are forgotten.

Harmonize the ear’s resonance, contain the eye’s light, seal the tongue’s qi, regulate the breath through the nose. Preserve the spirit and stabilize the intent, guarding inwardly with a single heart. Regulate the breath to be continuous and subtle, exhaling lightly as if present yet absent, never allowing interruption. When breath rests upon spirit-stabilization, nature stabilizes and life abides. Nature and life are both preserved, form and spirit both wondrous, uniting with the Dao in truth.

Profoundly clear, boundlessly still, dimly obscure, silently serene, purely complete, chaotically merged—spirit, essence, soul, and intent. The Three and Five blend as one, the Three Primes converge, the Four Symbols harmonize. The Five Qi return to the origin, the Three Flowers gather at the crown. Returning to the root and restoring life, the myriad spirits unite as one, encompassing all, containing all.

Naturally, the heart-fire descends, the kidney-water ascends, and the mouth generates saliva of its own. Through refinement and tempering over time, it does not dissipate. Naturally, the blood and vessels within the body flow like wind, and the abdomen resounds like thunder. The stringless melody sounds without strumming, resonates without striking.

The harmonious qi permeates, the finest nectar pours upon the crown, the sweet dew sprinkles the heart. Day and night without rest, after three thousand days, the work is complete and the fruit is full. Yin is exhausted, yang is pure, the sacred embryo is accomplished. Within the body, another body forms; the spirit becomes a true sage. The true sage unites with the Great Void, the Great Void unites with True Emptiness, and True Emptiness unites with the Spontaneous Void.

The Spontaneous Void is the Original True One; the Original True One is my true body. Born before heaven, yet formless; growing before heaven, yet without substance. Who is without form or substance? The Great Dao endures eternally, never decaying or perishing. The myriad sages dwell together, perceiving the inner realm, witnessing the affairs of the Void. The spirit speaks of itself, sharing the lifespan of heaven and earth, the years of sun and moon. Only then, liberated from birth and death, is the fruit of the Perfected Truth attained.

Heaven attains the True One, and its divine light is clear and bright. Earth attains the True One, and the myriad things arise. The deviant attains the True One, and naturally returns to correctness. The spirit attains the True One, and becomes the thousand numinous and myriad sages. Man attains the True One, and becomes the true embryo of the divine immortal.

The Dao is fundamentally Void; within the Three Powers and Six Directions, it is nowhere without numinosity, nowhere without sageliness. The Dao is the ancestor of the myriad sages, the origin of the myriad things. In purity and chaos, in concentrating the spirit and refining qi, throughout the twelve hours of the day, remain ever pure, ever still.

The numinous platform free of念 (niàn) is purity; the absence of a single念 (niàn) is stillness. When intent is stabilized, the spirit is whole, and the water’s source is clear. When intent moves, the spirit wanders, and the water’s source is turbid. This is the true barrier between Wood and Metal.

Eating to excess makes breath and qi difficult to stabilize. If the eye’s light is not concentrated, the spirit’s light is not bright. If the ear does not cease listening, the spirit cannot abide. If sounds and sights are not cut off, essence and qi are not complete. If the myriad conditions are not severed, the spirit is not at peace. If the spirit is not at peace, the heart-spirit is not numinous. If the heart-spirit is not numinous, the sacred embryo does not form. If the sacred embryo does not form, one becomes a yin spirit or a lower ghost.

The body is the dwelling of qi; the heart is the abode of the spirit. When intent moves, there is action; when there is action, the spirit moves; when the spirit moves, qi scatters. True action is non-action; stillness resides within it.

When breath rests upon spirit-stabilization, purely complete, chaotically merged, spirit congeals and qi coalesces. In Perfected Truth and non-action, the myriad spirits return to one, and spirit and qi gather. When spirit and qi gather, the Five Phases’ true qi congeals into the elixir pellet. Spirit, qi, and saliva become the true water and fire. Swallowing saliva and absorbing qi is drinking the elixir pellet, also called "finest nectar pouring upon the crown" and "sweet dew sprinkling the heart," or "purifying the heart and cleansing the mind." The heart-spirit unmoved is true bathing.

True purity, true stillness—movement resides within them. If the cultivator does not recognize the true mechanism of movement and stillness, does not comprehend the principle of the Ever-True and Perfected Truth, how can one attain the Dao and become a true being?

Breath unmoved and intent stabilized is "withdrawing." Intent unmoved and spirit congealed is "adding." Spirit congealed and intent moving is "martial refinement." Breath stabilized and spirit congealed is "civil refinement." External thoughts not entering and internal thoughts not arising is "sealing." The two qi exchange, each weighing a catty.

The Spontaneous Void is the application; the myriad spirits returning to one is "preserving accomplishment." Nature stabilized and life abiding is "nurturing the fire." Refining qi into spirit is "true gold." Heart-fire descending is "restoring life." Kidney-water ascending is "returning to the root." Fire welcoming true water is "golden liquid." Water welcoming true fire is "returning elixir." The Five Phases congealing is the "Nine Returns." Yin exhausted and yang pure is the "Seven Reversions." Subduing inner demons is "wild battle." Spirit complete and lacking nothing is "Perfected Truth."

The essence, blood, qi, and spirit are the true seeds. Spirit congealed and qi coalesced unite with True Emptiness.

Within the Central Palace, the womb-intent is the Yellow Dame. Metal’s sentiment and Wood’s nature become husband and wife. The heart-spirit’s true mercury is the Maiden of Cinnabar; the essence-qi’s true lead is the Infant. Essence congealed and form stabilized become the Black Tortoise; refining spirit to congeal it forms the Red Serpent. Forging and refining through breath are the Dragon and Tiger.

Dragon and Tiger, Tortoise and Serpent merge into one mass—this is the harmonizing of the Four Symbols. One nature gathers sentiment to unite Metal and Wood; yin and yang return to become the exchange of Water and Fire.

Fire and Wood share a single source, two natures as one family—South’s two and East’s three together form five. South’s two is the heart-spirit, Fire; East’s three is Liver-Wood, nature. This is Fire born of Wood. Water and Metal share a single source, two natures as one family—North’s one and West’s four together form five. North’s one is Kidney-essence, Water; West’s four is Lung-Metal, sentiment. This is Water born of Metal. The Central Five belongs to Earth—Earth is intent.

When exhaling, the Tiger roars and wind arises; when the Tiger roars, mercury surrenders to lead. Mercury is nature; nature is the mercury within cinnabar. Cinnabar-mercury is the yin within Li, the spirit-qi within the human heart. When intent is settled through breath, spirit-qi is complete; when spirit-qi is complete, nature is perfected.

When inhaling, the Dragon chants and clouds gather; when the Dragon chants, lead surrenders to mercury. Lead is life-destiny; life-destiny is the metal within water. The metal within water is refining essence into qi; refining essence into qi is essence-qi congealing. When essence-qi congeals, form is stabilized; when form is firm, essence-qi is complete; when essence-qi is complete, life-destiny is perfected.

With both nature and life-destiny complete, essence, qi, and blood fill the body; spirit congeals and qi coalesces. Three thousand merits fulfilled, pure yang is refined—this is "enriching the nation and pacifying the people." Essence refined becomes solar essence; blood refined becomes lunar radiance; qi refined becomes yellow gold; marrow refined becomes white jade; the brain refined becomes cinnabar; the kidneys refined become giant clams; the heart refined becomes coral. These are the Seven Treasures, dwelling within the body without dispersion.

When merit is accomplished and conduct fulfilled, one mounts the phoenix and rides the simurgh, ascending to the Golden Palace to pay homage to the Jade Emperor, forever a true immortal. Thus concludes the *Scripture on Attaining the Dao and Perfecting the Body*, spoken by the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy.
