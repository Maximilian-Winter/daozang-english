*The Jade Pivot Precious Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Responsive Origin, Thunder’s Voice, and Universal Transformation Heavenly Worthy*

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy of the Nine Heavens’ Responsive Origin, Thunder’s Voice, and Universal Transformation was in the Jade Purity Heaven, where he convened with the Heavenly Lords of the Ten Directions in the Hall of Jade Void and Ninefold Radiance, the Pavilion of Fragrant Mist and Vast Net, the Chamber of Purple Ultimate and Winding Secrecy. There, they perused the azure jade tablets of the Great Obscure and examined the books of the Profound Luminous Dawn, whispering intimately of the profound mysteries. The many attending ministers stood in reverent attendance to either side.

The Heavenly Worthy, seated in tranquil recitation of the cavernous scriptures, was joined by the Heavenly Lords chanting as they paced the void. Celestial maidens and immortal maidens scattered blossoms in circling dance, then led one another in playful wandering through the verdant palaces. The assembled immortals processed ahead, bearing ceremonial staves and battle-axes, their dragon banners and simurgh chariots swaying through the vast sky, gathering upon the seven-jeweled tiered terrace of Jade Brahma.

Then the Thunder Master, Elder Hao, stepped forth from the ranks of immortals, approaching before the Heavenly Worthy and bowing deeply. With a voice both resonant and true, he performed the rites, rising in solemn reverence to kneel and address the Heavenly Worthy:

“Great is the Heavenly Worthy’s compassion, great is the Heavenly Worthy’s sagacity! Father of all beings, teacher of the myriad spirits! Today, all the heavens enjoy this auspicious audience. Just now, I witnessed the Heavenly Worthy perusing the precious tablets and examining the jade books within the profound mysteries of the central archives—an incalculable treasure.”

The Jade Firmament’s single prefecture governs the inner courts of the thirty-six heavens, including the Eastern and Western Flower Terraces, the Mystic Halls and Wondrous Pavilions, the Four Palaces and Six Institutes, and all their subordinate bureaus—these together oversee the Five Thunders’ descent into the Three Realms. The Heavenly Worthy, august and sovereign, attends to all affairs with intimate care. Yet such minor omens—by what cause or condition do they come to submit? We wish to hear the reason.”

The Heavenly Worthy replied: “Thunder Master Hao, you and your immortal ministers have stored merit across past lives and accumulated deeds through former births, thus gaining appointment to the Jade Prefecture and enrollment in the Jeweled Palace. Now, your merit and conduct surpass even those of former times. Apply yourselves fully, entrusting your hearts to the Fire Department of the Thunder Bureau. Day after day, year after year, as merit mounts and conduct shines, as nature clears and spirit harmonizes, you will attain the rank of lofty perfected ones and ascend the wondrous Dao.

Yet the ghosts and spirits of the Thunder Department toil by day and labor by night, ever subject to flogging and cudgeling, now tormented with the lash, now carved like clouds or snow—unceasingly. Summons to dragons and commands to crows: this ceases only for that to begin, that for this. Such is the cause and condition of their lot.”

Thunder Master Hao and all the gods and immortals of the heavens pricked up their ears in silence. The Heavenly Worthy sat upon the nine-phoenix cinnabar-dawn screen, raising a golden luminous ruyi scepter. A pure, subtle breeze arose, and embroidered clouds gathered in splendor. The Heavenly Worthy remained still for a long while.

Then he spoke: “In a former kalpa, fifteen hundred aeons past, I first stitched this Dao with the needle of my mind, thereby attaining the rank of Supreme Perfected. My intent fermented this merit, and thus I wielded the authority of great transformation. Once, before the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Great Ultimate in the Great Brahma Heaven, I vowed with a pure and vast heart: ‘In future ages, may all beings—celestial dragons, ghosts, and spirits—who but once invoke my name all transcend defilement. Should this not be so, I shall take their suffering upon myself.’ Now, purify your hearts, for I shall proclaim this to you.”

The Heavenly Worthy continued: “You gods and humans who wish to hear the supreme Dao—the supreme Dao is profound and subtle, yet it lies nowhere else. If you truly wish to hear, know that the unhearing is the unhearing, and the seeing is the true Dao. To open sight is also to dissolve it—it is yours alone. You are not even ‘you,’ how much less the Dao? To hear without hearing—what Dao is there to discuss?”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “The Dao is entered through sincerity, guarded through silence, and employed through softness. To use sincerity is to seem foolish; to use silence is to seem inarticulate; to use softness is to seem clumsy. Only thus can you forget form, forget self, forget even forgetting. Those who enter the Dao know when to stop; those who guard the Dao know caution; those who employ the Dao know subtlety. Knowing subtlety, wisdom’s light arises; knowing caution, sagely wisdom is complete; knowing when to stop, perfect stability and peace are attained. With perfect stability and peace, sagely wisdom is complete; with sagely wisdom complete, wisdom’s light arises; with wisdom’s light arisen, one becomes one with the Dao—this is called true forgetting. Only in forgetting yet not forgetting, in forgetting what cannot be forgotten, does the un-forgettable become the supreme Dao.

The Dao pervades heaven and earth, yet heaven and earth do not know it. Sentient and insentient alike—there is but one, without duality.”

The Heavenly Worthy asked: “How shall I now benefit beings in this world? For all gods and humans, I expound this wondrous treasure. Those who awaken to it shall ascend the immortal’s throne. Students of the Dao, believe in the workings of qi and destiny. For lands and climates differ, and thus endowments vary—this is called qi. For wisdom and folly differ, and thus purity and turbidity vary—this is called destiny. Destiny is bound to fate; qi is struck by heaven. Constrained by qi and destiny, fettered by heavenly mandate, one cannot attain the true Dao. Yet the foolish may become wise, the turbid may become clear—this is decreed by fate. Foolishness is dull, turbidity is dark—these too shift with the endowments of land and climate.

Heaven and earth move by their mechanism, causing people to remain unaware—this is called spontaneity. To know that one does not know is also called spontaneity. The wonder of spontaneity, though wondrous in knowledge, is wondrous precisely because it arises from not-knowing. Yet in relation to the Dao, it has never begun to exist—through the foolish and the turbid. All the gods heard this, and the four assemblies rejoiced.

The Heavenly Worthy said: “What I have now spoken is the *Precious Scripture of the Jade Pivot.*”

Should beings of future ages hear my name and, in profound stillness, silently invoke it—whether once, five or seven times, or hundreds or thousands—thinking thus: *"Nine Heavens Responsive Primordial Thunder-Sounding Universal Transformation Heavenly Worthy,"* I shall manifest in the ten directions, extending my intent through the Three Realms, ensuring all who call my name attain their heart’s desire. Throughout the ten directions and Three Realms, among all heavens and earths, sun and moon, stars and constellations, mountains and rivers, grasses and trees, creatures winged and crawling, whether sentient or insentient, gods and dragons, ghosts and spirits—should any fail to comply upon hearing a single invocation of my name, may their heads be severed and hearts carved out, reduced to motes of dust.

The Heavenly Worthy said: *"I am the Nine Heavens’ True Radiance Great Sage. On the sixth day of each month and the *xin* days of the mid-decade, I oversee the myriad heavens and wander the Three Realms. Should one aspire to cultivate the Dao, seek immortality, evade the Nine Darks, or dispel the Three Calamities, let them engage a Zhengyi Daoist priest—or gather with kin and friends in a towered temple, at home, or in a village shrine—to pour libations of water, offer flowers, and recite this scripture—once, three or five times, or even tens or hundreds of times. Thereby shall they attain clarity of spirit, vigor of qi, expansiveness of heart, and ease of body. Sound the chime. All aspirations, without exception, shall meet with response."*

The Heavenly Worthy said: *"The nine numinous spirits within the body—why not summon them? The first is Celestial Birth, the second Immaculate Radiance, the third Mystic Pearl, the fourth Central Upright, the fifth Child Cinnabar, the sixth Revolving Wheel, the seventh Cinnabar Prime, the eighth Great Abyss, the ninth Numinous Youth. Summon them, and all shall be auspicious. The three essences within the body—why not invoke them? The first is Terrace Light, the second Luminous Clarity, the third Secluded Essence. Invoke them, and blessings shall follow. When the five centers grow vexed and stifled, when the six pulses surge in tumult, when the four limbs lose their peace, when the hundred joints cry out in distress—recite this scripture.*

*The Heavenly Worthy said: Should one encounter adversity in the Five Phases, peril in the Nine Luminaries, a year of punishment and clash, a fate of mutual conquest, solitary stars and bereft constellations, the Blade of Yang and the Edge of the Sword, the Calamity of Robbery and the Spirit of Death, the Ghost Gate’s twisting coils, the ruin of one’s allotted fortune, the Steed’s fall into emptiness—every movement fraught with danger, every step mired in misfortune—recite this scripture. Then shall the Heavenly Officials dispel celestial misfortune, the Earthly Officials quell terrestrial woes, the Water Officials resolve aquatic perils, the Five Emperors dissolve the afflictions of the five directions, the Four Sages dissolve the afflictions of the four seasons, the Southern Star dissolve the afflictions of one’s natal fate, and the Northern Dipper dissolve all misfortunes.*

*The Heavenly Worthy said: When chronic illness confines one to bed, when stubborn ailments weigh upon the body, when time accumulates without relief, when physicians’ efforts prove futile, when the five spirits lose their governance and the four great elements scatter—whether before the Five Emperors and the Three Officials, before the Five Paths of Mount Tai, before the sun, moon, and stars, before the mountains, forests, grasses, and trees, before sacred altars and ancient sites, before city gods and village shrines, before the wells and hearths of lanes and alleys, before the temples, pagodas, and towers—or whether in the Thirty-Six Prisons of the Underworld or the Seventy-Two Bureaus of the Nether Officials, where grievances abound—recite this scripture. Or if the cause lies in oaths, curses, or vows, or in debts unpaid and obligations unmet; if enmity spans three lifetimes or grudges stretch across kalpas, if faults and transgressions accumulate, if karmic adversaries stand in opposition—confess and repent, then recite this scripture.*

*The Heavenly Worthy said: The Heavenly Officials’ talismans, the Earthly Officials’ talismans. Each year, month, day, and hour bears its own official talisman. Every direction and orientation bears its own official talisman. Great matters bring official talismans; small matters bring gossip—governed by the gods of the Red Mouth and the White Tongue. In all actions and undertakings, in going out and returning, in rising and resting, if one fails to observe taboos and avoid offenses, encountering official talismans or slanderous tongues, one shall suffer harassment, day and night tormented as if scorched, lips and words entangled. Faces may affirm while backs deny, and every movement invites dispute. Swearing by gods and cursing the Buddha begin with slander and defamation, end in abuse and vilification—thus lawsuits arise, and punishments await. To escape such fate, recite this scripture, and slander shall vanish like mist, official talismans forever stilled.*

*The Heavenly Worthy said: The Nine Mounds of the Earth Sovereign are governed by one thousand two hundred spirits—Earth Lords and Earth Earls, Earth Lords and Earth Ladies, Earth Children and Earth Grandchildren, the Earthly household and its kin. Whether the Grand Year-Star, the General, the Crane Spirit, Venus, the Nine Excellencies, the Sword’s Edge, the Male and Female, the Metal Spirit, the Fire and Blood, the Yellow Body, the Colliding Fate, the Three Calamities, the Seven Calamities, the Yellow Banner and Leopard’s Tail, the Flying Blade and Anvil—all such earthly spirits and baleful stars. Should one undertake construction or choose a dwelling site and offend them, illness and even death shall follow. But recite this scripture, and the myriad spirits shall rise; heaven shall hold no taboos, earth shall hold no taboos, yin and yang shall hold no taboos, and all prohibitions shall be lifted.*

*The Heavenly Worthy said: Among the world’s husbands and wives, in their unions, some offend the Salty Pond, some the Heavenly Dog, some the Three Punishments and Six Harms, some the clashing angles of isolation and bereavement, some the snares of the Heavenly Net and Earthly Web—struggling to bear descendants, often left solitary and childless. Should one seek a son, recite this scripture, and the Great Spirit of Celestial Birth shall summon the spirits and gather the winds, bringing forth a worthy child. At the hour of birth, the Great Unity stands at the door, the Controller of Fate in the courtyard. Should grievances, ghosts, or malevolent spirits intrude, should taboos or misfortunes arise, causing difficult labor—recite this scripture, and the Nine Heavens’ Guardians of the Chamber shall attend, the Holy Mother silently aiding in the delivery, ensuring a joyous birth and a safe labor. For all infants in swaddling, tormented by the fifteen kinds of ghosts beneath the Sandalwood Spirit King’s throne, suffering convulsions and seizures—recite this scripture.*

*The Heavenly Worthy said: When one’s dwelling is plagued by crows and rats bearing omens, by snakes and insects bearing afflictions, by bricks and tiles hurled in malice, by startled chickens and mischievous dogs, by demands for sacrifices—even to the point of spectral coercion and dream oppression, or theft and adultery—dare these spirits claim the dwelling as their lair, bewitching the living. The courtyard and home grow unclean; wailing echoes through the beams by night, spying eyes peer into the chamber by day. Cattle, horses, dogs, and swine suffer pestilence; calamity clings to kin, disaster befalls livestock. Wicked shrines and demonic cults gather, evil spirits and sorcerers conspire, funeral guests arrive in droves, funeral carriages depart in succession. Recite this scripture, and ghostly spirits shall perish, people and creatures alike shall know peace.*

*The Heavenly Worthy said: The Generals of the Nine Heavens’ Thunder, the Generals of the Five Directions’ Thunder, the Generals of the Eight Directions’ Cloud and Thunder, the Envoys of the Five Directions’ Barbarian Thunder, the Thunder Department’s Soldiers and Envoys, the Adjudicating Officials—issuing commands swift as wind and fire. Where there are temples to be struck, altars to be smitten, demons to be expelled, and malevolent spirits to be banished—in this degenerate age of the Dharma’s end, with sorcerers and shamans proliferating, dark arts spreading, and secret curses rampant—thus does the Upper Clarity possess the Celestial Court for Binding Ghosts and Recording Transgressions, the Imperial Prison for Restraining Demons and Interrogating Evil. Recite this scripture, and the response shall be as swift as an echo.*

*The Heavenly Worthy said: The Heavenly Pestilence, the Earthly Pestilence, the Twenty-Five Pestilences."*

The Celestial Gu and Earthly Gu, the Twenty-Four Gu.
The Celestial Consumptive Ailments and Earthly Consumptive Ailments, the Thirty-Six Consumptive Ailments.
Recite this scripture, and pestilence shall be purified, gu toxins dispelled, and consumptive afflictions healed.

There are reasons for these afflictions:
Some arise from the recently deceased entangling the living,
Others from lingering corpse qi or ancestral miasmas,
Or from tomb disputes and burial curses,
Or from the contamination of dead souls,
Or from the summoning of corpse qi.
All such spirits—whether grieving, resentful, or hateful—
Drag the living into their entanglements, clinging as witnesses,
Striking when opportunity arises.

Thus this scripture ascends to the Three Heavens and descends to the Nine Springs,
Enabling the deliverance of wandering souls and the salvation of ancestors and forebears.
The Most High dispatches the Great General of the White Chariot and White Horses to oversee this.

The Heavenly Worthy said:
Should one prepare for a distant journey,
With bandits and thieves scheming, and weapons poised to strike—
On land, tigers and wolves, mountain spirits and ants sharpen their fangs;
On water, dragons and turtles, alligators and soft-shelled turtles gape their jaws.
Some rapids harbor vengeful souls,
Some winds and waves mark predestined calamities.
The dead of the past and the transformed of the present seize the living to replace the dead.
Yet those who take refuge in this scripture and pledge their devotion
Shall find peace on land and water, their travels and repose harmonious and auspicious.

The Heavenly Worthy said:
When scorching drought rages and rains fail their season,
Prostrate yourself before this scripture, and timely sweet showers shall fall.
When unrelenting yin prevails and floods overflow,
Prostrate yourself before this scripture, and skies shall clear at once.
When the Fire God fans disaster and flames engulf homes,
When red rats roam the city, startling the people with searing heat—
This scripture can avert such misfortune.
When the Sea God loses control and fish and turtles run amok,
When floods rise to the heavens and people drown—
This scripture can halt them.

The Heavenly Worthy said:
Should mortals wish to escape the calamities of the Three Disasters and Nine Perils,
They must, in the stillness of night, bow their heads toward the Northern Asterism.
Above the Northern Asterism lie the Three Terraces,
Their stars aligned like twin eyes,
Stacked in three tiers to cover the Dipper’s bowl—
This is called the Celestial Stairway.
Those who behold it shall know no imprisonment in life
Nor the suffering of drowning in death.
Within the Dipper resides the August Emperor,
Two stars vast as chariot wheels.
Those who see them shall preserve their form in the world,
Attaining long life as divine immortals.
Take refuge in this scripture, surrender your heart to the Northern Culmen,
And unseen responses shall follow.

The Dipper is the Pivot of Heaven,
Within it lies the Celestial Stem,
Internally known as *Lian Zhen*, externally as *Po Jun*.
The Twelve Gates of the Thunder Citadel all follow the Stem’s direction.
When the Stem points to *chou*, its body resides in *wei*—
What it points to is auspicious; where it dwells is inauspicious.
The same holds for all other positions.
Those who see it may live a thousand years.

The Heavenly Worthy said:
As the world declines and the Dao withers, people lack virtue.
They are disloyal to their lords,
Undutiful to their parents,
Disrespectful to their teachers and elders,
Unkind to their siblings,
Unfaithful to their spouses,
Unjust to their friends,
Unawed by Heaven and Earth,
Unafraid of the gods,
Disrespectful to the Three Luminaries,
Neglectful of the Five Grains.
With three bodily transgressions and four oral sins,
They use large scales and small measures,
Kill a hundred to harm a thousand,
Indulge in licentiousness and perversion,
And rebel against the arts of shamans.
From minor to grave offenses,
The Three Officials wield their brushes,
The Great Unity dispatches documents,
And the matter is handed to the Bureau of Five Thunders for execution and interrogation.
First, the spirit is struck down;
Then, the form is examined.
The spirit is beheaded, the soul condemned,
Causing them to fall into chaos.
What people despise, they are made to endure;
What people detest, they are forced to suffer.
Their resentment and hatred are met with interrogation of the form and thunderous punishment of the corpse,
Shattering them to pieces.
They are driven to roll in waves,
Compelled to pull carts,
Their names recorded in the monthly and decadal registers,
And further subjected to torture.
Yet upon hearing this scripture, their sins are instantly erased.

Should one incur the wrath of thunder,
Their corpse left unburied,
Unaccepted by water or fire—
Invoke the name of the Nine Heavens’ Responsive Thunderous Voice,
The Universally Transformative Heavenly Worthy,
And declare:
“All spirits bow their heads and heed my command.”

The Heavenly Worthy said:
The merits of this scripture are beyond conception.

In the kalpas of old, the Divine Sovereign of Jade Clarity of the Divine Empyrean, the Great Emperor of Long Life, once proclaimed this teaching. When transmitting this scripture to the worthy, one must cut gold and place silk offerings, swearing an oath to Heaven before passing it on.

The Thunder Master, the Venerable Lord Hao, rose in reverence, knelt, and respectfully addressed the Heavenly Worthy once more. The Heavenly Worthy said: Wherever this scripture resides, the local earth gods and life-mandating spirits shall guard and protect it, while the Thunder Department shall oversee and inspect it in due time. If a household possesses this scripture and reverently enshrines it, auspicious mist will fill their courtyard, felicitous clouds will shade their halls, misfortune and chaos will not arise, and blessings will gather. Upon their passing, they shall not enter hell. Why is this so? At death, they shall be reborn; in life, they shall return to the good Dao, inheriting the Heavenly Worthy’s power and attaining this numinous penetration. Carrying this scripture in their comings and goings, all people will revere them, and ghosts and spirits will stand in awe. When encountering peril or hardship, if they single-mindedly invoke the name of the Universally Transformative Heavenly Worthy of the Responsive Thunderous Voice of the Nine Heavens, they shall all be liberated.

Thereupon, the Thunder Master, the Venerable Lord Hao, before the Heavenly Worthy, spoke this gatha:

Supreme Sovereign of Jade Clarity,
Who governs the thirty-six heavens.
Universally Transformative Lord of the Nine Heavens,
Whose forms pervade the ten directions.
With unbound hair, riding a qilin,
Barefoot treading upon layered ice.
Grasping the qi of the Nine Heavens,
Whistling winds and lashing thunder.
With the power of wisdom,
Subduing all demonic spirits.
Delivering souls from eternal night,
Bestowing benefit upon all beings.
Like the silver river’s waters,
A thousand eyes, a thousand moon wheels.
Vowing in the ages to come,
To forever propagate the Heavenly Worthy’s teachings.

When the Thunder Master, the Venerable Lord Hao, finished reciting this gatha, the Heavenly Worthy said: This scripture has been transmitted through the world, yet people remain unaware. In the Nine Heavens’ Responsive Palace that I govern, there are the Envoys of the Nine Heavens’ Thunder Gate, assisted by those who compile records and those who conduct investigations. There are also four bureaus: the first is the Bureau of Excessive Punishment, the second the Bureau of Accumulated Arrests, the third the Bureau of Hidden Wrongs, and the fourth the Bureau of Timely Retribution, each overseen by a grand minister. All whom I govern—my ministers, masters, and envoys—assist in the primordial transformation.

When the Heavenly Worthy finished speaking this scripture, the seven-jeweled layered terrace of Jade Brahma was adorned with cascading celestial flowers and fragrant vapors of sacred incense. The Heavenly Lords of the ten directions all exclaimed, “Excellent!” The devas, dragons, ghosts, and spirits, the officials of the Thunder Department, and the myriad spirits of the three realms rejoiced greatly, faithfully receiving and upholding the teaching.

Oṃ hūṃ traṭ hriḥ vaḷa.
Here ends *The Jade Pivot Precious Scripture of the Universally Transformative Heavenly Worthy of the Responsive Thunderous Voice of the Nine Heavens*.
