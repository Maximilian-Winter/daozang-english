The Supreme Dao Lord spoke:
From past lives to the present, the transgressions and evils committed by worldly people have accumulated upon their own bodies. In youthful ignorance and folly, they fail to comprehend the Dao/Way and its principles, unaware of teachings and disciplines, ignorant of proper conduct, and blind to the distinction between right and wrong. They violate the prohibitions of Heaven and the taboos of Earth, the four seasons and five phases, the interplay of yin and yang, the soft and the firm, the sun, moon, and stars, and the spirits of the Dao/Way and virtue/power. Above, they are unfilial toward Heaven and Earth, the sovereign, parents, elders, and revered superiors; below, they bring harm to subjects, inferiors, servants, and even the crawling and flying creatures. Their sins and transgressions amass, forming countless calamities and retributions that pursue them without end, cutting short their years and seizing their allotted spans, beyond reckoning.

The transgressions and evils they commit include:
- Anger, wrath, and vengeful punishment as sins;
- Cruelty, malice, and brutal oppression as sins;
- Killing, wounding, destruction, and execution as sins;
- Deception, exploitation of the weak, and contemptuous disregard as sins;
- Flattery, partiality, sorcery, and deceit as sins;
- Secret envy, lust, arrogance, and pride as sins;
- Gluttony in drink, vomiting, and drowning in excess as sins;
- Abuse of power, bullying, and intimidation of the noble as sins;
- Greed, sycophancy, theft, and pilfering as sins;
- Hoarding, stinginess, and failing to aid the dying as sins;
- Coercion, scheming, mockery, and harsh criticism as sins;
- Desecrating graves, exposing corpses, and scattering bones as sins;
- Deception, slander, and malicious attacks as sins;
- False accusations, quarrels, and spreading confusion as sins;
- Slandering sages and worthies, and engaging in defamation as sins;
- Indulging in excessive desires and lewdness as sins;
- Self-indulgence in trivial pleasures and gluttony as sins;
- Careless speech and reckless conduct as sins;
- Impure thoughts and indiscriminate gazing as sins;
- Indiscriminate listening and indiscriminate smelling as sins.

Those who commit such evils:
- As rulers, cannot embody benevolence;
- As ministers, cannot embody loyalty;
- As officials, cannot embody impartiality;
- As fathers, cannot embody kindness;
- As sons, cannot embody filial piety;
- As mothers, cannot embody love;
- As elder brothers, cannot embody fraternity;
- As younger brothers, cannot embody deference;
- As friends, cannot embody integrity;
- As wives, cannot embody reverence;
- As men, cannot embody goodness;
- As women, cannot embody chastity;
- As teachers, cannot embody instruction;
- As disciples, cannot embody respect;
- As superiors, cannot embody guidance;
- As inferiors, cannot embody propriety;
- As neighbors, cannot embody deference;
- As companions, cannot embody trustworthiness;
- As clansmen, cannot embody harmony;
- As husbands, cannot embody sincerity;
- As servants, cannot embody diligence;
- In cultivating the self, cannot bring benefit;
- In studying the Dao/Way, cannot attain immortality.

Thus:
- Those who govern the state cannot achieve great peace;
- Those who manage households cannot attain good fortune;
- Those who cultivate the body cannot extend their lifespan;
- Those who pursue their work cannot complete their tasks.

Therefore, the Dao/Way encompasses boundless compassion, its virtue/power cherishes all beings, its grace extends without limit, and its blessings penetrate without end. To those on the verge of perishing, it grants rebirth; to those burdened by sin, it permits confession and repentance.

Those who confess and repent must:
- Sincerely express their remorse;
- Fully disclose their transgressions;
- Observe the Six Fasts and Ten Days of Abstinence;
- Honor the Gengshen and Jiazi days, the eight solar terms, and their own birthdays;
- Enter the chamber, burn incense, and openly confess their offenses.

Thus:
- No sin will remain unforgiven;
- No transgression will remain unabsolved;
- No merit will fail to accumulate;
- No virtue/power will fail to be established;
- No resonance with the Dao/Way will fail to manifest;
- No attainment of immortality will fail to be achieved.

If one cannot observe the designated days of fasting and abstinence, one should at least request the sutra and make offerings. During the establishment of the fast, on the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month, and on one’s birthday, with utmost sincerity and earnestness, one should confess one’s transgressions. The merit thus accrued will be even greater, and no sin will remain unforgiven.

Now, I teach you this: devote yourself to reverent practice, and the field of blessings will flourish, and your karmic deeds will be established.

The Heavenly Master bowed deeply and respectfully received the instructions.

The Supreme Dao Lord spoke:
All people—men and women, emperors, kings, and lords—who establish fasts and practice the Dao/Way should have the Dharma Master recite this text of confession and repentance from the high seat. If one cannot recite it clearly, one should follow the ritual of the Numinous Treasure Fast, arranging the altar and oratory as convenient, for one day or up to three days, adjusting the offerings according to one’s means, whether rich or poor. Use golden dragons and colored silks to consecrate the ten directions.

If employing the ritual protocol:
- State the name, age, and number of household members of the fast’s sponsor;
- Have the sponsor bow twice, prostrate fully, and kowtow three times with hands clasped overhead, then strike the ground in full prostration.

The Dharma Master should then recite the text of confession from the high seat, first enumerating the sins of the sponsor’s living and deceased kin. Thus:
- The merit will move the heavens;
- Sins will be eradicated from the nine yin realms;
- Blessings and virtue/power will flow back;
- Grace and protection will descend;
- True qi will descend;
- Both the living and the dead will be liberated;
- Humans and spirits alike will be released.

The merit is immeasurable; the Dao/Way of immortality will be accomplished. Demon kings will pay homage, households will be purified, ghosts and demons will not dare to intrude. No greater merit exists.

Now, I transmit this to you; treasure it well.

The Heavenly Master bowed his head and respectfully received the teachings and admonitions.

The Perfected One said: When reciting the initial text of confession, it should be chanted in the tone of scripture.

First, the sponsor bows twice, prostrates with head touching the ground, and strikes the earth three times with forehead. The Dharma Master intones:

To the Most High, Boundless Dao/Way, and the Three Treasures, the revered deities: In such-and-such prefecture, county, village, and hamlet, the man or woman official [Name], aged [X], with [X] household members, now during this retreat, lays bare and resolves the heavy transgressions of past lives. Humbly beseeching the Perfectly True, may they bestow the grace of the Dharma, grant great compassion, and pardon all sentient beings—along with the sponsor’s ancestors through nine generations and seven lineages, extending to the five degrees of mourning and six relations.

Whether as ruler or high official, they may have governed with frequent transgressions, policies unjust and uneven, favoring private over public, greedily coveting wealth and beauty, levying taxes inequitably, inciting slander, fabricating false documents, spying on the innocent, nitpicking faults, engaging in excessive trade and profiteering, blocking the four roads, manipulating prices, disrupting agriculture and sericulture, seizing labor at critical times, imprisoning the virtuous while releasing the wicked, lightly pardoning evil while heavily punishing good, flattering favorites, slaughtering the worthy, exalting the favored while oppressing the weak, unleashing rapacious officials, jackal-like aides, tiger-like generals, and bear-like soldiers—idling by day and feasting by night, causing livestock to die violently, devouring the people, extorting those under their rule, amassing illicit wealth beyond measure, sins and transgressions piled high as mountains.

As rulers, they were unworthy; as ministers, disloyal; as officials, corrupt; in public office, impure and unchaste; in private, crooked and unprincipled. They defied and disrupted the true Dharma, following their own whims, crafting deceitful documents, misleading the eyes and ears of others. Accepting bribes, they released the guilty and killed the innocent. They extorted goods under false charges, coerced the innocent into surrendering treasures, usurped thrones, murdered rulers, abducted men and women, enslaved maidservants and bondservants, beat and flogged the upright, whipped the blameless, harmed the guiltless, executed the innocent. They plundered and pillaged, seizing people and property—seven treasures, five silks, livestock, and breeding animals. Without cause, they mobilized armies, waging war, driving the people to their deaths, leaving souls stranded in desolate lands, blood and sweat flowing like rivers, corpses and ghosts wailing in the wilderness, starving spirits in the deepest misery, in the nine springs below. The living cried out in suffering, their grievances reaching heaven; the dead held bitter grudges, lodging complaints in the nine yin realms. Vengeance and retribution intertwined, trials and transgressions linked endlessly. They attacked and ravaged nations without reason, hunted and slaughtered living beings, killing those with breath, flying hawks and running hounds devouring their flesh, destroying fetuses and stripping eggs, trapping and netting creatures, shooting and stabbing with cruel intent, hearts filled with malice, devoid of benevolence and righteousness. They brewed poisoned wine, spoiled food, and toxic concoctions, urging others to consume them, rotting their organs and ending lives. Relying on their noble status or wealthy households, they compared themselves to the sun and clouds, belittling their peers, setting their ambitions beyond the heavens, foolishly believing in the permanence of wealth and rank, slandering the Perfected, doubting and mocking Daoist masters, ridiculing the true adepts, severing their own roots. Such capital crimes and countless transgressions cannot be fully enumerated.

All these and the like bring retribution in death, calamities flowing to later generations, causing the common folk to stagnate in office, dwell in decline and poverty, suffer constant losses, endure lingering illnesses. Their descendants may not survive, sons and daughters dying young, family estates dwindling, disconnected from their ancestors, lacking ancestral blessings, unable to escape hunger and cold. All these countless misfortunes arise from such transgressions.

Now, on behalf of the living and the dead, we repent. Humbly we pray the Heavenly Worthy to grant forgiveness and absolution.

Second, the sponsor bows twice again, prostrates with head touching the ground, and strikes the earth three times with forehead. The Dharma Master intones:

To the Most High, Boundless Dao/Way, and the Three Treasures, the revered deities: May they pardon the sponsor’s ancestors from past generations down to the present, and from the time of self-awareness to now—truly, they have committed many evils and few good deeds, been rebellious and seldom compliant, defied heaven and betrayed earth, offended the stars. As ministers, they failed to be loyal to their rulers; as children, unfilial to their parents; as wives, disrespectful to their parents-in-law; as younger siblings, disobedient to their elder brothers and sisters. Though born human, they lacked compassionate hearts and benevolent conduct, were perverse and partisan, their anger and joy inconstant. On the six fast days and auspicious occasions, they violated the decrees of the Mysterious Bureau.

Toward those they loved, they wished life; toward those they hated, they wished death.

Beating and bullying without cause, cursing and reviling without restraint, acting solely to please themselves, gluttonous for fine flavors. Errors great and small intertwined, households devoid of rules and order. Turning from virtue toward lust, indulging in frivolity and arrogance. Bullying the orphaned and cheating the widowed, seizing what is not theirs. Hearts given to extravagance and ease, words and deeds marked by arrogance and contempt. In all they undertook, each action bore the weight of transgression. Unafraid of spirits and gods, heedless of precepts and prohibitions, unmindful of calamity and evil, reckless in advance and retreat, disregarding taboos and prohibitions, forsaking benevolence and righteousness, miserly and covetous, never giving alms. Demanding repayment from others, delighting in theft and robbery. Deceiving and extorting among their peers, practicing injustice and perversion in public. Scheming to profit from others, constantly mocking and deriding them. Borrowing money long-term while repaying short, using light scales and small measures, narrow cloth and short rods; forcing heavy scales and large measures upon others, monopolizing their gains. Exploiting power and influence, invoking official authority in their speech; relying on cunning and malice, flattering and deceiving to mislead the foolish; their hearts far from pure, yet invoking gods with false sincerity. Desecrating tombs and plundering graves, assaulting and robbing the dead. Fraudulently borrowing and lending, taking wealth not rightfully theirs, wearing clothes not theirs to wear, eating food not theirs to eat, drinking drink not theirs to drink, stealing others’ livestock, fruits, vegetables, grains, mulberry trees, bamboo, and thriving trees. Their avaricious and base nature, sins manifest before the divine; in all their movements and deeds, violating statutes and transgressing laws. The gravest of sins, recorded by the Right Bureau. Thus causing their households’ livelihoods to falter, frequent strange occurrences, poverty, hardship, destitution, and squalor, repeated losses, discord among family, mutual resentment and anger, few in good health, many afflicted by illness—all stemming from the transgressions and evils committed thus. Now, therefore, they repent for both the living and the dead, humbly beseeching the Heavenly Worthy to grant forgiveness and absolution.

Thirdly, bowing again, prostrating and kowtowing, raising their hands thrice to strike their chests.

The Dharma Master intoned:
To the Most High and Boundless Dao, the Three Treasures and Venerable Deities, we humbly pray: may Your great compassion descend, erasing the karmic afflictions of our ancestors and the sins binding us in this present life, from the time of self-awareness to now. Truly, husband and wife failed to uphold good conduct toward one another, instead transforming into wickedness. Lacking pure and upright intentions, their hearts filled with jealousy and envy, harboring hidden grievances and disputes, mutual hatred and resentment. Scolding sons and cursing daughters, beating and abusing servants and maids, berating guests and rebuking visitors, severing ties with neighbors, distrusted by their village and community, discord with kin, estrangement from relatives, disharmony among the six relations, disloyalty among the nine clans, venting anger upon livestock, harboring suspicion toward wives and concubines. Delighting in deceitful friends, reveling in wicked companions, secretly stealing and openly robbing, colluding with villains. Specializing in curses and hexes, covertly inflicting harm; flattering and bewitching, outwardly kind but inwardly evil; envying the worthy and resenting the capable, suppressing talent, slandering the virtuous, humiliating the good, defiling the pure, staining the unsullied. Biting at others’ excellence, resenting others’ wealth. Their hearts like cunning otters, their minds harboring malice, tongues sharp as daggers, mouths filled with venom. Devoid of benevolence and righteousness, lacking propriety and loyalty. Insisting on their own rightness, condemning others as wrong; self-conceited and boastful, self-righteous and arrogant. Year after year, unable to recognize their own faults. Deceitful and insolent, slanderous and contradictory, lacking sincerity and trustworthiness, pointing south while calling it north, twisting east into west, mocking parents, defying teachers and lords, disregarding close and distant relations, showing no reverence for the honored, sowing discord with forked tongues, inciting strife and wickedness, flattering with honeyed words, constantly quarreling and deceiving. In trade and commerce, specializing in fraud and trickery, nitpicking over ounces and grains, turning long into short, exchanging the fine for the coarse, insatiable in their desires. Publicly acting lawlessly, privately encroaching upon the loyal and good, belittling the four great elements, defiling the three luminaries, indulging in folly and baseness, chasing after the powerful. Their hearts anxious, their minds restless. Thousands of transgressions recorded by the Four Bureaus, myriad offenses inscribed by the Five Emperors, accumulating over months and years, beyond count. Thus causing their households to suffer constant misfortune, their endeavors to fail, their studies of the Dao to lack clarity, their pursuit of immortality to bear no fruit, mocked by the common crowd, beset by groundless slander, calamities recurring, despised by the multitude, deceived by officials. All fortune eludes them—all due to the transgressions and evils committed thus. Now, they repent for both the living and the dead, humbly beseeching the Heavenly Worthy to grant forgiveness and absolution.

Fourthly, bowing again, prostrating and kowtowing, raising their hands thrice to strike their chests.

The Dharma Master intoned:
To the Most High and Boundless Dao, the Three Treasures and Venerable Deities, we humbly pray: may Your merciful grace descend, may You pardon the sins of the sponsor’s ancestors and this present life, from the time of self-awareness to now. Truly, they received emoluments without merit, rewards without virtue. Unable to perform good deeds, they mocked those who did; unable to accept transformation, they slandered the sacred teachings.

Those who secretly steal scriptures, treat the sacred and the worthy with disdain and defilement, turn their backs in betrayal and rebellion, forsake the Dao to embrace heresy, undermine and destroy achievements, indulge in wrongdoing and chase after transgressions. Seeing others’ faults, they pierce with words and mock with speech. Encountering the virtuous, they harbor resentment; facing the talented, they breed jealousy. They favor the depraved, despise the noble, delight in others’ vices, and shame others’ virtues. They do not believe that evil begets evil, that sin begets retribution; knowing they should reform, they persist unceasingly; knowing they should not transgress, they never cease. Borrowing without thought of repayment, lending without intent to reclaim, they lightly harm the poor and destitute, slandering the foolish and ignorant. They teach others to do evil, urge them toward wrongdoing. Though dwelling in poverty and hardship, they do not blame themselves but instead nurse grievances, coveting what belongs to others. Gaining advantage brings joy; losing it sparks fury. They vent their malice, waiting to ensnare others at the first opportunity. In the unseen realm, their bodies remain unclean, rising naked at night, offending the stars, cursing wind and rain, disrespecting the divine, disrupting yin and yang, and disturbing the five phases. They harm others to benefit themselves, endanger others to secure their own safety; they claim others’ merits as their own, turning others’ achievements into their own fame. Their actions are indefensible, their deeds improper. They belittle the elderly and slight the young, arrogant and reckless in their conduct. Outwardly, they lack propriety; inwardly, they lack kindness and benevolence. They sever others’ nine clans, estrange others’ six relations; they turn a southerner’s father into a stranger, a northerner’s child into an orphan, an easterner’s husband into a widower, a westerner’s wife into a widow; they separate men from their sons, isolate women from their daughters. They teach others to abort, guide others to miscarry, valuing only killing and harm, holding no reverence for life. Harboring resentment, they burn incense and invoke the gods, recklessly praying to a hundred ghosts, calling to heaven and earth. They curse the deities of the Three Luminaries, wishing death upon others, invoking ruin, their hearts unkind, ever nurturing venomous thoughts. They lust after others’ wives, covet others’ essence. Their desires and thoughts dwell on deceit and treachery. They build no merit, harbor no intent to give. Some study without a radiant teacher, practice without proper guidance, their mouths filled with grass and wood, their hearts with sand and stone. Some, relying on their age, refuse the great teachings, their bodies devoid of even one precept, yet falsely claim mastery of the Three Caverns. Some, in women’s attire, remain unclean and defiled, usurping sacred ranks and altars, their minds clinging to sensual realms. Seeing the poor, the wretched, the orphaned, and the weak, they double their arrogance, mockery, deceit, and contempt. Some drink to drunkenness, raving and lost in confusion, speaking lawlessly, defying the rhythms of heaven, deluded without measure. Some enter temples yet refuse to bow to scriptures and images. Some consort with the secular, engaging in illicit unions, secretly indulging in desire, reported by the Four Controllers, devoid of virtuous merit; investigated by the Five Emperors, bearing guilt and offense. Thus, their life’s conditions dwindle, every endeavor falters, they constantly suffer misfortune, repeatedly encounter peril, mired in sorrow and joyless, walking with worry, accumulating years without happiness, passing seasons without peace. Their minds are darkened, their intentions blocked, their wisdom and judgment clouded, their faculties dull and obscured, the six senses unopened, principles of righteousness ungrasped. Their wishes go unfulfilled, their requests unanswered, their endeavors fail, their official careers stall, their livelihoods decline, their homes remain unsettled. Great and small calamities befall them; their studies do not advance, their cultivation does not lead to immortality—all due to the transgressions and evils committed thus. Now, for the sake of the living and the dead, they repent. Humbly beseeching the Heavenly Worthy to grant forgiveness and absolution.

Then, bowing again for the fifth time, he prostrates himself, knocking his head to the ground, raising his hands thrice to strike his own cheeks. The Dharma Master intones:

Supplicating above to the Supreme, Boundless Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, and the Three Treasures of the Venerable Scriptures, we humbly pray that the Perfected Ones pour forth hidden blessings and grant absolution to the nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages of descendants, the thousandfold forebears and myriad progenitors, the departed and the newly deceased, all spirits from former lives to the present. Each, due to unkind deeds in past lives, met early ends, perishing before their time, their later lives unfulfilled—unable to know the manner of their deaths.

Some died with splitting headaches and burning brows, their five viscera in turmoil, their bodies frozen cold, lying abed. Others suffered chronic illness, emaciated and skeletal, leaning on staffs for years before death. Some succumbed to poisonous treatments, racking coughs, and blood-vomiting, their bellies swollen with lumps, ravaged by toxins and lethal drafts, their insides rotting away. Others perished from limb-swelling, madness, ulcers, and festering sores, their flesh teeming with worms, their bodies wracked by malaria, deformities, and joint dislocations, their sinews withered and severed. Some died deaf, blind, mute, or dumb, their seven orifices blocked, their bowels and bladder obstructed, unable to take in food or water. Others fell to wind-induced epilepsy, head sores, demonic possession, or madness—rolling their eyes, sticking out their tongues, arching their backs in spasms, bellowing like oxen, bleating like sheep, whining like dogs, or crowing like roosters—plunging into ravines or leaping into flames, heedless of water or fire. Some met their end on battlefields, trampled by blades, pierced by spears and halberds, struck by arrows, their heads severed, their bodies hacked apart. Others were stung by snakes, wasps, or scorpions, mauled by eagles, wildcats, jackals, wolves, tigers, or dragons, or trampled and gored by oxen, horses, dogs, or boars. Some plunged from cliffs or trees, drowned in sinking boats, fell from horses or chariots, or tumbled from heights, crushed or drowned. Others were ambushed by thieves or bandits, slain in brawls or skirmishes, left to die by the roadside. Some perished under the weight of official or private tyranny. Others died far from home, their blood soaking the roads, their flesh nourishing the grasses and waters, their remains abandoned in foreign lands. Some starved in famines or wars, perishing from cold or heat, thirst or hunger. Others succumbed to paralysis, leprosy, or loathsome diseases, their faces and bodies disfigured, noses eroded, ears severed, cast aside in remote villages or exiled to distant frontiers. Some were beaten to death by villains or brutish men, their skin flayed, their chests and hearts pierced by blades, their bones shattered, their limbs broken, their eyes gouged, their teeth smashed, their five organs scorched by stagnant heat. Others were seized by malevolent spirits, struck by misfortunes or miasmic vapors, slain by vengeful ghosts, or snatched away in an instant. Some choked on blood or suffocated, succumbing to dysentery or wasting diseases, their insides hardened, their outsides knotted, their bodies withered. Others perished from seminal leakage, obstructed meridians, the five taxations and seven injuries, their complexions sallow, their limbs numb and aching, their bodies parched and withered. Some were imprisoned for crimes, executed in public squares, or died under judicial torture. Others died in childbirth, drenched in blood, or lost their infants—sons who never grew, daughters who never thrived, cut down in blindness or infancy, never beholding the sun or moon. Some were struck by lightning, their backs branded, their spines split. Others drowned in floods, burned in fires, crushed by falling trees or stones, buried under earth, or swept away by mudslides. Some perished on night marches, bearing swords and bows, their strength spent, their qi exhausted, collapsing from toil.

Though all met a single death, their pains were manifold—each fate bound to karmic causes, their ends dictated by destiny. Life wanes swiftly, not by the Dao’s design. Devoid of past-life blessings, their unkindness brought this retribution. Their bodies surrendered to the Three Offices, their souls plunged in an instant, cast into the dark paths where each spirit faces its karmic adversary. Imprisoned in hells, Fengdu, the Three Offices, or the Six Bureaus, they are hung by their heads in shackles, made to stand on triple blades, climb mountains of knives, or walk forests of swords. They are fed fire and forced to eat coals, boiled in cauldrons, burned in flames, made to swallow ice and drink poison, their tongues torn out, their mouths force-fed, flogged by day and tortured by night. Their bodies are mutilated, their forms charred, their souls tormented by searing pain, their suffering unbearable. After three interrogations, escape is impossible. In the endless night, they wander among the wailing hungry ghosts, trapped in the sorrow of the Three Wretched Paths, enduring the agony of the Five Sufferings’ court. Their sins span countless kalpas, their offenses unforgiven.

Longing for life, the paths of rebirth are barred; wishing for rebirth, no karmic ties remain. Death is denied, and they sink forever into the abyss of sin, forever severed from peace. Their lingering misfortunes extend to later lives, evil begetting evil, faults entangling faults. Thus, the foolish and the common suffer unending misfortune; officials cannot secure rank, livelihoods cannot bring warmth or fullness. Men and women, young and old, endure unceasing hardship.

Now, for all beings—those departed in past lives and present, the newly deceased and the long-dead—we repent these sufferings, the sins of unkindness, the transgressions of wickedness, the offenses of rebellion, the violations of harmony, the defiance of heaven and earth, the offenses against spirits, the flouting of laws, and the deviance from the Dao. Their sins tower like mountains, their transgressions deep as the sea, causing the departed and the newly dead to perish without reason, afflicted by a thousand illnesses and ten thousand pains, a hundred torments and myriad ailments, dying from poisonous wounds—all retribution for past-life unkindness.

We beseech the Great Compassion to grant mercy and absolution. According to the manner of each departed soul’s death, may the trapped spirits be liberated, the suffering souls delivered. May they escape the clutches of Fengdu and the Three Offices, be freed from the Nine Hells, and ascend to the Heavenly Halls. May they dwell in the Forest of Pure Ghosts, the Land of Non-Action, severed from karmic ties, their blessings extended to descendants. May their homes be peaceful and auspicious, their lineages complete. May malevolent spirits and demons be restrained, heaven’s canopy and earth’s support safeguarded by divine protection. May those who study the Dao attain it; those who seek immortality achieve it. May wealth and honor be long preserved, and peace come naturally.

Thus the host bows twice and kowtows, declaring gratitude for the grace of the Dao.

Here ends the *Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Sutra of Proclaiming Precepts, Initiating Repentance, and Safeguarding from All Transgressions, Scroll the Middle*
Here begins the *Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Sutra of Proclaiming Precepts, Initiating Repentance, and Safeguarding from All Transgressions, Scroll the Lower*

The Supreme Dao Lord addressed Celestial Master Dao-ling, saying: This method of initiating repentance and the *Scripture of the Ascending Mystery* serve as the fence of the Dao and virtue, the ramparts of the Most Perfect, the ferry of life and death, the bridge for the multitudes, the field of blessings for establishing oneself, the deep pool of merit and achievement, the living path of nurturing one’s nature, the immortal formula for cultivating the Perfect Truth, the great dharma for dissolving transgressions, the foremost school of practice, the supreme goodness of ultimate life, the first means of delivering the dead, the true discipline for dispelling calamities, the secret art for dispersing misfortune, the grand teaching for pacifying the state, the solemn covenant for tranquilizing the household, the wisdom of learning, the boundless wealth of seeking goodness, the excellent remedy for curing illness, the virtuous medicine for healing disease, the pivot of divine luminosity, and the Bian Que of the ten thousand afflictions.

This peerless and most perfect great Dao, vast in its model, broadly disseminates the teaching of the world and delivers boundless beings. When its hymns dissolve transgressions, a thousand sins melt like ice, and ten thousand faults scatter like snow.

Reciting it saves the dead, and suffering souls and wronged spirits forever depart from the fires of torment. It liberates from the five sufferings, transcends the eight difficulties, and spirits ascend to the pure groves of the Dao’s abode. Above, they wander the precincts of the Mysterious Capital; below, they repose in the courts of Kunlun. Both the living and the dead are delivered, and blessings and benefits flourish day by day.

When one recites it seeking even a single blessing, misfortunes cease to pursue, old transgressions vanish, the living gain fortune, and one constantly dwells in peace and felicity. The register of death is erased from the right palace, and the record of life is inscribed upon the left contract. Thus, one cultivates the scripture and practices the Dao, observes long fasts and austere disciplines, calms the spirit and steadies the mind, with single-hearted sincerity contemplates the Dao, and turns one’s heart to the court of the supreme and perfectly true. One venerates the *Sutra of the Ascending Mystery and Inner Teaching of the True Scripture*, the supreme register that fully accords with Heaven. Wearing it as a treasure upon the body, one awaits the cloud-borne chariot, soaring through the great void to ascend and meet the August Sovereign of Emptiness, carefree in the Jade Capital.

You must treasure and keep it secret, practice it according to the method, establish merit and eradicate transgressions, as echo answers sound. Cultivating goodness, misfortune naturally perishes; establishing merit, fortune naturally arises—like a mirror, the crooked and straight follow the form. In upholding the method, one must give one’s whole heart; in revering the master, one must offer utmost sincerity. When the heart is fully given, the divine and luminous know; when sincerity reaches its essence, the ultimate truth is refined. Thus, without laxity, one ascends as an immortal and attains long life.

With earnest admonition, I declare this to the myriad beings: you must proclaim this scripture. This scripture is the ancestor of all methods, the supreme and most numinous. Those who make offerings to it will surely attain the Dao, ride the clouds, and ascend to the Jade Purity. Wondrous indeed is this scripture of the perfect and true—those who venerate it, listen with reverence.

The Most High Lord of the Dao addressed the Heavenly Master, saying: If there are worthy men and good women who wish to cultivate themselves and uphold the method, focus their minds on observing the precepts, seek life and pursue immortality, delight in the Dao and love the scriptures, reform their hearts and change their conduct, repent their transgressions and evils, with single-minded sincerity and unwavering faith, desiring long life and old age, transcendence by immortals, deliverance from disaster and suffering, escape from calamities and hardships, turning the wheel toward the fields of goodness, constantly accompanied by fortune—living in peace and joy, dying in transformation like the cicada’s molt, learning the Dao and attaining the Dao, ascending to heaven in broad daylight, equal in glory to the sun and moon from beginning to end, liberated from sorrow and suffering, ever filled with joy—all past transgressions must be repented. The method of repentance requires utmost sincerity, complete honesty, and no concealment, which would only increase one’s sins.

The Heavenly Master assented reverently and received the precepts.

The Most High Lord of the Dao addressed the Heavenly Master, saying: Good men and good women, if you wish to remain forever among the seed-people, preserve life and extend years, after a thousand years transform your bodies, dwell long in the divine lands, not migrating to desolate regions, always abiding in countries of the Dao, ever born into gates of filial piety and kindness, not falling into places devoid of virtue, not born in frontier lands, departing from pain and distress, transmitting fortune and following goodness, not belonging to the same kind as birds and beasts, not serving as slaves to evil spirits, possessing lovely countenance and form, free from foolishness and emaciation, keen and penetrating in wisdom, with insight as the foundation of intelligence—all past transgressions of a thousand sins and ten thousand faults must be repented. All must be honestly confessed, with no concealment, which would only increase one’s sins.

The Heavenly Master assented reverently and received the precepts.

The Most High Lord of the Dao addressed the Heavenly Master, saying: Good men and good women, if you wish to cure illness and heal disease, dispel calamities and rescue fate, save the dying and protect the living, live in the world without sorrow, accomplish what you undertake, fulfill your wishes, dwell in pure and secluded abodes, double the harvest of fields and silkworms, prosper in livelihood, be loved by the multitude, respected by high officials, with flourishing descendants, wealth, honor, and glory, attaining all that is auspicious, all that is peaceful, with every wish fulfilled and every thought realized, cultivating the scriptures and seeking the Dao, desiring to behold the True Lord—all past transgressions must be repented. The method of repentance lies solely in sincerity and honesty, sending forth the heart’s emotions, ensuring they ascend to be heard. The Dao-eye of the August Sovereign naturally reflects your heart. Concealment increases sin; the Dao does not speak in vain.

The Heavenly Master assented reverently and received the precepts.

The Most High Lord of the Dao addressed the Heavenly Master, saying: Good men and good women, if you wish to know your past lives’ abodes, the suffering and joy of the living and the dead, to understand that doing good brings good, planting fortune brings fortune, establishing kindness and bestowing favors, building merit and amending faults, recalling the deeds of past lives not limited to this body, awakening to the correspondence of sin and fortune, good and evil, knowing that this present body comes from a former body, turning from life to death, from death to life, following the causes that arise, causes unbroken; following the conditions that arise, conditions unsevered, thus attaining the present and establishing this body—once you recall this, think to establish good karma, fearing that this body may receive another body in the future, not attaining what this body now has, and fearing that after this body, the next may not clearly recognize, or lose the human path, not as this present body. Relying solely on this body, broadly cultivate the fields of fortune. Those who can do this will attain their wishes accordingly.

If you wish never again to be poor or lowly, never again orphaned or feeble, never again cold or hungry, never again begging or selling labor, never again suffering disaster or illness, never again deaf or blind, never again foolish or perverse in views, never again wrongly accused by officials, never again a slave or servant, never again slandered or maligned, always meeting sages and worthies, always connected with enlightened masters and precious scriptures, always encountering perfected immortals and transcendent beings, always meeting good, fortunate, and virtuous people for instruction, desiring the accomplishment of the immortal Dao—all past transgressions must be repented. The method of repentance requires complete sincerity, thorough confession without concealment, not hiding grave faults while admitting minor ones, which would only increase one’s sins. The statutes are stern and severe; the Dao does not speak in vain.

The Heavenly Master assented reverently and received the precepts.

The Most High Dao Lord addressed the Heavenly Master, saying: "Good men and good women, if you wish that the residual debts of past lives—ancient transgressions, former faults, and long-standing sins of your forebears—be no more; if you wish that in this present life there be no mutual burdens, no new offenses, no recent misdeeds, no karmic debts, no immediate grave faults; if you wish that your three generations of ancestors and five lineages, your ninefold kin and sevenfold descendants, all be liberated from the Three Wretched Realms and entirely escape the Five Sufferings; if you wish that your future descendants flourish, both great and small prospering, their bodies whole and complete, their years long and their lives enduring, untouched by cold in water or heat in fire, free from pain and itching, hunger and thirst; if you wish that no monstrosity may terrify you, no calamity harm you, that dragons lie hidden and phoenixes soar, your comings and goings unrestrained—then all past transgressions must be repented. The method of repentance lies solely in utmost sincerity, thorough confession without concealment; thus, no evil shall remain unremoved, no fault unabsolved. Carelessness and irreverence will only increase your sins. The Dao does not speak in vain—take heed!

The Heavenly Master assented reverently and received the precepts.

The Most High Dao Lord continued: "If rulers and ministers, fathers and children, elder and younger brothers, husbands and wives, masters and servants each wish to repent their transgressions, they must prepare offerings for their masters, prostrate themselves in contrition, strike their breasts in remorse, compose their bodies, examine their conduct, and maintain reverence and solemnity with focused, upright minds, obeying the teachings and commands. The Dharma Master shall ascend the high seat to recite the scripture of confession and repentance. If in a quiet chamber or altar hall, one may also circumambulate while reciting scriptures at any time.

The Dao is non-action, profound and obscure, invisible to the eye, inaudible to the ear. Yet when the human heart is sincere, it perceives and understands human sentiments—seeing without relying on the eyes, hearing without relying on the ears. Thus, the divine and enlightened grasp the supreme Dharma, govern the multitudes, propagate teachings, and bestow precepts to guide the foolish. When the master leads the repentance, sins are absolved at once; but if one returns to wrongdoing after repentance, the sins only deepen.

Man values timely action; the Dao values subtlety. To correct one’s faults from morning to evening is praised by the sages. Thus, those who do good cultivate the earth; those who uphold precepts and prohibitions wield the plow; those who give alms and kindness sow seeds; those who repent their sins wield the hoe; those who cultivate purity nurture flourishing sprouts; those who receive scriptures receive the rain’s blessing; those who establish fasts and vigils are like crops ripening in the field; those who perfect virtue and the Dao are like the harvest gathered.

Those who propagate the Dharma, widely deliver gods and humans, rescue the living and the dead, relieve the destitute and distressed, and heal the sick are like those who open granaries to feed the poor, giving food to the hungry and drink to the thirsty, ensuring all are sated and none lack. So too does one attain blessings after reciting scriptures and repenting. This is called the field of blessings, the work of goodness. Thus, the merit of this scripture and this Dharma is supreme.

When a ruler repents, heavenly disasters are dispelled; when a worthy minister repents, earthly harms vanish; when a compassionate father repents, his household knows no omens; when a filial son repents, misfortunes cease; when a benevolent elder brother repents, his family avoids calamity; when an obedient younger brother repents, his door knows no resentment; when an upright man repents, no slander arises; when a chaste woman repents, she safeguards her descendants; when a son repents, his household is harmonious; when a daughter repents, her marriage prospers; when a husband repents, he lacks nothing he needs; when a servant repents, they escape humiliation; when a Daoist repents, the Three Officials do not restrain them; when one cultivating nature repents, they transcend grain and face no peril; when one cultivating immortality repents, they ascend in broad daylight; when a householder repents, blessings cover their family; when a ruler repents, the nine provinces are at peace. The merit of repentance is lofty and weighty. The distinction between sin and blessing is clear—do you not understand?"

The Heavenly Master bowed twice and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "The teachings and precepts are fully imparted; I now request permission to propagate them. Your servant, Dao Ling, wishes that all under heaven may open their hearts and awaken their minds, knowing to repent and thus escape their sins, bringing peace and joy to their families and nations, and attaining long life and enduring longevity. Your servant prays that the Heavenly Worthy, with the power of the Dao, may extend nourishment to those yet unreached, so they may know that doing good brings goodness, and creating blessings brings blessings—like planting the five grains, reaping a hundred-thousand-fold harvest. May those who have not yet repented be transformed; may those not yet delivered be rescued; may those not yet attaining the Dao ascend as immortals; may those not yet born live long lives."

The Most High Dao Lord replied to the Heavenly Master: "Your words are excellent and essential! Transgressions and evils are the concerns of the mundane. The people of this world have long been distant from the sages, the great transformation has waned, the turbid *qi* thickens, wisdom is shallow, and they do not recognize fortune and misfortune. Deluded and confused, they do not awaken, blindly violating laws and incurring sins without knowing why. Thus, I expound scriptures and precepts to enlighten the unenlightened, teaching them to repent and remove their faults. The blind shall see clearly; the stubborn shall become gentle; misfortune shall turn to fortune, calamity to blessing. I guide them with the elixir of life, transform them with the true Dao.

Yet people know what they should not do and do it anyway, know what they should not pursue and pursue it nonetheless. They repent today and transgress tomorrow, their nature unchanged, their evils unceasing. Only when disaster strikes do they shut their doors; only when guilt is certain do they grow fearful; only when shackled do they seek release; only when bound do they hope for escape; only when gravely ill do they seek treatment; only when facing death do they long for life; only when *qi* is exhausted do they seek to replenish it; only when life is ending do they seek to prolong it. By then, Heaven cannot protect them, spirits cannot revive them, ghosts cannot restore them. Even if they encounter sages and divine beings, disasters will not disperse, illnesses will not be cured. Neither their Heavenly Father nor Heavenly Mother can extend their lives."

To build blessings, one must act before misfortune strikes; to accumulate merit and virtue, one must do so before transgressions sprout. It is like planting in spring to reap in autumn—plowing when hunger comes cannot relieve hunger, nor can digging a well when thirst arrives save one from sudden thirst. To dispel misfortune, nothing surpasses cultivating blessings; to accumulate merit, nothing surpasses cultivating the self. In cultivating blessings and the self, one must be diligent and earnest, for then the gates of the Dao and virtue will open of themselves, while the doors of calamity and evil will seal shut. Blessings will arise from all directions, and disasters will diminish across the nine yin realms.

If no good deeds are planted before misfortune arrives, then when life nears its end, one may exhaust all wealth and property, bow at the gates of masters, and prostrate before halls of virtue—how can one escape then? Though the August Heaven is high, its hearing is most low. Within every person’s body dwells a spirit that watches for transgressions, ascending and descending at all times to report one’s good and evil.

One hundred and twenty transgressions make a *ke*, and a *ke* brings frequent decline and little profit. One hundred and eighty transgressions make a *hao*, and a *hao* causes harm to the six livestock. Three hundred and sixty transgressions make a *lou*, and a *lou* brings the onset of illness. Five hundred and forty transgressions make a *xiong*, and a *xiong* causes muteness, paralysis, deafness, and blindness. One thousand and eighty transgressions make a *huo*, and a *huo* brings violent injury and death. One thousand two hundred transgressions make a *can*, and a *can* produces those who commit treason and rebellion. One thousand three hundred transgressions make a *jiu*, and a *jiu* cuts off descendants, leaving one without heirs. One thousand four hundred and forty transgressions make a *gao*, and a *gao* brings calamity flowing through five generations, binding one to great misfortune and chronic illness. One thousand six hundred and twenty transgressions make a *zhe*, and a *zhe* severs one’s lineage, leaving no posterity. One thousand eight hundred transgressions make a *huan*, and a *huan* reduces one to servitude, bringing ruin and chaos to the household. One thousand nine hundred and eighty transgressions make a *heng*, and a *heng* causes the birth of children afflicted with epilepsy, madness, and idiocy. Two thousand one hundred and sixty transgressions make a *bao*, and a *bao* brings rebellion within the family, where fathers and sons, brothers, attack one another; it gives rise to false shamans and demonic teachings, who falsely expound divine doctrines. Two thousand six hundred and ninety transgressions make a *zai*, and a *zai* causes incestuous strife among kin, producing offspring who are not true. Three thousand six hundred transgressions make a *yi*, and a *yi* brings blindness and deformity. Three thousand two hundred and forty transgressions make a *bian*, and a *bian* brings imprisonment, execution, and the extermination of one’s clan. Three thousand four hundred and twenty transgressions make a *guai*, and a *guai* reduces one’s family to beggary, where members are publicly executed, their corpses left unburied, their bones discarded, with none to gather them. Three thousand six hundred transgressions fill a *ke*, and when a *ke* is full, death is certain, and the soul drifts without anchor. Depending on the severity of the transgressions, one is consigned to the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, drowning in hardship, enduring pain and torment beyond endurance, to face judgment before the living.

If one is twenty or thirty years old and three *ke* are filled, one meets with violent injury; if fifty or sixty and three *ke* are filled, one meets the same fate. Those who die young due to transgressions bear the lingering faults of past lives; those who live out their years without encountering misfortune enjoy the lingering blessings of past lives. Thus, after accumulating virtue, residual blessings remain; after accumulating evil, residual misfortune lingers.

If one can repent of transgressions, Heaven takes note, reducing one’s *ke*. One act of repentance removes three *ke*; three acts of repentance remove nine *ke*. But if one continues to transgress without cease, the sentence of death is sealed. Therefore, those who wish to dispel disasters, disperse violence, treat illness, and cure disease must gradually, over months and years, reflect on their faults, take responsibility, and repent of their transgressions. If one can practice this with utmost sincerity, moved to fear and trembling, shedding tears and sweating with remorse, Heaven will know one’s sincerity, and the earth spirits will affirm one’s truth. Practicing for one day, the spirit that watches for transgressions removes one *ke*; for one hundred days, two *ke*; for one year, three *ke*; for three years, blessings will naturally follow. Without repentance, transgressions will daily increase, and misfortune will deepen. Minor transgressions harm only oneself; major ones flow to one’s descendants.

Good men and good women who invite scripture masters to their homes, establish fasts and vigils, burn incense and practice the Dao, whether for a day and a night or three days and three nights, with diligent and earnest devotion, reciting this *Shengxuan* repentance text in the six periods of day and night, will move the true spirits of the various heavens to descend to their chambers. The dark offices will remove *ke*, and transgressions will be pardoned. Accumulated goodness is like dust upon a beam; accumulated evil is like smoke within a chimney. How can one not be cautious? How can one not be cautious?

The Heavenly Master bows his head, prostrates twice, and pledges to follow these teachings.

The Heavenly Master says: Those who have not received the *Fangsu* contract over the years may not wear this contract. Be cautious.

**Inner Teachings: Rites for the Supreme Ascent to Heaven and Completion of the Contract**

The *Taishang Lingbao Shengxuan Inner Teachings: Proclamation of Precepts, Repentance of Sins, Protection of Life’s Conditions, and the Supreme Ascent to Heaven Completion Contract* is conferred upon those who have unified with the true. It is the comprehensive contract governing the three caverns and thirty-six thousand six hundred and sixty completion matters. The disciples He Tai, Ju Ningji, and others, in accordance with the regulations, present as offerings nine taels of gold, twelve taels of silver, five bolts of five-colored patterned silk, and twenty-four thousand cash in alms money. They come before the *Shengxuan* Master to receive and wear it, cultivating and practicing for years, experiencing numinous responses. The Three Primes of the true spirits settle and guard the cinnabar field; divine youths and jade maidens attend to the left and right. The transmission of the method qualifies one as an inner immortal of the *Shengxuan*.

The Daoist of [such-and-such] Prefecture, [such-and-such] County, [so-and-so], in the current year, month, and day of the Great Year, transmits this to the Daoist of [such-and-such] Abbey.

Having previously received the seventy-two-character covenant of plain silk, years have passed in sincere accumulation of merit and unwavering diligence. The myriad heavens are fully aware; the great sages bear witness. The names recorded in the Three Bureaus of the dead have long since been erased. One is now prepared to ascend among the ranks of the *Shengxuan* immortals. In accordance with the method, receive and treasure this as a personal treasure, a vessel of grace to guide oneself. The Three Heavens serve as witnesses, the Nine Earths as pledges, the Nine Pledges as guarantors, and the divine spirits as sureties. Swear never to violate the regulations or transgress the precepts, nor to defy the law or breach the statutes. Should one commit an offense or lapse even once, the body shall be delivered to the Three Bureaus, death shall consign one to the lower ghosts, the human Dao shall be forever lost, and one shall be eternally bound in servitude. If one remains vigilant and faultless, one shall be destined for the celestial courts of the immortals, attaining the Dao in life and death, and freed from the earthly bureaus.

All is in accordance with the statutes of the *Lingbao Shengxuan Inner Teachings’ Supreme Covenant for Ascending to Heaven*.

The Heavenly Master declares: All Daoist scholars who study immortality must first receive the method of initial repentance. If they do not, their sins shall remain unresolved forever. All must repent of their transgressions, burn incense and make offerings to the *Shengxuan Inner Teachings’ Supreme Revered Scripture*, and wear the seventy-two-character plain silk covenant along with the supreme great thread. Only after years of cultivation may one obtain this supreme method of the *Ascension Covenant*. It is not to be transmitted to beginners. Should one violate the regulations or breach the covenant, one shall not be permitted to receive the scripture of initial repentance for *Shengxuan* disciples.

You who receive this scripture, be cautious, be most cautious.

The Heavenly Master declares: This *Graduation Covenant* must not be recklessly transmitted, nor should this scripture. Both require earnest practice. Only after refining oneself to completion and attaining a profound understanding of the Dao’s meaning, with unwavering faith and no doubt, may one perfect the Dao and eliminate transgressions. Only then shall this covenant and the scripture be entrusted to the disciple. If one’s heart does not comprehend, if one clings to personal views, harbors doubt in the center, or trusts in superficial appearances while forsaking true reality—such a person shall surely stumble into the hells as a lower ghost. One must not transmit the scriptures of celestial ascension to the vulgar or the walking corpses of the world. Thus, I admonish you. Be cautious, be most cautious.

The *Lower Scroll of the Most High Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture on Proclaiming Precepts, Confessing Transgressions, and Securing Protection* concludes.
