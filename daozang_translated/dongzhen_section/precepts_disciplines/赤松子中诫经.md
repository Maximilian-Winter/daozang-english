**Preface to The Red Pine Master’s Central Admonitions Sutra**

Long ago, Master Gongming Zigao passed through Song and saw Minister Xue Ai, who had ten sons—six afflicted with lameness, missing limbs, madness, or idiocy; one who died in prison; and three blind, deaf, or stricken with sores and ulcers. Zigao then asked: "Minister, what deeds have you committed to bring such misfortune upon yourself?"

Xue Ai replied: "Now that you, Master, have deigned to inquire, I shall speak from the depths of my heart. As the kingdom’s chief minister, I have never recommended a single worthy person nor befriended a single scholar. I regarded the virtuous as enemies, blocking their advancement. When others suffered losses, I rejoiced as if I had gained; when others prospered, I grieved as if I had lost. I resented only that I could not do the same."

Zigao said: "With such conduct, Minister, your entire household is doomed to destruction. A thousand calamities and ten thousand illnesses will befall your descendants, who will suffer every kind of retribution. How could it be otherwise?"

Hearing the Master’s words, Xue Ai grew pale with dread, his spirit adrift. He bowed in remorse and vowed to reform. Zigao then said: "Though Heaven is high, it observes all below. Those who do evil will surely meet with misfortune; those who do good will surely receive blessings. Correct past wrongs and cultivate future virtue—turn failure into success. It is never too late."

"Years ago, I received from you, Master, a scroll of *The Red Pine Master’s Admonitions*. If one follows its teachings, it can cure the myriad illnesses of the body and deliver one’s descendants from present suffering. Now that I understand the intentions behind your actions, I see they have all been misguided. I shall now bestow this admonition upon you. Follow it faithfully, and you will witness Heaven’s verification."

Thereupon, he opened his case, took out the sutra, and presented it to Xue Ai. Ai bowed, received it reverently, and Zigao took his leave. Several years later, Zigao returned and saw that the minister’s sons had all recovered from their ailments. Observing their restored health, he asked: "Since we last parted, what skilled physician or wondrous art has cured your sons’ afflictions?"

Ai replied: "My sons did not encounter any great physician, nor did we employ any special methods. Some years ago, I received *The Central Admonitions Sutra* from you, Master. I reformed my ways and opened my heart. When I saw others suffer loss, I grieved for them; when I saw others prosper, I rejoiced inwardly. I recommended the worthy and deferred to the capable, relinquishing my salary and rank. I distributed the gold, silk, money, and grain I had hoarded to orphans and the poor, aiding the destitute. I eased my heart, lent generously, and competed with none. I purified myself, offered sacrifices to my sovereign and father, refrained from extravagant adornments and rich flavors, revered Heaven and Earth, believed in spirits, practiced contentment and frugality—and my sons each recovered on their own."

Zigao said: "How swift! How swift is Heaven’s reward for goodness—faster than an echo answering a sound, a shadow following a form! Now that you, Minister, have wholeheartedly embraced virtue, your sons’ hundred ailments have all been cured. How much more so if you perform a thousand good deeds?"

Xue Ai then offered a thousand gold pieces to Zigao in gratitude for the sutra, begging him to accept. Zigao replied: "I have no use for your gold. Keep it to bestow as hidden charity upon others. The greatest repayment would be to copy this sutra and transmit it to those who have yet to awaken." Thereupon, the Master took his leave of the minister.

**The Red Pine Master’s Central Admonitions Sutra**

The Yellow Emperor bowed deeply and asked the Red Pine Master: "I observe that the lives of the people are not uniform—some are wealthy and noble, others poor and lowly; some live long, others die young; some suffer unjust imprisonment, others are plagued by chronic illness; some die suddenly without sickness, others enjoy long life and prosperity. Why are they so unequal? I beg you, Master, to explain this."

The Red Pine Master replied: "The people are born solitary, each bearing a star. Some stars are large, others small, each governing the form of its host—determining longevity or brevity, prosperity or decline, poverty or wealth, life or death. Those who do good are enveloped in virtuous *qi*, with fortune and power following them. All evil departs, spirits protect them, and people respect them, distancing them from misfortune. Those who do evil are enveloped in malevolent *qi*, with disasters and calamities trailing them. Auspiciousness shuns them, evil stars shine upon them, and people despise them. All manner of suffering and decline converge upon their bodies.

From morning to night, people’s thoughts and actions—whether good or evil—often unknowingly violate Heaven and Earth’s prohibitions, incurring punishments and accumulating sins, which are not limited to one kind. Day and night, those who do evil offend the gods and spirits. The Controller of Destiny reports their deeds, and the stars deduct from their allotted lifespan. Heaven’s *qi* abandons them, and Earth’s *qi* clings to them—hence, they decline."

The Yellow Emperor further asked: "How long is a person’s natural lifespan?"

The Red Pine Master replied: "When a person is born, Heaven grants them a lifespan of forty-three thousand eight hundred days—amounting to one hundred and twenty years. Each year governs one year of life. Thus, all people are meant to live one hundred and twenty years, but by violating Heaven and Earth’s prohibitions, their lifespan is shortened, and their lives end prematurely."

The Emperor asked again: "Some die in the womb, others perish in infancy. They have not yet acted—what prohibitions have they violated?"

The Red Pine Master replied: "These are the sins of their ancestors, whose misfortunes extend to their descendants. Since ancient times, the wise and virtuous have established teachings, leaving behind immortal sutras, all exhorting people to do good and recognize the myriad evils. Only then can their names be passed down through the ages, and their descendants enjoy blessings.

People live between Heaven and Earth, endowed with the *qi* of *yin* and *yang*. Though the August Heaven is high, its response is below; though the Earth is lowly, its response is above. Heaven does not speak, yet the four seasons proceed; Earth does not speak, yet the myriad things are born. People dwell between them, indulging their desires. Every movement and breath of an ordinary person is known to Heaven and Earth. Thus, it is said that Heaven possesses four kinds of knowledge."

People do not speak of repaying the grace of Heaven and Earth, yet their words brim with resentment toward them. Heaven gives birth to the people, with the *qian* and *kun* trigrams as father and mother, the sun and moon as eyes, the stars as the nine orifices, and the movement of wind and the warmth of fire as vital *qi*. When the span of life ends, all return to the earth. In the heavens, the Three Northern Asterisms—the North Star, the Controller of Fate, and the Recorder of Deeds—dispatch the Grand Rectitude Talisman, which constantly hovers above a person’s head, observing their transgressions and stripping away their allotted years. If one year is taken, the star above their head dims, and their life becomes fraught with misfortune. If ten years are taken, the star gradually fractures, and they suffer calamity, decline, and illness. If twenty years are taken, the star’s light extinguishes, and they fall into dire straits or face imprisonment. If thirty years are taken, the star scatters, and they die. When their allotted years are exhausted before their time, misfortune extends to their descendants. If the descendants’ suffering is not exhausted, it may even lead to the annihilation of the family line. Yet people, unaware of their own transgressions, merely lament their short lives.

Thus, Heaven does not deceive all things, manifesting its truth through shadows: the alternation of day and night, the interplay of *yin* and *yang*, thunder, lightning, rain, snow, rainbows, halos, solar and lunar eclipses, comets, and meteors. Earth does not deceive all things, manifesting its truth through resonance: the birth of the myriad things, the flow of rivers, their drying and flooding, landslides, earthquakes, fierce winds that shake trees, flying sand and rolling stones, floods, locusts, famines, droughts, miasmas, plagues, and epidemics. Ghosts and spirits do not deceive all things, manifesting their truth through fortune and misfortune: omens, anomalies, disasters, and blessings. The ruler of the state does not deceive all things, manifesting his truth through Heaven and Earth, harmonizing the stars, responding to calamities, pacifying the four directions, uniting the people, and securing the peace of the sovereign.

People’s conduct, words, and intentions—let none say that Heaven and Earth act thus. Therefore, the sage has said: "August Heaven shows no partiality; it aids only those who possess virtue. Revere the Mandate of Heaven, revere the great, and revere the words of the sages." Every day, as people secretly commit good or evil deeds, Heaven and Earth know their true nature. When they secretly take lives, the spirits see their forms; when they speak or think, the ghosts hear their voices. When they violate a hundred prohibitions, ghosts seize their essence; when they violate a thousand, Earth records their forms. With each evil deed, shackles form in an instant—this is the retribution of *yin* and *yang*. August Heaven issues warnings, and those who defy them incur the wrath of ghosts, spirits, Heaven, and Earth.

The Yellow Emperor further asked about the signs of good and evil among immortals and whether one who receives blessings could have these matters examined and explained. Red Pine replied: The methods of cultivating the self, controlling fate, and governing one’s nature involve conducting oneself with auspicious *qi* each morning, focusing the mind on virtuous thoughts, words, deeds, and gazes. If within a single day the three karmas do not arise, then within three years, Heaven will send down a fortune star, and all shall be blessings in return. If, however, one consistently utters evil words, commits evil deeds, and casts evil glances each morning, teaching others to do evil daily, then within three years, calamity will befall them, leading to the loss of wealth and life. Earth will infuse them with malevolent *qi*, and they will surely decline.

The Nine Shameful Stars of Heaven correspond to the Nine Violent Deaths of the human realm. Good is the tally of evil; evil is the proof of good. It is also said: The good are the teachers of the wicked; the wicked are the resources of the good. Fortune is the evidence of misfortune; misfortune is the remnant of fortune. When good people frequently encounter disasters and manifold misfortunes, it is the lingering calamity of their ancestors. Thus, those who cultivate goodness throughout their lives need not select auspicious times or days; whenever they act, they naturally find fortune within misfortune, with a hundred spirits secretly protecting them and malevolent forces avoiding them. Conversely, those who do evil throughout their lives, even if they carefully choose auspicious days and times, will, when the moment arrives, encounter misfortune within fortune, with evil spirits harming them and benevolent spirits shunning them.

Yet if people consistently cultivate good conduct each day, Heaven will naturally increase their fortune and longevity, and harmonious *qi* and rosy light will surround them—this is the Way of form and shadow. To remain unwaning and unexhausted, preserving harmony with Heaven, one must understand the gains and losses of Heaven and Earth’s prohibitions and the Dao of cultivating the self and controlling fate. Now, let these be set forth in detail:

When a person performs one good deed, the spirits’ minds are at peace. When they perform ten good deeds, their *qi* and strength flourish. When they perform twenty, their body knows no harm. When they perform thirty, their wishes are fulfilled. When they perform forty, they enjoy wealth and joy. When they perform fifty, their descendants prosper. When they perform sixty, they avoid false accusations and the entanglements of wicked people. When they perform seventy, their learning brings them honor. When they perform eighty, they gain the benefits of the land. When they perform ninety, the heavenly spirits protect them. When they perform a hundred, Heaven bestows upon them emolument, and they encounter sages. When they perform two hundred, their names are celebrated in later generations, and their descendants receive emolument. When they perform three hundred, three generations of descendants enjoy wealth, honor, and happiness. When they perform four hundred, four generations of descendants enjoy wealth, honor, and promotion. When they perform five hundred, five generations of descendants receive enfeoffment and elevated ranks. When they perform six hundred, generation after generation of descendants serve loyally and enjoy wealth and honor. When they perform seven hundred, generation after generation produces wise and sagacious people. When they perform eight hundred, they produce people of virtue and power. When they perform nine hundred, they produce sages. When they perform a thousand, they produce a host of immortals.

Ancient virtuous deeds and policies are recorded by the Dao of Heaven. Those who embody them have their allotted years extended, ascend in rank, and attain immortality, their blessings extending to their descendants, who give birth to the worthy and produce sages.

If a person commits one evil deed, their mind is unsettled. If they commit ten, their *qi* and strength wane. If they commit twenty, their body suffers many illnesses. If they commit thirty, their wishes go unfulfilled. If they commit forty, they face hardship, decline, and loss, with all affairs going awry. If they commit fifty, they will never find a match. If they commit sixty, their descendants will dwindle and perish.

If a person commits seventy evil deeds, malevolent spirits plot their harm. If they commit eighty, they suffer disasters of water and fire, drowning or burning in untimely calamities. If they commit ninety, they fall into poverty, weakness, sores, scabies, and madness. If they commit a hundred, Heaven’s *qi* harms them, entangling them in misfortune, leading to execution and violent death. If they commit two hundred, Earth’s *qi* harms them, bringing ruin through bandits and thieves. If they commit three hundred, their descendants will be born lowly and base. If they commit four hundred, their descendants will live in destitution, reduced to begging. If they commit five hundred, their lineage will be cut off. If they commit six hundred, their descendants will be born blind, deaf, mute, or afflicted with idiocy and madness. If they commit seven hundred, their descendants will commit the five inversions, violate the law, and be unfilial. If they commit eight hundred, they will produce traitorous ministers and rebellious sons, leading to the extermination of their kin. If they commit nine hundred, they will produce monstrous offspring, bringing annihilation to their clan. If they commit a thousand, their descendants will be deformed, their bodies altered into the shapes of beasts, incomplete in form. When the accumulation of evil reaches its full measure, the calamity extends for generations.

This is the Controller of Fate seizing their allotted years, their stars falling as their body perishes, their soul tormented in Fengdu, their misfortune flowing to posterity.

The Yellow Emperor further asked: "When the Controller of Fate seizes a person’s allotted lifespan, what sins have they committed to invite this?"

Master Red Pine replied: "I humbly observe that people in the world bring misfortune upon themselves, yet they complain that the Dao of Heaven is unjust, refusing to reflect on their own faults. They curse and rage at Heaven when imprisoned in shackles, when starving or impoverished, when stricken with illness, when afflicted by cold, heat, frost, or snow, when resenting the length of day or night. They commit evil deeds yet pray and curse Heaven, defy the four seasons, violate the five phases, expose themselves naked before the Three Luminaries, relieve themselves facing the stars, the altars, or the temples, witness the eclipses of the sun and moon without attempting to save them, indulge in self-gratification while disrespecting Heaven and Earth and the spirits, fail to honor their parents, revile wind and rain, destroy the teachings of the sages, demolish altars and temples, desecrate graves to steal the belongings of the dead, deceive the blind, deaf, or mute, steal gold and silk, pour filth into others’ homes, recklessly tear or discard clothing, use unclean vessels for food and drink, cast curses on the living, bury talismans in the earth, envy the worthy and resent the capable, cultivate venomous creatures, take lives without cause, leave anonymous slanderous letters, malign the innocent, expose others’ private affairs, block roads, fill in ditches and canals, steal others’ possessions, discard or misuse medicine, fell others’ trees, crops, flowers, fruits, or gardens, harm livestock, defile wells, springs, palaces, temples, or monasteries, sing and make merry while in mourning, set fires to mountains, ruin others’ livelihoods, drain ponds and marshes, hunt and capture aquatic creatures like soft-shelled turtles, alligators, turtles, and fish, break oaths in their dealings with others, show contempt for the divine, engage in deceit and false accusations, speak with a forked tongue, spread malicious gossip, stir up strife, teach others to file frivolous lawsuits, expose themselves naked before others, eat and drink with disheveled hair, harm the good and aid the wicked, enrich themselves at others’ expense, blindly follow corrupt masters, teach unlawful practices, attack and kill the innocent, twist justice to serve wrongdoing, rely on power and cunning, exaggerate minor offenses, engage in killing in spring, take lives in summer, fail to correct their faults in autumn, disturb the earth’s treasures in winter, separate others from their kin, delight in killing and despise life, value themselves and belittle others, bully orphans and widows, undermine others to advance themselves, endanger others for their own security, borrow without repayment, praise themselves while slandering others, ally with the wicked and chase power, flaunt others’ authority, feign kindness while harboring malice, grow angry at the sight of killing, refuse to correct their faults, ignore goodness, turn their backs on family to favor strangers, disdain the high and oppress the low, reject the teachings of parents and teachers, allow wives and concubines to sow discord, heed petty and base words, abandon their kin, regret acts of kindness, rejoice in others’ misfortune, spy on others’ secrets, seduce others’ wives and concubines, act without principle, steal others’ affections, claim others’ good deeds as their own, implicate the innocent in serious crimes as guarantors, show disrespect to superiors and inferiors, disregard rank, indulge in drunken violence, misuse objects, discard food and drink, treat clothing with contempt, seek what is not rightfully theirs, court danger and death, forget old friends for new ones, abandon roots for branches, fail to repay kindness, deceive and mock others.

Herein are recorded over eight hundred transgressions, though they cannot all be listed in full. Yet when people commit any of these offenses, they violate the stars that govern their fate, and their deeds are reported to the Supreme Emperor, the Seven Stars, the Six Pitches, the Four Seasons, the Eight Winds, the Nine Palaces, and the Five Phases. The Controller of Fate is first commanded to seize their allotted years, shortening their lifespan, and bringing misfortune that extends to their descendants."

Emperor Huang again asked: "When people violate the prohibitions of Heaven and Earth, their allotted years are seized in measure—how grave are their offenses?"

Master Red Pine replied: "Humans are the root of Heaven and Earth; they ought to cultivate goodness and restrain their karma. Yet people present a gentle, harmonious appearance while harboring hidden malice. When they transgress prohibitions, their offenses accumulate without number, and the Controller of Fate records each one to be reported. Thus do people meet execution or perish on the battlefield: first, because they themselves have violated the Dao, and their past deeds become their adversaries; second, because the Five Phases intersect, and the Great Unity punishes them, their fate aligning with the shifting cycles of time, compelling them to suffer annihilation’s calamity."

Emperor Huang again asked Master Red Pine: "From what you have said, when people transgress, they lie uneasy upon their mats—can their offenses be absolved?"

He replied: "Some offenses may be absolved, others cannot. If people commit wrongs unintentionally and their hearts repent, absolution is possible. But if they hear the truth yet refuse to believe, recognize their faults yet refuse to change, persist in evil, and let their hearts grow cruel and fierce, absolution is impossible."

Master Red Pine said: "When people follow the good Dao, Heaven and Earth, ghosts and spirits, bestow blessings and aid them, extending their years and longevity, sparing them from misfortune. Why, then, would one not walk the good Dao? People should revere Heaven and Earth and the Three Luminaries, avoid transgressing prohibitions, honor and love their parents, live in harmony with their siblings, pity the orphaned and solitary, rescue and assist the poor and sick, respect their teachers and elders, heed the teachings of ancient sages and village elders without defiance, and remain humble and reverent. Whenever they encounter wind and rain, cold and heat, malevolent stars, strange omens, eclipses of the sun and moon, or celestial obscurations, they should reflect on goodness, keep their distance from ghosts and spirits, and offer sacrifices to Heaven and Earth. Their merits will be recorded above, and their allotted years and blessings extended.

When they see others doing evil, they should urge them to cultivate goodness. If they encounter good people, they should respect and follow them. When they witness danger or peril, they should rescue and protect with all their heart. When they themselves face hardship, they should ensure others remain secure. They should take on light burdens for themselves and heavy ones for others, dissuade people from engaging in lawsuits or quarrels, repair wells and irrigation channels, and mend roads.

They should not sacrifice the great for the small, nor abandon the small for the great. When they see others suffer loss, they should feel their pain deeply; when they see others gain, they should rejoice inwardly. They should support the weak and protect the infirm, bestow kindness and aid the orphaned and poor, remain reverent and humble, and yield their blessings to others. Their merits will be recorded in Heaven, and their longevity extended, bringing fortune to their descendants.

If one remains steadfast in faith, reveres the Dao and virtue, does not shirk danger, rescues those drowning in rivers and lakes, avoids illicit relations, does not encroach upon others’ homes or property, does not harm living beings without cause, cherishes life and abhors killing, upholds propriety without fail, studies the classics regularly, repays kindness without forgetting, bestows favors without regret, endures humiliation with forbearance, fulfills loyalty and filial piety, does not flaunt authority, does not squander wealth, does not covet fine clothing or lavish feasts, does not take lives unjustly, and sets an example for others to follow—then all will draw near to them. They should not consider themselves wise, virtuous, clever, wealthy, proud, domineering, boastful, self-important, self-exalting, arrogant, self-serving, or self-righteous. Their merits will be recorded below, and their allotted years extended. Those who receive even greater extensions are those who serve their lord with loyalty, their father with filial piety, remain free from arrogance, respect their teachers and elders, enlighten the young, honor their masters, cultivate humility, live in harmony with superiors and inferiors, treat all with fairness and kindness, refuse to listen to slander, act with sincerity, and ensure that women are filial and obedient to their parents-in-law, reverent toward their husbands, chaste and pure in conduct, patient and restrained in speech, diligent in morning and evening reflections, gentle and cheerful in demeanor, and selfless in their service. Such people will receive extended years, increased blessings, the dissipation of disasters, and wisdom for their sons and daughters.

Those whose years are cut short and blessings diminished are ministers who murder their lords, children who murder their fathers, disciples who betray their teachers, those who forget their masters after achieving success, the rebellious and irreverent, those who fail to distinguish between kin and stranger, and those who indulge their desires and act with self-importance. Women who defy their parents, are unfilial to their parents-in-law, disdain their husbands, engage in slander and gossip, disrupt the harmony of their families, steal and act lazily, or harm their neighbors—all will have their blessings and years seized, suffer from grave illnesses, endure scorn in life, and fall into hell after death."

Emperor Huang again asked: "Is there yet a most wondrous Dao in the human realm that I may hear?"

Master Red Pine replied: "Whether people cultivate goodness or evil begins in the heart. The heart is the seed of the Five Thieves and the root of all evil. When the human heart intends to do good, though the good deed may not yet be done, the spirits of goodness already respond. When the heart conceives evil, though the evil may not yet have sprouted, the spirits of misfortune already know. Thus, a noble person may perform good deeds for a thousand days, yet their goodness may still be insufficient; but if they commit evil for even a moment, their evil will be more than enough.

Consider those who usurp and seize by force—this too arises from the heart. Gain and loss alike are determined by the Dao of Heaven. Even if one harbors the intent to harm others, they may not succeed, for life and death, prosperity and decline, are governed by fate.

The classic states: 'Heaven has Five Thieves; those who perceive them prosper, those who lose them perish.' The teachings speak of Five Virtues: those who practice them prosper, those who abandon them perish. Practicing them means embodying warmth, kindness, reverence, frugality, and yielding, as well as benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust. Abandoning them means embracing evil, rebellion, greed, envy, and killing, as well as cruelty, chaos, deceit, fraud, and flattery.

People often practice the Five Abandonments, and their hearts are habitually moved by nine thoughts: when they see another’s family prosperous and noble, they speak of their past hardships and wish for their demotion; when they see another’s wealth and honor, they mock their former poverty and wish for their ruin; when they see another’s abundant wealth, they scheme to have it plundered..."

When they see another’s wives and concubines beautiful, they conceive lustful and illicit desires; when they see another’s house grand and imposing, they conceive the desire to burn it down; when they owe another a debt, they wish the creditor dead; when they cannot borrow another’s wealth, they grow resentful and harbor deep hatred; when they see another in peril, they speak of their past wrongs; even toward their own parents, they early wish them dead to seize their wealth and property.

These are the nine thoughts of foolish people. Thus, Heaven and Earth and the spirits abhor them, visiting them with calamity and misfortune, cutting short their allotted lifespan.

Those who practice the Five Virtues constantly hold nine reflections: seeing another’s honor and nobility, they reflect on their own meager karmic conditions; seeing another’s granaries filled with grain, they reflect on their own lack of diligent cultivation; seeing another’s gold, jade, and wealth, they reflect that these are not their own possessions; seeing another’s beautiful wives and concubines, they reflect on their own spouse and refrain from wayward thoughts; seeing another’s grand and imposing house, they reflect on their own humble dwelling and find contentment; seeing another who once slighted them now entangled with officials, they conceive the thought to rescue and assist them; owing another a debt and unable to repay it at present, they constantly reflect with concern and strive to repay it earnestly; desiring to borrow another’s wealth, they reflect on their past lack of kindness or merit; seeing another serving their lord and parents, they constantly reflect on their own lack of diligent repayment to others in the world.

Those who can practice these nine reflections throughout the day, abandoning the former nine thoughts, are people of supreme wisdom and luminous understanding. In this life, they obtain blessings and protection, their prosperity flowing to their descendants, and unforeseen calamities and misfortunes cannot reach them.

The Yellow Emperor further asked the Master: "What ranks follow the wise?"

The Master replied: "There are three grades, all being people of benevolence.

The highest wisdom: they understand astronomy, discern geography, comprehend without learning, grasp without teaching, silently retain knowledge, distinguish tones and rhythms, discern the worthy and the foolish, their hearts filled with compassion, never belittling others, recognizing success and failure, knowing advance and retreat, distinguishing survival and demise. Such people, though poor, will ultimately prosper; though briefly lowly, will ultimately rise—these are people of the highest wisdom.

The middle wisdom: they are well-versed in the classics, constantly upholding ritual and reverence, seeing the worthy and aspiring to emulate them, aiding the imperiled and rescuing the weak, bestowing kindness without regret, maintaining loyalty and filial piety without fail, their words never harming others, humble, yielding, warm, and modest. These, though unlearned, ultimately awaken; though not yet prominent, ultimately achieve success—these are people of middle wisdom.

The lower wisdom: they are cultivators of goodness, reforming the past and cultivating the future, pursuing their work while aspiring to learn, firmly believing in matters of good and evil, never encroaching on others’ wealth, preserving life and cherishing their bodies, understanding the Dao/Way and recognizing laws and texts, naturally aiding the weak, naturally fearing calamity and decline. Such people, vigilant and without fault, do not encounter unforeseen misfortunes—these are people of lower wisdom."

The Yellow Emperor said: "Excellent! Excellent! These words cannot be overstated in their merit and virtue. I shall carefully follow what has been said, record it, and show it to all people, making it a great bridge and beam."

All the assembled ministers bowed their heads and withdrew, adhering to the teachings and putting them into practice.

*Red Pine’s Middle Admonitions* concludes.
