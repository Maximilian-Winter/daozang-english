### **Preface to the Merit-Demerit Ledger of the Most Supreme Perfected Lord**

The *Book of Changes* states: *"The family that accumulates goodness will surely have abundant blessings; the family that accumulates evil will surely have lingering misfortune."* The Daoist scriptures say: *"Accumulating goodness brings forth auspicious rewards; committing evil incurs calamitous retribution."* Thus, the teachings of Confucianism and Daoism are not different in essence.

In ancient times, sages, noble gentlemen, and lofty Daoist adepts all composed covenants and precepts. Internally, they purified their minds and refined their conduct; externally, they instructed others, thereby establishing their meritorious deeds. In the *xinmao* year of the Dading era, at the hour of *zi* on the second day of the second lunar month, I dreamed of wandering through the Purple Palace and paying homage to the Most Supreme Perfected Lord. There, I received the *Merit-Demerit Ledger* and was instructed to transmit it to those of sincere faith.

Suddenly awakening from the dream, I pondered the merits and demerits, their categories vivid and distinct in my mind. Rising at once, I donned my robe, sat upright, and reflected in silence. Realizing this was a revelation from a lofty immortal, I dared not be negligent. Adjusting my attire and cap, I washed the inkstone, spread out the paper, and swiftly transcribed it all—completed in an instant, as if without conscious thought, untouched by deliberate intent. Thus were set forth thirty-six articles of merit and thirty-nine articles of transgression, each divided into four gates, to clarify the reckoning of merit and demerit. This is entrusted to the practitioners of the Dao, who shall record their daily deeds, tallying merits and demerits monthly in a minor review and annually in a major reckoning. They will thereby know the measure of their merits and transgressions, which shall align precisely with the celestial tally of the Perfected Ones above, with no discrepancy.

In general, at the end of each day, recording merits comes easily, while recording transgressions is difficult. Even the wise, though they may suddenly awaken to the causes and conditions of sin and fortune, the gates of good and evil, may understand half but remain wholly lacking in caution. By adhering to this practice, turning away from evil and advancing in goodness, one holds to true precepts, and the way to immortality is not far.

### **Instructions for Upholding the Dao**

Always keep brush, ink, and ledger by the head of your bed. At the start of each month, record the month and day. Beneath each day, draw two columns for merit and demerit. Before retiring at night, record all good and evil deeds of the day, matching them to the categories and quantities in this ledger. For good deeds, mark under merit; for evil, under demerit. One must not conceal transgressions while highlighting merits.

At month’s end, tally the total merits and demerits. Compare them: either offset merits with demerits or demerits with merits. The remaining balance reveals the net merit or demerit. Record this total, then proceed to the next month. At year’s end, conduct a major reckoning. One will thereby know one’s karmic fortune and misfortune, without need to inquire of omens.
