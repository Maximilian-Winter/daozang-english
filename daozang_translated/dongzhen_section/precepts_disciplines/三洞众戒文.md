**Preface to *The Precepts for the Three Caverns***
Compiled by Zhang Wanfu, Daoist of the Great Clarity Abbey in the capital

Wanfu respectfully observes: The Three Caverns contain many scriptures expounding precepts, too numerous to detail in full. Those who study the Dao and seek truth invariably begin with fasting and precepts. Thus, the *Lingbao* *Ascending Mystery, Pacing the Void* states: "All arise from fasting and precepts, accumulating merit to bind past karmic ties." The Left Immortal of the Supreme Ultimate also says: "To study the Dao without cultivating fasting and precepts is but vain toil in the mountains and forests." From this, the matter is clear.

Now, precepts restrain all evil conduct and serve as the foremost defense among all practices. Without upholding precepts, the Dao cannot be attained. Yet if the scriptures of the Dao are not transmitted by a master, their practice lacks spiritual efficacy. The liturgical codes of the Three Caverns provide comprehensive regulations, but masters and disciples, each adhering to their own tradition, differ in transmission across Wu, Shu, and the capital. This is because teachings and precepts require gradual or sudden awakening. People vary in wisdom; methods are adapted to their capacity, yet all must accord with the Dao.

I fear that those of limited vision may rashly generate doubts. The sequence of transmitting scriptures and methods has already been outlined in *The Catalog of the Three Caverns*. Now, following the scriptures, I have extracted the precept texts and appended them to their respective methods. On the day of transmission, they are conferred in accordance with the method, enabling Daoists to recite and practice them, preventing wrongdoing and restraining evil, governing the six senses, advancing in rank to become Perfected Immortals, and transcending the Three Realms. From shallow to profound, distinctions exist; from mortal to sage, each has its gradations.

Here, I briefly present the main outline to facilitate awakening to the mystery:
- For those beginning to awaken and enter the Dao: the Three Refuges Precepts;
- For registered disciples: the Five Precepts and Eight Precepts;
- For laymen and laywomen: the Supreme Ten Precepts;
- For newly tonsured: the Initial Perfection Precepts;
- For Orthodox Unity disciples: the Seventy-Two Precepts;
- For male and female officials: the One Hundred Eighty Precepts of Lord Lao;
- For devout disciples: the Celestial Worthy’s Ten Precepts and Fourteen Rules for Conduct;
- For the *Five Thousand Characters* and the Golden Seal: the Yin-Yang Precepts of the Great Clarity;
- For High Mystery Masters of the Supreme: the Twenty-Seven Precepts;
- For the Cavern of Divinities: the *Three Essential Sayings*, the Five Precepts, the Thirteen Precepts, and the Seven Hundred Twenty Gates of Precepts;
- For the Inner Teachings of Ascending Mystery: the One Hundred Twenty-Nine Precepts;
- For the Initial Alliance of Numinous Treasure: the Precepts for Closing the Six Senses;
- For the Middle Alliance: the Upper Grade Precepts of Wisdom;
- For the Great Alliance: the One Hundred Eighty Precepts of the Three Primes;
- For the Highest Clarity: the Two Hundred Great Precepts of Wisdom and Contemplating the Body.

For all transmissions, each is conferred with the ritual vestments. The codes and precepts for the vestments are proclaimed, the rank of the method is briefly conferred, and then the essential precepts of the Celestial Worthy are transmitted. After three days of admonitions, a fast is held to give thanks. The names and appearances of the Three Masters, along with the location of the abbey, are all recorded to the left.

These are written simultaneously with the transmitted scriptures and methods. Though they are all contained within the scriptures, consulting them at the time of transmission is difficult. Thus, they are presented here.

**The Precepts for the Three Caverns, Fascicle One**
**The Three Refuges Precepts for Beginning the Aspiration to Enter the Dao**
*From the Supreme Mystery Section*

The Primordial Celestial Worthy addressed the Celestial Worthy of the Great Dao, saying: The Dao is vast and formless, yet in motion, it takes form. It spreads qi and moves spirit, giving birth to all beings. Embracing the One and containing the Origin, it is emptiness and quiescence. Patterns respond and images coalesce; it enfolds truth and emits essence. Endowed with perception, it shapes forms, transforming yellow into green. Riding the moment, it attends to encounters, responding to the feelings of things. Therefore, I tell you: close your ears and listen with your heart.

The Dao is the origin and head of all things, the unborn and spiritually generative. It creates and transforms heaven and earth, sun and moon, mountains and rivers. It flows essence and disperses qi, reaching everywhere. Distant, it is boundless; near, it is unfathomable. Vast, it encompasses all; subtle, it enters all. It weaves the cosmos and moistens even the hairs. Guarding it brings clarity and emptiness; awakening to it brings spiritual illumination. It is serene and unchanging, free from restlessness and clamor. It abides eternally, unobstructed and freely flowing. Though kalpas pass, it remains unaltered, serving as a model for all ages. It can preserve spirit, guard the body, govern the state, and attain immortality.

The Dao, the scriptures, and the master are the common path for all. They suppress evil and promote good, serving as precepts for humans and devas. The body, spirit, and life are the wondrous treasures of existence. Returning to the origin and transforming through the root, they are the foundation of sagely perfection. The body is a temporary vessel, formed by the congealing of essence and qi, returning to emptiness and quiescence. Spirit is a lodging, abiding where the Dao moves and life endures, returning to constancy. Life arises spontaneously, sustained by food and breath, returning to the multitude. Sin and fortune, good and evil, fortune and misfortune arise accordingly. All forms undergo birth and transformation, shifting and floating in emptiness, unable to endure. They return to the Dao, the scriptures, and the master—like a child returning to its mother, like all things relying on the earth. Precepts must not be lost even for a moment.

Heaven, without this Dao, cannot revolve;

Earth, without this Dao, cannot bear and nurture;
Sun and moon, without this Dao, cannot shine and illuminate;
Yin and yang, without this Dao, cannot generate and transform;
Ghosts and spirits, without this Dao, cannot perceive clearly;
Rulers and leaders, without this Dao, cannot govern and order;
Daoists, without this Dao and its precepts, cannot abide in constancy.
The threefold Dao is divinely wondrous—long life may be preserved.

The Most High Lord of the Great Dao bows his head and addresses the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "May this Dao be taught to all heavenly and human beings."
Thereupon, fragrant incense of a hundred harmonies is burned, the grand music of the celestial spheres is played, the perfected ones scatter flowers, and all the heavens assemble. The men and women are commanded to prostrate themselves and receive the Three Refuges and Precepts.

The first precept: take refuge in the Most High, Boundless Great Dao;
The second precept: take refuge in the thirty-six divisions of the venerable scriptures;
The third precept: take refuge in the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.

The Heavenly Worthy says: "The Three Refuges are the pivot of heaven and earth, the root of divine immortals, the first gate of practice, the primal sign of establishing the mind. They circulate qi, awaken the numinous, and enter the principle in profound obscurity. They encompass all that has form and unite the body with what lies beyond. Those who uphold them receive the joyful blessings of heaven, earth, and the divine spirits. Their wisdom and intellect are opened, their ears and eyes are clear, and all things hold them in awe. Their six viscera are harmonious and joyful, the perfected ones protect them, and they become parents to all beings. They endure through the ages without loss, and humans and spirits commune in peace."

**Disciples’ Observance of Precepts and Rituals Toward Their Masters**

When a disciple parts from the master for a month, they must don their cap and sash, hold a tablet, and inquire after the master; they may not wear plain clothes.
When a disciple parts from the master for a night, they must bow and kneel in reverence; upon returning, the same is observed.
A disciple may not refer to themselves as "disciple" in the master’s presence; all speech must use their own name.
When a disciple approaches the master, they may not sit without permission; they may sit only when bidden.
A disciple may not address the master as "Daoist"; they must always call them "my master."
A disciple may not violate the master’s name taboo; if questioned, they must answer in a low voice.
A disciple may not act rudely toward the master; officials on both sides are charged with oversight.
If a disciple sees the master commit a fault, they must admonish them in a secluded place while kneeling; they may not speak of the master’s faults or shame before others.
When a disciple speaks with the master, they may not raise their voice or speak loudly.
When a disciple shares a room with the master, they may not lie down first or rise later.
When a disciple eats with the master, they may not begin eating before the master or stop after the master.
When a disciple greets the master, they must do so according to their rank, wearing their cap and robe, holding a tablet; they may not approach casually in plain clothes.
When a disciple follows the master in daily life, they must always be humble and reverent; they may not be without respect even for a moment.
When a disciple serves a master who is younger than themselves, they must still show reverence, treating the master as they would an official of two thousand bushels or their own parents. They may not rely on their own seniority or nobility to slight the master, for the consequences are grave, as set forth in the *Mingzhen Ordinances*.
When a disciple sits with the master and the master rises or moves, the disciple must stand at once; they may not remain seated in comfort.
If a disciple has not yet received the precepts and is of equal rank in qi or senior in age, or is a relative such as a brother, nephew, or descendant, and later seeks to receive the precepts from the master, they must still be humble and reverent, addressing the master by name in all speech; they may not act as they normally would.
A disciple may not serve as master to one with whom they share mourning garments of coarse hemp. The reason is this: when receiving the precepts, one bears witness for three generations of ancestors and seven generations of parents, who come to oversee their descendants’ reception. If the covenant is violated, the nine generations of ancestors suffer punishment, and calamity befalls the one who received the precepts.
A disciple may not harbor anger, resentment, or hatred toward the master; the penalties are set forth in the *Scripture of Illuminating the Perfected*.
When a disciple seeks the Dao and its methods from the master, they must don their cap and sash, hold a tablet, and humbly entreat; they may not approach casually.
When a disciple has been apart from the master for a year, on the first day of each month they must don their cap and sash, hold a tablet, bow three times, kneel, and inquire after the master. After the greeting, they bow twice more, completing five bows. The same is observed upon parting, so that each may remember clearly.
A disciple may not argue with the master or act with careless disdain.
When a disciple serves the master, they must always be reverent; they may not be arrogant or discourteous. The penalties are set forth in the *Scripture of Illuminating the Perfected*; all should take heed.
A disciple may not contend with the master over merit or fame, nor lack a mind of deference.
When a disciple approaches the master, they must inquire about what they have received; they may not discuss private or base matters.
When a disciple serves the master and the master returns from a journey, the disciple must go to meet them according to the distance; they may not remain seated in comfort. When walking with the master, the disciple may not tread on the master’s shadow; they must be cautious.
When a disciple sits with the master, they may not accept others’ bows, for there is no second seat of honor.
A disciple may not secretly act with malice or harbor resentment toward the master.
When a disciple goes out or undertakes any task, they must first consult the master; they may not act on their own.
When a disciple serves the master, they must be loving, faithful, and sincere; they may not waver or harbor divided loyalty.
A disciple may not steal from or reveal the contents of the master’s vessels or cases, nor violate the master’s prohibitions; the ordinances impose penalties for such offenses.
A disciple may not betray or oppose the master; they must be cautious, as the *Scripture of Illuminating the Perfected* makes clear.
When a disciple is with the master, they may not spit or snort to the sides; they must be cautious.
When a disciple attends the master in the presence of guests, they must stand to the master’s left or right; they may not sit arrogantly or act no differently from common folk. To do so is to commit unfilial impiety; they must be cautious.
When a disciple receives the master’s teachings and later achieves profound virtue and is revered by others, they must remain humble and remember their original master, never forgetting their prior kindness.
A disciple may not casually sit in the master’s bed or seat; the spirits swiftly take note of such transgressions.

Here follows the translation:

The above are the thirty-six precepts for disciples serving their masters.

*Three Caverns Precepts, Scroll One* concludes.
*Three Caverns Precepts, Scroll Two*
Compiled by Daoist Zhang Wanfu of the Great Clarity Abbey in the capital

**Precepts of the First Covenant of the Numinous Treasure, Closing the Six Passions**

The First Precept: Let the eyes not wander in broad gazing, nor be distracted by manifold hues, lest the pupils be lost and sight dimmed, the light no longer bright and clear.

The Second Precept: Let the ears not indulge in chaotic hearing, nor be confounded by the five tones, lest the spirit be harmed and rightness undone, evil sounds and wailing arise.

The Third Precept: Let the nose not seek out diverse scents, nor be tainted by foul and rank qi, lest turbidity arise and the form lose its purity and uprightness.

The Fourth Precept: Let the mouth not crave rich flavors, nor be stained by fatty and pungent fare, lest the five spirits be sullied and the organs and viscera swell and rupture.

The Fifth Precept: Let the hands not commit evil deeds, nor steal the belongings of others, nor covet profit for oneself, lest calamity come unawares.

The Sixth Precept: Let the heart not cling to desires, nor agitate the five spirits, lest essence be harmed, qi dissipated, and the body fall into confusion and delusion.

The Heavenly Worthy declares: These six precepts address the great afflictions of the body.
In future lives, though one may be born male or female in human form, if the six passions remain impure, the scriptural teachings unseen, the Dharma-sound unheard, the form unaware of itself, one will sink into the gates of transgression, leading to a foreshortened life, failing to complete the allotted years, and dwelling long in evil destinies—how pitiable indeed!
Thus are these precepts expounded to deliver gods and humans. With a faithful and devout heart, single-mindedly take refuge, reverently uphold the sagely teachings, and close the gates of evil. Then the form will enter emptiness, the six penetrations and wisdom will arise, the six passions will be at peace, the spirit will be serene, qi will be harmonious, essence will be secure, and life will be long and enduring, never perishing.

Wanfu says: The six passions are the gates of defilement and the source of bodily ruin. Therefore, in holding the precepts, one must first restrain the six passions. When the six passions are at peace, the spirit and the Dao return as one.
Thus, when scholars first enter the Middle Vehicle, they must first close the six passions before gradually ascending to the One Dao.
This is the proper sequence; those who understand will reflect upon it.

**Three Precepts**

The Scripture states: Those who study wondrous essence, mysterious transformations, divine changes, and the manifold arts of the Great Dao must purify themselves and fast, recite and practice the pure precepts, thoroughly comprehend their meaning and intent, move and rest in communion with the spirits, diligently practice the good Dao, meticulously attend to wondrous matters, carefully weigh merit and transgression, and never give rise to delusion or falsehood. With a clear and settled mind, and the precepts and practices complete, only then may one practice the Dao, so that the heart’s intent aligns with the spoken word.
Those who fail to cultivate this will confuse humans and spirits, destroy themselves and mislead others. To practice the Dao is to benefit both self and others; thus, one must be cautious, never trifling or boasting of the Dao to others.
Nor should one harm others for personal gain. One must uphold these precepts to restrain oneself.

The First Precept: Clearly discern causes and conditions; do not forget the root while chasing the branches.

The Second Precept: Carefully guard against self-interest; do not seek benefit for oneself at the expense of others.

The Third Precept: Diligently practice and cultivate; do not blend with the vulgar and lose the true.

The above Three Supreme Precepts are practiced by the Supreme Sovereign, upheld by the Celestial Thearchs, and cultivated by superior scholars. Those who practice and uphold them without breach will unite with the three qi of the correct spirits. Body and spirit will become one, undivided, attaining the Dao and abiding forever—this is called the Supreme One.
Those who do not practice these precepts but wear talismans and texts will labor in vain without effect; they are not disciples of the Supreme One.

**Five Precepts**

The Scripture states: The Thearch Haoying addressed the Yellow Thearch, saying: "I received the essential precepts of the multitude of scriptures from the Supreme Lord Lao, and through diligent practice, I attained my present state. The Dharma should be disseminated to exhort and transform future generations; it must not be concealed or cut off from posterity.
Only when the heart is refined can one attain long life. It is fitting to broadly proclaim these precepts to achieve the merit of universal salvation."

The Yellow Thearch bowed his head and prostrated himself twice, receiving the decree and vowing to comply.

The First Precept: Let the eyes not covet the five colors; vow to cease killing and study long life.

The Second Precept: Let the ears not covet the five tones; wish to hear the good and follow without delusion.

The Third Precept: Let the nose not covet the five qi; use ritual incense to dispel worldly impurities.

The Fourth Precept: Let the mouth not covet the five flavors; practice embryonic breathing and renounce evil speech.

The Fifth Precept: Let the body not covet the five adornments; engage in diligent labor to accord with the Dao.

The above Five Precepts: The Five Elder Thearchs each dispatch twenty-five spirits to guard the bodies of those who receive and uphold them, freeing them from disasters and extending their years, bringing peace to the nation and the household, and delivering all beings.
At the time of transmission, follow the method of the Three Precepts. The Three Precepts summon the three qi of the Primordial Origin and the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, while the Five Precepts extend the five qi of benevolence, propriety, trust, righteousness, and wisdom. Three and five make eight, pervading all without omission. Refine and perfect them, and all things, great and small, will be complete.

**Eight Precepts**

The Supreme One states: All precepts and disciplines should be practiced together. Among them, urgency and ease, complexity and simplicity, loftiness and humility each have their significance. In accordance with the standards of the Primordial Origin, transformations generate numbers, and stages gradually complete one another. Three, five, eight, nine, ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand—though one may adapt to what is fitting, none may be omitted.
Those who know to turn toward the correct Dharma and cultivate long life without death, having already integrated the Three and Five Precepts, should receive the Eight Precepts.

First: Resolve the five phases and cultivate the five virtues.

Second: Practice the five affairs without fail.

Third: Harmonize the eight correct principles; act and withdraw in accord with the seasons.

Fourth: Clearly discern the five celestial stems and abide together with qi.

Fifth: Carefully examine the Imperial Ultimate; let above and below be in harmony.

Sixth: Cultivate the three virtues and await the assembly of the Three Clarities.

Seventh: Resolve doubts and transform the false into the true.

Eighth: Examine and verify, dispel misfortune and summon blessings, refine the ordinary and ascend to sageliness, never failing the Three Honored Ones.

The above Eight Precepts must be upheld in full. If one transgresses and breaks them, one must repent, confess one’s faults, reform one’s intentions, and resolutely guard against future lapses.
After practicing them for three years, the good spirits of the eight directions will gather to protect one.

After six years, one is safeguarded from the Six Adversities. The Six Adversities are: misfortune and premature death, constant suffering from illness, perpetual anxiety, accumulated hardship and poverty, repulsive appearance, and frailty with no recourse.

After eight years, one perpetually enjoys the Five Blessings. The Five Blessings are: longevity, wealth and honor, health and peace, love of virtue, and a timely end.

Refining existence into non-existence, one naturally recognizes past lives. After nine years, spiritual penetrations arise, and one transcends the ordinary to attain sageliness.

**Three Essential Writings**

The Scripture states: For those who aspire to learning, whose strength is yet insufficient, excessive knowledge leads to failure, and indolence invites calamity. A good teacher illuminates what the disciple can bear, gradually imparting knowledge according to their capacity, fostering daily progress through inspired effort. First, set aside complex precepts and reveal the essential formulas. All scriptures and methods are to be practiced in due order, and as merits accumulate, natural mastery arises. Mastery originates from essentials, and there are three essential formulas.

The first is called *Cause*. From the beginningless past, the knowing nature persists. The spiritual essence is indestructible; suffering in death remains, while joy in life lacks mechanism. One who does not recognize cause will surely not resent Heaven, blame others, fault things, or lament the body. Accepting suffering and joy as they come, one avoids delusion.

The second is called *Condition*. Following cause through movement and stillness, harmonizing inner and outer, one neither encroaches upon others to benefit oneself nor entraps oneself to mislead others. Though diminished, one remains unharmed; though benefited, one causes no injury. Recognizing root and branch, one avoids perverse doubts.

The third is called *Diligence*. Guarding the heart and mouth with care, strictly commanding the body and spirits, one seeks the sagely, inquires earnestly, receives teachings, and obeys them. One expands good conditions and severs evil causes. With right vision, the disciple advances without retreat, does not defy the teacher to act on one’s own, does not blindly follow superficial trends, does not grow arrogant or indolent to disrupt the community, does not obstinately oppose the multitude, does not conceal truth to display falsehood, and does not begin without finishing.

By long remembering these three formulas, one delivers others and benefits oneself. The divine scribes of the Three Sovereigns will naturally appear in form, serving and aiding one, communicating with true spirits, refining the ordinary into sageliness, and transforming the coarse into the refined. Without knowing these three, one will never attain the Dao.

**Eight Defeats**

The Scripture states: In purification, order and discipline are urgent. Urgency lies in ordering and disciplining body and mind. When body and mind are ordered and disciplined, one is preserved from disorder and defeat.

Defeat arises from many sources, but its major forms are eight:

1. Killing to sustain oneself,
2. Stealing from others to supply oneself,
3. Taking pleasure in lust,
4. Deceiving others with false speech,
5. Indulging in wine to one’s whim,
6. Reclining on high, broad, and grand beds,
7. Competing in the use of fragrant oils and ornate adornments,
8. Delighting in singing and dancing performances.

Noble persons and those who study the sagely and true immortals do not engage in these eight acts. Thus, the Eight Defeats cannot arise. When the Eight Defeats do not arise, the Eight Accomplishments naturally stand. Once established, they are not lost, prolonging life and preserving destiny. Spiritual penetrations become thorough, and the verification of truth through practice and cultivation is swift.

**Three Essentials**

The Heavenly Sovereign said: The first essential is to first seek longevity; the second essential is to conceal one’s form; the third essential is to avoid worldly glory.

**Thirteen Prohibitions**

The Immortal said: Those who wish to prolong life and attain longevity must avoid the following prohibitions.

Prohibit ejaculation, or life will be cut short;
Prohibit overeating, or qi and vessels will be blocked;
Prohibit excessive drinking, or the bladder will be strained;
Prohibit extreme heat, or marrow and bones will be consumed;
Prohibit extreme cold, or muscles and flesh will be harmed;
Prohibit cold food, or illness and stagnation will arise;
Prohibit coughing and spitting, or bodily fluids will be lost;
Prohibit prolonged gazing, or the eyes will dim;
Prohibit prolonged listening, or hearing will be obstructed;
Prohibit prolonged weeping, or the spirit will grieve;
Prohibit sudden shouting, or the soul will be startled;
Prohibit internal brooding, or the mind will be distracted;
Prohibit anger and resentment, or the spirit will be displeased.

**Seven Hundred Twenty Essential Precepts**

The Scripture states: The seven hundred twenty essential precepts are treasures of the heavens, transmitted orally and worn on the body, not recorded in scriptures. If one has not yet met a teacher, one should ingest talismans to elicit a response, summoning the spirits to descend and receive them.

From the beginningless past, people have possessed consciousness in the heart. The heart’s consciousness is restless, changing in an instant—swifter than a team of horses passing a crack, slower than clouds drifting between lightning flashes. The heart’s goodness and evil shift unpredictably; among all urgencies, none is as swift as the heart’s. The heart is harder to restrain than tigers and leopards; monkeys, apes, deer, and horses are all easier to control. Among all things, the heart is the most difficult to master. Only the highest sages can skillfully guide the heart. Middle and lower sages and true immortals constantly struggle with the heart, examining within and observing without day and night, ever fearful of transgression and the dissipation of spirit. Once the spirit scatters, it cannot be retrieved; once the body falls, how can it be restored? To preserve the body from falling and the spirit from scattering, to attain longevity and become a divine immortal, ascending to the rank of the highest sages—this depends on pure purification.

Purification has many levels. The five emotions and six desires surge and compete, inner and outer falling out of alignment, leading to confusion and disorder. Turning from the correct to the perverse, abandoning root for branch, deceiving the unseen and the seen, one invites judgment and sinks into the Nine Springs’ abyss, where myriad torments await, and liberation is without term—all due to the failure to purify.

Those who aspire to learning must urgently practice purification. In purification, aligning the heart is primary, and upholding precepts is the foundation. The foundation restrains the heart; when the heart is settled, life arises. Forgetting precepts and losing the foundation, the heart becomes chaotic, and death follows. Seeking life within death, seeking immortality within life—all must involve pure purification and the recitation and practice of precepts.

As emotions and desires multiply, precepts become boundless. The boundless dharma gates were established by the many sages to guide and lead all beings, enabling their entry. Each has its proper place, differing among the heavens, with times for action and concealment, varying across ages. In general, they are not disparate; all share in common the seven hundred twenty gates, which are the most wondrous and supreme. Those who uphold them in full attain the ultimate Dao, enabling transformations across seventy-four directions. The nine heavens each have eight, and eight times nine is seventy-two. From above to below, they total seventy-four directions.

Those who cannot uphold the precepts—or uphold them incompletely—vary in their stages and ranks, and their transformations differ accordingly. With differing transformations, they cannot avoid accumulating afflictions; thus, the supreme sages command their full observance.

All sentient beings possess the Three and the Five, yet these vary in measure. The foolish and the wise differ, each leading and encompassing the other, restraining and elevating in mutual dependence. Once the first consciousness stirs, countless impulses arise without end. To guard the One is impossible; one must directly address the Three and the Five. Interwoven and mutually sustaining, the Three Qi flow and circulate, the Eight Assemblies lend support, the Great One traverses, and the Nine Palaces achieve completion. The One Source is the root; the Nine Transformations are the branches. With root and branches established, the Nine and the One reside as the essence. The root guides the branches; the branches return in harmony to the source. The One Source responds to the branches; when the branches’ sensations stir, the root remains eternally quiescent. Quiescence responds to all movements—movement is called "external arising."

What arises externally is movement; what abides internally is quiescence. Quiescence and movement meet midway, sharing both difference and sameness. Sameness moves to dispel departure; difference rests to aid arrival. Arrival does not disturb quiescence; departure does not exhaust movement. Movement without exhaustion does not depart from quiescence; quiescence without disturbance does not doubt movement. Quiescence illumines with clarity, thus free from disturbance and doubt; movement arises gradually, thus free from labor and separation. Free from labor and separation, one constantly unites with long life; free from disturbance and doubt, one abides in eternal joy. Abiding without abiding, acting without acting—this is the highest of the Dao.

The original One, through division and transformation, becomes multiplicity. Eight and nine revolve, multiplying and accumulating into gates—seven hundred and twenty in all. A gate is pattern, principle, and return. Dispersed and scattered, one responds and returns; return and cultivation proceed through pattern. Attaining the gate enables entry, yet one has not yet returned to the source. Initially coarse and manifold, with practice the conditions refine and diminish. The many and the few incline toward one another, supplementing and interpenetrating. As perception and awakening unfold, the gate becomes increasingly discernible. With long-cultivated goodness and courageous vigor, one swiftly attains the goal. For those who have not yet attained swiftly, the passage of kalpas is boundless. In general, transformation entails relinquishing the old and embracing the new. Astonishing to hear and wondrous to behold, this occurs within the seven hundred twenty gates. Accumulating through eight and nine, refining to the utmost, the seven hundred twenty merge as one.

To guard the One without loss is difficult; to practice it without firmness is arduous. Thought follows thought without pause; even a moment’s lapse invites deviation. Deviation invites obstruction; obstruction veils the correct. Veiled, the gate is blocked; blocked, one’s vision becomes deluded. Delusion leads to suffering; at suffering’s extremity, one yearns to return. The spirit of perception stirs, awakening suddenly. One strengthens one’s thought, thought following thought in unbroken succession. Through accumulation over time, the One Qi permeates the body. Body and spirit become thoroughly pervaded; the eight and nine shine clearly. Transformations become boundless, arising from awakening to guarding the One. Guarding the One requires support—nothing is more urgent than the precepts. Upholding them without deficiency prevents deviation from entering. With deviation barred, the correct qi draws near. Intimacy deepens over time, naturally merging into oneness, uniting with the Dao in truth. The fruition of precept-support is attained; through precepts, one enters the Dao—hence they are called the gate. Those of refined aspiration and sincere devotion follow accordingly.

Master Wanfu said: The human mind is not one; perception may be dim or bright. The wondrous Dao is without fixed form; spiritual transformation is difficult to fathom. A bright mind awakens to the Dao; a dull spirit strays from truth. The mind attains clarity through quiescence; the spirit falls into chaos through movement. Chaos loses the Dao; clarity unites with truth. Thus, guarding the correct and dispelling deviation prevents delusive thoughts from arising. Turning from brightness toward darkness, evil thoughts arise. Good and evil arise not from another—truly, they are self-created. Delusion and awakening lie within oneself, not dependent on others. Therefore, the Great Sage Heavenly Worthy, in vast compassion, transforms beings with skillful means, guiding all without exception. Establishing boundless dharma gates, he gathers all, administering medicine according to need, dispelling the illnesses of the multitude. Universally exhorting practitioners, he commands all to uphold the precepts.

Precepts are of many kinds, with gates great and small. Ultimately, they converge at the root, equally accomplishing the correct Dao. Yet the Three, Five, Six, and Eight differ gradually or suddenly. Once perception and awakening are clear, one ultimately upholds the One Precept. The One Precept is simply to restrain the mind from arising in other thoughts—this is what is meant by "guarding the One without loss, thought following thought without pause." Scholars should reflect deeply and practice accordingly.

The Lower Scroll of the Precept Texts of the Three Caverns concludes.
