At that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning, who existed before heaven and earth, spread *qi* throughout the ten directions and brought forth the myriad forms. Lord of humans and gods, sovereign of rivers and mountains, by whom the sun and moon move in their courses and the four seasons take shape. He fashioned the ladder of Daoist cultivation and the bridge across birth and death. Emerging from existence and entering non-existence, he responded to the needs of the time, adapting his teachings to conditions to deliver sentient beings. Manifesting as the Dharma-body, he pervaded the world, perfecting omniscience and arousing boundless intention. At times he appeared as a king, at others as a minister or official, a clerk or a renunciant, a Dharma-master or a dragon-king, a man or a woman, a mendicant or a person of lowly station. In countless transformations, he conformed to the world, yet the eyes of ordinary beings could not perceive him. Failing to recognize him, they fell into confusion, distinguishing right from wrong, self from other. Greed and delusion arose from attachment to desire, and from clinging, hells were born, binding them to karmic foes. From life to life, from kalpa to kalpa, they never awakened to right mindfulness, their bodies and minds never entering the source of stillness. Rising from illusion, they sank into evil destinies, adrift on the river of craving, blown by the winds of karma—how could they attain true stability? The three karmic actions sowed the seeds, and the ten evil thoughts arose. In the midst of the true Dharma, they engaged in endless discrimination, forever drowning in the sea of suffering, with no hope of liberation.

Ever mindful of the immeasurable afflictions of sentient beings, I now transmit these precepts to halt evil and prevent transgressions. Those who rely on and practice them will attain the fruit of the Dao.

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate further said: In my past five hundred lives, I resolved to cultivate the Dao and saw that all dharmas were nothing but the true Dharma. Why? Because I did not perceive them through illusion. Knowing all dharmas as devoid of falsity, I saw them as true. Why? Because I knew them with true wisdom. Thus, those who cling to illusion see illusion, while those who abide in truth see truth. Simply cultivating the true mind is true wisdom. Truth does not depart from illusion; transforming illusion returns it to truth. Illusion does not depart from truth; delusion and truth become illusion. Only by severing illusion and returning to truth, upholding the precepts and practicing them as taught, reciting them day and night, can one avoid hell and all attain heaven.

Whenever reciting the precepts, observe the following fasting days each month: the 1st, 8th, 14th, 15th, 18th, 23rd, 24th, 28th, 29th, and 30th (in shorter months, the 27th instead). These are called the *Ten Upright Fasting Days*. Also observe the *Eight Seasonal Fasting Days*: the days of *Beginning of Spring*, *Spring Equinox*, *Beginning of Summer*, *Summer Solstice*, *Beginning of Autumn*, *Autumn Equinox*, *Beginning of Winter*, and *Winter Solstice*. The *Three Origin Fasting Days* are the 15th of the 1st, 7th, and 10th months. The *Four Commencement Fasting Days* are the 1st of the 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th months. The *Three Assembly Fasting Days* are the 7th of the 1st month, the 7th of the 7th month, and the 5th of the 10th month. On these days, those of shared karma and practice—whether few or many—should gather in a quiet chamber, purify themselves, fast, chant praises, recite sincerely, and burn incense. Or, within an abbey, known as a *blessed land*, they should sweep and purify the halls, which then become a *mystic altar*. They should invite a Dharma-master to recite these wondrous precepts and burn fragrant incense. At that moment, the attendants of the left and right, the thirty-two Perfected Immortals and Heavenly Lords, the divine officials of the ten directions, the marshals of the Five Peaks, the earth gods of the nine provinces, the lords of mountains and forests, the spirits of water palaces, the twelve stream maidens, the flying heavenly kings, the divine youths of the heavens, and countless others will assemble at the place of recitation and precepts. They will record the merits of those who resolve to practice, and surely erase their karmic transgressions. If one steadfastly copies, receives, and upholds these precepts, reciting them diligently, then life after life, kalpa after kalpa, one will not fall into hell.

The Perfected One expounded the precepts in verse. We, the assembly, now deeply repent and each vow to receive and uphold them. May the precept-master expound them to us from time to time.

**First Precept:** Do not kill, sever the lives of others, or boil and cook delicacies to indulge the body. Do not kill yourself, instruct others to kill, or rejoice in killing, nor consume the flesh of beings. Violators will in the past have suffered the hell of boiling cauldrons.

**Second Precept:** Do not steal or take wealth that is not rightfully yours. Do not enter others’ homes at night or spy on gardens by day, taking advantage of opportunity to harbor thieving thoughts. Do not steal yourself, instruct others to steal, or rejoice in stealing. Violators will in the past have suffered the hell of knife mountains and sword trees.

**Third Precept:** Do not harbor secret schemes to wrongfully accuse the good. When seeing others surpass you, do not seek to harm them. Do not calculate inequities, seek personal gain, claim others’ virtues as your own, or resent others for your own faults. Violators will in the past have suffered the hell of burning coals.

**Fourth Precept:** Do not be duplicitous, speaking one way while thinking another, or sow discord among relatives.

Violators will in the past have suffered the hell of iron pestles pounding their bodies.

**Sixth Precept:** Do not consume alcohol. Intoxication disturbs the spirit-mind, breeds reckless violence, disregards rites and music, disrupts reverence for elders and parents, invokes deities with shouts, and harms the heart while depleting qi. Violators will in the past have suffered the hell of venomous serpents devouring their hearts.

**Seventh Precept:** Do not engage in deceitful speech, frivolous talk, harsh words, or divisive gossip.

Violators will in the past have suffered the hell of embracing burning copper pillars.

**Tenth Precept:** Do not break fasts or violate precepts, act without filial piety or benevolence. Do not steal offerings from fasts, conceal kitchen provisions, or prevent others’ merits from reaching fulfillment. Violators will in the past have suffered the hell of carrying stones to build mountains.

**Eleventh Precept:** Do not damage or dismantle sacred images, steal banners and flowers, or use offerings for personal clothing and bedding. Violators will in the past have suffered the hell of lying upon an iron bed.

**Twelfth Precept:** Do not witness the destruction of meritorious works—collapsing halls and dwellings—without repairing them, harboring false accusations in your heart. Violators will in the past have suffered the hell of sword forests severing body and mind.

**Thirteenth Precept:** Do not, upon visiting others’ homes and seeing their possessions, borrow with no intention of repayment, fabricate debts to exploit poverty, or extort by unjust means. Violators will in the past have suffered the hell of freezing ice.

**Fifteenth Precept:** Do not enter sacred spaces without washing hands or rinsing the mouth, defile scriptures and images, or treat sacred texts with disrespect. Do not act with irreverence or laziness. Violators will in the past have suffered the hell of iron rods beating them relentlessly.

**Nineteenth Precept:** Do not consume impure foods—meat, alcohol, or pungent vegetables like onions, garlic, leeks, and scallions—defiling the body and driving away spirits. Do not chant scriptures or cultivate practice while offending the sacred. Violators will in the past have suffered the hell of swallowing fire and eating coals.

**Twentieth Precept:** Do not be self-righteous, mock others, create divisions of self and other in the Dharma, cling to attachments, or fail to perceive the true and real. Violators will in the past have suffered the hell of grinding, pounding, and crushing.

**Twenty-First Precept:** Do not administer poisons to others, harming their lives and fostering enmity. Violators will in the past have suffered the hell of being steeped in vats of noxious toxins.

**Twenty-Second Precept:** Do not scheme against the Three Treasures, estrange the six relations, neglect generosity, or seek only personal gain. Do not speak with duplicity or fail to uphold trust. Violators will in the past have suffered the hell of tongue extraction.

**Twenty-Third Precept:** Do not mix pure fast offerings with impure foods—meat, alcohol, or pungent vegetables—disrespecting the fast and incurring the wrath of the heavens. Violators will in the past have suffered the hell of iron chains binding their bodies, preventing rebirth.

**Twenty-Fourth Precept:** Do not rely on power and wealth to deceive the poor and lowly, separate men and women, or distrust the celestial truth. Do not harbor dualistic views, fail to sever self and other, persist in wrongdoing, or remain ignorant of karmic causes. Violators will in the past have suffered the hell of being sawed apart in body and mind.

The Supreme Perfected One further said: These twenty-four precepts are the great afflictions of the body. Violators will endure the blades of ten thousand kalpas, their living souls perpetually tormented. If one suffers bodily pain, bruises of blue and red, or a heart filled with sorrow, it is the underworld officials preparing to punish their living soul. One must, according to their capacity, burn incense, enter fasts, perform the Dao, offer repentance, uphold the precepts with devotion, invoke the Most High Heavenly Worthy, light lamps, and widely cultivate merit—never violating again, so that their transgressions may be absolved.

The Perfected One further said: Those who wish to study the Dao must first observe fasts and precepts, purify the heart, and guard against transgressions. The merit of upholding precepts surpasses the number of motes of dust. Though the count of dust motes may be seen and measured, the merit of fasts and precepts is boundless and inexhaustible. One who upholds the precepts elevates nine generations of ancestors to heaven, bestows blessings upon the entire household, and resolves calamities when they arise. Even if one exhausts their family’s wealth in giving, they must still uphold these precept scriptures. Without observing these precepts, one’s study of the Dao will ultimately fail. Those who uphold these precepts will be witnessed by all the Heavenly Kings, Perfected Ones, Great Sages, Divine Immortals, Jade Maidens, and all the spiritual officials of the Boundless Worlds, who will burn incense, light lamps, and attest that the merit of the precept-keeper is immeasurable.

To perfect the Dao and attain true reality, all the heavens will welcome them with incense and flowers, and surely guide these beings to rebirth according to their vows. If good men and good women hear this precept scripture and rejoice in their hearts, their evil karma will be eradicated. Able to relinquish stinginess and greed, they use pure wealth to redeem and transmit these precept scriptures, dedicating the merit with diligent devotion. For households conducting memorial rites for the deceased—whether on the first seventh day or through the final seventh day—those who uphold and recite these precepts will cause the departed soul to ascend to pure realms and be reborn in heavenly halls. Pregnant women who hear this precept scripture will be delivered from peril; for those facing personal calamities, suffering and karmic entanglements will dissolve, and the entire household will receive boundless blessings. The precepts restrain afflictions, sever demonic thoughts, and with earnest cultivation, hasten liberation.

All the heavens join in chanting this gatha:
All who cultivate and study,
Vow to perfect the true Dao.
With compassion, heed these admonitions,
And with each recitation, sever afflictions.
Forever parted from the suffering of birth and death,
They attain the supreme Dao.
Turning their hearts toward the true and real,
Their countenance remains youthful, never aging.

The Most Supreme Perfected One concludes *The Scripture of the Twenty-Four Precepts*.
