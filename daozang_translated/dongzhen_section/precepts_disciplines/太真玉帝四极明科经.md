### *The Supreme Perfection Jade Emperor’s Illuminated Precepts of the Four Poles*
**Scroll One**

At that time, the Most High Great Dao Lord bestowed upon the August Supreme Perfection Jade Emperor the *Illuminated Precepts of the Four Poles*, a code of one hundred and twenty statutes, to inspect the Heavenly Perfected Ones above, examine the Flying Immortals in the middle, and adjudicate the transgressions of the guilty below.

This jade scripture emerged from the annotations of the August Supreme Governor, enshrined within the Sevenfold Radiant Purple Chamber of the Lofty Jade Void. Its jade splendor formed the canon, golden immortals scattered incense, and five hundred million divine soldiers of the Five Thearchs, along with flying essence-clad cavalry, guarded the sacred text. Its reckoning spans the endless kalpas, presiding over the five transformations of fortune and the ninefold changes of sovereignty. When the time comes to assess the Perfected Ones who assist in the sagely governance, those with golden bones and jade viscera, bearing the Dark Chart and Purple Tablets, their names inscribed in the Upper Clarity, shall transmit the precepts in accordance with the code.

The Most High addressed the Golden Portal Emperor Lord, dispatching the Nine Numinous Jade Consorts to cast gold into tablets, bound with silver, while the Mother of Tortoises wielded the brush, the Supreme Perfection swept the mat, the Purple Dawn scattered incense, and the Great Florescence held the towel. Within the Purple Chamber of purity, they transcribed the jade scripture, then sealed it in a cloud-brocade pouch with cinnabar and azure seals.

Thereupon, the Most High Great Dao Lord led the Twenty-Four Emperors of the Lofty Jade Void and the Thirty-Nine Perfected Ones upward to the Radiant Purple Palace of the Utmost Utmost Utmost Non-Radiant Qi, where golden splendor and jade halls unfolded in ninefold chambers. They summoned the divine soldiers of the Five Thearchs, the ten million officials of the Four Poles, along with venomous dragons and colossal beasts, to guard the Ten Heavens.

At that moment, canopies of flowing rosy clouds and a thousand Perfected Ones of the Mulberry Grove, bearing nine-colored standards, flanked the numinous gates. Divine simurghs chanted in the dark, purple phoenixes wheeled in flight, jade flutes resounded with piercing tones, and the numinous chimes of the Jade Grove echoed. Golden blossoms scattered fragrance, jade consorts wafted incense, and the Four Assemblies of the Flying Empyrean converged with the Eightfold Penetrations of the Cavern Clarity. The Three Luminaries paused their radiance, night candles shone brightly, molten gold unleashed its might, and fiery bells blazed in descent. The Five Dawns aligned in brilliance, the Seven Primes subdued their essences, and a hundred million chariots with ten thousand cavalry filled the Purple Court in lush abundance.

The August Supreme Jade Emperor commanded the Jade Maidens of the Upper Palace—Xu Farong, Xiao Yizhong, Tian Sifei, Li Yunmen, and others—to strike the cloud-harp’s zither and join their voices in chanting the hymns of the Great Cavern’s lofty purity and the verses of the Three Paths’ dew-laden suffering.

The jade wisdom flutes rang clear, celestial melodies unfolded subtly, divine jade chimes trembled with resonance, and golden tones soared in emptiness. The transformative power reached the multitudes, unifying the myriad mechanisms at their inception.

**The Hymn:**

The Great Cavern encompasses the Three Wheels,
The primordial transformation holds form and formlessness.
Silent as a rootless teaching,
Solemn as a numinous might.

Alas, within the Three Paths,
Sorrow and suffering arise therefrom.
Through diligent study of these precepts,
Accumulate goodness to exhaust the kalpa’s span.

When the kalpa ends, transform and be reborn—
Body like a celestial brick, peer to sun and moon.
Foolishness follows worldly fancies,
Fleeting learning seeks vain glory.

Proclaiming transformation without discipline,
Lightly leaking the Heavenly Treasures’ scriptures,
Violating the code to enter death’s gate—
The Four Poles bind your name.

Soul and spirit tread the Nine Perils,
The Five Sufferings ever entangle you.
Feeding on fire, treading the Blade Mountains,
Hardship knows no moment’s respite.

Bewail this source of fortune and misfortune,
So clear amidst the vast and distant.
The Most High bequeaths stern precepts,
Fortune and misfortune move one to sigh.

The Dao of immortality is fated by destiny,
In darkness, it is already decreed.
Without destiny, it does not unfold;
Once awakened, one endures constant sorrow.

If one can revere the Dark Code,
Naturally one transcends the empyrean.
But if mired in the toils of love and desire,
Why persist in arrogance and frivolity?

Dwelling in transgression, the Four Luminaries bind,
Life and death tread the Eight Perils.
Dragged through the Five Sufferings’ courts,
The Three Paths’ knots remain unbroken.

The soul sinks into the Nine Darks’ plunder,
Ten thousand kalpas without dawn’s reprieve.
Grieve for this teaching of the Primordial Beginning—
How can it not evoke lament?

Vast and distant, above the Nine Mysteries,
Obscure, at the dawn of transformation’s inception.
Without form, without shadow,
Without depth, without measure.

The Two Modes initiate the unfolding of destiny,
Condensing qi to form sediment.
The Three Dawns illuminate the Dark Chamber,
The Five and Nine establish discipline.

Fortune and misfortune arise from humanity,
Good and evil—who indeed prevails?
If one can awaken to the Dark Enlightenment,
Transcendently rise above lofty doubts.

But if one wields the axe that hews fate,
Accumulating transgressions to fill the heart—
Sinking in guilt, the Four Luminaries bind,
The old punishments are truly deserved.

Born bearing the Blade Mountains,
The Five Sufferings know no end.
The Seven Mysteries fill the dark night,
Ten thousand kalpas mark a single epoch.

Lingering in the Three Paths,
Unawakened to life and death.

Thus did the Most High Sagely Perfected Jade Emperor and the Supreme Dawn Great Master, leading the Immortal Jade Lords, wield the feathered staff of ascension and the jade-script imperial decrees, proclaiming to the Five Spirits. The Jade Bureau upheld its position, the myriad emperors attended at the throne, the Radiant August One inaugurated the oath, and the Luminous Statutes were reverently conferred upon the Most High Great Dao Lord.

The Dao Lord received the Mysterious Precepts and, at that time, transmitted them to the Later Sage Ninefold Mystery Golden Portal Emperor Lord, charging him to govern the Upper Clarity above, the Ten Heavens in the middle, and the myriad multitudes below, to oversee all immortals, and to universally proclaim to the myriad perfected. He was to examine and establish the Mysterious Charts and Purple Writs of the Azure Palace, whose names were inscribed in the Jade Emperor’s register, and to confer them upon later disciples, that all might know the precepts and cultivate their practice in accordance with the statutes.

The Later Sage Emperor Lord reverently received the *Four Poles Luminous Statutes* from the Most High Great Dao Lord and sealed them within the Golden Portal Purple Terrace Jade-Lustered Seven-Treasured Palace. After one thousand seven hundred years, they were transmitted to the Prime Minister Azure Lad, who in turn transmitted them to the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One, the Vermilion Lord of the Southern Marchmount, the Lord of the Western City, the Immortal Earl of the Mysterious Continent, the Ninefold Numinous Prince, and the twenty-four Perfected Ones.

The Lord of the Western City sealed one copy within the Jade Chamber of the northwest of Mount Wangwu, where it shall remain for ten thousand kalpas before being transmitted to those later disciples who attain the Dao. Should one possess the Mysterious Charts and jade-inscribed name, with golden bones and purple concealment, they shall obtain this text—those who do shall become immortals and ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

Thirty-six Jade Lads and thirty-six Jade Maidens attend the text, safeguarding the bodies of those who uphold the statutes, recording merits and illuminating virtue. One must diligently and cautiously observe these precepts, abiding by the sacred covenant and treasuring its secrecy. It must not be lightly transmitted. Should the numinous scriptures be divulged, the nine generations of one’s ancestors shall be consigned to the toil of the Primal Exhaustion, bearing mountains and transporting stones to fill the River of the Dark Night, swallowing fire and devouring coals. For ten thousand kalpas, they shall know no pardon; their bodies shall perish in the Dark Springs, and they shall make amends to the Three Officials.

The Three Officials of the Highest Clarity Subtle Heaven and the Mysterious Three Heavens, overseen by the Jade Emperor’s Surveillance Immortal Lords, command fifty thousand divine soldiers of the Five Emperors. The First Left Office governs the offenses of negligence toward the Most High Perfected Jade Emperor. The Second Right Office investigates the crimes of divulging celestial treasures. The Third Yin Office oversees the transgressions of the Primordial Lords in violating the statutory prohibitions.

The Three Officials of the Yu-Yu Heaven, administered by the Perfected Ones and the Jade Lords who oversee transgressions, command fifty thousand divine soldiers of the Five Emperors. The First Left Office governs yang offenses: the crimes of violence, killing, rebellion, theft of celestial treasures, divulging numinous texts, and perjurious curses. The Second Right Office governs yin offenses: the crimes of harboring treacherous plots, scheming against the worthy and able, and entertaining un-Dao-like thoughts. The Third Capital Office governs the offenses of doubting the celestial perfected, lacking reverence and faith, slandering celestial treasures, wavering in resolve, treating the Daoist scriptures lightly, and defiling the numinous texts.

The Three Officials of the Great Red Heaven, who oversee the surveillance of numinous emissaries, command fifty thousand divine soldiers of the Five Emperors. The First Left Office governs the crimes of the living. The Second Right Office governs the crimes of the dead. The Third Yin Office governs the crimes of women. Additionally, there are the Left and Right Offices of Water and Fire. The Left Water Office governs the offenses of false speech, slander, malicious gossip, envy of the worthy and harm to the able, disbelief in the celestial perfected, doubting talismans and registers, disparaging sacred texts, recklessly discoursing on heaven and earth, divulging secret scriptures, defaming the Two Modes, and offending the Three Luminaries. The Right Fire Office governs the crimes of great rebellion, killing living beings, harming one’s masters and lords, plotting against parents, malicious intent, and entertaining un-Dao-like thoughts.

The Great Mound Mountain also has the Left and Right Offices of Wind and Blade. The Left Wind Examination Office governs the offenses of receiving scriptures, talismans, treasured instructions, and covenants without proper vows, loving wealth and despising the Dao, and violating celestial statutes. The Second Right Blade Examination Office governs the crimes of breaking vows and covenants, betraying masters and friends, abandoning one for another, debating good and evil, and attacking the root of the Dao—offenses of profound disloyalty.

Within the Mysterious Center lie the Three Great Vacuities, which are the domains governed by the Three Officials. The Upper Three Officials govern the Jade Void of the Great Mystery above. The Middle Three Officials govern the Great Vacuity of the Upper Clarity. The Lower Three Officials govern the Great Vacuity of the Supreme Ultimate. All reside within the Mysterious Vacuity, above the Hollow Caverns, where nine bureaus are separately established within the Mysterious Vacuity Grotto Chambers of the Five Marchmounts. There is no crime or punishment that does not fall under the jurisdiction of the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus.

The Knife Mountains lie north of Mount Tai, above the Hollow Caverns of the Lesser Heaven, encircling seven thousand *li*. Above them are one hundred twenty offices and one thousand two hundred subordinate officials, commanding fifty thousand divine soldiers who mete out punishments. Those who have committed crimes against the Three Officials, their souls after death, are made to ascend and descend the mountains. For ten thousand kalpas, they endure one lashing; after three lashings, their suffering souls may proceed to the Land of Flowing Fire.

The Land of Flowing Fire lies south of Mount Huo, within the Vast Yang Cavern Court, encircling five thousand *li*. The sinful souls are all consigned to this fiery realm, where they feed on fire and devour coals, their emaciated souls enduring agony. For ten thousand kalpas, they endure one lashing; after three lashings, they are assigned to the toil of the Three Paths, bearing the soil of Mount Meng to fill the River of the Dark Night. Only after three lashings may they return to the path of rebirth among the unenlightened.

The Three Paths are all connected to the Azure Upper Palace of the Great Mystery Woman in Mount Fengdu, located in the northern *gui* region. Upon this mountain are eight prisons: the First Celestial Surveillance Prison, the Second Celestial Equilibrium Prison, the Third Void Prison, the Fourth Natural Prison, the Fifth Ninefold Equilibrium Prison, the Sixth Clarion Decree Prison, the Seventh Mysterious Heaven Prison, and the Eighth Primordial Rectitude Prison—these eight prisons are overseen by the Upper Heaven Three Officials.

At the mountain’s center are another eight prisons: the First Mysterious Sands Northern Prison, the Second August Heaven Prison, the Third Prohibitive Punishment Prison, the Fourth Mysterious Wonder Prison, the Fifth Punitive Rectitude Prison, the Sixth Statutory Decree Prison, the Seventh Nine Heavens Prison, and the Eighth Clarion Jade Prison—these eight prisons are overseen by the Middle Heaven Three Officials.

Beneath the mountain are yet another eight prisons: the First Boundless Prison, the Second Great Perfected Prison, the Third Mysterious Capital Prison, the Fourth Thirty-Six Heavens Great Prison, the Fifth Heaven One Northern Prison, the Sixth River Earl Prison, the Seventh Kalpic Accumulation Prison, and the Eighth Azure Woman Prison—these eight prisons are overseen by the Lower Three Officials.

The twenty-four prisons are all situated north of Mount Dengdu. Each prison is staffed with twelve subordinate officers and twenty-four hundred mighty celestial enforcers—golden-headed, iron-faced, and wielding golden hammers and iron staves. All souls who violate the Mysterious Statutes and meet death are consigned to their respective prisons, where the enforcers’ iron staves administer punishment. A single lash endures for ten thousand kalpas; only after three lashes may the soul be released to atone for its transgressions in the Three Wretched Realms.

The Most High addressed the Golden Portal Lord of the Imperial Palace, saying: “All people born within the Six Directions of Heaven and Earth yet remain ignorant of their predestined lives and deaths, the roots of sin and fortune—how grievous this is! The causes of good and evil invariably yield their recompense. Those who in life perform meritorious deeds and spread virtue, rescuing and delivering all beings, shall after death transform and be born in halls of fortune, transcending the Eight Difficulties, receiving human felicitations, and earning the natural rewards of Heaven.

Those who in life devote themselves to study, aspire to the Dao of immortals, revere the Mysterious Statutes, honor and believe in the sacred scriptures, turn from evil to embrace goodness, and establish conduct to enter the Real, shall after death transform and be received by the Thearchs. Their names shall be inscribed on purple tablets and ascend to the Jade Dawn, where they shall dwell in the Dao’s joy, undeterred by hardship or cold. Following their masters, they prioritize labor, endure hunger and thirst without complaint, and after death transform to ride flying chariots, roaming and feasting upon the Five Peaks, traversing the void and descending through mist.

Those who in life maintain steadfast integrity, neither licentious nor deceitful, neither greedy nor desirous, unmoved by sensual allure, their hearts as cold as dead ashes, and hold fast to the source of the Dao, shall after death transform and be rewarded as numinous beings, transcending the Three Wretched Realms and sparing themselves the Five Sufferings.

Those who in life perform good deeds, wishing Heaven’s universal deliverance so that all may ascend and escape the Eight Difficulties—even if others remain unenlightened, they themselves find no peace, sacrificing their own garments to relieve the destitute and cold, sharing their provisions with birds, and leaving offerings in desolate mountains—shall be praised by the Four Controllers. Their virtue shall move the Jade Thearch, their names inscribed on purple tablets, and they shall be appointed as ascending immortals.

Those who in life are loyal and filial, reverently serving their elders and superiors, honoring those wiser than themselves, and venerating their masters and lords as if their eyes and bellies were one with their own, their hearts free of arrogance, their speech devoid of frivolity, their inner and outer selves aligned, and their actions in accord with the Real, shall after death transform and become numinous beings. They shall not traverse the Three Wretched Realms nor endure the Eight Difficulties. Goodness begets goodness, fortune begets fortune—such is the Dao’s recompense, which never fails humanity.

Those who in life are wicked, harboring malice and deceit, attacking their masters’ foundations, slandering sacred scriptures, failing to revere the numinous texts, doubting the celestial immortals, feigning virtue for vain glory, speaking falsely while their hearts remain treacherous, betraying the source of the Dao, stealing scriptures without oath, recklessly disseminating them, divulging secret formulas, spreading false teachings, violating statutes and taboos—such souls enter the gates of sin. Their seven generations of ancestors suffer calamity, their destitute spirits are held accountable, their bodies endure flogging after death, consume fire, tread mountains, and endure the Three Wretched Realms and Five Sufferings for ten thousand kalpas without reprieve. Beaten in the dark of night, their pain is unbearable.

Those who wish to cultivate and study must carefully ponder this text. How can the retributions of fortune and misfortune be fully described? Those whose golden names are recorded in the Thearch’s register and whose jade characters are inscribed on purple tablets, who receive and uphold the *One Hundred Twenty Articles of the Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*, are all destined to become immortals. They must abide by the statutes, cultivate goodness, and follow the Dao, thereby attaining the resonance of divine clarity. The Jade Thearch of the Mysterious Void shall discern their merit, and the Four Controllers shall welcome them in their comings and goings. Near and far, none shall fail to bow in reverence and serve their destined forms.

Disciples must sever all dealings with the mundane, avoiding association with ordinary people, lest they tread the filth of life and death, offend the true numina, consume the five pungent foods, fill their stomachs with turbid qi, deplete their essence and spirit, expose themselves to the Three Luminaries, and slight the Jade Dawn. Such transgressions invite self-inflicted calamity, bringing ruin upon their destined forms. This warning is given in earnest; heed it with care.

Those who receive the *Luminous Statutes* must not recklessly discuss scriptures with ordinary students, debate ancient mysteries, or presume to comprehend the utmost Real. To recklessly transmit or divulge the source of the Dao, or show it to worldly people, shall bring calamity upon their seven generations of ancestors and their dead souls, consigning them to eternal atonement at the River Source, their forms enslaved in the Nine Dark Realms, their suffering beyond words.

Those who receive and uphold the supreme methods and cultivate the *Luminous Statutes* must, on the eight solar terms and their own life-destiny days, purify themselves with fasting, burn incense, and repent before the Imperial Lord to absolve their sins in the Nine Yin and dissolve the Seven Mysteries. On the days of *Lichun* and the Spring Equinox, light nine lamps in the central courtyard; on *Lixia* and the Summer Solstice, light three lamps; on *Liqiu* and the Autumn Equinox, light seven lamps; on *Lidong* and the Winter Solstice, light five lamps; and on their life-destiny day, light twelve lamps. At midnight, place the lamps outdoors, facing east on *Lichun* and the Spring Equinox, south on *Lixia* and the Summer Solstice, west on *Liqiu* and the Autumn Equinox, north on *Lidong* and the Winter Solstice, and toward the Year Star on their life-destiny day. Knock their teeth twenty-four times and softly recite the incantation:

*Supreme and Most True, Ten Thousand Sage Thearchs,
Five Thearchs and Jade Controllers, Overseers of All Immortals,
On this auspicious day of the eight solar terms,
We declare the dissolution of yang sins and yin punishments,
Sever the Nine Yin, forever absolve the Seven Mysteries,
Escape the fiery realms, forever leave the Mountain of Knives,
The Three Wretched Realms and Five Sufferings shall not burden my form.
May I be as enduring as Heaven and Earth, forever safeguarded by the Imperial Dawn.
May the Five Vows and Eight Assemblies be fulfilled as spoken.*

Upon completion, remove their headscarf, bow their head one hundred twenty times, touching their forehead to the ground without causing pain. Then, replace the headscarf, gaze upward, and silently recite: *“Today, my form receives the grace of Heaven’s favor, bestowed upon my mortal frame, to be reborn as a flying immortal.”* Conclude by swallowing twenty-four breaths of qi. After three years of such practice, all past transgressions shall be eradicated, their form shall become one with the Real, they shall not tread the Five Sufferings, escape the fiery realms, and attain the status of a true person, freely roaming their destined abode. This is a wondrous formula; guard it well and do not transmit it lightly.

The Four Poles are governed by the Four Directional and Five Thearch Jade Controller Lords, who universally oversee all realms—without height or depth, shallowness or profundity, and through boundless kalpas. None escape their comprehensive judgment of good and evil, for all fortunes and misfortunes are bound to the Jade Controller Lords.

The innumerable officials across the Four Directions and Eight Domains—are they not all designations of the Jade Controller and Wandering Controller Lords?

*Tai Xuan Upper Palace’s Nü Qing Four Poles Bright Statutes and Ordinances*

The Azure Thearch Jade Controller Lord, surnamed Liang, personal name Shu Du, wears a flying azure feathered robe adorned with nine-colored phoenix insignia, a Nine Primordial Treasure Crown upon his head, and holds a nine-colored staff. He governs the Eastern Grand Brightness Yang Terrace Grotto-Heaven, the August Mystery Capital’s Nü Qing Upper Palace, and commands the Eastern Marchmount Mount Tai’s officials, the earth spirits, water essences, and the Azure Armored Host. The Eastern Pole’s Boundless Metal-less Heaven, the innumerable kalpas, and the infinite, inexhaustible offices all fall under the jurisdiction of the Azure Thearch Jade Controller Lord. He presides over the life and death of beings; those who know his name and invoke his spirit through nine years of cultivation shall attain azure clouds and a flying canopy to welcome their destined form.

The *Tai Xuan Capital Four Poles Bright Statutes* state: Should the Supreme Jade Clarity Grand Perfected Thearch Emperor violate the statutes’ provisions, his name shall be stricken from the Imperial Register, and he shall be demoted to a Wandering Dispersed Perfected Thearch, governing the Great Clarity’s Central Palace for seven hundred years, with promotion contingent upon merit.

The *Tai Xuan Capital Four Poles Bright Statutes* state: Should an Upper Clarity Perfected Person neglect the affairs of the Thearch, slacken in duty, shirk their true office, or leak sacred formulas, bestowing them upon the unworthy, their name shall be stricken from the Register of Upper Perfected Ones, and they shall be demoted to serve as the Chief of the Five Marchmounts’ Hosts for a thousand years, with promotion contingent upon diligence.

The *Tai Xuan Capital Four Poles Bright Statutes* state: Should one who has received the title of Upper Prime Lady or the appellation of Primordial Lord neglect the affairs of the Thearch, shirk imperial duties, exceed proper decorum, disrupt courtly observances, or recklessly divulge celestial treasures, their name shall be stricken from the Register of Perfected Thearchs, their Purple Void rank revoked, and they shall be relegated to the Middle Mystery’s Qingwei Wandering Dispersed Spirit Officials for seven hundred years, with promotion contingent upon diligence.

The *Tai Xuan Capital Four Poles Bright Statutes* state: Should one who has received the title of Flying Immortal of the Five Marchmounts fail in their imperial duties, shirk their immortal office, or show contempt for the Dao’s texts, their name shall be stricken from the Register of Orthodox Immortals, and they shall be demoted to serve as the Chief of the Three Offices’ Hosts for two thousand four hundred years, with promotion contingent upon diligence.

The *Tai Xuan Capital Four Poles Bright Statutes* state: Should any who hold the positions of the Five Thearchs’ Four Controllers, Three Offices’ Chiefs, or Hosts of the Offices neglect their proper duties, delay or neglect their tasks, disregard celestial statutes, abandon imperial affairs, impose unjust punishments, provoke grievances from spirits, or act with reckless impropriety, their orthodox and true ranks shall be revoked, and they shall be demoted to serve as Clerks of the Hosts’ Command for three thousand six hundred years, with promotion contingent upon diligence.

The *Tai Xuan Capital Four Poles Bright Statutes* state: The Yellow Writ and Red Realm, the Dao of True Unity—these minor arts of union and the secret matters of the Dao’s hands are subtly perilous. They involve the convergence and separation of the Two Images, the harmonization of the Three Qi, the resolution of turbid calamities, the dissolution of misfortune, the refinement of essence to nourish the spirit, and the attainment of deathlessness. Those who receive these methods yet harm the orthodox qi, indulge in desire, act with impurity and excess, harbor jealousy and doubt, attack their masters, or engage in slander face the gravest prohibitions. Should one violate these prohibitions, both they and their seven ancestors shall jointly endure the punishments of the Left and Right Palaces: treading mountains of fire, bearing stones to fill rivers, and suffering the Three Paths and Five Sufferings through three trials before being consigned to eternal servitude as ghostly laborers.

The Upper Palace *Nüqing* Precepts—those who receive them must observe them with clarity and caution.

The *Mingke* of the Four Poles of the Great Mystery Capital states: The great characters of the Upper Clarity Heavenly Sovereign, Earthly Sovereign, and Human Sovereign all encompass wondrous and subtle methods of profound emptiness, the treasured texts of the Cavernous Origin, and writings of numinous power. From the absence of a golden name in the Square Tablets of the Azure Palace, none may know or hear of them. Those who possess these texts shall immediately become earthly immortals, ascend to the mysterious void, and attain the rank of immortal ministers. Yet should they treat the celestial perfected with disdain, divulge the sacred treasures, transmit them to the unworthy, defile them with impurity, or fail in reverence to reveal them, violating these prohibitions, their seven ancestors shall undergo interrogation and be consigned to the Right Palace, enduring the trials of treading fire mountains, bearing stones to fill rivers, and suffering the Three Paths and Five Sufferings through one ordeal before being transformed into inhuman forms. Their own persons shall be consigned to the punishments of the Left Palace, treading fire mountains, enduring the Three Paths and Five Sufferings through three ordeals, and thereafter serving eternally as ghostly laborers.

The Upper Palace *Nüqing* Precepts of the Northern Emperor—those who receive them must observe them with clarity and caution.

The *Mingke* of the Four Poles of the Great Mystery Capital states: The *Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Upper Scriptures*, the great and minor kalpas, the Five Talismans, the Jade Instructions, the treasured texts of Upper Clarity, and the Dao of the Mysterious Cavern—from the absence of jade bones and the mysterious chart, or a name inscribed in purple characters, none may see or hear of them. Those who possess these texts shall have jade lads and jade maidens attend them. They must burn incense and prostrate themselves as if serving a sovereign father, purify themselves in fasting and recite the scriptures, thereby ascending upon cloud chariots, feasting in the radiance of the Five Marchmounts, and presiding over the numinous mountains. Yet should they fail in reverence, defile and disdain the true texts, recklessly reveal and disseminate them, or transmit them to the unworthy, violating these prohibitions, their seven ancestors shall be interrogated and consigned to the Right Palace, enduring the trials of the Lesser Fire Mountain, the Three Paths, and the Five Sufferings through two ordeals before being reborn into inhuman forms. Their own persons shall be consigned to the interrogations of the Left Palace, enduring the punishments of treading fire mountains, bearing stones to fill rivers, and suffering the Three Paths and Five Sufferings through three ordeals before serving eternally as ghostly laborers in the boundless darkness of the netherworld.

The Upper Palace *Nüqing* Precepts of the Northern Emperor—those who receive them must observe them with clarity and caution.

The *Mingke* of the Four Poles of the Great Mystery Capital states: The thirty-nine chapters of the *Highest Cavernous Perfected Scripture*, the *Subtle and Numinous Great Possession Scripture*, the *Jade Tallies of the Feminine One and the Five Elders*, the *Purple Writings of the Golden Flower Cavern Chamber*, the *Original Register of Mount Tortoise*, the *Golden Root Upper Scripture of the Azure Register and White Tablet*, and the *Jade Chapters of the Great Empyrean*—these thirty-one volumes of the Upper Palace’s treasured texts are the independent instructions of the Dao of the Radiant Jade Mystery. The treasured texts of the Cavernous Heaven and Jade Clarity are conferred upon those who have already become perfected persons, possessing golden bones and jade viscera, their names inscribed on the imperial tablets and recorded in the Purple Court, thereby gaining access to these writings. Those who receive them shall have jade lads and jade maidens attend them; they must burn incense at their sides, prostrate themselves morning and evening as if serving a sovereign father, maintain perpetual fasting in the mysterious peaks, and recite the numinous chapters, thereby immediately summoning cloud chariots, ascending to Jade Clarity, attaining the golden gates, and sharing the same carriage as the Emperor. Yet should they receive these texts without reverence, violate the precepts through negligence, disbelieve in the celestial perfected, recklessly divulge the sacred instructions, or reveal the holy texts to the world, causing them to be seen and heard, they shall be reported by the jade lads, and their seven generations of ancestors shall be interrogated and consigned to the Right Palace, enduring the punishments of the Fire Mountain and the Three Paths, suffering the Five Sufferings through two ordeals before being reborn into inhuman forms. Their own persons shall be interrogated and consigned to the Left Palace, enduring the punishments of treading fire mountains, bearing stones to fill rivers, and suffering the Twenty-Four Hells, the Three Paths, and the Five Sufferings through three ordeals before serving eternally as ghostly laborers in the boundless darkness of the netherworld.

The Upper Palace *Nüqing* Precepts of the Northern Emperor—those who receive them must observe them with clarity and caution.

The *Mingke* of the Four Poles of the Great Mystery Capital states: The *Six Celestial Palaces of the Great Possession of Upper Clarity* and their protocols of reverence and deference, the three hundred volumes of the treasured scriptures of the Upper Dao, the nine thousand words of jade instructions, and the seven thousand talismanic chapters—these treasured texts of Jade Clarity are concealed within the Palace of the Numinous Capital of the Most High, in the Purple Chamber of the Seven Radiant Ones, and transmitted to those who have already become perfected persons, possessing mysterious names and imperial charts inscribed in purple characters of Jade Clarity. Those who gain access to these texts shall have jade lads and jade maidens attend them. They must burn incense and prostrate themselves as if serving a sovereign father, refrain from impurity and defilement, and avoid disdain and negligence, thereby immediately summoning cloud chariots and ascending to heaven in broad daylight. Yet should they recklessly divulge these texts, defile and disdain the celestial treasures, critique and expound upon the numinous chapters, or recklessly reveal them to the unworthy, their seven ancestors shall be interrogated and consigned to the Right Palace, enduring the punishments of the Twenty-Four Hells and the Three Paths through two ordeals before being reborn into inhuman forms. Their own persons shall be interrogated and consigned to the Left Palace, enduring the punishments of treading fire mountains through three ordeals before bearing stones to fill rivers and serving eternally as ghostly laborers in the Three Paths and Five Sufferings of the boundless darkness.

The Upper Palace *Nüqing* Precepts—those who receive them must observe them with clarity and caution.

The *Mingke* of the Four Poles of the Great Mystery Capital states: The *Scripture of the Golden Liquor of Upper Clarity*, the *Nine Cauldrons Divine Chart*, the *Cinnabar of Langgan, Frost Ascending and Snow Arising, the Four Jewels and the Crimson Essence Producing the Purple Elixir, the Concealed Radiance Numinous Pellets*, the *Great Elixir of the Nine Transformations of the Great One Immediately Perfected*, and the *Central Record of the Transmutation of Embryonic Essence*—these one hundred and forty volumes constitute the Dao of ascending transformation for middle perfected ones. They are conferred upon those destined to become perfected persons, possessing golden names in the Square Tablets Palace, who are thus entitled to receive these scriptures. Those who obtain them shall refine the elixir to perfection, undergo seventy-four transformations, ride the void and mount the clouds, ascend to Upper Clarity, and immediately produce the five colors of purple and yellow, gold and silver. They must keep these methods secret and cultivate them in seclusion. They must not treat the celestial perfected with disdain, negligence, or defilement, nor recklessly reveal the numinous texts to the vulgar. Those who violate these prohibitions shall be interrogated and consigned to the Left Palace, enduring the punishments of the Wind Blade and the trials of this world, and upon death, serving as stone-bearers through one ordeal before being reborn among the barbarian tribes.

The Upper Palace *Nüqing* Precepts—those who receive them must observe them with clarity and caution.

The *Mingke* of the Four Poles of the Great Mystery Capital states: The *Divine Charts of the True Forms of the Five Marchmounts* came into being together with heaven and earth. They are placed in the Palace of the Cavernous Court in the Thirty-Second Heaven and reside in the abodes of the perfected flying immortals. Above them grow the divine herbs and jade mushrooms that grant deathlessness.

Those who obtain these charts shall have the Five Thearchs dispatch jade lads and jade maidens to serve as their attendants. Should one treat them with disdain or recklessly disclose them, offending the perfected numina, the jade lads shall report the transgression, and the offender shall be interrogated and consigned to the Fire Bureau, enduring the punishments of fire. Their scriptures shall be burned, and upon death, they shall suffer the trials of the Fiery Realm.

Those who bear these texts shall have a radiant orb manifest above their necks, illuminating the Ten Heavens, enabling them to soar through the Great Void and ascend to heaven by riding emptiness.

One must maintain prolonged fasting in secluded groves, relinquish the abandoned body, and reverently venerate the scriptures. One must not defile oneself with filth, treat the celestial perfected with disdain, recklessly disclose them, or rashly show them to ordinary people.

Those who violate these prohibitions shall be examined by the Three Officials, punished with wind-knives, and suffer five calamities in this life. In death, they shall be consigned to the Knife Mountain and Fire Feeding, enduring the twenty-four hells and the Three Wretched Paths. After three interrogations, they shall pass through, but remain eternally burdened with ghostly debts, bound to this fate in both life and death.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mystery Metropolis* state: The *Scripture of the Azure Tooth’s First Growth*, the *Scripture of the Cinnabar Radiance’s Dao-Essence*, and the *Method of Gathering Flowers to Restore Youth*—these three scrolls were cultivated by the Queen Mother of the West and transmitted to the Master of the Great Valley, the Perfected Yellow Lad, the Master of Valley Aspiration, and the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate. One copy is now sealed within Mount Tai.

According to the statutes, three transmissions are permitted every seven thousand years. If one bears a mystic name inscribed on the Purple Tablet, they may receive these texts. Should a qualified recipient appear within a hundred years, three transmissions are also permitted. The covenant requires twenty feet of crimson silk, three pairs of gold rings, and a thirty-four-day joint retreat by master and disciple before transmission through sworn alliance. Two jade lads and two jade maidens are assigned to the recipient.

Should one violate the covenant or transgress the statutes, a third offense nullifies merit and severs the path to transcendence. A fifth offense results in death and descent into the Five Sufferings of hell, followed by rebirth into the path of non-human existence across ten thousand kalpas.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mystery Metropolis* state: The *Jade Scripture of the Golden Chamber’s Life-Span Extension, the Rejuvenating Three Radiances*, was received by the Perfected King of the Nine Heavens. It contains the spontaneous oral instructions of the Empty Cavern and is concealed within the Palace of Great Existence atop the Nine Heavens, upon the Seven-Treasure Terrace of Golden Radiance. Three hundred golden transcendents, jade lads, and maidens of the Great Flower burn incense and attend the Perfected.

The August High Sage of the Primordial Sovereign, the Supreme Perfected of the Myriad Transcendents, the Great Dao Lord of the Supreme Ultimate, the Purple August Master, the Three Origin Ladies, the Queen Mother of the West, the Lady of the Upper Origin, the Supreme Emperor, the Celestial Emperor, the Emperor of the Supreme Polarity, the Emperor of the Golden Watchtower, the Azure Lad of the High Minister, and the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate—all received this text from the Perfected King of the Nine Heavens.

This is the foundational origin of the scholar of the Dao and the wondrous sound of the quest for life. Even if one retreats into secluded mountains, severs grain, and fasts, practicing the Dao ten thousand times without encountering this text, it will bring no benefit to the spirit—indeed, transcendence will never be attained. Though its oral instructions are few, their scope is vast; thus, it is concealed within the Nine Heavens and not circulated in the world.

The ancient statutes permit transmission once in ten thousand kalpas. Those whose golden names are inscribed in the Registers of the Jade Clarity, whose purple characters adorn the Emperor’s chart, whose jade-like bones conceal golden essence, and who encounter a Perfected within seven hundred years may receive three transmissions. The covenant requires eight taels of refined gold, ninety feet each of five-colored silk, five pairs of gold rings, and a ninety-day joint retreat by master and disciple. The transmission is conducted on the southern face of a sheer cliff, invoking the sun and moon in sworn alliance. Thirty-six jade lads and thirty-six jade maidens are assigned to the recipient.

Upon obtaining this text, the Five Marchmounts’ bureaus will welcome the recipient, and the Jade Bureau will inscribe their name. Without further cultivation, they will spontaneously attain transcendence.

Should one violate the statutes or betray the covenant, a first offense nullifies merit and severs the path to transcendence. A third offense extends punishment to seven generations of ancestors and to the offender’s own person, subjecting them to the trials of the left and right bureaus: the labor of the Knife Mountain and the Fire Maw, the Twenty-Four Hells, and the Three Paths and Five Sufferings. Only after three interrogations may they pass, thereafter enduring the eternal labor of bearing stones to fill the rivers.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mystery Metropolis* state: The *Hidden Writ of the Inner Vision of the Jade Radiance and Purple Glow* was received by the August Lord of the Azure Essence and concealed within the Palace of the Purple Tenuity, in the Jade Chamber of the Three Treasures’ Mysterious Terrace. Five hundred jade lads and five hundred jade maidens attend as guards.

The Great Dao Lord of the Supreme Ultimate, the Four Controllers and Five Emperors of the Purple Yang Transcendent Metropolis, the Nine August Emperors of the Golden Watchtower, and the Azure Lad of the High Minister cultivated this text. The Perfected of the Western City sealed one copy within the Cavern of Mount Wei, amid the Empty Brilliance of Great Existence.

The ancient statutes permit transmission once in ten thousand kalpas. Those whose names are inscribed in the Purple Registers and whose golden names are listed in the Emperor’s chart may receive three transmissions if they encounter a qualified recipient within seven hundred years. The covenant requires a hundred feet of purple silk, thirty-two feet of azure silk, and two pairs of gold rings. The transmission is conducted after a retreat invoking the Three Realms in sworn alliance. Thirty-four jade lads and maidens are assigned to the recipient.

Upon obtaining this text, one’s eyes will regain their luminous essence, and one’s face will assume a purple glow.

Should one violate the statutes or betray the covenant, a first offense nullifies merit and severs the path to transcendence. A third offense extends punishment to seven generations of ancestors and to the offender’s own person, subjecting them to the trials of the left and right bureaus: the Knife Mountain and the Fire Maw, the Twenty-Four Hells, and the Three Paths and Five Sufferings across ten thousand kalpas. Only after enduring these may they return, thereafter enduring the eternal labor of bearing stones to fill the rivers.

The Precepts of the Female Azure of the Lower Palace of the Mystery Metropolis—let the recipient observe them with clarity and caution.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mystery Metropolis* state: The *Jade Scripture of Dissolving Form and Pursuing Transformation through Flowing Radiance* was established at the inception of the Nine Heavens, wherein the mysterious writ is preserved.

The Venerable of the Primordial Beginning received it from the Ninefold Mystery Heaven and transmitted it to the Master of the Primordial August, the Twenty-Four Emperors of the August Jade Dawn, the Great Dao Lord of the Supreme Ultimate, the Lord of the Upper Prohibition, the Three Origin Ladies, the Queen Mother of the Purple Tenuity, the Primordial Lady of the Great Simplicity, the Supreme Emperor, the Celestial Emperor, the Emperor of the Supreme Polarity, the Emperor of the Golden Watchtower, and the Azure Lad of the High Minister. The Azure Lad sealed one copy within the Cavern of Kunlun.

The ancient statutes permit transmission once in ten thousand kalpas. Those whose golden names and jade characters correspond to the Mysterious Chart may receive three transmissions if a qualified recipient appears within a thousand years. The covenant requires ten taels of purple gold, forty feet of purple silk, forty feet of azure silk, one gold fish, one jade dragon, and two pairs of gold rings. The transmission is conducted after invoking the Nine Heavens in sworn alliance, with master and disciple observing a hundred-day joint retreat facing north.

Each shall be granted ten jade lads and ten jade maidens. Upon receiving this scripture, one shall instantly command ten thousand transformations, riding clouds and treading radiance to soar through the Great Void. Should one violate the covenant and betray its trust, a first offense shall sever merits and cut short affairs; a third offense shall extend to seven generations of ancestors, parents, and oneself, consigning all to the Knife Mountain and Fire Realm, the Twenty-Four Hells, and the trials of the Three Paths and Five Sufferings. Only after ten thousand kalpas may one return, forever bound to the servitude of lowly ghosts. This is the *Lüwen* of the Female Azure Law from the Lower Palace of the Mysterious Capital. Let the recipient observe it with clarity and caution. The *Mingke* of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital states: The *Shangqing Huanchen Guitong Minghui*, received by the Lord of the Purple Void of the Middle Mystery, is a chapter of the Primordial Void’s generation, transmitted to the Jade Lads of the Three Heavens. The Primordial Simplicity’s Lady of Purple Essence sealed one copy within the Caverns of Mount Emei. The ancient statutes permit transmission once in seven thousand kalpas. If one bears a golden name from the Eastern Flower and is recorded in the Registers of the Upper Clarity, and such a person appears within a hundred years, three transmissions may be granted. The covenant requires five taels of purple gold, fifty feet of brocade silk, with master and disciple observing a joint retreat of ninety days before invoking the Northern Emperor for transmission. Each shall be granted twelve jade lads and twelve jade maidens. Upon receiving this scripture, one’s eyes shall gleam with the radiance of revolving essence. Should one violate the covenant and breach its trust, a first offense shall sever merits and cut short affairs; a third offense shall extend to seven generations of ancestors and oneself, consigning all to the trials of the Left and Right Offices, the Knife Mountain and Fire Feast, the Twenty-Four Hells, and the Three Paths and Five Sufferings for ten thousand kalpas. One shall forever be bound to the servitude of lowly ghosts, bearing stones to fill the River of Night. This is the *Lüwen* of the Female Azure Law from the Lower Palace of the Mysterious Capital. Let the recipient observe it with clarity and caution. The *Mingke* of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital states: The *Purple Phoenix Red Writ* and the *Eight Radiance Morning Chart*, two scrolls received by the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, were bestowed upon the Celestial Emperor, the Emperor of the Supreme Polarity, the Lady of the Upper Primordial, the Three Ladies of the Primordial Simplicity, and the Azure Lad, who sealed one copy within the Caverns of Mount Weiyu. The ancient statutes permit three transmissions in seven thousand years. If one bears a golden name from the Eastern Flower and is recorded in the Registers of the Upper Clarity, and such a person appears within a hundred years, transmission may be granted. The covenant requires ten taels of superior gold, one gold fish, one jade dragon, and one jade tablet twelve inches in length, with which to swear an oath to the Nine Heavens. Master and disciple shall observe a joint retreat of ninety or thirty days before invoking the Northern Emperor for transmission. Each shall be granted ten jade lads and ten jade maidens. Upon beholding this scripture, one shall whip dragons to drive through the void, ascending to the Seven Jeweled Terrace of the Jade Capital. Should one violate the statutes and transgress the precepts, one shall be examined by the Left and Right Offices, extending to seven generations of ancestors, consigning all to the trials of the Knife Mountain and Fire Feast. After two rebirths, one may return, forever bound to the servitude of ghosts. This is the *Lüwen* of the Female Azure Law from the Lower Palace of the Mysterious Capital. Let the recipient observe it with clarity and caution. The *Mingke* of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital states: The *Precious Cavern Soaring Empyrean Absolute Gold Chapter*, received by the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, was sealed upon the towering terrace of the Jade Capital Mountain, within the Nine-Bend Chamber, where three hundred jade maidens of the Upper Palace attend and burn incense. The ancient statutes permit transmission once in seven thousand years. If one possesses golden bones and a jade viscera, with a name listed in the Azure Palace, and such a person appears within three hundred years, transmission may be granted. The covenant requires ten taels of superior gold, forty feet of white silk, one gold fish, one jade dragon, with master and disciple observing a joint retreat of twenty-seven days before invoking the Northern Emperor for transmission. Each shall be granted ten jade lads and ten jade maidens. Upon obtaining this scripture, a thousand demons shall be subdued, and ten thousand spirits shall lose their forms. Should one violate the statutes and transgress the precepts, a third offense shall sever merits and cut short affairs, forever barring one from immortality; a fifth offense shall extend to seven generations of ancestors and oneself, consigning all to the custody of the Left and Right Offices, the Knife Mountain and Fire Realm, the Twenty-Four Hells, and the Three Paths and Five Sufferings. After three rebirths, one may return, forever barred from the path of humanity. This is the *Lüwen* of the Female Azure Law from the Lower Palace of the Mysterious Capital. Let the recipient observe it with clarity and caution.

The *Mingke* of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital states: All Upper Scripture and Precious Writs of the Jade Clarity are bestowed upon those whose destiny aligns with the Dao and whose bones bear the marks of immortality. One must abandon home, forsake wife, wander the Five Marchmounts, dwell in mountain forests in perpetual retreat, meditate with earnest devotion, consume only the purest fare, drink plain water from a single gourd, endure neither toil nor cold, and remain unwavering from dawn to dusk. Only then shall one move the Emperors and Sovereigns, prompting the Jade Bureau to dispatch messengers. The Three Primordials shall visit one’s chamber, and after three years, one shall whip a carriage through the Mysterious Void, ascending to the Great Clarity. Should one treat these scriptures with disdain, defile their sacredness, or recklessly disclose them, allowing the world to witness them, violating the covenant and betraying the oath, calamity shall extend to the seven ancestral souls and one’s own, consigning all to the trials of the Left and Right Offices. One shall ascend the Knife Mountain, feed on fire and devour coals, endure the Twenty-Four Hells and the Three Paths and Five Sufferings. Only after ten thousand kalpas may one return, forever bound to the servitude of ghosts, bearing the stones of Mount Meng to fill the River of Night. This is the *Lüwen* of the Female Azure Law from the Lower Palace of the Mysterious Capital. Let the recipient observe it with clarity and caution.

The *Mingke* of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital states: Should one receive the Precious Scriptures of the Upper Clarity through karmic encounter and be fortunate enough to behold sacred writs, yet be unable to abandon worldly ties, forsake home, and enter the mountains, one may remain in the world with a heart reverent and intent, spiritually inclined toward the Mysterious and Numinous. One shall establish a separate chamber to enshrine a copy, burning incense morning and evening, bowing in reverence upon entering and exiting, as if serving a sovereign or father. In matters of supplication, all shall be granted as desired. Heaven shall dispatch jade lads and jade maidens to attend and guard this scripture, observing one’s heart. With sincere devotion, the spirits shall naturally respond, fulfilling every wish: warding off disasters, repelling misfortunes, subduing ten thousand demons, vanquishing a thousand spirits, bringing wealth and prosperity, elevating official rank, ensuring descendants flourish like a forest of gold and jewels. After seven years of diligent practice, a perfected one shall descend to one’s chamber, commune with the spirits, and transmit essential teachings. Without study, one shall spontaneously attain mastery; without toil, one shall ascend as an immortal. Thus, those who pursue the Dao while amidst the three armies are of this kind. Should one encounter these teachings and refuse them, it is merely one’s fate. Should one receive them yet lack faith, it is to forfeit one’s destiny.

To treasure yet lack faith is truly a sin. When these three—faith, treasure, and practice—are as one, the Seven Mysteries and one’s own person shall be examined by the Left and Right Bureaus. Those found wanting shall be punished with the Knife Mountain, the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, the Nine Calamities and Eight Adversities, and after ten thousand kalpas, shall attain a birth that leads not to the Dao.

The *Lüwen* of the Lower Palace of Xuandu, recorded by the Lady of Azure, must be received with clarity and reverence, and practiced with utmost care.

Here ends *Scroll Two of the Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles of the Jade Emperor of the Great Perfection*.
*Scroll Three of the Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles of the Jade Emperor of the Great Perfection*
*The Lüwen of the Left Palace of Xuandu, Recorded by the Lady of Azure of the Four Poles*

The Lord of the Jade Bureau of the Red Emperor, surnamed Jade, personal name Jingdu, wears a crimson robe adorned with nine-colored phoenix emblems. Upon his head rests the *Pingtian Feishen Jade Crown*, and in his hand, he holds the nine-colored staff. He governs the Grotto-Heaven of the Southern Vermilion Yang Terrace in the Great Mystery Capital. The Lady of Azure of the Left and Right Bureaus of Xuandu oversees the immortal officials of Mount Heng in the Southern Marchmount, the earth spirits, water essences, and the armies of the Red and Fire realms.

The Southern Pole’s boundless heavens, beyond measure in kalpas, the infinite and limitless bureaus, all statutes governing the perfected ones of the upper realms, are subject to the Lord of the Jade Bureau of the Red Emperor. He presides over the life and death of beings. Those who know his name, visualize his spirit, and cultivate for nine years shall obtain the divine herb and jade fungus of immortality. Crimson clouds and purple mists shall descend to welcome their form, ascending to the Jade Clarity Palace.

The *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles of the Great Mystery Capital* state: *The Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, the primordial and spontaneous jade stanzas of the Highest Nine August Lords of the Dao, also called *The Scripture of the Great Perfection* or *The Dragon Book of the Three Heavens*. It is concealed within the Heaven of Great Possession, in the Jade Chamber of the Nine Mysteries, attended by three thousand jade lads and maidens who burn incense and guard its numen. It was transmitted to the Central Yellow Venerable Lord.

By ancient statute, it is transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas. If one bears the mystic name and imperial chart, inscribed on purple slips in green characters, a person of jade concealment and golden bones, they may receive three transmissions within a thousand years. The covenant requires ten taels of gold, twenty-five catties of bronze, five pairs of gold buttons, one gold fish, one jade dragon, one tael of azure silk. Master and disciple shall face north, fasting together for a hundred days—or ninety, or thirty—binding the gold buttons, and transmitting the scripture only after swearing the covenant.

Twenty-four jade lads of the Golden Dawn and thirty-six jade maidens of the Western Florescence attend the scripture, burning incense. Those who receive this text and recite it ten thousand times shall ascend at once to the Upper Clarity, deliver their seven ancestors, and be reborn as immortals of the Southern Mystery. Should one violate the covenant or transgress the precepts, a single offense shall nullify all merit and sever their affairs. Ten thousand shall not attain immortality. Three offenses shall extend to their seven ancestors and themselves, all subjected to the examination of the Left and Right Bureaus, punished with the Knife Mountain, consigned to the fire to devour coals, the twenty-four hells, the Three Paths and Five Sufferings. Only after three trials may they pass, condemned to labor eternally as lower ghosts, bearing stones to fill the rivers. The jade lads and maidens shall reclaim the scripture and return it to the Upper Palace.

The *Lüwen of the Left and Right Bureaus of Xuandu, Recorded by the Lady of Azure*, must be received with clarity and reverence, and practiced with utmost care.

The *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles of the Supreme Mystery Capital* state: *The Treasure Scripture of the Five Elders of the Feminine One’s Jade Seal*, a numinous scripture of purple script, the Dao of the Radiant Mystery of the Highest, cultivated by the Lord of the Highest Emperor. It embodies the twelve wishes of the Mystic Mothers, the eight intervals, the nine transformations, the five revolutions, and the metamorphoses of the feminine and masculine.

It was transmitted to the assembled emperors, the Lord of the Upper Prohibitions, the Three Primordial Ladies, the Queen Mother of Purple Tenuity, and the Golden Portal Emperor of the Nine Mysteries of the Latter Sage. It is concealed in the Palace of Great Possession above the Nine Heavens, within the Jade Chamber of the Numinous Terrace of the Great Mystery, inscribed on purple gold silk, its characters written in azure and green. Three thousand jade lads and maidens attend the scripture, burning incense and safeguarding its transmission.

By ancient statute, it is transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas. If one bears the mystic name and imperial chart, inscribed on purple slips in green characters, a person of golden bones and jade concealment, they may receive three transmissions within seven thousand years. The covenant requires five taels of gold, fifty bolts each of five-colored brocade, one catty of incense, three pairs of gold buttons. Master and disciple shall face north, fasting together for ninety days, and transmit the scripture only after swearing the covenant before the Northern Emperor.

Twenty-nine jade lads and twenty-seven jade maidens safeguard the numinous scripture. Those who receive this text and cultivate it ten thousand times shall ascend to the Upper Clarity. Its prohibitions are especially weighty; it must not be transmitted recklessly. Should one violate the covenant or break faith, a single offense shall nullify all merit and sever their affairs. Ten thousand shall not attain immortality. Three offenses shall extend to their seven ancestors and themselves, all subjected to the examination of the Left and Right Bureaus, punished with the Knife Mountain and fire, condemned to labor as lower ghosts, bearing stones to fill the rivers. The jade lads shall reclaim the scripture and return it to the Upper Palace.

The *Lüwen of the Left Bureau of Xuandu, Recorded by the Lady of Azure*, must be received with clarity and reverence, and practiced with utmost care.

It is inscribed on jade slips, its characters engraved in gold. It was transmitted to the Lord of the Heavenly Emperor, the Lord of the Upper Primordial of the Southern Pole, the Lord of the Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity, and the Golden Portal Emperor of the Nine Mysteries of the Latter Sage. Now, one copy of each of the Three Treasure Wondrous Scriptures is sealed within Mount Tai.

The *Mingke* of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital states: The *Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected*, cultivated by the Celestial Emperor of the Great Subtle Heaven, was bound by the Eight Dao and Nine Perfected with luminous radiance, ascending the Dao of the sun and moon.

After ninety days of fasting, with an additional twenty-four days, one faces north to swear the covenant and transmit it. Seventeen jade lads and maidens each shall be assigned. After seven years of cultivating this Dao, one shall ride the clouds in flight and ascend to the Great Clarity. This method is especially weighty: two offenses shall nullify all merit and sever one’s affairs; four offenses shall extend to the seven ancestors and oneself, all subjected to the examination of the Left and Right Bureaus, punished with the Knife Mountain and fire hells, consigned to the Three Paths and Five Sufferings for ten thousand kalpas, and reborn into the realm of the inhuman. The *Lüwen* of the Left Female Azure of the Mysterious Capital must be reverently observed by the recipient.

The *Mingke* of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital states: The *Hidden Scripture of the Great Cinnabar and Cavernous Perfection*, also called the *Seven Transformations and Nine Forms of the Celestial Lord*, the *Three Degrees of the Great One and Five Essences of the Imperial Treasure*, and the *Three-Five Union of the Imperial One*, was received by the Celestial Lord of the Great One from the chapters of the Empty Mystery’s spontaneity. It is concealed within the Purple Chamber of the Six Harmonies Palace of the Most High and transmitted to the Southern Pole Primordial Lord, the Three Primordials of the Great Simplicity, and the Queen Mother of Purple Tenuity. Now, one copy is sealed within Mount Tai. By ancient statute, it emerges once in ten thousand kalpas. If one bears the Golden Name and Imperial Chart, the Green Characters on Purple Tablets, and is a person of bone and qi containing the true, they may receive three transmissions within seven hundred years. The covenant requires twenty-seven feet of azure silk, five taels of plain silk thread, two packets of blended incense, one brush, one hundred sheets of paper, and one tael of cinnabar—the unspoken oath of the Celestial Lord. Master and disciple fast together for a hundred days before swearing the covenant and transmitting it. Nine jade maidens and seven jade lads shall be assigned to attend and burn incense. After cultivating the Dao of the Five Spirits’ union for a hundred days, the perfected spirits shall descend. Within seven years, one shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight. One must not violate the statutes or transgress the covenant: a single offense shall nullify all merit and sever one’s affairs; three offenses shall extend to the seven ancestors and oneself, all subjected to the examination of the Left and Right Bureaus, punished with the Knife Mountain and fire, consigned to the twenty-four hells and the Three Paths and Five Sufferings.

The *Mingke* of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital states: The *Scripture of the Purple Crossing and Luminous Radiance of Mysterious Perfection*, the *Inner Vision of the Central Realm*, and the *Seventy-Four Methods of Upper Clarity Transformation*—three scrolls—were received from the True King of the Nine Heavens, the lofty chapters of the Nine Mysteries of the Great Palace, and are concealed within the Purple Chamber of the Numinous Capital Palace of the Most High, presided over by the Three Primordial Lords. They are transmitted once in ten thousand kalpas.

The covenant for the *Purple Crossing* requires fifty feet each of five-colored brocade, five taels of superior gold, five catties of aloeswood, one catty of true pearls, one writing knife, seven gold rings, and seventy feet of crimson silk. The covenant for the *Upper Clarity Transformations* requires forty feet of azure silk, ten taels of superior gold, six pairs of gold buttons, one catty of fine incense, one gold fish, and one jade dragon. Master and disciple fast together for ninety days, or thirty days, or nine days, before swearing the covenant and transmitting it. Twenty-four jade lads and thirty-six jade maidens shall be assigned to burn incense and attend the perfected. After a hundred days of cultivation, one shall transform into the void; after nine years, one shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight. Violating the statutes or transgressing the laws shall result in: a single offense nullifying all merit and severing one’s affairs; three offenses extending to the seven ancestors, parents, and oneself, all subjected to the examination of the Left and Right Bureaus, punished with the Knife Mountain and fire, consigned to the twenty-four hells and the Three Paths and Five Sufferings.

The *Mingke* of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital states: The *Seven Cycles and Seven Transformations of the Divine Continent Dancing in Heaven*, also called *Concealing Radiance and Hiding Form* and *Exiting Existence and Entering Non-Existence*, was received by the Purple Dawn Lord of the Supreme Sovereign Master from the chapters of the Great Void’s spontaneity.

It was transmitted to the Supreme Sovereign Lord of the Accomplished Mystery of the Clear Heaven, the Jade Lad of the Three Heavens, the True Primordial Lord of the Purple Ultimate, the Upper Primordial Lord of the Southern Pole, the Celestial Emperor of the Great Subtle Heaven, and the Later Sage of the Dao.

Master and disciple fast together for ninety days before swearing the covenant and transmitting it.

To the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, twenty-one each, they attend and burn incense. Should one violate the precepts or breach the covenant, a single transgression bars ascension to immortality for ten thousand kalpas; three transgressions condemn seven generations of ancestors and oneself to the trials of the Left and Right Bureaus, punished with the Knife Mountain and Fire Feast, the Twenty-Four Hells, and the Three Paths and Five Sufferings. Only after three examinations may one pass, then consigned eternally to the labor of bearing stones to fill the rivers. The Green Statutes of the Left Bureau of the Mysterious Capital—let the recipient observe with utmost care.

The *Luminous Precepts of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: The *Seven Scrolls of Vanquishing Demons with Wisdom*, also called the *Cavern Scripture of the Great Simplicity* or *Primal Wisdom*, were received by the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao from the primordial writings of the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning, concealed within the Jade Clarity’s tower and the Cinnabar Chamber of the Lofty Void Sovereign. Three thousand Jade Maidens of the Primal Spirit attend this scripture. Once in ten thousand kalpas it emerges. If one bears the Golden Name of the Eastern Florescence and the Green Characters of the Upper Clarity, they may receive three transmissions within seven hundred years. The covenant requires ten taels of gold, one jade tablet, one golden fish, one jade dragon, and forty feet of purple silk.

Once in ten thousand kalpas it is transmitted to the Azure Essence Emperor, the Supreme Void Sovereign of the Primordial Spirit, the Lofty Spirit of the Great Simplicity, the Cavern Observer of the Dao, the Upper Sovereign of the Southern Pole, and the Host of Emperors. Now, one copy is sealed within Mount Wangwu. If one possesses a body of golden marrow and jade bones, their name inscribed in the Emperor’s Register, they may encounter this transmission within seven hundred years and receive it thrice. The covenant requires one golden fish, one jade dragon, one hundred feet of purple silk, and forty feet of azure damask. Master and disciple fast together for one hundred days before swearing the covenant and transmitting it. Twenty-four Jade Lads and Jade Maidens each are assigned to guard the recipient’s body. After one hundred days of cultivation, one attains spirit communion and achieves perfection; after nine years, one rides the clouds to soar through the Jade Clarity. Should one violate the precepts, three transgressions bar further ascension to immortality; five transgressions condemn seven generations of ancestors, parents, and oneself to the trials of the Left and Right Bureaus, punished with the Knife Mountain and Fire Realm, the Twenty-Four Hells for ten thousand kalpas, then consigned to the labor of lesser ghosts bearing stones to fill the rivers.

The *Luminous Precepts of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: The *Heavenly Net of Flying Steps and Treading the Seven Primes*, the *Feather Scripture of White Plumes and Black Pinions for Flight*, and the *Three Celestial Diagrams of the Heavenly Pass for Transposing the Seven Stars*—these three esoteric teachings were received by the Supreme Thearch and the Celestial Emperor of the Great Subtle Heaven. They are the Dao of ascending the void, concealed within the Purple Chamber of the Lofty Spirit’s Jade Void. Two thousand four hundred Jade Maidens attend them.

The covenant requires seven taels of gold and forty feet of white silk, sworn before the Nine Heavens as a pledge of secrecy. Those who obtain these methods shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight. Those who lightly disclose or profane them shall be condemned to the Three Bureaus, sentenced to the labor of carrying stones to fill the rivers for ten thousand kalpas, thereafter reborn within the human Dao.

The *Lüwen* of the Right Bureau of the Mysterious Capital, recorded by the Maiden Qing—those who receive it must uphold it with clarity and caution.

The *Mingke of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* states: Whenever one studies the scriptures of the Highest Clarity, such as the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*, on the day of entering the chamber, one must don the ritual vestments and wear a headscarf of deerskin—or, if unavailable, one of kudzu cloth. One must drape oneself with a deerskin cloak, or, if unavailable, one of purple and azure, with purple as the outer layer and azure as the lining. The cloak should be four feet and nine inches wide, corresponding to the number of the four seasons, and five feet and five inches long, aligning with the qi of heaven and earth. The outer and inner layers follow the same rule: the outer layer should have twenty-four strips, and the inner layer fifteen, corresponding to the thirty-nine positions of the Perfected Thearchs. Thus clad in the vestments of the Thearch-Emperors, one dons the appropriate attire. Without these vestments, one must not act presumptuously. For every verse of the precious scripture chanted, the sound shall resound through the Nine Heavens, ten thousand Thearchs shall attend in audience, and the Nine Perfected shall uphold one’s position—such is no trivial matter. Those who recite the scriptures in plain garments shall be assailed by heavenly demons, their essence invaded by myriad spirits, their spirit scattered and qi dispersed. They shall perish and descend to the Dark Springs, their souls and spirits enduring hardship, forfeiting their attainment of immortality. With these ritual vestments and numinous insignia, one is attended by twelve Jade Lads and twelve Jade Maidens, who serve and guard the Perfected. These vestments must not be lent to others, nor trodden upon in impurity. Those who treat the divine vestments lightly shall, after five offenses, forfeit the right to wear them and lose all hope of immortality; after ten offenses, they shall be examined by the Left and Right Bureaus, their bodies perishing amid the torments of knife mountains and fire consumption. After ten thousand kalpas in the twenty-four hells, they shall be reborn to the labor of carrying stones.

The *Lüwen* of the Right Bureau of the Mysterious Capital, recorded by the Maiden Qing—those who receive it must uphold it with clarity and caution.

The *Mingke of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* states: Whenever women study the methods of the Highest Clarity for ascending to heaven in broad daylight, receive the precious scriptures and jade instructions, and cultivate the Great Cavern, they attain the rank of Lady of the Primordial Sovereign. On the day of entering the chamber, they must don the vestments of the Primordial Sovereign, draping themselves with a purple gauze cloak, three zhang and four chi in length, tailored to fit the body. The cloak should be made of two panels divided into sixteen strips, with twenty-three strips at the center, totaling thirty-nine strips. Additionally, a skirt of azure gauze is required, forty-five chi in length, made of eight panels, each four feet and nine inches long. The remaining fabric is used for a sash, divided into eight panels with thirty-two strips. This is the Flying Azure Skirt, the vestment of the Primordial Sovereign. When one dons these vestments, ten thousand Perfected shall gird their sashes, and a thousand demons shall vanish. Twelve Jade Lads and twelve Jade Maidens are assigned to attend and safeguard the ritual vestments. Without these vestments, one must not chant the precious scriptures of the Highest Clarity. Those who lightly recite the supreme scriptures in ordinary garments shall be assailed by heavenly demons, their essence invaded by myriad spirits, their spirit scattered and qi dispersed, forfeiting their attainment of immortality.

Should one possess the vestments of the Primordial Sovereign yet treat them with disdain, defilement, or recklessly lend them to others, five such transgressions shall sever merit and obstruct affairs, barring one from attaining immortality. Ten transgressions shall subject one to the scrutiny of the Underworld Officials, condemned to the knife mountains and fire pits, the twenty-four hells, and the ten thousand kalpas of the Three Wretched Realms, returning only to toil as a bearer of burdensome stones.

*Statutes of the Azure Maiden of the Right Palace of the Mysterious Capital—let the recipient observe with clarity and caution.*

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: When receiving the sacred scriptures of the Three Treasures or the jade instructions of the Highest Clarity, and donning the vestments of emperors and kings to enter the chamber and burn incense, one must first, outside the door, knock the teeth thrice, close the eyes, and visualize within the chamber a purple cloud of qi, dense and billowing, crowning and enveloping the body. One must then envision Jade Lads attending to the left and Jade Maidens to the right, golden light and precious mushrooms illuminating the interior and exterior. Softly recite the incantation:

*"The heavens are bright, the qi is clear,
The Three Luminaries illumine all.
Within the golden chamber’s secluded room,
Five mushrooms bloom with precious radiance.
Mystic clouds and purple canopies
Come to adorn my form.
Jade Lads and Jade Maidens,
Bestow upon me their numinous power.
The Nine Emperors align in splendor,
The Three Origins plow as one.
May I ascend in a flying canopy
To enter the Purple Court."*

Upon completion, swallow the qi thirty-nine times, then enter the chamber to perform obeisance and conduct the rites. To enter without first visualizing and communing with the Perfected, proceeding directly to bow, burn incense, or perform rituals, shall startle and offend the divine Perfected. Such actions are in vain, for the Celestial Emperor shall not heed them. The spirit shall scatter, the qi disperse, and the Inner Palace be forsaken.

Five transgressions shall bar one from attaining immortality; ten transgressions shall consign one to the jurisdiction of the Left Officials, whereupon death delivers one to hell, the ten thousand kalpas of the Three Wretched Realms, and rebirth into the paths of non-human beings.

*Statutes of the Azure Maiden of the Right Palace of the Mysterious Capital—let the recipient observe with clarity and caution.*

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: When entering the chamber to recite the *Jade Radiance Inner Scripture of the Yellow Court*, one must burn incense and purify through fasting, don the ritual vestments, enter the chamber, face north, and bow four times. Kneeling upright, knock the teeth twenty-four times and petition:

*"To the Most High, the Ten Thousand Perfected, the Jade Dawn, the Supreme Dao Lord of the Great Dao: I, [Name], now enter the chamber to recite the jade scriptures, refining the spirit and safeguarding the treasury. I beseech the flowering splendor of the Celestial Palaces, that my body may ascend on emptiness to bow before the Imperial Court."*

Upon completion, turn east, bow four times to the Supreme Emperor, knock the teeth twelve times, and petition:

*"To the Great Emperor of Fusang, the Divine King of the Yang Valley: I, [Name], now enter the chamber to recite the jade scriptures. May the chamber’s stillness cause mushrooms to sprout of their own, jade blossoms to shine with precious radiance, the Three Luminaries to illumine all, and the myriad embryonic immortals to flourish. May I attain the numinous power of the Emperor."*

Upon completion, face east to recite the scripture, ten sections constituting one cycle. After one cycle, turn north and bow four times, then face east and bow four times—no further petitions are required. Simply perform the obeisance as prescribed, adjusting the number of recitations as needed, though ten shall be the standard measure. To recite the scriptures without adhering to the proper method, disrupting the prescribed postures and gestures, is to labor in vain, offending the divine without benefit to one’s quest for immortality.

Five transgressions shall sever merit and obstruct affairs; ten transgressions shall consign the body to the trials of the Wind Knife, and upon death, to the toil of the Underworld as a ghost burdened with stones, enduring ten thousand kalpas before rebirth into the paths of non-human beings.

*Statutes of the Azure Maiden of the Right Palace of the Mysterious Capital—let the recipient observe with clarity and caution.*

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: When scholars enter the chamber to recite scriptures, they must be girded by the Five Emperors and attended by the Four Directors. They must not pause mid-recitation, converse with outsiders, omit words or phrases, or delay the Perfected with idle speech. Distracted thoughts shall dissipate focus.

Five transgressions shall sever merit and obstruct affairs, barring one from attaining immortality; ten transgressions shall subject the body to the scrutiny of the Left Officials, and upon death, to the hells, the ten thousand kalpas of the Three Wretched Realms and Five Sufferings, and rebirth into the paths of non-human beings.

*Statutes of the Azure Maiden of the Right Palace of the Mysterious Capital—let the recipient observe with clarity and caution.*

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: When reciting scriptures in the chamber, one must ensure the words flow in unbroken sequence, without omitting or skipping the celestial sounds. To lose one phrase requires reciting a hundred additional words; to lose two phrases, two hundred; to lose five phrases, five hundred. If a phrase is lost at the outset, recite the entire section again to compensate.

Ten to thirty transgressions shall sever merit and obstruct affairs, barring one from attaining immortality. Fifty to a hundred transgressions shall extend punishment to seven generations of ancestors and oneself, subjecting all to the scrutiny of the Left and Right Officials, condemned to the knife mountains and fire pits, the twenty-four hells, and the toils of the Three Wretched Realms. Only after three trials shall one be consigned to the labor of bearing stones and filling rivers.

*Statutes of the Azure Maiden of the Right Palace of the Mysterious Capital—let the recipient observe with clarity and caution.*

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: When reciting scriptures in the chamber, one must fix the gaze upon the text and the mind upon the divine Perfected, without entertaining distracting thoughts or wayward imaginings that disrupt the celestial sounds.

Ten to thirty transgressions shall sever merit and obstruct affairs, barring one from attaining immortality. Fifty to a hundred transgressions shall extend punishment to seven generations of ancestors and oneself, consigning all to the scrutiny of the Left and Right Officials, condemned to the knife mountains and fire realms, the twenty-four hells, and the ten thousand kalpas of suffering in the Three Wretched Realms and Five Torments, returning only to toil as a lowly ghost.

*Statutes of the Azure Maiden of the Right Palace of the Mysterious Capital—let the recipient observe with clarity and caution.*

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: When reciting scriptures in the chamber, one must not consume drink before completing a thousand words. From one thousand to five thousand words, one may drink once; from five thousand to ten thousand, twice; and beyond ten thousand, thrice. One must not recklessly consume food or drink to sustain the qi and voice.

Five to ten transgressions shall sever merit and obstruct affairs, barring one from attaining immortality. Ten to thirty transgressions shall subject the body to the scrutiny of the Left Officials, and upon death, to the hells for ten thousand kalpas, returning only to be reborn among the six domestic animals.

*Statutes of the Azure Maiden of the Right Palace of the Mysterious Capital—let the recipient observe with clarity and caution.*

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: When reciting ten thousand words in the chamber, should the spirit weary and the qi falter, one may pause to rest, resuming only after regaining composure to complete the recitation.

Though so, one must not leave unfinished verses overnight, thereby diminishing the celestial measures. Five to ten transgressions shall sever merit and obstruct affairs, barring one from attaining immortality. Ten to twenty transgressions shall subject the body to the scrutiny of the Left Officials, and upon death, to the hells for ten thousand kalpas, returning only to be reborn among the lowly.

*Statutes of the Azure Maiden of the Right Palace of the Mysterious Capital—let the recipient observe with clarity and caution.*

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: When reciting scriptures in the chamber, should there be male and female disciples studying together, they may share the same room, yet must occupy separate beds. Facing north to recite, men shall be positioned to the east and women to the west. They must not sit, rise, recline, or rest in a manner that mingles upon a single mat. Three transgressions shall sever merit and obstruct affairs, barring one from attaining immortality. Five transgressions shall subject the body to the scrutiny of the Left Officials, and upon death, to the hells—among the Three Wretched Paths—for ten thousand kalpas, returning only to be reborn among the six domestic animals.

*Statutes of the Azure Maiden of the Right Palace of the Mysterious Capital—let the recipient observe with clarity and caution.*

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: Whenever entering the chamber to recite the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, one must first deploy the talismans of Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance for summoning spirits and subduing demons, placing them in the five directions. Only then may one recite the precious scripture. This text issues from the True King of the Nine Heavens, bestowed by the Ten Thousand Emperors, and bears the imperial title. Without this text, one may not perform the affairs of true perfection—how much less may later disciples proceed without it? Reciting scriptures without the talisman shall fail to summon the perfected; heavenly demons shall invade the body, and the inner spirits shall not be secure, causing one’s flourishing years to wither and decay. With this talisman, heavenly perfected shall attend and protect, the Five Marchmounts shall dispatch escorts, the recitation shall resound clearly, and the Three Primes shall arrive at the chamber. Upon completing the ritual, enclose it in a brocade pouch and seal it within a golden coffer. It must not be proclaimed or lightly spoken of; to divulge the numinous text, to defile or slight the Most High Perfected, shall bring calamity upon the seven ancestors and oneself, consigning all to the Knife Mountain and Fire Feast, the Twenty-Four Hells, the Three Wretched Paths and Five Sufferings for ten thousand kalpas, and to the labor of bearing stones to fill rivers.

*Statutes of the Azure Maiden of the Right Palace of the Mysterious Capital—let the recipient observe with clarity and caution.*

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: When reciting the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, one must sit upon a square zhang of the *Shocking Spirit* mat. This text is to be rendered in blue as the ground, worn upon the body, or placed within the seat cushion. On the day of its deployment, without this text, heavenly demons shall assail the practitioner. Those possessing this text must not recklessly permit women or outsiders to sit or rise upon it. This is a secret text of the heavenly perfected, intended solely for one’s own use; it may not be shared or treated with irreverence. One transgression shall sever merit and obstruct affairs, barring one from attaining immortality. Three transgressions shall subject oneself and the seven ancestors to the scrutiny of the Left and Right Officials, punished with the trials of Knife Mountain and the Fire Realm, thrice tormented within the Twenty-Four Hells, and reduced to the labor of the lowest ghosts.

*Statutes of the Azure Maiden of the Right Palace of the Mysterious Capital—let the recipient observe with clarity and caution.*

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: Whenever entering the chamber to recite scriptures, one must sweep and purify both inner and outer spaces, ensuring all is immaculate. Burn incense, light lamps, and sever all external distractions to await the arrival of the divine. Thus shall the perfected descend to the chamber, the spirit be clear, the body luminous, and the attainment of immortality assured. To delay the spirits or violate the statutes—five transgressions shall sever merit and obstruct affairs, barring one from attaining immortality. Ten transgressions shall consign one to the hells—among the Three Wretched Paths—for ten thousand kalpas, returning only to the labor of the lowest ghosts.

*Statutes of the Azure Maiden of the Right Palace of the Mysterious Capital—let the recipient observe with clarity and caution.*

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: All implements for the veneration of the precious scriptures—tables, cloths, curtains, and canopies—must not be recklessly lent to others. Jade maidens and jade lads oversee and record these items; they may not be treated with negligence. Five transgressions shall sever merit and obstruct affairs, barring one from attaining immortality. Ten transgressions shall subject the body to scrutiny, and upon death, to the hells—among the Three Wretched Paths—for ten thousand kalpas, returning only to be reborn among the lowly.

*Scroll Four of the* Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Jade Emperor of the Great Perfected *concludes here.*

*Scroll Five of the* Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Jade Emperor of the Great Perfected
*Statutes of the Azure Maiden of the Central Palace of the Great Mysterious Capital*

The Jade Controller of the Central Yellow Emperor, surnamed Huang, personal name Zongsheng, wears a robe of yellow patterns adorned with the nine colors, and a *Tongtian Yubao Chen* crown upon his head. He governs the Central Palace of the Great Mysterious Capital, presiding over the realm beyond above and below, within and without, front and back, the boundless kalpas, and the limitless heavens. He commands the immortal officials of the Central Songgao Mountain and oversees the troops of the Five Directions’ wu and ji. All officials of the Four Controllers are subordinate to the Jade Controller. He governs the life and death of humanity; knowing his name and visualizing his spirit, and cultivating for nine years, one shall be received by a chariot of yellow mist and ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: Those possessing golden bones and jade names, inscribed in the Azure Palace, who encounter a scripture master in the world and receive the thirty-one fascicles of the *Independent Oral Instructions of the Precious Texts*, yet remain unable to renounce worldly ties and retreat to secluded mountains—constrained by worldly affairs, or lacking the resources for immortality—may still venerate and pay homage morning and evening, as one would serve a sovereign or father. Even those with spouses may cultivate the Dao of the Seven Scriptures, aligning their qi and observing the celestial measures. However, they must not disrupt the celestial balance, causing qi to scatter and spirits to depart, thereby entangling the true and perfected. The supreme perfected, the imperial effulgences, and the descendants of the Lordless Lady may descend to those of the Dao, forming celestial unions, their qi harmonizing in accordance with the cycles of destiny. How could this be sullied by the turbid and impure? Having received the supreme method yet remaining bound to the worldly path, one must seek the Seven Scriptures, follow their rites, and refrain from recklessly uniting yin and yang or defiling oneself without restraint. Should such acts occur, violating the purity of the retreat chamber—one transgression shall utterly bar one from immortality. Three transgressions shall subject oneself, the seven ancestors, and parents to the scrutiny of the Three Officials, punished with the Knife Mountain and Fire Feast, the Twenty-Four Hells, and the Three Wretched Paths and Five Sufferings for ten thousand kalpas, forever consigned to the labor of the lowest ghosts bearing stones.

The *Statutes of the Jade Maiden of the Central Palace of the Mysterious Capital* must be received with clarity, caution, and diligent observance.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: Those who study the supreme teachings and receive the precious scriptures, after approaching their master and pledging their oath, must serve and honor their master with reverence, as though attending upon the divine. When entering the chamber to burn incense, they shall first visualize the master’s presence, bow in their heart before the master, and only then proceed with the rites. The covenants of sworn oaths and the pledges of bound sashes are of utmost gravity—never to be treated lightly. Should one violate the oath or betray the pledge, assail the master’s foundation, dispute right and wrong, or forsake the old for the new, a single transgression shall sever merit and nullify all progress, barring one from immortality. Three transgressions shall extend to the seven ancestors and oneself, subjecting all to the scrutiny of the Left and Right Officials, punished with the Knife Mountain and Fire Feast, the Twenty-Four Hells, and the Three Wretched Paths and Five Sufferings for ten thousand kalpas, forever consigned to the labor of the lowest ghosts bearing stones to fill the rivers.

The *Statutes of the Jade Maiden of the Central Palace of the Mysterious Capital* must be received with clarity, caution, and diligent observance.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: Those who receive the supreme scriptures, approach their master, and ascend to pledge their oath, invoking the Nine Heavens above and swearing before the Ten Thousand Spirits below, vow to treasure, guard, and cultivate the Dao in secrecy. After the oath is sealed, one must not engage in frivolous speech or deceit, cheat fellow disciples, lure away scriptures, slander the master, fabricate baseless accusations, or recklessly reveal sacred secrets. To do so and share them with the uninitiated shall extend the sin to the seven ancestors, condemning them to boundless kalpas, treading the Knife Mountain and Fire Feast, enduring the Three Wretched Paths and Five Sufferings. In this life, one’s body shall be subjected to the torment of wind and blades, denied even the mercy of death. The sinful soul shall be consigned to the Left Official, the Knife Mountain and Fire Realm, the Twenty-Four Hells, and the Three Wretched Paths and Five Sufferings, with no hope of redemption for countless kalpas.

The *Statutes of the Jade Maiden of the Central Palace of the Mysterious Capital* must be received with clarity, caution, and diligent observance.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: Those who bear the golden name of the Eastern Palace or the purple writ of the Jade Purity, having received the precious scriptures, must transmit them in accordance with the ordained covenants. Only when one has verified that the recipient’s bone constitution aligns with immortality, their precepts are flawlessly cultivated, and their intent is fixed upon attaining the true Dao, may one then perform the purification rites, administer the oath, and transmit the teachings. Should the disciple betray their vow after transmission, the sin shall extend to the master. Three transgressions shall nullify merit and sever all progress, barring one from immortality. Five transgressions shall condemn one to death and descent into hell, suffering in the Three Wretched Paths for ten thousand kalpas, only to be reborn into the lowest of mortal paths.

The *Statutes of the Jade Maiden of the Central Palace of the Mysterious Capital* must be received with clarity, caution, and diligent observance.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: When men and women study together the Dao of the Supreme Purity, jointly serving the master, entering the chamber to fast and burn incense, and bowing in reverence, they shall proceed according to the depth of their learning, ascending in proper order. The most profound and discerning shall first receive the Three Treasures and the wondrous scriptures. Ascending the oath is of paramount importance; those of equal virtue shall be ranked by seniority. If both virtue and seniority are equal, the elder shall take precedence. All shall be judged by the loftiness of their virtue and the excellence of their talent, and the foremost among them shall be named the Master of the Great Cavern. None shall contend for precedence, refuse mutual respect, or disrupt the proper order, lest they be seized by the Four Administrations. Five transgressions shall nullify merit and sever all progress, barring one from immortality. Ten transgressions shall subject one to the scrutiny of the Left Official, condemning one to death and descent into hell, suffering in the Three Wretched Paths and Five Sufferings for ten thousand kalpas, only to be reborn into the lowest of mortal paths.

The *Statutes of the Jade Maiden of the Central Palace of the Mysterious Capital* must be received with clarity, caution, and diligent observance.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: Those who jointly serve the master and pledge the same oath must ensure their hearts and minds are harmonious, their qi and voices in accord, and their conduct unified, advancing together in equal measure. Each shall strive for the other’s attainment of the true Dao, that all may receive the master’s scriptures and ascend to heaven in broad daylight. None shall assail one another, disrupt the harmony of fellow disciples, engage in clamorous disputes, or spread groundless slander. Though bound by the same oath, if their demeanor betrays discord, if they envy those more capable, or vie for precedence, they shall become adversaries. Such enemies of enmity shall be seized by the Four Administrations.

Three violations of these precepts shall sever one’s merit and obstruct attainment, barring rebirth as an immortal. Five violations shall bring examination by the Left Bureau, punishment by blade-mountain, fire-consumption, and charcoal-devouring, confinement in the Twenty-Four Hells, and suffering in the Three Paths and Five Torments for ten thousand kalpas without reprieve.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Azure Writs of the Central Palace of the Mysterious Capital* state: Those who approach a scripture-master to pledge oaths and receive the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Supreme Clarity Treasure Scripture* and the *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles* shall, on the eight seasonal nodes, present a pair of gold rings and nine feet of azure silk to the scripture-master. The master, upon receiving these tokens, shall inscribe in sequence the names, native prefectures, counties, townships, ages, birth months, and years of all disciples on the center of the nine-foot azure silk. At the sheer cliffs of the Mysterious Peak, facing north, he shall submit the names to the Azure Palace, knock his teeth twenty-four times, and softly intone the incantation:

*"The heavens revolve, the qi retreats,
The Eight Paths convey their essence,
The Three and Five meet their destined hour,
The Nine Blessings shift in turn.
The root-truth abides in mysterious quiescence,
Assisting the imperial spirits of the throne.
The jade tablets have been presented;
Now I submit the names of the pledged.
Solemnly I notify the Nine Bureaus,
The numinous overseers of the Five Peaks,
To record those I have listed,
That they may ascend to the Jade Clarity.
After three years,
Come to welcome my embodied form,
Bestow the Eight Radiant Chariots,
And ascend to the Celestial Court of the Supreme Emperor."*

When finished, he shall bury the azure silk beneath the sheer cliff. Thus for three years, a perfected one shall descend to instruct the disciple in the Way of spirit and truth. Those who receive the regulations but fail to submit their names shall have no record in the Azure Palace; if seized by the Four Administrations, they shall incur the same penalty as those who steal scriptures or pilfer regulations. Should the master ascend as an immortal or reside too far to deliver the rings and silk, disciples shall perform the rite themselves. They must still pledge their tokens as a sign of devotion to the master, though they need not send them to the scripture-master. To miss one seasonal offering shall nullify merit and obstruct attainment, barring rebirth as an immortal. Three missed offerings shall invoke a decree from the Three Bureaus, punishment by wind-blades, and death in the hells. They shall endure the torments of the Three Paths for ten thousand kalpas and be reborn in the realm of non-humans. If the master receives the pledged tokens but fails to submit them, the penalty shall be the same.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Azure Writs of the Central Palace of the Mysterious Capital* state: Those who cultivate the Supreme Dao shall pacify the heart and still the mind, guard the truth in silence, and maintain mindfulness in all actions, treating the Dao as their very body. Through fasting, precepts, and adherence to the regulations, they shall calculate their days until attaining immortality. They must not indulge in anger, resentment, or vexation, nor harbor grudges, curse, or invoke ghosts and spirits, lest they offend the celestial statutes and bring calamity upon themselves and the examining officials. Three violations of this prohibition shall forever bar attainment of immortality; five violations shall extend punishment to the seven generations above and the self below, consigning all to the blade-mountain, fire-consumption, and charcoal-devouring hells, suffering in the Three Paths and Five Torments for ten thousand kalpas, and rebirth in the realm of non-humans.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Azure Writs of the Central Palace of the Mysterious Capital* state: Those who cultivate the Way of Supreme Clarity shall hold in their hearts all creatures—winged, crawling, born, and unborn—wishing that all attain the true Dao, achieve immortality, and that heaven’s grace be universally bestowed. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, they shall calculate their days until attaining immortality. They must not harbor thoughts of rebellion, nor harm living beings with their hands. If others surpass them, they must not wish them peril or downfall, nor prioritize malice over goodness. This prohibition is especially grave; violations shall bind them to the Left Bureau, subject their bodies to wind-blades, and extend punishment to their seven generations, all enduring the torments of blade-mountains, fire-consumption, and charcoal-devouring in the Three Paths and Twenty-Four Hells for countless kalpas without reprieve.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Azure Writs of the Central Palace of the Mysterious Capital* state: Those who cultivate the Way of Supreme Clarity shall ensure their five viscera and six bowels are pure, their inner and outer elixirs harmonized, their upper and lower essences aligned, their precious flowers interwoven, and their spirits radiant and luminous. They must not consume alcohol, lest drunkenness disrupt their organs, startle their five spirits, defile their aspirations, and prevent the completion of their practice, inviting inner illness to ravage their bodies and hasten their decay. Such cultivation is a vain labor of the heart. Five violations of this regulation shall bar rebirth as an immortal; ten violations shall extend punishment to the seven generations above and the self below, consigning all to the blade-mountain hells for ten thousand kalpas before rebirth among humans.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Azure Writs of the Central Palace of the Mysterious Capital* state: Those who receive the *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles* and the true methods of the Three Heavens, and wear the true writs, shall always prioritize bathing and washing. They must keep their footwear, clothing, and garments immaculate, avoiding filth lest the true spirits depart and malevolent forces take advantage. Five violations shall result in the revocation of their rank among the terrestrial immortals; ten violations shall bring examination by the Left Bureau, death in the hells for ten thousand kalpas, and rebirth in the realm of non-humans.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Azure Writs of the Central Palace of the Mysterious Capital* state: Disciples of the Supreme Way who receive the true methods of the Three Heavens and the *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles* must not recklessly enter defiled or polluted places, nor weep sorrowful tears or offer condolences at funerals. Five violations shall sever merit and obstruct attainment, barring rebirth as an immortal; ten violations shall result in death in the hells for ten thousand kalpas and rebirth in the realm of non-humans.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Azure Writs of the Central Palace of the Mysterious Capital* state: Disciples of the Supreme Way who receive the true methods of the Three Heavens and the *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles*, and wear the true writs, must not, when going out beneath the Three Luminaries or when sleeping, sitting, or resting, expose their heads without a kerchief or hat, nor remove their clothing to bare their forms, thereby insulting their body-spirits and dishonoring the true writs, causing the true spirits to depart and leaving only an empty corpse. Three violations shall bar rebirth as an immortal; five violations shall result in death in the hells for ten thousand kalpas and rebirth in the realm of non-humans.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Azure Writs of the Central Palace of the Mysterious Capital* state: Those who receive these precepts shall observe them with clarity and caution.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: All advanced scholars who receive the true methods of the Three Heavens and the *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles* must not recklessly share beds, seats, or rising positions with those of the yin household, nor with those whose external qi does not align with the Dao. They must not share clothing, blankets, footwear, or other items in mutual exchange. Five violations shall bar rebirth as an immortal; ten violations shall result in death in the hells, suffering the Three Paths and Five Torments for ten thousand kalpas, and rebirth in the realm of non-humans. The *Luminous Regulations of the Azure Writs of the Central Palace of the Mysterious Capital* state: Those who receive these precepts shall observe them with clarity and caution.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: All who cultivate the methods of the Highest Clarity must not face north toward their life-destiny’s position, nor relieve themselves in two places, lest they offend the Jade Morning of their nature and defile their original true essence. Five violations shall bar rebirth as an immortal; ten violations shall subject them to interrogation by the Left Bureau, death in the hells, and suffering in the Three Paths for ten thousand kalpas, followed by rebirth in the realm of non-humans. The *Luminous Regulations of the Azure Writs of the Central Palace of the Mysterious Capital* state: Those who receive these precepts shall observe them with clarity and caution.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: All who receive the precious scriptures of the Highest Clarity and cultivate the Way of the Solar and Lunar Imperial Flowers must, during solar and lunar eclipses and on the days of new and full moons—when celestial qi wages assault and the two luminaries engage in battle—adhere to the purple writs’ methods to defend and rescue them. Without these methods, one must not cultivate the Way of the Sun and Moon or practice the arts of chewing the solar root. Those who recklessly violate this prohibition shall be barred from rebirth as an immortal; five violations shall subject them to interrogation by the Left Bureau, death in the hells, and suffering in the Three Paths and Five Torments for ten thousand kalpas, followed by rebirth in the realm of non-humans. The *Luminous Regulations of the Azure Writs of the Central Palace of the Mysterious Capital* state: Those who receive these precepts shall observe them with clarity and caution.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: All who receive the precious scriptures of the Jade Clarity must first perform a declaration of purification and transmit them in accordance with the day’s covenant. If the covenant has not yet been established, one must still perform the declaration of purification before initiating the scripture, and upon its completion, perform the covenant to transmit it. To transmit the scripture without a covenant shall subject both master and recipient to interrogation by the Left and Right Bureaus, extending to seven generations of ancestors and the recipient’s own person, condemning them to the Knife Mountains and Fire Realms, the Twenty-Four Hells, and the Three Paths and Five Torments, where they shall endure three interrogations before being reborn as lower ghosts burdened with the labor of bearing stones. The *Luminous Regulations of the Azure Writs of the Central Palace of the Mysterious Capital* state: Those who receive these precepts shall observe them with clarity and caution.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: The precious scriptures of the Highest Clarity bear the heaviest prohibitions. In ancient times, they were revealed but once in ten thousand kalpas. In this degenerate age, few seek the Dao, and the Three Heavens hasten their destiny, requiring worthy ones to assist in rectification. Thus, a limit of seven hundred years is set, and they are transmitted only when the right person is encountered. If one whose bones are destined to receive the scriptures has not yet completed the seven hundred years, their name in the Azure Register and their status in the Mysterious Record remain undetermined, and they must not presume to act as a scripture master. Though they may possess jade bones and a golden storehouse, they must not recklessly transmit the scriptures. The Most High regularly dispatches officials from the Three Bureaus and the Four Divisions of Inspectors to traverse the world. Those who violate the prohibitions by leaking the scriptures shall be reported to the Azure Writs, and their seven generations of ancestors shall be seized and consigned to the Cauldron of Boiling Water in the Fire Realm. After one interrogation, their souls shall be emaciated, and they shall tread the Knife Mountains for ten thousand kalpas before being burdened with the labor of bearing stones. Their own person and those who lightly received the scriptures shall together endure the torments of the Wind and Knife in this world, suffering the punishment of being unable to die. After interrogation, they shall endure the trials of the Knife Mountains and Fire Realms, the Twenty-Four Hells, and the Three Paths and Five Torments for ten thousand kalpas before being assigned the labor of bearing stones. The *Luminous Regulations of the Azure Writs of the Central Palace of the Mysterious Capital* state: Those who receive these precepts shall observe them with clarity and caution.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: All who receive the precious scriptures of the Highest Clarity, though their allotted years have not yet expired, must, upon encountering one with golden bones and a jade storehouse—a person destined for immortality—who seeks these scriptures, transmit them to such a one through a master who knows the methods in advance. They must not obstruct the seeker’s path on the grounds that they themselves have not yet transmitted them. If one guides and transmits to three persons who are destined for the true, their merit shall move Heaven, and the Jade Emperor shall issue a special decree to the Four Bureaus to erase their names from the records of transgressions. Those who violate these prohibitions shall, upon the first violation, be barred from rebirth as an immortal; three violations shall result in death in the hells, suffering in the Three Paths and Five Torments for ten thousand kalpas, and the labor of bearing stones. The *Luminous Regulations of the Azure Writs of the Central Palace of the Mysterious Capital* state: Those who receive these precepts shall observe them with clarity and caution.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: All who receive the precious scriptures of the Highest Clarity must prepare a pledge, swearing with their heart and offering treasure to the Dao, commensurate with the oath of cutting hair and drawing blood. To receive the scriptures without a pledge is to transgress the celestial Way; to transmit the scriptures without a covenant is to leak the celestial treasure. Both transmitter and recipient must be cautious of their obligations. One violation shall bar rebirth as an immortal; three violations shall condemn seven generations of ancestors and the recipient’s own person to the Knife Mountains and Fire Realms, the Twenty-Four Hells, and the Three Paths for ten thousand kalpas before being assigned the labor of bearing stones. The *Luminous Regulations of the Azure Writs of the Central Palace of the Mysterious Capital* state: Those who receive these precepts shall observe them with clarity and caution.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* state: All who transmit the precious scriptures of the Highest Clarity and receive tokens of trust from their disciples shall divide them into three parts: one part to be cast among mountain recluses to relieve the destitute and impoverished scholars; one part to provide for their own ritual garments; and one part to establish merit for the disciple’s seven generations of ancestors, purchasing incense, oil, and the like. Thus, the three parts unite as one, and the Dao becomes luminous. On the day the offering is cast among mountain recluses, one must vow that all destitute and impoverished scholars in the world who cultivate in seclusion and endure hardship shall swiftly attain the Dao, transcend the world, ascend as immortals, escape poverty, and surmount the Eight Difficulties. On the day one dons one’s ritual garments and cap, one must vow that one’s own person shall share the same attire and cap as the Emperor, wearing the garments of the imperial law. When lighting lamps and burning incense in accordance with the imperial law, one must vow that the disciple, one’s own person, seven generations of ancestors, and parents shall escape the Knife Mountains and the hells of the Three Paths and Five Torments, ascend to the Southern Palace, return to the womb to be reborn as immortals, and in all matters follow the law to attain the true Dao. Those who violate the covenant and transgress the regulations shall be interrogated, extending to their own person and seven generations of ancestors, who shall be eternally confined in the Dark Springs, their persons enduring the Five Difficulties, and never be pardoned for ten thousand kalpas. The *Luminous Regulations of the Azure Writs of the Central Palace of the Mysterious Capital* state: Those who receive these precepts shall observe them with clarity and caution.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mystery Capital* state: All who receive the precious scriptures of the Highest Clarity, presenting their tokens of faith to their masters, must not, before fulfilling the prescribed term, accept other tokens for their own use after receiving the scriptures. Rather, they shall transmit them to their former masters, ensuring the prior term is fully met, before dispersing one-third of the remainder. Those who violate the regulations and transgress the laws shall be interrogated by the Left Bureau, their merits nullified with each offense, and they shall not attain immortality. Upon a third offense, the punishment extends to their seven generations of ancestors and their own person, who shall be consigned to the Knife Mountains and the fiery realms, the Twenty-Four Hells, and the Three Paths for ten thousand kalpas, thereafter reduced to the labor of lowly ghosts.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Azure Writs of the Central Palace of the Mysterious Capital* state: Those who receive these precepts shall observe them with clarity and caution.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mystery Capital* state: All who serve as scripture masters, transmitting the tokens of the Heavenly Treasures, yet disperse only one-third while privately diverting the rest for other uses, leaving the destitute without succor and the seven generations of ancestors without deliverance from sin, and themselves without pure and undefiled vestments—such persons offend the gods and transgress the law. Upon a third offense, they shall not attain immortality; upon a fifth, they shall die and enter hell, suffering in the Three Paths for ten thousand kalpas before being reborn into the human realm.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Azure Writs of the Central Palace of the Mysterious Capital* state: Those who receive these precepts shall observe them with clarity and caution.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mystery Capital* state: All who study the Dao of the Highest Clarity must constantly wear the ritual sash and talismans, devoting themselves to fasting, abstinence, and tranquil contemplation. They shall not wander in idle gatherings, lodge in common households, or frequently engage in quarrels, disputes, or conflicts with ordinary companions, nor harbor resentment, invoke heaven and earth, or offend the gods and violate the prohibitions. Upon a third offense, their prior merits shall be nullified, and they shall not attain immortality; upon a fifth, they shall die and enter hell, suffering for ten thousand kalpas before being reduced to the labor of lowly ghosts, bearing stones to fill the rivers.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Azure Writs of the Central Palace* state: Those who receive these precepts shall observe them with clarity and caution.

The *One Hundred and Twenty Precepts of the Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mystery Azure Writs of the Highest Sage* assist in the governance of the Three and Five, aiding the Great Clarity. Above, they encompass the myriad perfected beings; below, they govern the hidden spirits. They rectify and regulate qi, supervise and command the immortals, with the Four Directors and Five Emperors distinguishing life and death. They are the profound statutes of the Supreme Deity and the majestic luminosity of the Jade Emperor. Concealed within the Palace of Great Abundance above the Nine Heavens, they have endured through countless kalpas, never circulated in the world. When the cycles of fortune and misfortune intersect, they shall be transmitted to those of mysterious name, jade bones, and golden viscera, the purple-scripted adepts of the Highest Clarity, those destined for immortality.

Those who obtain these regulations shall have their names reported by the Four Directors, universally proclaimed to the Five Marchmounts, the Three Rivers, the Nine Springs, and the Four Poles’ spirit officials. Guardians shall protect their forms, perfected beings descend, and the Three Primes visit their chambers, where radiant light arises, their bodies suffused with golden perfection. This is the wondrous transformation—immortality attained without study. For those who study the Highest Dao, these regulations come first. With diligent effort and arduous practice, seeking remote mountains, their sincere devotion moves the unseen, and they encounter these scriptures. Those who obtain them must treasure and conceal them, never showing them to others.

Such are the luminous regulations, upheld by the Heavenly Perfected Venerable of the Nine Heavens, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning, the Jade Maidens of the Great Perfection, the Jade Lads of the Three Heavens, the Jade Emperor of the Highest Sovereign, the Thirty-Nine Perfected, the Upper Prime of the Southern Pole, the Three Primes of the Great Simplicity, the Primordial Lady of Purple Simplicity, the Queen Mother of the Western Tortoise, the Lady of the Purple Tenuity, the Four Directors, the Five Emperors, the Perfected of the Four Poles, and the immortals of the Five Marchmounts—none fail to observe these regulations. Without them, the governance of the Emperor would not proceed, the royal canons would be deficient, and immortality would remain unattainable for students. Thus, they are the secrets of the Emperor and Sovereign, never circulated in the world. If their texts were to appear in the world, the land would no longer know those who mourn the dead.

Now, as the Three and Five cycles turn, the time has come for their transmission. Therefore, the Jade Emperor has dispatched the divine soldiers of the Five Directions and the Three Officials of the Left and Right to inspect and regulate the sacred texts, apprehend those who violate them, and investigate reckless transmissions, all in accordance with the mysterious regulations. For seven hundred years, those who encounter the true teachings and form covenants, practicing in accordance with the law, shall attain the highest immortality. Those who violate them shall be seized and interrogated—let no blame fall upon the sacred texts. Thus, these laws are established. Observe them with care and caution.

All advanced scholars who receive the precious scripture *The Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles* shall, on the Eight Festivals, the day of the Great Year-Star, and their own life-destiny day, ingest and wear the fifteen sacred talismans of the Supreme Perfected to dissolve the karmic knots of their destined forms and stellar transgressions, dispelling the trials of wind-blades, water, and fire, the Knife Mountains and Fire Realms, the Twenty-Four Hells, the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, and the punishment of bearing stones to fill rivers. By ingesting these talismans, they shall transcend the Eight Difficulties; the Jade Bureau shall erase their names and inscribe them in the Azure Palace. After nine years, the Perfected shall descend to their chambers, and they shall ride flying clouds to ascend the Nine Heavens.

All devoted scholars whose names are recorded on the Purple Registers, though they may not yet possess the great scriptures, may also singly ingest these talismans to dissolve their karmic roots, avert calamities, and extend their lives, gradually attaining the state of divine transcendence. On the day they receive them, they may form a single covenant, offering two taels of refined gold and forty feet of purple silk as a pledge to the Nine Heavens. They shall announce their vows with a full purification rite, kneel, and receive the talismans.

**(Talisman text originally omitted)**
**Luminous Talisman of the Three Flowers for Returning the Spirit**
When the adept wishes to avoid the trials of wind-blades, water, fire, and the interrogations of the Left and Right Officials, they shall, on their life-destiny day and the day of the Grand Year-Star, inscribe in yellow upon white paper to ingest, and also inscribe in yellow upon silk to wear. The Four Luminaries shall then erase their transgressions, the Lady of Blue shall strike their name from the rolls, and the Jade Bureau shall submit their case for inscription among the Three Clarities. After three years, they shall converse with the Perfected; after seven years, they shall ascend in flight.

This Dao is profoundly subtle—guard it well and do not transmit it lightly.

The fifteen precious talismans of the Supreme Perfected are treasures of the Highest Sage, the Jade Emperor of Great Perfection. They are secretly preserved in the Crimson Chamber of the Seven Radiant Splendors, within the Jeweled Grove’s Purple Gate, attended and incensed by eight hundred jade-maidens of the Flowery Brilliance. These texts of primordial antiquity emerge but once in ten thousand kalpas; without one’s name inscribed in the Emperor’s Register of the Purple Script of the Jade Clarity, none may partake of their mysteries. The High Minister, the Blue Lad, seals one copy each in the Nine Heavens, where the Twenty-Four Emperors and Thirty-Nine Perfected preserve them through endless kalpas, their luster ever renewed despite eons of concealment.

Should one encounter these talismans, their destiny shall be marked for transcendence: they shall tread no path of the Three Wretched Realms, nor be bound by the Five Sufferings. They shall deliver the damned from hell, extricate themselves from the Eight Difficulties, disperse the sins of the Nine Yin, sever the roots of past karma, and liberate their seven ancestors, restoring their hun-souls to the Southern Terrace. Those who study without this method labor in vain; their trials remain unresolved, and with each misstep, they enter the gates of judgment, unable to exonerate themselves. Misfortune shall extend to their seven generations, and the sorrows of life and death shall be beyond words.

The adept who obtains these talismans shall attain transcendence without study; their trials shall vanish, and they shall ascend to the Dragon Chariot. Treasure them and practice accordingly to bear your body aloft—yet guard them closely and never display them to the profane, lest you incur heaven’s heavy burden and turn resentment against the Dao and the Perfected. All this accords with the statutes of the *Nüqing Lüwen* of the Mysterious Capital.

When transmitting or receiving these talismans, enter a chamber, burn incense, face east, and knock the teeth twenty-four times. Recite the incantation:
*"Supreme Jade Perfected, exalted sages of the Nine Mysteries,
Jade script binds my po, preserves my form, and anchors my spirit.
Thrice refined, nine times tested, my Dao is spontaneous.
Delivered from Fengdu, forever parted from the Mountain of Knives,
the Three Wretched Realms and Five Sufferings shall not constrain me.
I petition the Jade Bureau to inscribe my true name,
recorded in the Azure Register and Purple Scrolls of the Attained Dao.
The Three Origins align in splendor, the Nine Emperors share my chariot.
I grasp the Purple Void’s reins to ascend to the Dawn Court.
Blessings flow to my seven ancestors, all attaining transcendence."*

Conclude by swallowing the talisman and circulating saliva twenty-four times. If practiced according to this method for three years, the roots of misfortune shall dissolve, the Emperor Perfected shall descend, and with virtue fulfilled and the Dao accomplished, one shall attain divine transcendence.

For those who receive the Dao of the Supreme Clarity and cultivate its precious scriptures and jade talismans yet do not study the *Four Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*, success shall forever elude them. Statutes restrain transgressions, and regulations expose faults; to study without the *Bright Statutes* is like a blind man groping toward light—unable to perceive the source, one cannot grasp the method. Missteps in practice lead to the realm of sin, where one’s seven ancestors are enslaved and one’s own body suffers calamity, drifting through the Three Wretched Realms and Five Sufferings for ten thousand kalpas without release, forever indebted to the River of Origins.

The adept who seeks learning must first master the *Statutes*; with the *Statutes* as guide, success comes without toil. Sweep the floor, burn incense, and reverently serve the divine. When faults arise, repent at once; light lamps in the central courtyard, ingest the true talismans, dissolve sins, and preserve your form. The Jade Emperor shall be moved, exempting your case. The Jade Bureau shall hold no record of your transgressions, and the Mysterious Capital shall bear no name for punishment. Heaven shall assign maidens to attend you, while the Supreme Tenuity bestows regalia upon your seven ancestors, and the Southern Palace restores their forms to higher transcendence. Diligently practice the wondrous Dao of the Supreme Perfected.

For those who embody the *Four Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*, the Five Emperors of the Jade Bureau shall inscribe their names, submitting them to the Azure Palace of the Highest Sage. Above, the Supreme Emperor shall dispatch thirty-six Jade Lads of the Upper Numinous and twenty-four Jade Maidens of the Western Flower to guard the adept’s body, averting disasters, dispelling misfortunes, erasing sins, eliminating perils, rectifying faults, and rewarding merit, thereby connecting with the divine and attaining the Perfected. The adept shall burn incense and perform morning and evening rites, reciting the *Statutes* thrice monthly, always keeping them thoroughly familiar. Never treat the sacred texts with carelessness or defilement, nor violate the *Statutes* or transgress the precepts, lest the Jade Lads report them. The Left Officials shall then impose punishments equivalent to those in the *Nüqing Lüwen* and the *Four Poles Statutes*. Practitioners, be vigilant.

The *Four Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles* are the standards of the Jade Emperor of Great Perfection in the Supreme Palace, a text preserved for eons yet never transmitted. Thus, though students are as numerous as trees in a forest, only one in a thousand succeeds. Yet when one attains transcendence, it spans a thousand years. Were these *Statutes* widely known, none in the world would die. Therefore, the Jade Emperor guards them and does not transmit them below.

Should one obtain these *Statutes* and recklessly reveal their sacred texts to three others, their body shall perish, their form shall be maimed, and their seven ancestors shall be consigned to the Mountain of Knives. Scholars of the Dao, treasure these jade scrolls and await divine transcendence—never transmit them lightly.

When the great cycle turns and the precious scriptures are destined to circulate, once every seven hundred years, if one encounters a worthy recipient, they shall kneel and transmit them. When receiving the *Statutes*, present ninety feet each of five-colored brocade silk, forty feet of phoenix-patterned gauze, one gold fish, one jade dragon, and one jade tablet, twelve inches in length, inscribed with the year and month of transmission, to be sealed in the adept’s life-destiny mountain. Without this covenant, none may transmit them recklessly. To violate the covenant and betray the oath is to be judged by the Left Officials; master and disciple alike shall be consigned to ghostly servitude, bearing mountains and filling rivers for ten thousand kalpas without pardon.

When transmitting the *Statutes of the Four Poles*, one must fast and prepare a jade tablet, inscribing upon it: the year, month, and day of the new moon; the name of the adept of such-and-such a sacred peak; their age; their birth month; and their life-destiny governed by the Azure Emperor of the Eastern Dipper. Reverently, upon the lofty cliffs of the Dark Peak, they shall swear an oath to the Nine Heavens, receiving the *Statutes of the Four Poles* and vowing to uphold the true Dao. They beseech to have their name inscribed upon the Purple Registers and recorded in the Azure Palace. To violate the covenant and betray the oath is to forfeit all hope of immortality.

The master faces north, clicks their teeth twenty-four times, and invokes: To the High Numinous, Mysterious Void, Great King of the Nine Heavens, Radiant August Jade Emperor, the Thirty-Nine Perfected; to the Most High and Mysterious, the Lord of the Myriad Immortals; to the Inspecting Spirit Messengers, the Jade Lads in Attendance, the Four Directors and Five Emperors, and the Overseers of the Perfected and Immortals—now there is an aspiring Daoist, the adept of such-and-such a sacred peak, who seeks to inherit the supreme teachings and receive the precious scriptures, numbering so many scrolls. Yet, in this degenerate age, they have not yet ascended bodily; though their resolve reaches the Mysterious Void and they wander the sacred peaks, they remain indistinguishable from the worldly. Unacquainted with the *Statutes*, their conduct transgresses, offending the numinous heavens above.

Today, in accordance with the covenant, they present the pledged tokens, entrusting their fate and life, and seek to receive the precious instructions, numbering so many matters. The *Statutes of the Four Poles* must be upheld as the luminous text of the oath sworn to the Nine Heavens. They shall be vigilant, guard their speech, and cultivate the preservation of spirit and contemplation of the true, in pursuit of immortality. When the appointed term arrives and a worthy recipient appears, they shall report to the Nine Heavens before transmitting, never daring to leak them lightly or show them recklessly to others. They proclaim above to the myriad spirits and below to the Five Peaks, to the Three Rivers and Nine Springs, that all may bear witness.

To violate the covenant and betray its virtue is to condemn seven generations of ancestors, parents, and oneself to perpetual servitude under the Left Officials, treading the Knife Mountain, consuming fire, enduring the Twenty-Four Hells, the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, for ten thousand kalpas without remorse. They only beseech that the transmission be granted, and that true spirits, with jade lads and jade maidens, guard their form, that they may soon ascend and be delivered, soaring to the Upper Clarity. All prohibitions and precepts shall adhere to the covenant’s text.

When finished, the master holds the scripture in the left hand, and the disciple holds the tokens in the right. Facing heaven, they murmur: To the August High Mystery, the myriad emperors of the Void and Subtlety—those in the world below who hold fast to their vows, unwavering—dare they proclaim this covenant, to restrain all transgressions. The jade scriptures and precious instructions shall all conform to the statutes and rituals. After their deliverance, all qi shall return to the master’s lineage, eternally preserving heaven and earth, the Three Luminaries shining as one. Should any dare to leak them, they shall forever forfeit the Four Transgressions.

When finished, the disciple places the tokens before them, receives the scripture, faces north, and bows nine times before departing. This covenant may also universally deliver all scriptures, serving as the oath for all transmissions. Though other scriptures have their own covenants, the *Statutes of the Four Poles* governs all, encompassing the myriad traditions.

If no jade tablet is available, one of silver or wood may serve as a substitute. When the transmission is complete, the tablet is read aloud and buried beneath a sheer cliff, to stand as an eternal pledge and an oath witnessed by the myriad spirits. How can one not be cautious? How can one not be cautious?

The Azure Palace has its standards: for all who receive scriptures without pledging tokens and burying tablets to proclaim to the myriad spirits, their sincerity shall not reach the Most High, nor shall the myriad spirits distinguish their right. Thus, the tablet must not be omitted.

Here ends Scroll Five of the *Statutes of the Four Poles of the Most Real Jade Emperor*.
