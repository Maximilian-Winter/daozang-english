**The Illustrated Manual of the Dragon-Tiger Palm**
Combining *Shēntóng Qì* (Paramount Concordance) with *Yì* (Changes) symbolism, it establishes the supreme Dao/Way’s method. Within the *Yì*, the forms of Heaven and Earth are fully arrayed, exhausting the essence of transformation.

Observe the genesis of formed things—it arises from the interplay of one *yīn* and one *yáng* in mutual response.
The *Tàiyáng* (Great Yang) is the father of all things; the *Tàiyīn* (Great Yin) is the mother of all things. If the *huándān* (elixir) does not conform to the Heavenly Dao/Way, it will lack any rational foundation.

Fire is *shàoyáng* (Lesser Yang), and *yáng* is the child of *Tàiyīn*. The child follows the father’s course; thus, the numinous vessel nurtures in secret within the medicine, hence its precedence.

Xu (Xu Xun) and Wei (Wei Boyang) used the *Yì* symbolic sequences as omens, as detailed in the *Qì*’s (Concordance) chapter on *Jīnshì Dàozhāng* (Golden Pivotal Scriptures), along with the *Tàiyī Yùjué* (Great Unity Jade Precepts) as follows.

**The Jade Precepts (Yùjué):**
One stone: *Dānshā* (cinnabar) and *gǒngyín* (mercury) and *qiān* (lead) form one *shuǐ* (water), completing the *huándān* (elixir) Dao/Way.

*Qián* (Heaven) and *Kūn* (Earth) are the gateways of the *Yì*, the parents of all hexagrams.
*Qián* is Heaven, the father; *Kūn* is Earth, the mother. All things are born from *Qián* and *Kūn*, hence they are called gateways.

The two *yáo* (trigrams) of *yīn* and *yáng* exhaust the transformations, becoming the parents of the hexagrams.

*Kǎn* (Abyss) and *Lí* (Fire) as enclosing boundaries: *Kǎn* is in the north; *Lí* resides in the south. *Yáng* is born from *Kǎn*; *yīn* is born from *Lí*—thus they are called enclosing boundaries.

The revolving hub and central axis: movement resolves the *Kǎn* and *Lí* hexagrams. The *Lí* hexagram is hollow within—its void is the hub; the *Kǎn* hexagram is solid within—its solidity is the axis.

Within the hollow hub, Heaven’s wheel turns, the Dipper shifts, and the wheel revolves endlessly. One *yīn* arises in the fifth month when *yáng* is at its peak; one *yáng* arises in the eleventh month within the Great *yīn*. Thus, it cycles endlessly, the hub mirroring the axis.

When the cycles of domination are fixed and the solar hours align without deviation, then the Heavenly Dao/Way’s movements of *yīn* and *yáng* can be grasped in the palm.

The four hexagrams are the lofty keys, covering and encompassing the Dao/Way of *yīn* and *yáng*.
The four hexagrams—*Qián*, *Kūn*, *Kǎn*, *Lí*—were earlier explained: the two upper trigrams are *yáng*, hollow and flexing, drumming and giving rise; the lower two are *yīn*, governed by the timing of *yáng*’s stillness to effect transformation.

Covering and encompassing: they encompass all between Heaven and Earth without omission.

The dragon’s reins and the tiger’s tracks—following them, the Dao/Way proceeds with the *Tàiyáng*’s affairs, as if driving horses with reins, ensuring the tracks align without error.

The calendar marks months and nodes in five or six stages: within the *Kǎn* hexagram, *yáng* is external while *yīn* is internal. One *yáng* emerges within the盛 *yīn* (flourishing *yīn*), the *yáng* Dao gradually lengthening as the *yīn*’s darkness recedes. *Yáng*’s emergence is internal; *yīn*’s dissipation is external. Thus, over six days, the fire’s alchemical stages begin and conclude.

**Dragon and Tiger:**
The circulating *jīn jīng* (metallic essence) nourishes the ten thousand spirits, naturally granting an immortal, ever-living body. Do not emulate the world’s greedy and lustful—endlessly toiling, they become but a clump of dust.

**灵药**
The elixir—nameless yet potent—
One body’s spirit-*qi* most refined.
It does not rely on external things,
*Yīn* returning to check itself—thus it is perfected.

**还丹**
Heaven and Earth as furnace, the elixir within the body,
Unfathomable *yīn-yáng*—this is the divine.
Primordial *qi* ascends as frost, completing nine transformations,
The elixir’s essence is the *Tàihé*’s vital essence.

**文武**
Spring, summer, autumn, winter shift as one,
Dragon and Tiger blend with *Kǎn* and *Lǐ*’s interplay.
*Qián* and *Kūn* exchange day and night in harmonious union,
Child and Horse divide the twelve hours.

**神运**
Refining the elixir requires mastery of spiritual fire,
Do not burn with worldly fuels of wood and charcoal.
The Three Flowers’ fierce flames reside within you—
Wasting yourself in ceaseless toil will only consume your days and months.

**黄芽**
The Yellow Sprout follows the *zhōnglǜ* rhythm,
Hidden in Heaven and Earth, named *Zhēnyī*.
Only in the *Huáchí* Pool can Spring be commanded,
All things take root when flower and fruit begin.

**白汞**
On the third day, *Gēng* is born—*Duì*’s gate opens,
Black gold decays, revealing the white silver embryo.
Nine and six in spring and summer, three and five,
Seven and eight in autumn and winter—cycling endlessly.

**金虎**
Fire concealed in wood—*Jiǎ*’s Green Dragon,
Gold hidden in water—*Gēng*’s White Tiger.
Heaven and Earth’s transformations lie in these two,
Measuring *yīn-yáng* reveals their essence.

**玄曜**
Three-legged, round, one inch in measure,
*Yīn-yáng* emerging like *Qián* and *Kūn*’s forms.
No need for gold or silver to forge the cauldron—
At the ninth position, the hidden Dragon transforms into the Gate.

**真旨**
The Dao speaks of it as *having* for utility,
Yet also as *not having* for function.
Formless form within the One *qi*,
Only return to the origin—root and seed.

**流珠**
*Tàihé* flows through the body, named *liúzhū*,
Primordial *yáng*—black, round—like a pearl.
Three Fields above and below, *Qián* and *Kūn*’s domains,
The High Key stirs the wind, turning the door’s pivot.

**住世**
If you seek longevity, black is the mother,
Flowing through the Three *Yuán*’s pure storage chambers.
Worldly metals and stones are all *yīn* in nature,
Decaying flesh must be refined with *yáng* elixir to supplement.

**成真**
Primordial black ascends, transforming the ten thousand spirits,
The child possesses it—do not ask your neighbor.
Breathe in *Huáchí*’s flow, ascend to the upper realm,
Heaven’s Dao opens—an immortal body.

**出世**
The nine-transformed elixir refines the essence’s root,
Wrapped around the mud pill to fulfill its mandate.
Divine beings transcend emptiness, rising above the Three Realms,
Shedding the body, dissolving like a cicada’s shell.

**河车**
The *Kūn* symbol as a chariot, stationed in the North,
*Kǎn* water as the River, the Black Tortoise’s domain.
Heaven and Earth must be measured at the wheel’s pivot,
The Five Phases ascend and descend, cycling *yīn-yáng*.

The Dragon and Tiger meet in the mother’s womb,
Two *qi* harmonize—milky flowers bloom.
Focus only on the first *yáng*’s rise,
Only then will you know its likeness to plum blossoms.

**神水**
Divine water has always been mercury,
Bound by *Mù*’s virtue, spring’s *yáng* unfurls.
When it comes from the South, it rules the Fire Phase,
Seekers find it—only then do they grasp the truth.

**砂**
Sand is born from gold, mercury is lead,
Divine beings forbid commoners to transmit this.
Though I speak freely of elixir arts,
I fear Heaven’s retribution for ancient transgressions.
