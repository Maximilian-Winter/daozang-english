**Preface and Verified Diagrams of Cultivating the True**

The ultimate essence of the Dao lies in congealing the nature and refining the form to attain longevity. What is called "congealing the nature"? It is the numinous heart—an inward contemplation of immovable stillness, abiding in the primordial origin. Though it is said to be the congealing of the heart as one, there are two attainments.

The two attainments refer to *abiding in the heart* and *emptying the heart*. If one congeals by abiding in the heart, the body and its realm become one with the Dao, and both form and nature transcend. This is the true attainment of immortality and deathlessness, the wondrous Dao of the loftiest immortals. If one congeals by emptying the heart, the nature transcends while the body remains, achieving the lesser method of *corpse liberation through the hollow cavity*.

For when one abides in the heart, the absence of heart is where the true Dao naturally converges—this is called the *body of emptied origin*, a substance of true existence. When one empties the heart, the forgetting of emptiness is where the empty origin naturally unites—this is called the *body of empty existence*, a substance of true non-existence. This attains the wonder of the nature transcending the form but fails to grasp the essence of refining the form, becoming what is known as a *pure and numinous spirit-ghost*.

Thus, the scriptural formulas state that the *lesser immortals* are those who practice the method of *corpse liberation through the hollow cavity*. These two teachings are the essence of attaining the Dao. Yet while achieving the nature transcending the form is swift, it does not accord with the true essence of the Dao. The superior scholar who preserves life regards this as a method of perishing and does not cultivate it.

If one congeals by abiding in the heart and attains both form and nature, one’s lifespan extends for ten thousand years—this is called an *immortal*. Further refining the body into qi for ten thousand years, one is called a *perfected one*. Refining qi into spirit for another ten thousand years, one is called a *spirit-person*. Refining the spirit-person for three thousand years, one is called a *utmost person*. Refining the utmost person for another three thousand years, one becomes a *Dao-attained person* and realizes the fruit of the loftiest immortals. This Dao is the supreme truth of the highest grade, and only after thirty-six thousand years is the ultimate Dao fully perfected.

Yet among beginners, those who practice are as numerous as hairs, while those who succeed are as rare as horns. Thus, the Primordial Mother of the Supreme Dao, the Most High Dao Lord, expounded the *Scripture of Primordial Essence* to save and deliver those who cherish life and preserve destiny.

In ancient times, the *Scripture of the Dragon and Tiger* pointed to the natural spontaneous generation of the *returned elixir* by heaven and earth. According to the higher scriptures, after one thousand and eighty years, true gold ore is born. After another one thousand and eighty years, true cinnabar is born from the gold ore. After another one thousand and eighty years, true mercury is born from the cinnabar. After yet another one thousand and eighty years, the *returned elixir* is completed. Having received the true qi of heaven and earth’s yin and yang and the five phases, it coalesces over four thousand three hundred and twenty years. The primordial essence congeals and emerges between secluded cliffs in sacred mountains, forming spontaneously. At the moment of its completion, its radiance illuminates a thousand *li*, and the immortals and officials of the upper realms descend to gather it—yet it is difficult for ordinary cultivators to obtain.

The Primordial Mother of the Essence, moved by compassion for those who practice cultivation, thus allowed the condensation of the qi of the void through the ages to form true gold. From the gold, cinnabar is produced; from the cinnabar, mercury is born. Combining the three powers (heaven, earth, and humanity) into one crucible, the four thousand three hundred and twenty years of yin and yang primordial qi are accelerated through the twelve months of resonance, and the *returned elixir* is thus perfected. Ingesting it, one immediately realizes the supreme ultimate Dao and ascends to heaven in broad daylight.

Moreover, the ancient immortals and realized sages, fearing that beginners might suffer harm from the cold and heat within a single year, further instructed the refinement of common medicines into numinous medicines using the *sacred herbs of the initial stage*—such as the *small purple river chariot* and *heaven-born yellow sprout*—to create the *elixir of extended preservation*. Those who ingest it will surely attain long life and gradually ascend to perfection, though it lacks the great transformative power of transmutation.

All this is based on the oral instructions of masters and the essential wonders of interpreting the true scriptures. What was once obscure is now made manifest, bridging the mundane and the sacred, revealing the inner through the outer, and transforming the difficult into the easily discerned. Compiled into diagrams and discourses, these are presented for the verification of those gentlemen who cherish life.

Twelve diagrams are established, corresponding to the twelve earthly branches, to fully illustrate the Dao of sagely attainment and spiritual illumination. As the *Scripture of the Yin Talisman* states: *"The sun and moon have their numbers, the great and small have their measures; sagely attainment arises therein, and spiritual illumination emerges therefrom."* This is the meaning.

The verified annotations follow thereafter.

The Diagram of Thirty Spokes Sharing One Hub

The Scripture states: *"Thirty spokes share one hub."*
Master He Shang says: *"In ancient chariots, thirty spokes converge upon a single hub, which has a hollow center, allowing the spokes to unite therein—this follows the number of a lunar month. Thus, the small governs the great, and the few directs the many."*
As the *Scripture of the Yin Talisman* declares: *"The sun and moon have their numbers, the great and small have their measures."* This is the principle.

*"Only when it is hollow does the chariot serve its use."*
Zhuangzi says: *"The usefulness of the useless is great indeed."*
A single spoke, like any part of a chariot, is of no use alone.

The Thirty-Seven-Character Essential Method of the Sun and Moon states:
*"One line, three lines, five lines, seven lines, ten lines, thirteen lines, fifteen lines, seventeen lines, twenty-one lines, twenty-three lines, twenty-five lines, twenty-seven lines, thirty lines."*
Cyclical and unending, over four thousand three hundred and twenty years, the primordial qi gives rise to this.

The Song says:
*"The ages pass as sun and moon replace the years,
Cyclical and unending—such is the Dao’s natural way.
In the tenth month, the embryo sheds its form, nine revolutions complete.
Mao-Mao (卯卯) marks the Jade Hare’s position—Fire and Wood,
the Crimson Sun, where the Yang talisman governs.
You-You (酉酉) marks the Golden Rooster’s position—Metal and Water,
the Black Moon, where the Yin talisman governs.
The two forces revolve left and right, opposing yet gazing upon each other."*

Thirty-six thousand spirits, their qi abundant,
the True Primordial resides within—this True Primordial is the primordial qi of four thousand three hundred and twenty years.
Together they form the elixir.
Banishing evil toxins, all are thereby exhausted;
ingesting it, one ascends to the Great Luo Heaven.

**Method of Solar Fire and Lunar Fire**
Modern methods—those of the Primordial Lord, the Yin Lord, Ancient Songzi, and Biyunzi—open and close the talismans,
with the Three Flowers at the waxing crescent (the Flowers being the talismans).
Ancient methods opened and closed them with the Three Flowers at the waning crescent.

The method states:
*"The pitch-pipes (lü-lǚ) are the positions of Yin and Yang.
Yang is the pitch-pipe (lü), Yin is the harmony (lǚ)."*
Qingxiazi says:
*"The arising of one Yang marks spring and summer;
the arising of one Yin marks autumn and winter.
Yin culminates in Kun, Yang culminates in Qian.
Zi, Chou, and Yin are spring;
Mao, Chen, and Si are summer;
Wu, Wei, and Shen are autumn;
You, Xu, and Hai are winter."*

All these diagrams reveal the essential mysteries of the solar and lunar fire realms.
Without awakening to this symbolic method, the Reverted Elixir remains distant.

**Diagram of Gathering True Lead and Mercury**
Lead, ah—it is the spring of the Mysterious Primordial.
A spring is the source of water.
People see only the spring water surging forth from stone caverns,
yet none know whence the source arises.
Just so, the primordial qi gives life and ripens the ten thousand things,
yet none see whence the primordial qi comes.
Thus the *Daoist Scripture* says:
*"Subtle, wondrous, and profoundly penetrating,
it is beyond all knowing.
Precisely because it cannot be known,
we force ourselves to describe it—
this is called the formless form."*

The heavens revolve leftward,
while the five planets and sun and moon turn rightward.
Fire-lead mirrors the sun,
cinnabar-mercury mirrors the moon.
The moon moves swiftly, traversing thirteen degrees in a day and night.
The sun moves slowly, traversing one degree in a day and night.
The moon completes one revolution of the heavens in a month;
the sun completes one revolution in a year.
In a year, the sun and moon conjoin twelve times to form the year.
They give birth and transform the ten thousand things,
their essence lying in the twelve hexagrams.
Cyclical and unending, when the nine revolutions are complete and the qi of lead and mercury is abundant,
their spirits fully realized, the Golden Elixir is achieved.
Thus the scripture says:
*"The sun and moon move swiftly or slowly;
the nature of the medicine is either hasty or gentle."*
This is precisely so.

The Song says:
*"Slow is the sun, swift is the moon—
why trouble with excessive distinctions?
True lead is the essence of the Fire Clan,
true mercury soars, bearing crimson blood.
Male essence and female blood embrace,
blood gives rise to flesh, essence produces bone.
All depends on a good matchmaker to wed them,
nurturing the crimson child until it brings joy."*

Mercury is the radiance of the Vast Primordial,
the origin of the ten thousand things.
The origin of mercury is the Crimson Dragon.
The Crimson Dragon is cinnabar—
not common cinnabar,
but the flowing liquid of the Great Mystery,
formed from the primordial qi of two thousand one hundred and sixty years,
called the True Elixir of Emptiness and Nonbeing.

**Sixfold Permeation Diagram**
Six refers to the six qi-phases, the method of a single month.
Permeation means penetrating the twelve earthly branches,
discerning the movements and concealments of Dragon and Tiger,
the six unions, the six pitch-pipes, and the six harmonies—
the essentials of twelve cycles of appearance and manifestation.

**Secret of the Ascent and Descent of Yin and Yang’s Six Qi-Phases**
On the third day, *Dui* leaps to *Geng*, faintly luminous.
On the eighth day, *Zhen* rises at *Ding*, the waxing crescent briefly pauses.
On the fifteenth day, *Qian* vigorously appears, full at *Jia* and *Geng*.
On the sixteenth day, *Xun* wanes, entering *Xin*.
On the twenty-third day, *Gen* ascends, *Li* clings to *Bing*, the waning crescent.
On the thirtieth day, *Kun* compliantly follows, sinking into *Kan*’s transformation—
transformation meaning separation.

Here, the sun’s spirit and the moon’s essence,
when they unite in essence, give rise to myriad transformations.
In heaven, they generate the myriad images;
on earth, the myriad things;
in humans, the myriad spirits;
in medicine, the myriad numina.

It requires the power of the Three Flowers,
the Four Masters working in concert.
To know the intent of the Yellow and the Old,
the secret mystery lies in the Central Court.
These words all spoken,
does the student awaken or not?

**Diagram of Yin and Yang in Mutual Reflection**
When the sun’s spirit and the moon’s essence unite in essence,
the ten thousand things spontaneously transform.
It requires the power of the Three Flowers,
the Four Masters working in concert.
To know the intent of the Yellow and the Old,
the secret mystery lies in the Central Court.
These words all spoken,
does the student awaken or not?

**Ancient and Modern Methods: Great Unity with Minor Differences**
Master Cui employed the Heavenly Guardian Star,
summoned the Chen Star,
and convened Qian and Kun.
Establishing the two crescents,
he engendered the ten thousand things as three clans of children—
a method identical to Master Cui’s.
The Primordial Lord also possessed this method.
Those who employ this method,
on the day when the primordial qi of heaven and earth conjoin,
establish the root of the Dao—
the root being the Cinnabar Field.
As the scripture says:
*"When the root is established, the Dao arises."*

The various Immortal Lords employed the Fire Star,
summoned the Chen Star,
and after two seventy-day periods (three decades),
the primordial qi first conjoined in great unity,
with the Chen Star as the primal head.
Sun and moon conjoin,
lead and mercury unite.
Thus the scripture says:
*"Harmonize their light, blend with their dust—
this is called Mysterious Unity."*
And again:
*"Return to its luminosity—
this is what it means."*

**Saliva-Altar Diagram**
Saliva means harmony;
altar means earth.
As the scripture says:
*"Knead earth to make a vessel;
it is the emptiness within that gives the vessel its use."*
This speaks of harmonizing earth to create inner and outer vessels—
the inner being the crucible,
not an ordinary crucible,
but the crucible that receives the divine mercury.
Thus the *Scripture of Yin Talismans* says:
*"Here lies a wondrous vessel,
from which the ten thousand images arise—
the eight trigrams, the celestial stems and earthly branches,
the divine mechanisms, the hidden ghosts."*
Ghosts refer to *Gui* qi.
The "useless" refers to ordinary vessels.

The essence is retained within the crucible,
and the Three Hun are inwardly formed.
The Hun are the Dragon;
the Dragon is the divine radiance of Wood’s essence.
According to the *Scripture of Primordial Essence*:
*The Lord of the Great Dao says:
"The primordial essence of the Great Yang
is the numinous spirit of the Left Correct,
merged with the Dao.
Ingesting it, the body becomes light and attains longevity."*
And again:
*"Fire can solidify things,
firmly preserving the primordial qi.
Those who ingest primordial essence
permanently stabilize their qi and substance,
their spirit merging with primordial harmony
to achieve numinous communion."*
Primordial essence is the essence of true fire.

The *Furnace Enclosure Diagram*
The furnace enclosure is the outer saliva altar. Like a city that houses its lord and people, the myriad spirits of yin and yang rely on the furnace enclosure to resonate and establish sagely achievement, thereby completing the Reverted Elixir. Herein lies the Way of the Three Ultimates.

The Northern Dipper follows the celestial wheel, completing one revolution each day and night. The eight trigrams revolve through the eight gates of the crucible, traversing the twelve earthly branches in unison, giving rise to the transformation of the ten thousand spirits. The two essences intermingle, the Four Symbols mutually engender, the Five Phases alternately overcome and counterbalance—thus are the myriad things born. In the Reverted Elixir of Dragon and Tiger, the ten thousand spirits are fully present.

The marrow is retained within the crucible, inwardly forming the Seven Po. The Po are the Tiger; the Tiger is the essence of Metal, the numinous spirit of golden liquid. Thus the Dark Lady said to the Supreme One, the Celestial Lord: *"With golden liquid and golden water flowing into the five viscera, the four limbs become firm and smooth, the hundred spirits are nourished, the six bowels are moistened, hair and bones are transformed, and the form endures long. Its power is most divine and sufficient."*

The *Divine Chamber Diagram*
The Scripture states: *"Cut doors and windows to make a chamber; it is the emptiness within that gives the chamber its use."* Those who ingest the Upper Nine-Transmutation Elixir dwell in the Upper Three Heavens. Those who ingest the Middle Nine-Transmutation Elixir dwell in the Middle Three Heavens. Those who ingest the Lower Nine-Transmutation Elixir dwell in the Lower Three Heavens. This is brought about by the resonance of Dao, qi, and spirit.

The chamber is no ordinary chamber—it is the divine chamber of the Three Purities. The Three Purities, as the Scripture states, are the palaces of Great Purity, Highest Purity, and Jade Purity. They are the Purple Tenuity Palace, the Purple Radiance Palace, and the Purple Dawn Palace—these three palaces correspond to the three cinnabar fields, the upper, middle, and lower grades. The three grades are the Lesser Reversion, Middle Reversion, and Greater Reversion Elixirs, establishing the Three Bureaus. Within each of the three palaces reside three spirits, yielding two times three to make nine; the palaces give rise to three nines, forming the chambers of the Great Nine Transmutations, the fields of the Lesser Nine Transmutations, and the palaces of the Middle Nine Transmutations. These are the abodes of the divine Way, the gates and windows through which perfected beings enter, dwell, and wander. All are guarded by the great spirits of the eight trigrams, who protect and uphold the sagely Dao, a realm that restrains evil and promotes goodness.

Thus the *Scripture of Inner Radiance* states: *"Within the jade chamber, the eight primals intermingle."* *Primal* refers to the root; *eight* refers to differentiation; *chamber* is the chamber of Azure Perfection; *jade* is the radiance of dawn’s mist—same essence, different names. Those who awaken to this practice cultivation of life, and those who cultivate life will surely become perfected beings. Moreover, *intermingling* refers to the scene of the qi of the Nine Heavens converging and assembling.

The *Divine Chambers of the Three Elixirs*
The Great Nine Transmutations.

**First Grade: Chamber of Purple Dawn**
Shallow yellow ground, light green—Middle Nine Transmutations.

**Second Grade: Chamber of Purple Radiance**
Red ground, green with central yellow—Lower Nine Transmutations.

**Third Grade: Chamber of Azure Perfection (also called Chamber of Purple Tenuity)**
Pale blue ground, central yellow—*Illustration of the Seventy-Two Seasonal Divisions of the Zhou Changes*.
*Zhou* means three cycles. Three threes generate nine cycles; nine cycles are the nine returns. The essential lies in the three cycles: the solar cycle, the lunar cycle, and the annual cycle. These produce the seventy-two seasonal markers, the four seasons and eight solar terms, the twenty-four qi. The twenty-four qi: each day and night yields two qi per month, and the twelve months complete the measure—thus circulating and nurturing lead and mercury to achieve the merit of the returning elixir.

From the exterior:
First halo—shallow yellow;
Second stroke—light green;
Third halo—pale blue;
Stars and constellations—red.

*Illustration of Enveloping the Embryo to Verify Primal Chaos*
Within the embryo, the human is verified; within the medicine, the spirit is verified. *Enveloping* is the initial line. The initial line is the one yang beneath five yins—the latent dragon at the inception of the *Jianzi* hexagram. It is called "one generates two"; *two* is *chou*, *one* is *zi*. From *zi* to *chou*, *chou* is the *Lin* hexagram. By *yin*, the three yangs complete the embryo—*Tai* is the embryo. The two qi of yin and yang, together with harmonious qi, make three. Thus the scripture states: "One generates two, two generates three, three generates the myriad things." *Three* refers to *zi*, *chou*, and *yin*—the qi of generation. Therefore, the embryo is *Tai*. In primal chaos, it is heaven and earth; in humans, it is essence and blood; in medicine, it is water and fire.

The rat transforms into the ox, the ox into the tiger—these three images are the subtle and imperceptible. *Three* is primal chaos, as stated in the *Scripture of the Great One*. All in yellow.

*Illustration of Cinnabar Quartz Verifying Contained Radiance*
In humans, it verifies essence and blood forming shape; in medicine, it verifies lead and mercury forming the elixir. The *rooster* verifies metal; the *child* verifies water. Metal and water are lead and mercury—the Way of the youthful maiden and the young man in the *Yin Fu*. *Stone* is the stabilization of mercury, the *Gen* hexagram of stillness. It is called "worn metal and declining wood." The metaphor of *contained radiance*. *Quartz* is summer’s heat, a pure and unadulterated substance containing the five colors and the mysterious essence of the celestial mandate. Thus it is cited as an analogy for the common. This quartz emerges from Mount Min in Shu and Mount Hua in the Central Kingdom—it is white quartz. When sunlight strikes it, it gleams like jade.

*Illustration of Exquisite Jade Verifying the Divine Treasure*
*Exquisite jade* is five-colored jade, mined from the Secret Mountains of the Western Sea—it belongs to the class of the living returning elixir. It verifies the true lead of the wood phase. The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: "Exquisite jade is fine; the Yellow Emperor consumed and offered it, and by ingesting it, Xuanyuan ascended as an immortal." Another scripture describes the four or five colors manifesting, speaking of the symbolic hues of precious jade. The *Divine Talisman* says: "Responding." Red like a rooster’s comb, yellow like steamed chestnuts, white like congealed fat, blue like Qin jade, black like dark lacquer—these five virtues and five qi illustrate the colors of the returning elixir’s metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Thus it is cited as verification of the divine treasure. The divine treasure is lead and mercury.

*Illustration of the Merit of the Five Phases in the Returning Elixir*
*Returning* means returning to one’s original body. *Elixir* is the name for the red color. *Five* refers to the five stars, five emperors, five viscera, five natures, five classics, five flavors, five metals, five qi, five directions, five colors, and five sacred mountains—the five phases. *Phase* means circulation and distribution. *Merit* is the application of thorough understanding. The discussion follows.

The West, belonging to Metal of Geng and Xin, bears the color white, the musical note *shang*, the trigram *dui*, the spirit White Tiger, and governs autumn. Its metal is silver, its flavor pungent, its qi rank, its symbol injury. Its star is Venus, its sacred mountain Hua, its viscus the lungs, and it connects to the mouth. Its nature governs righteousness, its classic the *Book of Documents*. Its initial number is four, its completion number nine. The White Primordial Essence, when ingested, nourishes the lung palace.

The Classic states: The lung is the Jade Hall and the Palace of the Minister of Works, refining the seven *po* souls. It augments speech and qi, enhances the nature of righteousness, and enables external communication. The perverse qi of the five metals and harmful vessels cannot injure it. Its virtue subdues the tiger, and the Metal constellation cannot peer upon it—this is the benefit of the Metal Spirit Emperor and the Numinous Primordial Essence.

The East, belonging to Wood of Jia and Yi, bears the color blue-green, the musical note *jiao*, the trigram *zhen*, the spirit Azure Dragon, and governs spring. Its metal is lead, its flavor sour, its qi rank, its symbol generation. Its star is Jupiter, its sacred mountain Tai, its viscera the liver and gallbladder, and it connects to the eyes. Its nature governs benevolence, its classic the *Book of Songs*. Its initial number is three, its completion number eight. The Blue-Green Primordial Essence, when ingested, nourishes the eyes and the two internal palaces.

The two palaces: the liver is the Clear and Resonant Palace and the Orchid Terrace Palace; the gallbladder is the Purple Tenuity Palace and the Palace of Primordial Extremity. It nourishes the three *hun* souls, brightens the countenance and eyes, enabling distant vision. It enhances the nature of benevolence. The qi of Wood cannot erode or harm it, nor can vessels strike or obstruct it. Its virtue subdues the dragon, and the Thursday star cannot peer upon it—this is the benefit of the Wood Spirit Emperor and the Numinous Primordial Essence.

The Northern Direction, Ren and Gui Water, is black in color. Its musical note is *yu*, its trigram *Kan*, its spirit the Dark Warrior. It governs winter. Its metal is iron, its flavor salty, its qi putrid in odor, its symbol closure. Its star is Chen, its mountain Heng. Its organ is the kidney, which connects to the ears. Its nature governs wisdom, its classic the *Book of Changes*. Its initial number is one, its completion number six. The Black Primordial Essence, when ingested, nourishes the ears and benefits the kidney spirit.

The classic states: The kidney is called the Palace of Supreme Harmony. It solidifies marrow and blood, moistens and sharpens hearing, rendering one’s nature wise and luminous, refining the skin, hair, and complexion to a verdant hue. Yin evil and water cannot drown or submerge it. It communicates with the Great Yin and unites with concealment—one does not wander beyond the gate, casts no shadow in moonlight, and the Wednesday star cannot perceive it. This is the benefit of the Water Jade Lead Essence, the Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord, and the Numinous Primordial Essence.

The Southern Direction, Bing and Ding Fire, is red in color. Its musical note is *zhi*, its trigram *Li*, its spirit the Vermilion Bird. It governs summer. Its metal is copper, its flavor bitter, its qi scorched in odor, its symbol flourishing. Its star is Mars, its mountain Heng. Its organ is the heart, which connects to the eyes. Its nature governs ritual, its classic also the *Book of Rites*. Its initial number is two, its completion number seven. The Red Primordial Essence, when ingested, nourishes the heart spirit, enhances yang radiance, refines and strengthens sinews and bones, and transforms yin stagnation.

The classic states: The heart is the Crimson Palace and the Palace of Primordial Yang. Nourishing this palace internally fortifies the eyes externally, rendering one’s nature sincere in ritual conduct, untouched by arrogance or reckless yang dominance. Fire cannot burn it, yang toxins cannot heat it. The body communicates with the Great Yang and unites with the primordial, manifesting as sunlight—no shadow appears within its brilliance, and the Tuesday star cannot scrutinize it. This is the benefit of the Flame Emperor and the Numinous Primordial Essence.

The Central Direction, Wu and Ji Earth, is yellow in color. Its musical note is *gong*, its trigram *Kun*, its spirit the Earth Deity. It governs the four seasons. Its metal is gold, its flavor sweet, its qi fragrant in odor, its symbol containment. Its star is Zhen, its mountain Song. Its organ is the spleen, which connects to the nose. Its nature governs trust, its classic the *Book of Music*. Its initial number is five, its completion number ten. The Yellow Primordial Essence, when ingested, nourishes the stomach and benefits the spleen spirit.

The classic states: The spleen is the Central Yellow Palace and the Palace of Supreme Simplicity. It enhances will and qi, nurtures the nature of trust, refines the five forms, harmonizes the nine qi, augments sagely wisdom, subdues the myriad hidden forces, befriends the Five Elders, and prevents the earth from burying or sealing. The Saturday star cannot peer upon it. This is the benefit of the Five-Star Imperial Might and the Numinous Primordial Essence.

As for the Returning Elixir: it attains perfection through one surge, two harmonies, three ascensions, four revolutions, five penetrations, six attainments, seven governances, eight numina, nine extremities, and ten completions of the primordial truth above. How could its meaning not be resplendently clear?

Ordinary people possess talents and appearances that cannot be learned, yet if one transcends the Great Elixir, transformations manifest as desired. Thus, the classic states: "What can be and what cannot be—all becomes possible."

According to the *Triple Concordance and Grand Changes Record of Intent and Diagram*: "This diagram contains all virtues; only then can it communicate with the numinous." The ancient classics, the *Decisions of the Primordial Lord*, the *Transformation Diagrams of the Grass-Clad Master* and the *Azure Master*, all refer to the refining of the elixir—sometimes called the Wish-Fulfilling Pearl. When obtained by the Heavenly Emperor, it becomes the Crimson Palace Pearl; when obtained by the Heavenly Dragon, it becomes the Crown Pearl. Forged into a sword, it subdues all evils and malevolence; wielded as a staff, it grants free control over life and death. A single grain can polish ordinary copper, iron, or mirrors, enabling the discernment of all spirits, demons, and ancient buried objects. The Yellow Emperor’s treasured mirror was of this kind.

The Primordial Lord said: "With a single grain, one may inscribe talismans, perform corpse liberation, or summon the Five Peaks—spirits arrive instantly, and command is freely exercised."

The Primordial Yang Master said:
*"When the Qian hexagram moves, the Returning Elixir forms,*
*Withered trees bloom anew.*
*Those who ingest it attain long life,*
*Wandering the Purple Court of the heavens."*

The ancient perfected ones also said: "Earth, stone, and the five metals all transform into treasures. Withered bones revive, decayed flesh is reborn."

The ancient Master Song said: "Those who ingest it find their days lengthened and their lives extended; even if the great sea dries, their spirits grow stronger."

The Venerable Zheng Bai consumed it and soared above the Great Clarity, roaming freely within creation. He saw the sea as hills, and mortal lives as foam—this was not the work of heaven and earth, but the power of the Returning Elixir.

The Perfected Master Ge Hong said: "I have studied the Dao for over thirty years, perusing myriad classics and decisions—over ten thousand scrolls. Since ancient times, the highest perfected immortals have all regarded the Returning Elixir and Golden Liquor as the great essential."

The *Primordial Lord’s Golden Liquor Decisions* states: "Ingesting a single grain transforms one into a body of refined gold."

Thus, the *Yellow Court Classic* says:
*"The five talismans, though varied, share the same root and node."*
And:
*"The three and five unite in qi, their origin one."*
The *Eight Immortals’ Song* says:
*"One thing contains five colors,*
*Forever the immortals’ blessing."*
The *Three Radiances Decisions* states:
*"The supreme medicine, if lacking even one qi, differs not from tiles and pebbles."*

Why is this so? Because humans rely on the primordial spirits of the five viscera to sustain life. If all five viscera are truly nourished, the organs’ qi harmonizes, life flourishes, essence is refined and preserved, primordial qi naturally stabilizes, the skin glows, and the spirit congeals in emptiness—forever free from the dullness of sinking and dissipation. If the five qi are disharmonious, dominance and subjugation lead to punishment and nature’s transcendence, causing the body to fall. When nature returns to emptiness, the body sinks into oblivion. Thus, strength and weakness scatter, deficiencies and injuries prevail, and without the union of harmonious qi, there is no path to enduring vision.

For instance, in an ordinary person’s body, if one meridian falters, all meridians disorder and illness arises—how much more so when one of the five phases’ numinous primordial qi is lacking? The four yellows, eight stones, five metals, and the like are indeed the essence of heaven and earth, yet because they lack the fullness of the five qi, being solitary yin or solitary yang, rigid and unyielding, devoid of the five phases, and lacking fixed nature, they cannot serve as the supreme medicine.

The efficacy of these may remedy illness, yet they offer no hope for the attainment of transcendence and immortal ascension. Should one seek the feathered transformation of long life, one must ingest the five-colored lead and mercury, cinnabar and yellow sprouts—medicines that encompass the five hues, five flavors, and five phases. These alone embody inner illumination, the true presence that arises from absence.

For the *Daoist Canon* states: "That which sight cannot perceive, hearing cannot grasp, and use cannot exhaust." Master Wei likewise declares: "Unbroken and ceaseless—this is called the Yellow Sprout. Endlessly transforming—this is named Cinnabar." It is further said: "Ingest it, and one shall not die in this lifetime; the mercury of creation, once refined, leaves its root intact." Master Green Mist adds: "Yellow is the essence of cinnabar; the sprout is the foundation of lead. Grasp but the lineage and branches, and in application, you shall not err."

The ancient scriptures also teach: "The Golden Elixir preserves form, safeguards life, and completes the spirit. All other methods are but vain toil and suffering." Yet without the transmission of a true teacher, one cannot easily proceed. Thus, mineral medicines may harm life—regret comes too late. Let scholars and gentlemen take heed and examine this carefully. *Illustrated Verifications of Cultivating the True, Scroll #2, concludes without vulgarity.*
