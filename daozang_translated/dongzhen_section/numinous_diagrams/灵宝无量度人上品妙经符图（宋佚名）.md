**Preface to *The Marvelous Charts of the Supreme Scripture of Limitless Salvation of the Numinous Treasure***
*Composed by Emperor Huizong of the Song*

Of old, the numinous radiance of Hualing concealed the Three Qi within the primordial chaos; the divine splendor held brilliance, harboring the myriad perfected within the utmost mystery. In the flourishing of emptiness and non-being, kalpas transformed naturally, and from this arose the wondrous pole of the Divine Unity—this is the honored One of Primordial Beginning. It inaugurated the celestial charts before the imperial ancestors, congealing the essence and flowing forth the root of form, the origin of the profound and the yellow, the ancestor of all images.

Thus, it cleaved heaven and earth, ordered yin and yang, followed the four beginnings in their measures, and regulated the waxing and waning of the eight cords—all receiving the mandate of the supreme virtue, all governed by the authority of the celestial bureaus. It harmonized the spirits in hidden accord, nurtured their natures in concord, arrayed their positions and opened the directions, fostering and completing all things. Nine harmonies and ten unions—nothing failed to attain perfection. Flowing ceaselessly, it is boundless and unfathomable.

The Dao, though forced into a name, is called the *Numinous Treasure*. For the Numinous Treasure is the root of generation and transformation of the Great Primal. Since then, the subtle mechanism has unfolded, awakening the essence of dawn. One must reflect upon the era before the establishment of the primordial kalpa, when the myriad forms fused and crystallized, their brilliance and freshness radiant, the supreme principle shining forth in the Dragon Han, the marvelous scripture resplendent in the Crimson Clarity. The celestial net spread its splendor, cloud-like chapters unfurled in all directions; the five directions gleamed, the eight corners cast their rays. Subtle mysteries were concealed in the true profundities, divine functions lay hidden within the primordial net.

To expand the great teaching and let its compassionate fragrance flow, the scripture was inscribed by the brush of the august sage and its meaning proclaimed in the words of the Most High. Some took the form of charts and talismans, others of esoteric texts; some expounded the marvelous in the land of Fuli, others concealed the mysterious within the pearl of millet grain. Some were entrusted to us, others received from the Jade Void; some were secreted in the palaces of elixir, pearl, and mushroom, others revered in the divine halls of the numinous treasury.

They established ranks and categories, distinguishing types and dividing sections. Scattered, they upheld the warp of the Six Jia; united, they encompassed the standard of the One Primordial. They served as the great bridge of the Dao, traversing the profound ford, salvaging all without exception, exorcising all without fail. They sustained the turning of fate in times of distress, safeguarded the prosperity of the altars of soil and grain, pacified and stabilized the imperial destiny, and sealed the governance of mountains and rivers. Vast and majestic was their scope—nothing lay beyond their all-embracing order.

This is what is called the *Numinous Treasure*—truly the loftiest appellation of the Great Primordial. Within the grand palace of the Great Possession, this scripture was treasured, most revered among the ten thousand heavens. Those who, through diligence and toil, came to hear of it must first examine their worthiness, adhering to the luminous statutes of the Purple Tenuity and observing the rites of the divine kings in reverence. It was not to be lightly transmitted—once in ten thousand kalpas.

In the past, I presided over the Jade Realm of the Assembly of Perfected, opening the wondrous court of transformation. I embraced the ninefold radiance of auspicious clouds, soared with the phoenix canopy over the Three Floras, ascended the Dragon Terrace of Luyao’s splendor, and surveyed the turning of fate at the Primordial Gate. I examined the reckoning of kalpas and celebrated the era of Great Peace. Looking up, I prayed to the Supreme Emperor to descend into the world and save humanity.

Later, in the years *renchen* and *gengzi*, the qi responded to the Nine Yangs, heterodox teachings dissolved, and the true Dao began to flourish. The masses were enlightened, and boundless salvations were bestowed. At that time, the purple-sealed treasure chest was opened, and the jade key unlocked the jeweled case. The jade-bound medicinal slips were to be proclaimed; those who aspired to the true might behold them—how fortunate!

I often dwell in the Jasper Forest chamber, feasting in the jade dawn’s embrace, chanting in the lofty void, and expounding the subtle doctrines. I have elucidated the essentials within the divine treasury and beheld the supreme principle in the limpid mirror. Thus, I have unfurled and released the primordial meaning, aligning with the mysterious conveyance of the profound. I have discerned the profound purport of the original chapters and analyzed the graceful beauty of the numinous tones. I have expounded the pivot of the Limitless and meticulously investigated the obscure and distant.

This may enable one to ascend the ten-thousand-*ren* peak of the mysterious, to rescue those drowning in the vast and perilous abyss. For when the rosy clouds soar and gleam in the empty purity, nothing remains unilluminated in the depths of obscurity. The marvelous records are proclaimed, abiding in the way of simplicity. Bright and distinct, they awaken those with karmic affinity.

Let scholars not neglect their utmost application. Cultivate and advance, and one may summon the numinous qi at the Three Passes, flourish the precious blossoms at the Nine Gates. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, one’s name is inscribed in the Upper Clarity. Loosening the reins, one soars aloft, roaming the Great Brilliance. The greatness of transformative virtue—how could one exhaust its ultimate ford?

**The Marvelous Charts of the Supreme Scripture of Limitless Salvation of the Numinous Treasure, Volume One**

The Numinous Treasure, in terms of the supreme Dao, is the generation of divine transformation. When the primordial chaos first divided, the Primordial Beginning unfolded the celestial charts. The true qi wove its network, universally planting the numinous spirits, perpetually nurturing and enduring, generating and completing without end.

Human life, in its essence, is the most precious of things. Endowed with consciousness and perception, its transformations and applications are boundless. Tracing its great root, all receive the celestial constancy. It is nurtured by the covering and bearing of heaven and earth, encompassed within the guiding principles.

When the spirit descends, it becomes numinous; when qi gathers, it becomes treasure. The descent of spirit and the gathering of qi give form to substance. Nothing fails to be generated, nothing remains obscure, nothing is not established, nothing is not completed.

Thus, to the left resides the Non-Flourishing, to the right coalesces the White Prime. The Great One and the Director of Destinies, Peach Vitality and Union of Longevity, the Three Perfected and the Nine Palaces—all are scattered and complete. What room is there for conjecture or deliberation?

The millet pearl receives without limit, its nurturing and propagation flourishing and enduring. Great as heaven and earth, small as a single form, extending even to grasses and trees—the true essence of the myriad categories is all naturally managed thereby.

Thus, the Dao encompasses the ten thousand heavens, circumscribes the ten earths, propels the turning of yin and yang, and harmonizes cold and heat. It governs the eight trigrams, commands the Three Primordials, regulates ghosts and spirits, and preserves and nourishes the people and all things.

Thus its scripture summons the perfected and invokes the numinous, delivering countless beings—serving as the origin of the myriad Daoist traditions and acclaimed as the supreme scripture. For the Lingbao tradition encompasses the Three Ways, ascending to commune with Shangqing and descending to embrace Dongshen. The union of spirit and qi forms the root of primordial essence; its name stands majestic, exalted, and revered beyond all else.

The Dao declares: In ancient times, within the Azure Prime of Heaven, amidst the Celestial Void’s hymns of the Great Floating Li Land, the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign inscribed the Lingbao qi with a purple brush, where it intermingled with the Azure Prime’s qi to manifest its transformative forms. It governs the generative Dao of the world, heaven and earth, and ghosts and spirits, capable of nurturing and storing the qi of life, embracing the hun-soul and binding it through refinement to attain perfection. Those who possess it inscribe it in azure upon bamboo slips or silk, face the northwest to ingest it, preserving life and prolonging years, ensuring the spirit-qi does not scatter, thus securing the Dao of complete vitality. Wearing it draws the qi of life into the body, reversing aging to return to infancy, aligning with destiny to transcend mortality, and traversing the Great Yin. Donning the Azure Prime’s transformative chart, the Azure Prime Lord ascends with the adept, roaming the vast heavens.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign said: The qi of the Celestial Void in beings manifests as threads, vessels, sinews, and networks, interlinking and permeating. This qi originates in the Azure Prime of Heaven, generating in humans three hundred and sixty meridians, three hundred and sixty channels, three hundred and sixty collaterals, along with minute, branch, silk, and @ collaterals. The Great Bounds’ qi serves as their origin, coalescing within this scripture to form the chart. Those who wear it—immortals inscribe azure on silk to summon the perfected of the ten directions; a single hymn sung in the void is heard by all sages. Its ingestion and application follow the same method.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign fixed the script with a purple brush, using azure for the ground, yellow for the text, and red for the borders. Sealing this chart as the Floating Li Land demarcates the region encompassing the Zhixue’s abode. The luminous qi of the Central Yellow Supreme Mingfan revolves and flows, delineating the palaces, towers, and pavilions within its domain. Those who wear it find the hundred spirits attending their body, the Three Realms’ overseers welcoming them; demon kings receive commands, and the Five Emperors serve at their chariot. The Central Yellow Supreme Unity Emperor, if the adept recites the Dongzhang in unison, ascends with them to the Purple Chamber. This chart governs the spleen and stomach, nourishing supreme harmony—its application follows the prior method.

Receiving the *Primordial Beginning’s Scripture of Delivering Countless Beings, Supreme Grade*, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded this sutra, circling ten times to summon the ten directions, then ascending the throne.

The Heavenly Perfected Great Spirits, Supreme Sages of the Highest Rank, Wondrously Practiced Realized Ones, and countless hosts arrived riding the void, soaring through the cinnabar clouds of the empyrean. Their jade-green chariots and wheel-rimmed palanquins bore feathered canopies that trailed in response; streaming essences of jade radiance, five-colored qi surged in abundance, illuminating the Great Void with resplendence for seven days and seven nights. The sun, moon, and stellar lodges of the manifold heavens, along with the jade celestial pivots, all halted their revolutions at once. Divine winds stilled into silence; mountains and seas concealed their clouds; the sky held no drifting veils, and the four qi shone in clarity. The land of the entire realm—its mountains, rivers, and forests—leveled into perfect evenness, no longer possessing high or low; the earth transformed entirely into azure jade, without any differing hues.

The assembled Perfected attended the throne as the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, seated upon a darkly floating dais above five-colored lions, expounded the sutra once. The Great Sages of the manifold heavens simultaneously voiced their approval. At that moment, the deaf and ailing men and women of the realm all regained their hearing. When the sutra was expounded a second time, the blind received sight. A third recitation enabled the mute to speak. A fourth allowed the lame, the chronically ill, and the long-bedridden to rise and walk. A fifth restored those suffering from enduring ailments to their original forms. A sixth turned white hair black again and caused fallen teeth to regrow. A seventh rejuvenated the aged into youth and strengthened the young. An eighth enabled pregnant women, as well as birds and beasts—whether already bearing young or yet to conceive—to bring forth life in completion. A ninth caused the earth’s treasuries to open, revealing gold and jade. A tenth brought the withered bones back to life, all rising as whole persons.

At that time, every man and woman of the realm turned their hearts in devotion, all receiving protection and deliverance, attaining longevity without end. The Dao declared: When the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded the sutra once, the boundless and immeasurable hosts of the Perfected Great Spirits of the Eastern Direction arrived floating through the void. A second recitation summoned the boundless and immeasurable hosts of the Perfected Great Spirits of the Southern Direction. A third brought those of the Western Direction. A fourth, those of the Northern Direction. A fifth, those of the Northeastern Direction. A sixth, those of the Southeastern Direction. A seventh, those of the Southwestern Direction. An eighth, those of the Northwestern Direction. A ninth, those of the Upper Direction. A tenth, those of the Lower Direction. When the ten recitations were complete, the Perfected Great Spirits of the ten directions arrived simultaneously.

The men and women of the realm turned their hearts in reverence, their numbers like fine rain or dense mist. The countless hosts pressed upon half the land, causing the earth to sink unevenly, an effect that could not be restrained. Thereupon, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy suspended a single precious pearl, as large as a millet grain, in the dark emptiness of space, five *zhang* above the earth. The Primordial Heavenly Worthy led the Heavenly Perfected Great Spirits, Supreme Sages of the Highest Rank, Wondrously Practiced Realized Ones, and the boundless hosts of the Perfected Great Spirits of the ten directions into the pearl. The heavenly beings gazed upward, seeing only a surging movement as all entered through the pearl’s opening; once inside, their whereabouts became unknown. The people of the realm dispersed, and the earth returned to levelness, no longer uneven or sunken.

Within the pearl, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy completed the full exposition of the sutra. The assembled Perfected oversaw the deliverance and transmitted it to me. At that moment, joy and celebration defied description; the Dharma rites were roughly concluded, and the deities of the manifold heavens returned to their stations. In an instant, all fell silent, leaving no lingering echoes. The heavenly beings who encountered this sutra universally attained salvation, preserving their allotted years without harm. The entire land turned in reverence, all cultivating virtuous minds: refraining from killing or harming, from envy or jealousy, from licentiousness or theft, from greed or desire, from hatred or deceit; their speech bore no ornate falsity, their mouths no harsh words. United in compassion and love, even those of different lineages became kin. The realm knew peace, the people abundance, and all rejoiced in great harmony.

When the sutra first emerged to instruct the realm in the Dao, those who had previously cultivated sincere devotion, reverence, and respect all attained deliverance across the ages. The Dao declared: The words spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy in expounding the sutra comprise the inner names of the Heavenly Thearchs and the hidden rhymes of the heavens, as well as the secret taboos of demon kings and the concealed names of the hundred spirits. They are not the common speech of the world. Only the Supreme Sages who have attained perfection and the Realized Ones who have penetrated the mysteries can fully grasp its verses. Reciting it ten times causes the manifold heavens to chant in response from afar, the ten thousand Emperors to offer rites, rivers and seas to fall silent, mountains and peaks to conceal their clouds, the sun and moon to halt their radiance, the celestial pivots to cease their motion, demon hosts to bind their forms, ghostly spirits to lose their clarity, the dead to rise from their corpses, and white bones to become whole persons.

For those who diligently study this sutra, reciting it ten times will cause the Five Emperors to attend as guards, the Three Realms to bow in reverence, demonic spirits to lose their sight, ghostly beings to lose their clarity, and those on the verge of death to be delivered, snatching life from the jaws of extinction. The reason for this is that the student’s impure qi has not yet dissipated, and their body has not fully realized the Perfected; though they may summon and command the ten directions, their power does not yet govern the celestial administration. Their virtue may subdue and bind earthly demons, restraining and expelling malevolent spirits, but this only averts death—it does not restore life. To recite these verses lightly brings calamity upon oneself. To revere and honor them with offerings causes one’s household to flourish, bringing prosperity across generations, forming good karmic connections, shielding from the ten thousand disasters, and ensuring the protection of divine luminaries at one’s gate.

This sutra is supremely venerable, unmatched in the Jade Capital. It delivers countless beings, serving as the root of the ten thousand Daoist teachings. Its majestic and vast model of virtue is beyond measure.

The Dao speaks: Should one recite this sutra ten times, all the heavens assemble, and the suffering souls of countless generations of ancestors in the dark realms all receive deliverance, ascending to the Vermilion Palace. After nine years of refinement, they undergo transformation and rebirth, becoming noble persons. Those who diligently study this sutra to its fullest, with merits fulfilled and virtue perfected, all attain divine transcendence, soaring to the Golden Gates and roaming the Jade Capital.

Scholars of higher learning who cultivate and recite this sutra shall immediately receive deliverance, ascending to the Southern Palace. For those in the world who recite it, their lifespans extend, and in later times, they all attain the Way of *shijie*, their souls briefly extinguished yet spared from hell, swiftly regaining form to wander the vast heavens. This sutra is subtle and wondrous, universally delivering boundless beings. All heavenly and mortal beings receive immeasurable blessings, their lives and deaths graced with favor. Treasured by the heavens above, it is not transmitted to the lower world. Only the most devoted, bearing gold and treasures, may pledge their hearts to heaven to receive it. To lightly disclose or profane it brings calamity upon nine generations, condemning them to eternal servitude under the ghostly officials.

Twenty-four Jade Lads and twenty-four Jade Maidens attend this sutra, safeguarding its divine script with protective spirits to shield the reciter’s body.

The Dao speaks: During the first month of the year, observe a prolonged fast and recite this sutra to sever the earthly bonds of past generations’ wandering souls, delivering them to the Southern Palace. In the seventh month, observe a prolonged fast and recite this sutra to attain divine transcendence, with one’s name inscribed by the heavens. On the Yellow Register and White Tablet, death is erased and life restored. In the tenth month, observe a prolonged fast and recite this sutra for the sake of kings, emperors, lords, ministers, fathers, and sons, to stabilize the nation’s destiny, preserve the heavens’ longevity, and ensure the lineage endures unbroken, perpetually ruling as sovereigns, securing peace in their lands, with the people proclaiming great harmony.

On the eight seasonal festivals, recite this sutra to become a Perfected One of the Nine Palaces. On one’s natal day, recite this sutra to purify the soul, preserving the myriad *qi* eternally, sparing oneself from suffering, and enveloping the body in radiant light. The Three Realms offer protection, the Five Emperors oversee reception, and ten thousand spirits pay homage. One’s name is inscribed in the heavens above, and with merits fulfilled and virtue perfected, one soars to the Supreme Clarity.

The Dao speaks: On the day of performing the rites, one must bathe in fragrant waters, observe abstinence, and enter the chamber facing east. On the day of recitation, first don proper attire, wash hands and rinse the mouth, then place the sutra upon the table. Thereafter, burn incense, bow in reverence, kneel, and declare one’s intent to recite. Then, facing east, sit upright, burn incense, open the sutra, and read with focused mind and measured gaze, reciting softly. Should one err or falter, return thirty characters and reread, neither hastening nor rushing. To greedily pursue quantity undermines merit, and none should be slighted. Modulate the voice in recitation to harmonize the spirit and soul. Ensure the incense’s fragrance lingers unbroken in the chamber, and thereafter, follow the prescribed methods of visualization and invocation.

Knock the teeth twelve times to resonate with the Thirty-Two Heavens, and bow thirty-two times in the heart. To knock the teeth, bring the upper and lower central teeth together in pairs, producing a clear sound. Internally, this gathers the spirit; externally, it reaches the heavens. As the *Zhen Gao* states: "Knock the teeth thrice to gather the spirit; swallow saliva to harmonize with the true."

Next, visualize bowing to the Thirty-Two Heavens, imagining each celestial emperor as you bow once. Begin from the northeast, proceeding eastward in a leftward circuit, concluding in the northwest. With eyes closed, meditate upon sitting amidst clouds of three colors—azure, yellow, and white. The Mysterious *qi* is azure, the Primordial *qi* is yellow, and the Original *qi* is white. Within and without, all is veiled in mist, with the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, lions, and white cranes arrayed to the left and right. The sun and moon illuminate the chamber, their radiance filling the room. A circular halo emerges from the crown of the head, its light suffusing the ten directions—all must be vividly imagined.

The secret incantation declares:
*Azure Dragon to the left, White Tiger to the right,
Vermilion Bird before, Dark Warrior behind.
Lions in two rows on either side, eight in each,
Facing one another in pairs.
White cranes likewise.
The sun at the left of the brow, the moon at the right,
Their light filling the chamber.
A circular halo from the crown, nine colors interwoven—
Azure, crimson, yellow, white, black, green, red, purple, and gold—
Illuminating the ten directions.
Visualize all clearly, as if seen.*

Then recite the secret incantation silently, moving the lips without sound:
*Tanluo Yuluo, Fuwu Sutuo.
Great Thoroughfare, Supreme Ultimate,
Yin and Yang harmoniously enveloped.
Emerging from existence, entering non-existence,
Born from life, returning to death.
Ghosts and spirits cannot fathom,
Transformations arise naturally.
Primordial Chaos of the Original Beginning,
Mystery within mystery.
Above, it pierces the heavens’ summit;
Below, it penetrates the abyss.
Recite once, and chronic ailments heal.
Refine the soul, bathe the spirit,
True Yang is preserved whole.
With abstinence, reverence, and recitation,
Ten thousand repetitions grant flight to immortality.
The supreme secret incantation,
Ten thousand spirits everlasting.*

Recite the heart incantation repeatedly:
*Tanluo Donglun, Jade Clarity’s Supreme Ultimate.
Nine *qi* intermingle, dividing spirits as they arise.
Descending to infuse the body,
Form and spirit both wondrous.
Transform, ascend, and fly,
All as decreed.
Commanding the ten thousand spirits,
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.*

The Most High Lord of the Dao of the Supreme Mystery, the Three *Qi* of the Primordial Origin, gave rise to the Three Treasures, each dwelling in its own heaven. The Three Heavens reside above the hairline on the human forehead: the Heaven of Pure Tenuity, governed by the Heavenly Treasure Lord; the left is the Heaven of Yu Remnant, governed by the Numinous Treasure Lord; the right is the Heaven of Great Crimson, governed by the Divine Treasure Lord. When reciting the sutra, one must visualize the Three Emperor Lords, summoning the myriad officials within one’s body to emerge.

The Three and Five Merit Officers and Direct Envoys reside in the heart, emerging from the mouth. The Orthodox Unity Merit Officer dwells in the gallbladder, emerging from the left eye. The Healing Merit Officer dwells in the spleen, emerging from the bridge of the nose. The Left Mysterious Merit Officer dwells in the liver, emerging from the right eye. The Right Mysterious Merit Officer dwells in the lungs, emerging from the nose. The Upper Section Merit Officer emerges from between the brows, the Middle Section Merit Officer from the mouth, and the Lower Section Merit Officer from the navel. The Left and Right Official Envoys—the Left Official Envoy dwells in the left flank, and the Right Official Envoy in the right flank.

The Incense-Attending Golden Youth resides between the left brow. The Message-Transmitting Jade Maiden resides between the right brow. The Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans—each of the Five Thearchs corresponds to one of the five viscera, and each has its own Direct Talisman. Additionally, there are the Left Supporter, the Right Supporter, and the Attendant Within. The Incense Officials of the Day each number thirty-six, emerging forth. The Upper, Middle, and Lower Three Realms—each realm has eight officials, totaling twenty-four. The Three Hun and Seven Po, the Yin and Yang Lords, together make thirty-six. Clasp the Jade Emperor’s mudra, shift downward to *chou*, and restrain upward to *si*, then flick them forth.

When presenting one’s petition, if one has received the register of the Dao, state one’s rank accordingly. If one has not yet received the register, declare oneself a devotee of the Dao. The disciple should express wholeheartedly what is in their mind, desiring to speak. Yet it is most noble to be concise and appropriate, silently presenting with utmost sincerity.

Today is an auspicious day of perpetual fasting—on this certain day, one may say “auspicious,” following the day’s designation. If observing perpetual fasting, state so; if not, do not mention it. In the Pure Hall, one cultivates and recites the scriptures. If one knows the covenant of the Three Caverns, and sees the practice being carried out, one may say “cultivating and reciting the scriptures.” If one is not such a person, do not say so, but simply state “reciting the scriptures in the Pure Hall.”

For the immeasurable deliverance of beings, if reciting for a specific matter, state “reciting the scriptures for such-and-such a matter.” If reciting for the hidden souls of the ten directions, one may include the phrase “immeasurable deliverance of beings.” “Your servant and so-and-so (甲, 乙) turn the scriptures to receive rebirth.” If reciting for oneself at ordinary times, say “your servant and ancestors.” If reciting for another, say “your servant for so-and-so,” expressing the names of those involved as appropriate. “So-and-so” refers to the principle of such-and-such a person.

May the sincerity of this petition ascend directly to the presence of the Most High Thirty-Two Heavens’ Primordial Thearch, the August One. The Primordial Thearch here is not the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, but the Supreme Thearch, whose rank is equal to that of the Primordial One. Some say the Primordial Thearch is the Heavenly Worthy.

Once finished, draw in *qi* thirty-two times—“drawing” means inhaling through the nose and swallowing. “Thirty-two times” refers to the eight heavens of each of the four directions, drawing once for each. Draw in the blue-green *qi* of the East, storing it in the liver. Draw in the red *qi* of the South, storing it in the heart. Draw in the white *qi* of the West, storing it in the lungs. Draw in the dark *qi* of the North, storing it in the kidneys. Once the five viscera are thoroughly permeated, then recite the scriptures. Face east when reciting the scriptures—the East is the direction of long life, revered by all heavens.

The format for reciting the scriptures: for the first recitation, begin with the preface and proceed to this visualization. Once finished, recite the subsequent scripture. For the second recitation, begin directly with *The Marvelous Scripture of the Upper Chapters on the Immeasurable Deliverance of Beings*. Every ten recitations constitute one cycle. For exorcisms, supplications, or deliverances, ten recitations are optimal, adhering to the meaning of “delivering beings ten times.” If temporarily interrupted by other matters, or if the recitation lasts somewhat longer, one must return to reciting the preface and performing the visualization as before.

*Thus concludes the first scroll of the talismanic charts of The Marvelous Scripture of the Upper Chapters on the Immeasurable Deliverance of Beings.*

*Beginning of the second scroll of the talismanic charts of The Marvelous Scripture of the Upper Chapters on the Immeasurable Deliverance of Beings.*

The Primordial Cavernous Mystery’s Numinous Treasure’s root chapters, the marvelous head of the upper chapters, deliver beings ten times, conceal the hundred demons in hidden rhymes, and naturally separate and unite.

The Crimson Writ of the Chaotic Cavern

The Primordial began the movement, the Great Mystery initiated the numinous. The Void’s extremity had no form; one *qi* flowed into shape. It transformed and gave birth to the Two Effulgences, the Five Wefts congealed essence. Naturally mixed and united, it forever dispelled the bound embryo. The assembly of perfected beings spread its radiance, resplendent in the Nine Pures. Blazing and expansive, the Seven Epochs aligned. The Master Lu, the Vast, illuminated the Cinnabar Heaven with crystal brilliance. Vermilion light refined and delivered, red mists dispersed luminosity. The Three Flowers flourished luxuriantly, shining upon the Thearch’s dawn. The wondrous transformation of the Great Ultimate—divine and numinous, the Crimson Writ of the Chaotic Cavern.

In former times, the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign descended upon Jade Prosperity Ascending Victory Heaven and transmitted the Numinous Treasure Great Law of the Void Thearch to the Eastern Flower Upper Minister and Cavernous Spirit Grand Master, who oversaw the left officials of the Lower Origin’s register of the living and all the immortals’ officials. The Nine Empyreans’ Total Brahma and Eight Thearchs governed the heavens, for without the Crimson Writ of the Chaotic Cavern, one could not subdue and transform the Nine Yangs and illuminate the celestial deliverance.

Thus, the Jade Pure Void Thearch of the Divine Empyrean’s Jade Pure Heaven rode upon the effulgent *qi* of the Nine Yangs’ pure and void Brahma to form the celestial realm. The Vermilion Empyrean’s Southern Culmen Jade Writ Heaven rode upon the vermilion numinous and wondrous *qi* of the Cavernous Yang’s radiant true and original Brahma to form the celestial realm. The Azure Empyrean’s Great Void True Culmination Heaven rode upon the vast numinous and great effulgent *qi* of the Upper Yang’s original true and numinous Unity to form the celestial realm. The Jade Empyrean’s Jade Numinous Plain Effulgence Heaven rode upon the jade numinous plain effulgent *qi* of the pure Yang’s utmost true and original Unity to form the celestial realm. The Great Empyrean’s Great Numinous True Origin Heaven rode upon the great numinous cavernous effulgent *qi* of the Three Yangs’ Nine Perfected and Great Unity to form the celestial realm. The Lang Empyrean’s Plain Numinous Luminous Origin Heaven rode upon the plain numinous luminous effulgent *qi* of the Six Yangs’ cavernous true and utmost Unity to form the celestial realm. The Purple Empyrean’s Original Numinous Upper Culmination Heaven rode upon the original numinous purple effulgent *qi* of the pure Yang’s wondrous true Heavenly Unity to form the celestial realm. The Scenic Empyrean’s Wondrous Numinous Treasure Effulgence Heaven rode upon the wondrous numinous treasure effulgent *qi* of the radiant Yang’s essence-true and void Unity to form the celestial realm. The Azure Empyrean’s Jade Effulgent Non-Ultimate Heaven rode upon the azure numinous jade effulgent *qi* of the original Yang’s heavenly true and pure Unity to form the celestial realm.

These Nine Empyreans and Nine Heavens were all opened and transformed by the Crimson Writ of the Chaotic Cavern, their luminous and wondrous Brahma’s pure essence and purple cinnabar’s upper numinous splendor forming the celestial talismanic writs and true texts. Thus, the Crimson Writ transformed the Chaotic Cavern, and the Chaotic Cavern transformed the Miro. It is the Dao of the Nine *Qi* of the Heavenly Origin, descending to transform the Nine Causes and the Eight Brahma Perfected Jade Palaces—this too is the transformation of this writ.

Therefore, within the Great Cinnabar Heaven lies the Crimson Bright Thearch’s Palace, the Wondrous Profit City, the Abandoned Worthy World, governed by the Brahma Treasure Cinnabar Numinous Crimson Thearch. Within it are the Vermilion Mound’s Prefecture, the Flowing Fire’s Court, the Great Blaze’s Palace, the Crimson Brightness’s Hall, and the Cinnabar Mound’s Fire Pool.

The Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning refined the true writs in the very place where the Chaotic Cavern’s Crimson Writ transformed into the Brahma. In the heavens, the middle and lower Perfected could not attain this. I now bestow upon you this writ together with the *Chaotic Cavern Brahma Primordial Chart*. After six times nine kalpas, when the cyclical signs align in harmony, the *ren-chen* year will meet its measure, and the *geng-zi* year will govern transformation—naturally, all shall be revealed. Its myriad secrets, its talismanic responses, are all fixed, beyond all reckoning.

The *Chaotic Cavern Crimson Writ Brahma Primordial Chart* arises from the *qi* of the Divine Numinous Jade Treasury, the Three-and-Five Revolving Mechanism, the Central Yellow’s partitioned *qi*, the Nine Heavens’ Chaotic Yang, and the Primordial Brahma’s Miro. It gives birth to the Nine Heavens. The methods it enacts are fully recorded in the *Three-and-Five Revolving Mechanism and Cavern Yang Heavenly Immortal Secret Register*; this text does not exhaustively record them.

The *Chaotic Cavern Crimson Writ Nine Radiances’ Qi Transforming the Nine Heavens Chart*:
At the inception of the Nine Heavens’ portents, it gathered the Cavern Yang’s Nine Radiant *qi*, the Chaotic Cavern’s Crimson Writ, summoned and grasped the Heavenly Origin, divided the numinous, dispersed the *qi*, and thus formed the Nine Heavens. Its profound mysteries are the innermost secrets of the Divine Treasury, of utmost weight—never to be lightly revealed.

The Chaotic Cavern’s Crimson Writ is the Non-Ultimate’s Supreme Perfected. From the Primordial Ancestral Kalpa, it gave birth to the myriad heavens, illumined the Three Luminaries, and became the Root of Heaven. Above, there is no further ancestor—only the Dao is its body. The Five Writs opened and expanded, universally planting the divine and numinous. Without the Writ, there is no radiance; without the Writ, there is no illumination; without the Writ, there is no establishment; without the Writ, there is no completion; without the Writ, there is no deliverance; without the Writ, there is no birth. This is the Great Model, the Heaven within Heaven.

The Dark Mystery’s Flute Terrace, the Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital, the Supreme Ultimate’s Great Peerless Jade Clarity—vast and boundless through kalpas, now present, now absent. The Three Flowers part and separate, the Great Existence’s Wondrous Court, the Golden Gates and Jade Chambers, the vast array of purity and clarity. The great flow of Brahma *qi* circulates through the ten directions. Within it dwell the gods who deliver people from death, the Southern Culmen’s Lord of Longevity, the Controller of the World’s Marshal Great Divinity, the Life-Favoring Elder Lord Han, the Southern Supreme’s Controller of Destiny and Recorder, the Extenders of Lifespan and Augmenters of Years, the Deliverers from Tribulation’s Venerable Divinities—who turn back bones and raise the dead, delivering boundless multitudes.

Today, the celestial records are being reviewed, and the myriad heavens draw near.

They bear nine-colored standards and ten absolute numinous banners, with nine phoenixes wailing ahead and harmonious flutes sounding behind, eight simurghs singing in unison. Lions and white cranes roar and chant in harmony; the Five Elders clear the way, and the host of immortals flank the chariots. Myriad chariots and ten thousand riders float through the void to arrive. Their radiant light turns back, their chariots return, overseeing the Perfected and delivering the living.

The myriad heavens’ chancellors, the Southern Prosperity’s Upper Palace, the Recorder Han, the Overseer of Life’s Great Divinity—holding records and grasping registers—all arrive before the Thearch. According to those who ought to be delivered, they strictly review the myriad heavens and universally proclaim to the Three Realms.

**Universal Proclamation to the Three Realms Talisman**
To the Divine Realm beyond limits, the Yellow Springs’ Curved Prefecture, the Northern Capital’s Fengdu, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the Twelve River Sources—release the ancestral progenitors and karmic kin of a hundred kalpas, swiftly erase their ledgers of transgressions, extinguish their roots of evil, and let them not be detained or pressed into the ghostly throng.

**Primordial Beginning’s Talismanic Mandate**
The Primordial Beginning’s talismanic mandate, at the appointed hour, ascends and advances. The Northern Capital’s Cold Pool guards and protects forms and souls. It subdues demons, ensures promotion, and delivers ranks to the Southern Palace. Dead souls receive refinement and transform into immortals. Living beings receive deliverance and endure through kalpas. Following the kalpas’ revolutions, they share the heavens’ years. Forever delivered from the Three Paths, Five Sufferings, and Eight Tribulations, they transcend the Three Realms and roam freely in the Upper Clarity.

The Upper Clarity’s Heaven, the Heavenly Thearch’s Jade Perfected, the Formless Realm’s Brahma conduct. The Three Realms’ Jade Caskets’ Hidden Secrets. The Four Directions’ General Hidden Secrets. The Three Clarities’ Golden Gates’ Hidden Secrets.

**Yuan Dun Jade Calendar Chapter**
True Yang unfolds transformation, the Brahma of boundless circulation. The Golden Tower stands above, the Jade Palace resides in the east. Five patterns interweave, nine apertures radiate brilliance. The marvelous qi naturally harbors unfathomable mysteries. The Three Numinous Ones together penetrate the myriad sages’ ancestral origin. Examining and verifying cultivation, marking and recording true merit. With spirit fully attuned, one merges with the Dao in unity. Securely stabilizing the imperial registers, enduring for a hundred million kalpas without end.

Of old, in the primordial chaos of Hunyuan, the great Brahma of Miro, before the heavens were divided, the Nine Yangs merged in darkness. Thrice derived, ninefold transformed, six changes and seven revolutions. The Primordial Beginning took form, the Five Kalpas first unfolded. Thereupon, the Lord of the Dao of the Dawn of the Brahma Yuan Ancestor was commanded to record the celestial origin, traversing the Five Kalpas. Thus, *Yuan Dun* clarifies the ancestral qi; the *Jade Calendar* records the celestial origin. Five kalpas complete a cycle, returning to the One. From the One qi’s transformation and division, thrice derived to form nine—like dragons, like serpents, coiling through nine paths. Vast and boundless, it encompasses the primordial qi of the Nine Yangs. The Supreme One, through the threefold ninefold Brahma operation and the threefold fivefold primordial reckoning, combined forty-two qi to inaugurate the Azure Heaven. The qi of the Yuan Ancestor brightened, the eastern beginning of the Azure Primordial responded to the initial flourishing of the Nine Yangs’ Wood Thearch. Thus, the East received nine qi to divide the celestial realm, the kalpa named Longhan.

Next, the ninefold derivation repeated, the yang qi unfolded and brightened. Vermilion patterns flowed with light, spreading across the five measures, unfolding the charts and cinnabar writings. The Supreme One, through threefold fivefold reckoning and threefold revolutions of vermilion essence, combined twenty-four qi to inaugurate the Vermilion Heaven’s Yuan Ancestor qi. Illuminating the southern beginning of the Vermilion Primordial, it responded to the initial flourishing of the Three Yangs’ Fire Thearch. Thus, the South received three qi to divide the celestial realm, the kalpa named Chiming.

Next, the ninefold derivation accumulated again, the Central Yellow transformed the primordial. Heavenly wefts coiled and encircled, the Brahma Yuan rode the fivefold. The Supreme One, through fivefold fivefold threefold revolutions, blended the twelve yangs, combining fifty-two qi to inaugurate the Central Yellow Heaven’s Yuan Ancestor qi. Illuminating the central numinous Yellow Flower’s radiance, it responded to the initial flourishing of the Five Yangs’ Earth Thearch. Thus, the Central Realm received twelve qi to divide the celestial realm, the kalpa named Shanghuang.

Next, the ninefold primordial repeated, the pristine luminosity inaugurated the yang. Sevenfold brightness illumined the Brahma, fivefold wefts rode the heavens. The Supreme One, through sevenfold fivefold threefold reckoning, combined thirty-six blacks to inaugurate the Pristine Numinous Heaven’s Yuan Ancestor qi. Illuminating the western radiance of the White Flower, it responded to the initial flourishing of the Seven Yangs’ Metal Thearch. Thus, the West received seven qi to divide the celestial realm, the kalpa named Yankang.

Next, the ninefold derivation completed its cycle, transformation merged and returned to the origin, the One qi inaugurated brightness. The Supreme One, through twofold fivefold reckoning and thirteenfold accumulation of primordial yang, combined thirty qi to inaugurate the Northern Mysterious Heaven’s Yuan Ancestor qi. Illuminating the supreme luminosity of the Dark Mystery, it responded to the initial flourishing of the One Yang’s Water Thearch. Thus, the North received five qi to divide the celestial realm, the kalpa named Kaihuang.

Thus, the Five Kalpas having completed their cycle, the vast heavens took form.

One qi merged with the Dao, eight realms streamed with light;
Three accumulations, ninefold reckoning—eight directions unfurled their radiance.
Eight Thearchs manifested form, nine heavens divided their transformations.
Thus, the Primordial Celestial Venerable commanded the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign to inscribe the Jade Chronicle, recording the inception of the Cavernous Undifferentiated Transformation, the foundational cycles of kalpas and revolutions, the division of celestial realms, and the coalescence of the Cavernous Primordial Upright Yang qi into the Jade Chronicle. Therein were marked the kalpic revolutions of Heavenly Perfected Ones and Heavenly People, the path of merit’s ascent and retreat, and the nine grades of the Nine Sages.

These profound mysteries reside within the Jade Treasury, with further details expounded in *The Wondrous Ninefold Registers of the Nine Daoist Mysteries of the Grand Tenuity*.

Eight luminances obscurely merged, qi entered the Profound Mystery.
Within the Mystery, the Grand Supreme Thearch, the Lofty Perfected.
Floating upon the Grand Rosy Clouds, chanting and intoning the Cavernous Stanzas.
Golden Perfected’s fragrance wafted, flowing echoes through cloudy encampments.
Jade tones gathered qi, numinous winds amassed mists.

Within the Perfected dwelled the divine, the Great Lord of Longevity:
Lord Wu Ying, Venerable Bai Yuan, Grand Monad Controller of Destiny, Peach Prosperity and Longevity.
Grasping talismans, holding registers, preserving life and rooting destiny.
Roaming the Supreme Clarity, entering and exiting the Flowery Chambers.
Within the Eight Obscurities, amidst the subtle and minute.
Below, they governed the human body—Mud Pill Palace and Crimson Palace;
Centering, they ordered the Five qi, harmonizing the hundred spirits.
Ten revolutions returned the numinous, the myriad qi ascended as immortals.
The immortal path prized life, boundlessly delivering beings.
Above, the Eight Gates were opened, the Flying Celestial Dharma Wheel.
Sins and blessings, prohibitions and precepts, karmic destinies and causes.
Universally receiving deliverance, the dead souls embodied life.
Once the body received life, it ascended to hear the myriad heavens.
Above the myriad heavens, each had its Gate of Life.
Within dwelled the *Empty Cavern’s Hymns and Songs*, the *Mara King’s Numinous Scroll*—their verses matched the Lofty Perfected.

The First Aerial Melody of the Desire Realm: The Demon King’s name is Yumo.
The human path is distant and faint, the immortal path vast and boundless.
The ghostly path delights—yet it is the Gate of Human Life.
The heavenly path treasures life, the ghostly path treasures death.
The immortal path is ever auspicious, the ghostly path ever inauspicious.
The lofty, pure, and numinous soar, their mournful songs resounding through the great void.
I only wish the immortal path to flourish, not the human path to wither.
In the Northern Capital’s Yellow Springs and Crooked Mansion, a myriad ghosts gather,
All seeking to cut short human destiny, to sever the Gate of Human Life.
Ah! Sing the Cavern’s Hymns to subdue the Northern Feng of Luo.
Before dispatching the demonic spirits, sever the blades of the Six Ghosts.
The qi of the myriad heavens surges boundlessly—my Dao daily ascends in glory.

The Second Melody of the Form Realm’s Demon King: The Demon King’s name is Moluo.
Lofty and expansive, luminous qi spreads in all four directions,
The Brahma-conduct of the heavens encircles the ten directions.
The boundless great spirits all arise from my body.
I possess the Cavern’s Hymns—recite them ten thousand times to attain immortality.
The immortal path values deliverance, the ghostly path clings to it.
Heaven and earth stretch vast and dim, foul qi swirls thickly.
The Three Realms delight—pass beyond them to abide forever.
Cross my realm, and your body enters spontaneity.
At this moment of joy, how slight is my grace!
The Dragon Han eon surges boundlessly—how can one distinguish the true?
My realm is hard to cross, so I compose the Cavern’s Scriptures.
Transforming and soaring through the void, I test your body.
Success or failure, slackening or retreat—how few are those who cross!
Laughing at those who fail to cross, I sing this melody.

The Third Melody of the Formless Realm’s Demon King: The Demon King’s name is Shao.
Above the Three Realms, the vast and distant Great Luo,
Beyond the roots of form, clouds layer in towering peaks.
Only the Primordial Beginning dwells in the House of Vast Kalpas.
My realm is ordered and governed, inheriting the Mysterious Capital.
Those who transgress my realm enter the Jade Void.
I, the supreme king, rectify and command the host of demons.
Ten thousand transformations in the void, foul qi blooms in profusion.
Few preserve the true—many are deluded.
The immortal path is hard to secure, the ghostly path easy to stray.
The human path lies in the heart—truly, it does not depend on others.
The immortal path values substance, the human path values splendor.
If you do not delight in the immortal path, how can you pass the Three Realms?
Should you wish to turn the Five Paths, what can I do for you?

Above these Three Realms, amidst the soaring void,
The demon kings’ melodies harmonize with the Cavern’s Hymns.
Recite them a hundred times, and your name ascends to the Southern Palace;
A thousand times, and the demon kings safeguard and welcome you;
Ten thousand times, the Dao is perfected, and you soar into the great void.
Crossing the Three Realms, you ascend to the rank of Immortal Elder.
Those who hear the numinous melodies—the demon kings show reverence in form.
They command the earth spirits,
Issuing talismans to command the earth spirits,
Escorting and welcoming, delivering from the earthly prisons,
Rescuing from the Five Sufferings and Eight Hardships, raising the seven generations of ancestors,
Forever departing the ghostly bureaus.
The soul crosses the Vermilion Mound, undergoes refinement, and is reborn—
This is called boundless deliverance, universal salvation without end.

There are secret celestial texts, revered by all heavens.
Those who leak or slight them fall into hell, their misfortune extending to the seven generations of ancestors.

Recite the Cavern’s Hymns—
The Vermilion and Yellow of Tortoise Mountain, the Flying Mystery of the Purple Script—
This is the true text of the Cavern’s Hymns, the very one the Form Realm’s Demon King called "my Cavern’s Hymns."
The Flying Mystery’s purple qi congeals the numinous root,
The net of Jade Numinosity binds the myriad spirits.
In the void, it seethes and coalesces naturally,
Above, twelve layered mounds transmit it.
Jade towers towering, radiant with luminous clouds,
Flowing essence in the purple watchtowers, girded with golden chariots.
Resplendent jasper terraces encircled by eight soaring qi,
Within dwell the Nine Numinous Immortals of Azure Gold.
The Vermilion and Yellow True Mother is called Jingyan,
Wearing a flying azure feathered robe and a morning infant’s crown.
In her left hand, she holds a jade scepter and grasps the numinous banner,
The Five-Colored Life Demon faces the Imperial Honored One.
Holding the talismanic registers before the Gate of Life,
She chews the sun and moon, sips the Jade Spring.
Radiance from Li and Luo refines the five souls,
Internally full, externally overflowing, the Crimson Talisman rejoices.
Golden light shines brilliantly, the form perfectly round,
From the new moon it enters the golden hue, turbid and indistinct.
Only the Enlightened One understands these words,
The fifth day of the fifth month, the essence of the Northern Origin.
Carved and seen, the Flowery Canopy leads the Immortal Lords,
Purple qi swirls leftward, linking with the Dipper.
Passing through the twenty-eight lunar lodges to enter the Golden Gate—
This is where the Vermilion Emperor reviews the myriad immortals.
Those who clearly understand this secret and apply diligent effort,
Unfolding their forms and contemplating deeply, always discerning,
Will perceive the wondrous scenes and attain the essential text.
In three years, they will surely secure long life.
In nine years, they will ride the void, donning feathered skirts,
Lightly soaring in phoenix robes to ascend Dragon Mountain.
Looking up and down, they pay homage to the Nine Numinous Ones and the Jade Dawn,
Merging with spontaneity to pay court to the Highest Clarity.

Cultivate this Dao in the first, second, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, eleventh, and twelfth months—
Ten months in a year.
On the third, fifth, ninth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of each month—
Five times a month—
Purify and fast, reciting the Mystery Text once.
After midnight, step into the central courtyard, gaze upward, and contemplate the Flowery Canopy within the Northern Dipper,
Where purple cloud qi emerges from the Dipper, swirling leftward,
Passing through the twenty-eight lunar lodges to return above the Golden Gate.
If among humans the sky is overcast and lightless,
Contemplate within the chamber as prescribed, ensuring clarity.
After contemplation, bow four times to the purple cloud at heart,
Knock the teeth three times, and intone while gazing upward:
*"The night sky is bright and clear, the hidden and void reveal the true.
Flowing clouds linger, golden blossoms bestow their grace.
The Vermilion Emperor spreads his radiance, numinous flight in the purple chariot.
This evening unfolds, Azure Gold receives the immortals.
Fulfill my lofty wish, may my body accord with spontaneity.
Bind the life to the moon’s essence, safeguard the years and days’ root.
The Three Numinous Ones merge with the scene, forever abiding on Dragon Mountain.
In the secret night, pure and unveiled, I request as spoken."*
Finish, then knock the teeth, drawing in purple qi twenty-eight times before stopping.

Practice this for three years, and there will be signs of divine descent upon your sleeping mat.
Your body will be enveloped in purple qi, a single form interwoven with light,
Your name inscribed in the Nine Heavens—you will surely attain the rank of Highest Immortal.
When purple cloud qi appears in the heavens,
Drying the sun and moon, dividing the five stars,
In the lands of their directions, there will be those who unite with the Dao.

The lord who attains immortality—
such is the mark of this noble one, whose sign appears of itself.
When you see the purple cloud, then follow the text and perform the rites of invocation,
without needing to wait for the appointed day.
Apply yourself with diligence, and when the cloud descends at the appointed time,
there will be an ascension and a meeting.

This must be held within the heart alone;
do not lightly reveal it to others.
If the Dao is leaked, its numen scatters,
and the immortal qi will have no means to take form.
As with Master Wen Shi, Lord Yin,
who attended the Golden Gates—
the Sage Lord set him as the standard.

Take heed of these signs and strive to practice them.
The Dao says: These two chapters are the hidden voices of the Heavenly Thearchs of all heavens
and the most numinous demon kings,
all words of the Great Brahmā,
not the common speech of the world.
Their words lack ornate rhythm,
their melodies lack florid grace.
Thus are they profound and obscure,
difficult to fathom in detail.
They are treasured by the heavens above,
concealed in the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace of Mystic Capital.
According to the Mystic Statutes, they are transmitted but once in forty thousand kalpas.
If there be a perfected one whose heart is as steadfast as metal,
who follows the ancient protocols and pledges oaths to the Ten Heavens,
only then shall they be entrusted.

The Dao says: The revolutions of heaven and earth, too, have their ends in adversity.
The sun, moon, and five stars, too, have their waxings and wanings.
Even the most sagely and divine beings have their times of flourishing and decline.
And those of shallow learning, too, have their afflictions and harms.

Whenever such calamities arise, those of shared qi must unite in heart to perform purification rites, burn incense in the six periods of the day, and recite the scriptures ten times over—whereupon virtue and power descend at once, dispelling all inauspicious omens. These boundless texts universally deliver limitless beings.

The Dao says: Those of shallow learning in the Way, or whose immortal rank remains unfulfilled, when their destined time of passing arrives, shall traverse the Great Yin. At the hour of their departure, fellow perfected ones of shared learning shall burn incense and recite the scriptures ten times, thereby delivering the bodily form according to the proper method. The hun-soul shall ascend directly to the Southern Palace, where, in accordance with the merit of their practice, they shall be reborn after a reckoning of days. Having thus transmigrated without annihilation, they shall attain the immortals’ ranks.

The Dao says: When the revolutions of heaven and earth reach their end, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures. When the stellar lodges fall into disarray and the sun and moon lose their proper course, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures. When the four seasons lose their order and yin and yang fall out of harmony, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures. When the sovereign faces calamity and warfare erupts on all sides, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures. When pestilence spreads and the multitudes perish, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures. When a teacher or companion passes from this life, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures.

For the merit of purification rites and scripture recitation is most weighty: above, it dissolves heavenly calamities and safeguards the emperor; below, it wards off poison and harm, delivering the multitudes. In life and death, all depend upon it—its blessings are beyond measure, and thus it is called the boundless universal deliverance of heaven and humanity.

The Dao says: Whoever possesses these scriptures and performs such meritorious deeds for heaven, earth, the sovereign, and the multitudes—on the day of calamity, if they resolve in heart to perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures ten times—shall have their names recorded by all the heavens, with ten thousand spirits attending in guard. Those distinguished as perfected ones shall thereby become ministers of the Golden Gates of the Sagely Lord. The heavens record the merits and transgressions of humanity without the slightest error. The demon kings of heaven shall also safeguard your person, and those who attain the Way shall come to comprehend these most profound teachings.

The boundless hidden speech of the Great Brahma in the heavens,
The Central Chapter of the Numinous Writ of the Primordial Beginning,
Composed by the Dao Lord of the Eastern Eight Heavens.

The Primal Venerable Azure, the Harmonious Contemplator of Sound.
The Radiant Head of Xuanyan, the Dharma-Grasping Bodhi-Tam.
Jiana Ayu, the Sudden Chant of Huhaluo.
The Curved Splendor of Huadu, the Fresh Bodhi-Blossom Attained.
The Falling Great Brahma, scattering mist and felicitous clouds.
Flying and sprinkling upon the Jade Capital, the Luminous Demons ascend the gate.
The Peerless Foremost of Non-Action, the Revolving Tread of Flowing Mystery.
Adhara and Nāga-Rāja, the Four Symbols sigh in harmony.

**Eastern Numinous Script**
Knock the teeth nine times, visualize the nine-colored dragons guiding before and behind, with nine layers of azure clouds enveloping the body.

Penetrating heaven and earth, uniting with me in transcendence.
Driving the dragon-chariot, ascending to the imperial axle."*
Upon completion, draw in qi and swallow nine times.
Practicing for nine years, the eight heavens each dispatch eight azure-waisted jade maidens and eight azure-flower jade lads to attend the body, bestowing the essence of the nine azure numina. The body’s radiance shines through the formless void. After ten thousand recitations, the Dao is accomplished, and one gains the power of flight. Seven generations of ancestors share the blessing, all ascending to the Southern Palace.

**Southern Eight Heavens**
The Southern Yan-Dong-Floating Realm, where jade pupils gleam.
Brahma-forms descend from the void, the Nine Numinous Ones advance.
The Lotus Terrace of Ze-Luo, the vast green net of the great kalpa.
The distant and boundless Nine Uglies, the melodious chants winding on.
The Nine Capitals above the clouds, where flying life soars of itself.
Nayū’s lush fragrance, the demonic Mara’s dharma subdued.
Holding the mirrorless brightness, grasping posture and moving countenance.
Fragrant and resplendent, the divine tassels adorn the self-palace.

**Southern Numinous Script**
Knock the teeth three times, visualize the Vermilion Bird and phoenix soaring before and behind, with three layers of crimson clouds enveloping the body.
Recite the esoteric incantation:
*"The three qi linger and circle, the numinous phoenix comes flying.
The jade sounds of eight characters, blazing in the Purple Tenuity.
Auspicious day, great celebration—my Dao opens wide.
Crimson cinnabar and sweet nectar, I gaze upward to absorb the numinous radiance.
Body born of water and fire, clad in scarlet feathered robes.
Ascending the void in flying steps, treading the phoenix ladder.
Circling the eight heavens, seven generations of ancestors commune."*
Upon completion, draw in qi and swallow three times.
Practicing for three years, the eight heavens each dispatch eight Great Cinnabar Jade Maidens and eight Great Yang Jade Lads to attend the body, descending the essence of the three crimson luminosities. The complexion reverses to youthful whiteness. After ten thousand kalpas, it remains unaged; seven generations of ancestors transcend and ascend, entering the Hall of Blessings. Returning to the immortal lineage, one is reborn anew.

**Western Eight Heavens**
The Dao-Li Chan-You, the Po-Ni Fault-Passing.
The winding marsh’s purified hues, the hall of the vast and distant.
The flowing net of Brahma-sprouts, the radiant luxuriance of Xiao-Yu.
The distant and boundless, the silent—where the winding heads and young capitals dwell.
Alam and Yuzhu, the blossoming desert’s extended reason.
The nine openings discern themselves, the Anāpāna’s foremost.
The immeasurable supporting canopy, the floating net uniting with the spirit.
Jade saliva and long mulberries, the cypress void ferrying immortals.

**Western Numinous Script**
Knock the teeth seven times, visualize the White Tiger and lion guiding left and right, with seven layers of white clouds enveloping the body.
Recite the esoteric incantation:
*"The seven qi of golden numina, the honored spirits of the eight heavens.
The White Tiger spurs the chariot, the lion bears the axle.
The seven qi entwine, refining me into an immortal.
Body ascending in golden light, reflecting the white clouds.
Inner and outer transformations, ascending into the cavern gate.
Seven generations of ancestors emerge from the night, the nine dark realms’ souls revolve.
After a hundred million kalpas, they open the path—following the movement, eternally preserved."*
Upon completion, draw in qi and swallow seven times.
Practicing for seven years, the eight heavens each dispatch eight White Numinous Jade Lads to attend the body, descending the fumigation of the seven qi of Great Simplicity. Age halts, and the worldly countenance remains youthful for ten thousand kalpas. When the seven generations of ancestors ascend to the Southern Palace, returning to the immortal lineage, they are reborn anew, generation after generation as immortals.

**Northern Eight Heavens**
The self-nurturing Juewu, the nine suns guiding Qian.
The Mother of Kun covering the east, her form embracing the upper mystery.
The distant and vast Tuoluo, the subtle qi merging with the clouds.
The flying heavens’ great uglies, overseeing the upper heavens.
The Shatuo kalpa-measure, the dragon’s Han radiance.
The azure vault’s floating Li, the empty songs preserving the precious.
The evil Yi’s primordial rank, the cavern’s wondrous self-truth.
The primordial Brahma’s vast desert, the secluded and silent ferry of humanity.

**Northern Numinous Script**
Knock the teeth five times, visualize the flying tortoise and feathered canopy flourishing left and right, with five layers of black clouds enveloping the body. Divine lads and jade maidens in feathered robes and flying garments attend the body.
Recite the esoteric incantation:
*"The heavens linger in primordial circling, the flowing radiance of the Upper Clarity."*

The Great Possession Initiates the Movement, the Eight Characters Ascend in Brilliance.
The flying heavens clarify the void, the cavernous yin spontaneously arises.
The five qi entwine and coil, irrigating my form.
Crowned and girded with the Northern Unlined, receiving refinement from the cavernous numina.
The kidney palace issues forth to the north, inner and outer luminous essence.
Soaring through the Three Realms, roaming and feasting in the Purple Court.
Seven ancestors rejoice together, delighting in kalpa-long ages.
Within the Seven Treasures Grove, reborn through returning to the womb.
Emerging from the Long Night, names recorded in the Southern Palace.
Yellow Registers and White Tallies, immortals born generation after generation.
Upon concluding the incantation, draw qi and swallow five times, then cease. Practicing this for five years, each of the Eight Heavens dispatches eight Jade Lads of the Great Primordial to attend and guard the body.
They bestow the numinous essence of the five qi’s refinement, restoring years and preserving radiance, safeguarding life in the Three Clarities. Joy extends to the seven ancestors, immortals born generation after generation.

The Dao states: Among these heavens, the great Brahma’s hidden speech and the boundless sounds of ancient script were all a full *zhang* in length. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign of Old inscribed these characters to establish the correct intonation. Those who know these sounds and can recite them in unison will have the flying heavens and divine kings descend to observe their form, record their meritorious diligence, and submit it to the heavens above. Myriad spirits pay homage, earthly numina attend at the gates. Great Merit Demon Kings advocate for their ascent as immortals. With the Dao perfected and attained, they may roam the Three Realms and ascend through the Golden Gate. These sounds repel all, exorcise all, deliver all, and accomplish all. They are the Heavenly Perfected’s natural sounds. Thus, reciting them summons the flying heavens to descend, while the Emperor from afar intones, myriad spirits pay homage, the Three Realms attend in reverence, and all demonic hordes submit. Ghostly essences perish of themselves, the jade-like resonance vibrates. The ten directions grow solemn and clear, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks swallow their mists, and all numina tremble in submission. Gathering the assembled immortals, the heavens are free of miasmic filth, the earth devoid of demonic dust. Profound wisdom illumines the cavernous clarity, the vast measure is profoundly mysterious.
