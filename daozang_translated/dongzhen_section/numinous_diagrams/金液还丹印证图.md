**Preface to the Golden Elixir Reversion Alchemy Verification Diagram**
Composed by Longmeizi:

*"I once exchanged death for life through alchemical refinement—
My name was inscribed on jade tablets, yet remained obscure.
Seeking a master and pursuing the Dao,
My heart found harmony only in the alchemical scriptures.

Good and evil lie within the self;
Ascension and decline depend on one’s own efforts.

Observing the *Total Immortals* tradition,
I learned that from antiquity onward,
Ten thousand have ascended in spirit,
Eight thousand have relocated their dwellings.
Was this solely due to innate endowment?
Or did they achieve it through diligent practice?

If Huangdi was born divine and spiritually luminous,
It was by Heaven’s bestowal.
Yet if Jingyang refined his Dao to perfection,
Was it not through human effort?

One must await the exhaustion of evil karma
Before virtuous transformation takes root.

Some encountered the Dao while guarding the pass,
Others while crossing the sea,
Some through trials with demons grew only firmer in resolve,
Others endured tests without faltering in aspiration.
Obtaining it was arduous, yet cultivation demanded precision—
Refining in the grand halls of Hongdu,
Retreating beneath Taihua and Songshan.

Some dispersed in the red dust of the world,
Like Li Tao’s eight hundred or Anqi’s three thousand.
Others soared in broad daylight,
Like Zixia’s phoenix flight or Qin Gao’s control of the turtle.
Some loathed the world and achieved *shixie* (corpse dissolution),
Others remained in the world while preserving their form,
Some master-disciple pairs ascended together,
Others saw ancestral and descendant lines all attain transcendence.

Some found it difficult to obtain but easy to perfect,
Others found it easy to obtain but difficult to perfect.
The records are complete—
No exaggeration can be added.

From childhood, I devoted myself to the pursuit of emptiness and purity,
Seeking widely among schools, unable to distinguish truth from falsehood.
For three generations, I studied under a hundred masters,
Yet all my learning came only after profound awakening.
How could such rare matters be achieved with ease?

To ride the crane in leisurely flight,
One must first gather the alchemical funds.
The vulgar scoff at this,
While the sage remains silent.

A misstep of a hair’s breadth
Can lead to a thousand-li error.
If Heaven’s secrets are carelessly revealed,
The lineage’s guilt will extend to posterity,
And the untransmitted Dao will weigh heavily upon me.

I hesitated to speak, yet could not desist.
If the mysteries are hidden in the profound,
Why not lay out their broad outlines?

Thus, I recorded my master’s teachings
And illustrated them in diagrams.
The **Nine Chapters of External Alchemy** exhaust the subtleties of elixir crafting.
The **Nine Chapters of Internal Alchemy** detail the nurturing of the elixir.

The alchemist must have a source—
Thus, there is the **Original Foundation**.
With the foundation comes generation—
Thus, there is **Heaven and Earth**.
Using Heaven and Earth for refining—
Thus, there are **cauldrons and vessels**.
The vessels hold medicinal substances—
Thus, there is **lead and mercury**.
Lead and mercury must be measured precisely—
Thus, there is **harmonization**.
Harmonization produces the **yellow sprout**—
Thus, there is **true soil**.
The alchemical adept values extraction—
Thus, there is **collection**.
The process follows established methods—
Thus, there is **regulation**.
Crafting requires like-minded companions—
Thus, there is **assistance**.

This pertains to **External Alchemy**,
Illustrating the **Nine Chapters of Alchemical Force**.

After collection, one must ingest the elixir—
Thus, there is **elixir ingestion**.
Upon completion, one must temper and nourish—
Thus, there are the **Nine Cauldrons**.
Nourishment relies entirely on fire—
Thus, there is **fire progression**.
Fire has phases of advance and retreat—
Thus, there is **fire retreat**.
Advance and retreat follow medicinal symbols—
Thus, there is **withdrawal and addition**.
Advance and retreat require rest—
Thus, there is **bathing**.
After bathing, the elixir is complete—
Thus, there is the **Golden Elixir**.
Though the elixir is formed, the nature may not yet be perfected—
Thus, there is **embracing the Primordial**.
Guarding the One and embracing the Primordial,
Life is secured, nature penetrates,
The form ascends to Heaven’s gate,
And one attains the rank of True Person—
Thus, there is **Returning to the Primordial**.

This pertains to **Internal Alchemy**,
The **Nine Chapters of Elixir Nurturing**.

Once elixir ingestion is complete,
One must temper the fire for a year,
Piercing the interplay of yin and yang,
Contracting and conserving the seasons,
Plundering **27,360,000** units of vital *qi*,
And returning to the **913,724,680** treasures of the宝.
Thus, lifespan becomes boundless,
And though the allotted span may decay,
One must harmonize self and other,
Merge color and emptiness,
Awaken to the naturalness of the Primordial,
And attain the true awareness of the source.

In motion, one plays in ease;
In stillness, one enters the Great Void,
Achieving the vehicle of no obstruction,
And eternally returning to the original source.

Uniting past enlightenment with future return,
This makes **twenty chapters** in total.

Appended are **Four and Five Companions’ External Alchemy Practices**,
To connect beginning and end,
Interweave the text,
And guide the lost.
Thus, one may distinguish truth from falsehood,
And separate true adepts from false scholars.

Placed at the end for careful study,
This is not meant as a model for the accomplished,
But as a verification for later learners.

Composed on the first day of the eleventh month, *Gengyin* (戊寅) of the *Jiawu* (甲午) year of *QingSong Jia定* (嘉定),
By Longmeizi.

**The Golden Elixir Reversion Alchemy Verification Diagram**
This diagram was personally received by my predecessor, Yuxian,
As a handwritten original from the ancestral master, Longmeizi.
**Do not show this to others.**
Treasure it!
Cherish it!

*—Recorded by Wuning Wang Jingxuan (武宁王景玄) in the *Ending Peace* era (端平甲午).*

**The Primordial Source**
Before the murk of chaos held no light,
The wind-wheel churned and forged true lead.
When stillness reaches its utmost peak,
Motion springs forth—boundless becomes finite.

Qi, in its essence, first takes form from void,
The Two Principles revolve within the fixed.
Endless transformation knows no end,
A world of wonders brewed within the cauldron’s heaven.

**Awakening**
Discarding the corpse, I turn to gaze—
Mountains of sorrow, waves of endless tears.
Though worlds dissolve, their ruin is inevitable,
And mortal life, like pinched fingers, fleeting joy.
Born male, then female, in endless change,
Horned, furred—through myriad forms I roam.
Unless this life’s cycle awakens me,
What then remains to see?

**Heaven and Earth**
Before differentiation, the Undivided Whole—
Clear and turbid split, the Two Symbols complete.
Yin’s female, Yang’s male, yet one in essence,
Wood-Dragon and Metal-Tiger span the ages.
Modifying solitude to seek the Dao,
How could rigid-yielding forge the Mysterious?
Daily life ignores the inverted logic—
Only those who grasp this are true Immortals.

**The Cauldron**
Refining elixirs depends on furnace and cauldron,
Their forms must mirror Heaven and Earth’s model.
Round, five trigrams encircle, diameter one,
Lips four eights, belly’s navel spread.
To refine lead, first stabilize the mind,
Let Yang-fire surge from below.
Without a master’s direct instruction,
How shall you grasp the Mysterious pivot?

**Lead and Mercury**
Lead emerges from white gold, mercury from sand.
Alchemists boast of these as true medicines.
Yet if gold and stone are the genuine cure,
Why sow seeds and dance for hemp’s long stalks?
The Yellow Male within the Abyss is mercury’s ancestor,
The Dark Female in the Flame is lead’s kin.
Distinguish clearly true from false—
True lead resembles a horse’s tooth.

**Harmonization**
The Eight and Two stem from pure, correct One.
Do not say equal parts mean average balance.
Where Yin and Yang harmonize,
Consult the Child, Midday, and Applicator.
At the Hour of the Dragon, use the Hour of the Snake,
At the Hour of the Boar, seek the Hour of the Tiger.
When their influences merge into Three and Five,
The Central Yellow yields the utmost truth.

**True Soil as True Lead’s Yellow Sprout**
Primordial Black is true lead—do not trust deceivers’ claims.
Ten thousand transformations hint at verdant omens,
One spirit flees unless restrained.
Formed substance is not the genuine essence,
Formless substance alone is the Mysterious.
Tell the Dao-seekers to study diligently—
Do not mistake common lead for the true.

**Procurement**
At midnight, crimson light illuminates the Northern Sea,
A single gold elixir grain—perfect, round.
Without knowing how to gather, you miss the profound,
Wasting your ascent into the Celestial Clarity.
The crane’s wings stiffen with frost,
The toad’s fat thrives on moonlight’s glow.
Relying on qi’s resonance, the sword is wielded—
Seized upon the palm, the moment arrives.

**Ritual Setup**
Build the altar in three tiers: Heaven, Earth, Man.
Arrange the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams evenly.
Suspend the mirror above and below to command spirits,
Array the sword at the four cardinals to subdue demons.
With the Step of Yu, the Three Realms fall silent,
Stars appear as fingers point—hundreds of spirits gather.
Chime the clepsydra without error,
Every moment’s labor blooms into aeons of spring.

**Assistants**
Aides must harmonize in voice and purpose—
Three minds as one, mutually supporting.
The leader sits first, overseeing the cauldron’s arrangement,
The assistant attends to furnace and tools.
Verify the cauldron’s lead and mercury—dragon and tiger leap.
Adjust the qi and climate, both martial and civil.
Clarify beginning and end,
Rely on the disciples to call out precisely.

**Ingesting the Elixir**
Seizing the Yellow Sprout in your palm,
Swiftly swallow—do not delay.
Mercury’s mist envelops your body,
Lead’s yang captures the spirit like a bird in a cage.
Longing for reunion is no different from a child seeking its mother,
Harmony mirrors male meeting female.
Refine the fire’s timing with utmost care,
A ten-month gestation yields boundless life.

**The Nine Cauldrons**
The elixir’s secret art transcends mortals,
Six hundred verses name the Nine Methods.
Yu’s model terrified the deceitful,
The Yellow Emperor’s casting perfected the Dao.
Timing must align with the alchemists’ laws,
After ingestion, avoid carrion’s stench.
Seasons shift in cycles, returning anew,
When refined, the dragon’s form comes to welcome.

**Igniting the Fire**
At the Hour of the Child, ignite; at the Hour of the Geng, conceal—
This is the morning’s fire-ignition chapter.
Respond to Yin and Yang in silent accord,
Regulate breath’s inflow and outflow with gentle persistence.
Two hundred sixteen hexagrams,
Coinciding with *Complexion*, *Central Peace*, *Great Achievement*, and *Heaven*.
The clepsydra must not falter—timing is precise,
Flames blaze as the red lotus unfurls.

**Retreating the Fire**
At the Hour of the Horse, one hundred forty-four stars—
This is the Yin-Symbol’s fire-retreat sequence.
Tame the ice’s rigidity from the outset,
Conceal and store as Earth reaches fullness.
General effects only increase abundance,
The Two Qi’s division shows decay and flourishing.
Reduce the fire, retreat the symbol—Heaven and Earth grow still,
*Layered* and *Young Growth* hexagrams govern creation.

**Adding and Drawing**
Each cycle of fire-ignition brings Yang’s return—
Dragon and Tiger spiral, crimson light radiates.
Yin’s shadow and lead hide with the sun’s decline,
Yang’s spirit and mercury thrive with the times’ favor.
Handle the ash’s essence with utmost caution,
Impatience invites disaster like the hare’s peril.
Draw lead, add mercury—fire alone suffices,
Beyond this, no other method exists.

**Returning to the Primordial**
Form and spirit both perfect—Dao’s disciples,
Nature and life united with the Great Void.

**Divine Edict and Ascension**

When the precious edict descends, the crane-drawn chariot soars,
After bowing to the jade scroll, the dragon-carriage ascends.
Celestial officials gleam in splendor—who dares compare their rank?
In this turbid age, I endure the cauldron’s torment, dwelling like a hare.

Accumulate virtue, diligently seek—meeting is inevitable.
Tell me, why do you still hesitate?

**Returning to the Primordial**
South is non-South, East is non-East,
One essence, wondrously complete, inherently boundless.

The wise and the vulgar differ not in essence,
Saint and commoner share the same source.

Call red "crimson" by nature’s habit,
Name "Mother" as "Mama"—sharp as a whetstone’s edge.

All conditioned things are ultimately unreal,
Awaken to the true source—void yet not void.

**Alchemical Practice**
The Water Male and Fire Female,
These are the Yellow Sprouts’ sovereigns—
Heaven and Earth’s primordial seeds,
The ancestral roots of the Five Phases.

Equal parts in one *dou* measure,
From the eighth month, count anew.
When the moon reaches fullness,
One Yang arises at midnight’s peak.

*Taiji* qi swirls in mist,
Lured by the Holy Mother’s grace,
Seated at the North Star’s apex, masculine power revealed,
The altar rises three tiers high.

Dragon and Tiger spiral in flight,
Following the celestial cycles’ law,
The elixir cauldron glows with sudden light,
A single millet-grain pearl hangs suspended.

Swiftly gather it as it comes,
Swallow whole—do not chew.

When the soul-elixir enters the belly,
Mists disperse like wind and rain.
The Four Seas churn in waves,
Heaven and Earth’s essence and spirit settle.

Yang fire and Yin talisman,
Move in perfect harmony, no error.
Bathing must be done with utmost caution,
Drawing and adding require vigilant protection.

Nine cauldrons refine the cycle,
The River Vehicle meets no obstruction.
Golden liquid descends as jade nectar,
The infant sheds its mortal shell.

Ten months of toil complete,
Form and spirit grow wings.
The Daoist does not seek—
Only the side paths deceive.

Side-path methods mislead—
Examine them carefully before embracing.

This alchemical practice,
I speak of it no more.

**Warning to the Misled**
Long life may be learned, the Ultimate Way transmitted—
To the worthy, reveal it not;
To the unworthy, speak not.

In this muddled age, entangled by fame and gain,
Life flees like flowing water—who would still seek immortality?
Only those who study
Gain but partial truths:
Feasting on mist, inhaling qi,
Sitting in meditation, chanting sutras.

Refine one’s bodily Yin,
Burn eight stones to ash,
Three secret methods, six static extensions.
Dragon and Tiger manifest,
Ghosts and spirits appear before you.
Morning dew yields the great medicine,
Autumn stone in urine’s stream.

Grasses and trees reverse their aging,
Essences return to their source.
Suction and prohibition techniques,
Gathering and governing Yin energies.

Clear the intestines, abstain from grains,
Avoid markets, shun the dust.
Far gather the Five *Zhi* herbs,
Near cultivate the Three Fields.

The Four Fruits of the Dao,
The Ten Great Scriptures,
Golden grains of trust,
Jade flasks of *Hunyuan*.

Small *Pian* seven-two,
Great *Pian* two-four.

All these Daoist guardians,
Ten thousand herbs and roots,
Mislead those who cling—
Claiming precision in their pursuit.

Small hopes for mere longevity,
Great desires to ascend to Heaven,
Before white hair appears,
They are already recorded in the Yellow Springs.

They blame not their own errors,
Complain the Way lacks mercy,
Causing the earnest to falter,
Their path left in confusion.

With such methods seeking longevity,
Like crossing to Hu or Yue,
Retreating from the Central Plains.
Hunting fish in green waters,
Chasing hares to dry the rivers.

「Yet seeking the Way through false methods,
Deeply pitiable—thus I recount the *Yinzheng* to welcome future sages.

The ancient immortals do not reveal themselves outright,
Yet all their oral precepts are proclaimed.

Lamenting the bitter sea of suffering,
Silent in lonely quest like climbing a ladder to Heaven,
Teachers and masters are hard to find—
Planting virtue must come first.

Perhaps this may inspire and awaken,
So that the sincere may attain their true aspirations.

Reading this, one may gain insight,
Unlocking Heaven’s full essence,
When the work is complete and the Dao fulfilled,
Vanishing into the misty halls of the clouds.

As honored guests of the Jade Emperor,
Holding the pivot of transformation’s authority,
Mindful of this very moment,
Diligently striving both day and night.

Later, my teacher—when he was still a child—once said:
*"In Lu, I heard of your master, the nameless child, who sought Master Cloud: My master is indeed the Suiyi *Zhi*ren, Suiyi the son of Master Shunli. Together with Master Wutian, he studied at the *Piyong* Academy, yet never passed the imperial examinations. From early youth, he nurtured a divine root, and when he pursued the Dao, the Dao responded to him.*

Later, when he remembered his fellow Daoists had descendants, during the *Shuowu* year of Shaoxing, he met Master Wutian and received his teachings, thus attaining the Dao.

Unable to fulfill his aspirations, he then annotated *Pangzhenren’s* *Shantongqi Yishu*, hiding in the marketplace, yet still guiding others.

When he harmonized with like-minded souls, in the *Buanjixu* year of Qiandao, he attained the Dao beneath Tiger Hill, reaping the grace of immortals and mistakenly claiming their favor.

During Shaoxing’s reign, at the *Zhijiang Kuapu* Bridge, he was refined by *Pangzhenren’s* countenance, his inherent talents and resources yet unfulfilled. Day and night, he labored anxiously, already surpassing three decades.

Once, on the Mid-Autumn Festival, he expressed his feelings:
*"Mid-Autumn holds Heaven’s secrets in my grasp—
Each year on this night, my sorrow knows no bounds.
Three persons mastered the divine arts,
Two eights refined the *Hunyuan* essence of millet.
To trust the Dao, one must seek a blessed land,
Yet the Crane knows—ascend to Yangzhou.
Who can lend me the *Fuxiao* wind’s swift aid,
So that I may rise with them to the Ten Isles?
My resolve is clear—see how vast it is!
Thus, be diligent, all of you!"*

And so he imparted the Dao,
In truth during the *Gengxu* year of Chunxi.

Though alchemical formulas were not yet fully revealed,
He would later point them out.

In the *Gengshen* year, he again met Master Lu, the temple clerk, in Suzhou,
And only then disclosed the secrets—
For Master Lu was also among those Suiyi had instructed.

I have studied the Dao for thirty years,
And in the *Gengzi* year of Jiading,
Encountered the immortal master,
Who then fully revealed the alchemical secrets to me atop Tiger Hill.

Now, just two years later,
Yet I am still constrained by petty officials,
Buried in dusty labor—
Fearful that later generations may follow blindly,
Drowning in mundane pursuits and abandoning the Dao.
Thus, I compose this *Huandan Yinzheng* Diagram,
Hoping it may serve as a guide for them!

In days past, Master Xu of the Western Mountains,
On the day he slew the serpent,
Left these words: *"After my ascension,
A thousand two hundred and forty years hence,
Within the Five Tombs’ domain,
Eight hundred shall attain immortality.*
From the *Shujin Yongjia* era to our Song *Chunxi* reign,
The count has already been fulfilled.

Thus I reflect—
Within the Five Tombs today,
Those who are truly devoted and resolute,
All possess the potential for immortality.
This work is not without purpose!

On the third day of the Winter Solstice,
I recorded the lineage’s origins here.

**Postscript to the *Huandan Yinzheng* Diagram:**

I once heard the alchemical precepts from my true master,
Yet those who sought their validation in scriptures were many!
If they are not profound yet obscure,
Then they are shallow and scattered—
How difficult to discern!

Once, I obtained a scroll of *Longmeizi Yinzheng* Diagram,
Which I carefully preserved.
Observing its methods of refining medicines,
Nurturing the embryo to transcend its shell,
The gradual stages of cultivation—
Like ascending steps, one by one.
In a single glance,
The essence of alchemy and its scriptural alignment became clear to me.

Only the transmission’s order remains unclear:
*Longmeizi* was the ancestor teacher,
Yet the *Yinzheng* lineage’s second and third masters remain unknown.
For ancient sages often wrote under pseudonyms,
As seen in works like *Huoji* and *Longhu Jing*.

Now, examining the preface and its details,
One recognizes it as the lineage of *Ziyang* Master.
The inscription further states:
*"My teacher, the nameless child, was Master Cloud’s disciple.
My teacher’s master was Suiyi, the son of Master Liu Zhenren—
Liu Zhenren, the White Dragon Grotto recluse,
Was indeed a disciple of Ziyang.
Suiyi was his sobriquet.*

It is said that Ziyang departed in the fifth year of Yuanfeng,
And seven years later, Suiyi met him at Wangwu Mountain,
Composing verses to inspire each other’s resolve.
There were words of Ziyang hearing of his knowledge of medicines.

Though Suiyi heard the Dao yet lacked the strength to fulfill it,
In the *Shuowu* year of Shaoxing,
He again met Ziyang,
And completed his aspirations in the *Buanjixu* year of Qiandao,
Living beyond a hundred years,
Then finally soaring upward.

The one who inscribed the diagram’s title, Master Wang Qidao,
Was the Golden Toad Child,
A descendant of the Jade Toad Immortal.

Since he honored *Longmeizi* as his ancestral teacher,
The traces of *Longmeizi* are indeed hidden yet evident.
His ultimate attainment of the Dao
Need not be spoken—it is known.

Now, to observe his steadfast resolve,
To emulate the profound and thirst for the mysterious,
Yet the difficulty of attainment
Shall follow the path of Suiyi’s master!

Alas!
One need not fear the difficulty of studying the Dao,
But rather the difficulty of hearing it.
One need not fear hearing the Dao’s difficulty,
But rather the difficulty of attaining it.

Thus, many study like cow’s hair,
Few grasp it like a horn’s tip.
I often sigh at the ancient weariness—
If one has resolve, the task will be accomplished,
What is there to fear?

On the day when my cultivation is complete,
I shall fly beyond the Eight Trigrams,
Visit *Longmeizi’s* second and third disciples
In the land where the *Hunfeng Yunlei* winds blow,
Record their Daoist conduct for posterity,
And descend to guide those in the lower realms.
The world shall then add to the *Lianxian Zhuan*.

In the *Jizixu* year of *Jiazi*,
On the day when the Golden Essence fills the cauldron,
The *Yuntai Xuan Shi*, Master Yuan Yang,
Ascended from the tranquil forests of *Huxing*.
Black Jade knelt to receive the scriptures
At the *Tawei Xuangai* Celestial Hall,
A youth of thirty-five years.

The *Huandan Yinzheng* Diagram is complete.»
