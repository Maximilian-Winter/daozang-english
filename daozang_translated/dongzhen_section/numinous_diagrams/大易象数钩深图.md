- Diagram of the Great Ultimate Unifying the One
- Diagram of the *Yi* Possessing the Great Ultimate
  To the right, the *Taiji Tu*, transmitted by Zhou Dunshi Maoshu to the two Cheng masters.
  Maoshu said: "The Ultimateless and yet the Great Ultimate."
  The Great Ultimate moves and generates yang; when movement reaches its extreme, it becomes still, and when stillness reaches its extreme, it moves again. Movement and stillness alternate, each serving as the root of the other. Yin and yang are divided, and the Two Modes are established.
  Yang transforms and yin unites to generate water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. The five *qi* are distributed in order, and the four seasons proceed.
  The Five Phases are one yin-yang; yin-yang is one Great Ultimate. The Great Ultimate is fundamentally the Ultimateless.
  As the Five Phases are generated, each possesses its own nature. The true Ultimateless and the essence of the Two and Five wondrously unite and congeal.
  The Dao of Qian completes the male; the Dao of Kun completes the female. The two *qi* interact and transform, giving birth to the myriad things.
  The myriad things are born and reborn, their transformations endless.

  Previously existing diagram:
  Before the Great Ultimate had images or numbers, there was only one *qi*. Once this *qi* divided, the light and pure ascended to become heaven, while the heavy and turbid descended to become earth—thus the Great Ultimate generated the Two Modes.
  Once the Two Modes were divided, the positions of metal, wood, water, and fire were arranged in the four directions—thus the Two Modes generated the Four Images.
  Water, numbered six, resides in Kan and generates Qian; metal, numbered nine, resides in Dui and generates Kun; fire, numbered seven, resides in Li and generates Xun; wood, numbered eight, resides in Zhen and generates Gen—thus the Four Images generated the Eight Trigrams.

- Diagram of the Great Ultimate Containing the Three Natural Odds and Evens
- Diagram of Virtue and Affairs Mutually Arising from Odds and Evens
- Diagram of the *Shuogua*’s Eight Directions
  Qian, with three lines forming heaven, contains one within three. Kun, with six lines forming earth, pairs three to make six.
  The fundamental numbers of heaven-one and earth-two, the fundamental lines of heaven-odd and earth-even, are self-evident without comparison—yet the wondrous principle lies in one containing three and two containing six.
  Qian, one containing three, thus produces three sons, all odd; Kun, two containing six, thus produces three daughters, all even. Is this not the wondrous principle of heaven and earth’s generation?

  Zhen is thunder, which emerges from beneath the earth, hence one yang is below.
  Kan is water, which accumulates within the earth, hence one yang is in the center.
  Gen is mountain, which rises above the earth, hence one yang is above.
  Yet yang is movement and yin is stillness; that which takes movement as its foundation is Zhen. That which takes stillness as its foundation is Gen.
  Movement in the center is neither internal nor external, hence it may flow or stop, move or rest—thus Kan becomes water, and Xun becomes wood.
  Wood sprouts beneath the earth, hence one yin is also below.
  Li is fire, which emerges from within wood, hence one yin is in the center.
  Dui is marsh, which collects above the earth, hence one yin is above.
  Yet yin is soft and yang is firm, hence wood begins weak and ends strong, with yang at the end.
  Yang is bright and yin is dark, hence fire is bright externally and dark internally, with yang on the outside.
  Yang is dry and yin is moist, hence the marsh is moist externally and dry internally, with yang within.
  One may ask: Why is the marsh internally dry?
  I say: Internal dryness enables it to generate metal, while external moisture enables it to collect water. That metal generates water and earth generates metal can be understood through the marsh.
  How could the sages have been careless?
  Qian knows the great beginning.

The first yang emerges at *zi*, the second yang at *chou*, the third yang at *yin*, the fourth yang at *mao*, the fifth yang at *chen*, and the sixth yang at *si*. Yet Qian’s position lies in the northwest, before *zi*, hence it is said: "Qian knows the great beginning." This speaks of Qian as the fatherly Dao initiating heaven and earth.

Kun completes things.
The first yin emerges at *wu*, the second yin at *wei*, the third yin at *shen*, the fourth yin at *you*, the fifth yin at *xu*, and the sixth yin at *hai*. Yet Kun’s position lies in the southwest—for the southwest is *shen*, and things reach completion in the proper autumn, *you*. Kun acts at *shen* and completes at *you*, hence it is said: "Kun completes things."

Heaven is noble, earth is base.
From one to ten, heaven is noble above, earth is base below. The noble is Qian’s position, hence Qian is lord, father, and husband. The base is Kun’s position, hence Kun is minister, mother, and wife. All arise from the principle of heaven’s nobility and earth’s baseness. Thus it is said: "Heaven is noble, earth is base; Qian and Kun are thereby established."

*Diagram of Three Heavens and Two Earths*
Qian’s primordiality employs nine, the three heavens. Kun’s primordiality employs six, the two earths. Thus it is said: "Three heavens and two earths rely on these numbers." Nine and six are but the generative numbers. They are taken from the characters for "sun" and "moon" combined, as in the seal script where "sun" is written with "moon" beneath—signifying the sun’s departure and the moon’s arrival. Hence it is said: "The meaning of yin and yang is paired with sun and moon."

Sun and moon constitute the *Yi*.
*Diagram of the River Chart’s Numbers*
Wearing nine and treading one, left three and right seven, two and four as shoulders, six and eight as feet, five as the center—totaling forty-five. Counting vertically or horizontally, each sums to fifteen. The celestial five resides at the center; the sages observed this and thereby fixed the images of the eight trigrams.

*Diagram of the Luo Book’s Numbers*
The River Chart’s number is forty-five, for the sages subtracted heaven two, earth three, heaven four, and earth four—ten in all—leaving only the celestial five at the center to govern earth. By the Luo Book, earth attains the completed number ten, and thus water, fire, metal, and wood take form.

*Diagram of the River Chart’s Four Images*
The *Appended Sayings* states: "The *Yi* possesses the Supreme Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes. The Two Modes generate the Four Images, and the Four Images generate the eight trigrams." The Four Images reside in heaven one, earth two, heaven three, and earth four—heaven five. Heaven one occupies the northern *kan* position as water; earth two occupies the southern *li* position as fire; heaven three occupies the eastern *zhen* position as wood; earth four occupies the western *dui* position as metal. These lie in the four cardinal positions as generative numbers. Heaven five occupies the center as the number of earth. Earth has no fixed position, yet when it distributes its power to the four cardinal directions, it can generate the myriad things. Thus, northern water one gains earth five to become six; southern fire two gains earth five to become seven; eastern wood three gains earth five to become eight; western metal four gains earth five to become nine. These are called the Four Images.

*Diagram of the River Chart’s Initial Numbers and the Luo Book’s Completed Numbers*
The River Chart possesses heaven one, earth two, heaven three, and earth four as the beginnings of images. As for heaven five, it resides at the center and governs earth’s transformations, yet it cannot yet take form—hence they are called the Four Images. By the Luo Book, earth attains the completed number ten, and thus water, fire, metal, and wood all pair odd and even to take form. Therefore, the River Chart’s combination of the Four Images’ numbers can determine the positions of the eight directions, while the Luo Book’s possession of the Five Phases’ numbers can complete the images of the eight trigrams. The images that generate the trigrams must await heaven’s transformations and be perfected by the Luo Book’s earth ten’s completed number before the eight trigrams are formed. Only when these two mutually assist one another can the trigrams be completed.

*Diagram of the River Chart’s Eight Trigrams*
These eight images arise from the Four Images. Fuxi first followed the River Chart’s eight directions to position the eight trigrams, then took the Luo Book’s earth ten’s completed number to image the eight trigrams. Observing yin and yang, he established the odd and even lines; observing heaven, earth, and humanity, he established the upper, middle, and lower positions. With three lines all yang, it is Qian; with six lines all yin, it is Kun. With one yang beneath two yins, unable to yield to softness, it moves outward as Zhen. With one yin beneath two yangs, unable to offend hardness, it returns inward as Xun. With one yang between two yins, above and below both weak, unable to aid one another, it becomes perilous as Kan. With one yin between two yangs, above and below both strong, sufficient to stabilize itself, it attaches as Li. With one yang above two yins, hardness driving downward, it halts as Gen. With one yin above two yangs, softness able to soothe below, it delights as Dui.

*Diagram of Qian’s Primordiality Employing Nine and Kun’s Primordiality Employing Six*
Qian’s yang positions total twelve lines: Qian’s three lines, Zhen, Kan, and Gen each with one line, Xun, Li, and Dui each with two lines—twelve in all. Kun’s yin positions total twenty-four lines: Kun’s six lines, Xun, Li, and Dui each with one line, Zhen, Kan, and Gen each with two lines—twenty-four in all. The yang line is the lordly Dao, hence it may encompass them, totaling thirty-six lines. Thus four nines make thirty-six lines, and the yang line is called nine. Kun is the ministerial Dao and may not overstep its superior, hence four sixes make twenty-four lines, and the yin line is called six. Thus Qian’s three lines encompass Kun’s six lines to complete yang’s nine. Yang advances, and Qian’s primordiality employs nine; yin retreats, and Kun’s primordiality employs six.

Combining these remaining nine and six, they embody the hard and soft natures of Heaven and Earth.

**The Numbers of Heaven and Earth**
**The Counting Rods of Qian and Kun**
**The *Hetu* Diagram of Heaven and Earth’s Fifteen Numbers**

These are the numbers of Heaven and Earth—fifteen in all. Taken as a whole, their purport unfolds in six aspects, for they unite the numbers of nature.

First, when the *Hetu* is arranged vertically and horizontally, each yields the number fifteen.

Second, Heaven One, Earth Two, Heaven Three, Earth Four, Heaven Five—together they sum to fifteen.

Third, before the Great Ultimate divides—#8 undifferentiated as one—it is simply One. When the primal qi splits to form the Two Modes, Three appears; when the Two Modes separate to form the Four Images, Seven appears; when the Four Images unfold #9 to generate the Eight Trigrams, fifteen appears.

Fourth, the generative numbers of the Five Phases—One for Water, Two for Fire, Three for Wood, Four for Metal, Five for Earth—yield fifteen.

Fifth, dividing the numbers of the Five Phases to symbolize yin and yang: Seven becomes Lesser Yang, Eight becomes Lesser Yin—again yielding fifteen.

Sixth, if Lesser Yin and Lesser Yang remain unmoved, no change occurs. Eight, as Lesser Yin, moves and retreats, thus Lesser Yin in motion #10 becomes Greater Yin, retreating #11 to be called Six. Seven, as Lesser Yang, moves and advances, thus Lesser Yang in motion becomes Greater Yang, advancing to be called Nine. Six and Nine combined also yield fifteen.

Here, the yang positions—One, Three, Five—form a single unbroken sequence, with Five at the center, thereby ruling the four directions. Six, Seven, Eight, and Nine together complete the cycle, forming the Four Images.

**The Diagram of Forty-Nine in Use**
Heaven One descends to unite with Earth Six, generating Water in the North.
Earth Two ascends to unite with Heaven Seven, generating Fire in the South.
Heaven Three revolves left to unite with Earth Eight, generating Wood in the East.
Earth Four turns right to unite with Heaven Nine, generating Metal in the West.
Heaven Five moves in darkness to unite with Earth Ten, generating Earth at the Center.
What is born from the odd becomes even; what is born from the even becomes odd.
Heaven is yang, hence its numbers are odd.
Earth is yin, hence its numbers are even.
Odd and even unite to complete the number fifty-five.

The number of the *Great Expansion* conceals five—these are the functions of the Five Phases. It leaves one unused—this is the root of the primal qi. For Heaven Five is the beginning of transformation, dispersed among the positions of the Five Phases, and thus has no fixed image at the center. Heaven first generates One, initiating the sequence of numbers, which then gives rise to the numbers of the Four Images and Five Phases. Now, leaving one unused makes clear that the primal qi is the origin of creation, abiding in honor without movement.

**The Diagram of Qian, Kun, and the Six Children**
**The Diagram of the Six Positions of the Celestial Sphere**

**The Six Positions and the Three Ultimates Diagram**
The Six Positions take two, three, four, and five as their warp, and seven, eight, nine, and six as their weft—this mirrors celestial patterns. Heaven’s warp consists of the Dragon, Tiger, Crow, and Tortoise, while its weft comprises the Star of Stability, Jupiter, Mars, and Venus. The warp of the Six Positions, rooted in the Dark Warrior’s numbers, reveals only the Dipper’s pivot and the Pole Star when viewed from the north. Thus, the Dipper is called the Northern Dipper, and the Pole Star, the Northern Culmen. Though named for the north, they reside at the center of heaven—these are the numbers of the One and Six of the Great Ultimate, concealed within the Five. In the *River Diagram*, Six and One dwell north of *hai* and *zi*, while Five occupies the center, showing that both center and north embody the numbers of the Great Ultimate.

The weft of the Six Positions, rooted in the Star of Stability’s numbers, reflects how the Star of Stability completes one celestial circuit every twenty-eight years, while Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury traverse the lodges it governs—akin to the Yin-Yang masters’ doctrine that Earth dwells in the central palace, ruling the four seasons. Thus, the *Yijing*’s 384 lines correspond to the numbers of celestial phenomena, and the changes of fortune are divined through seven, eight, nine, and six, just as the Five Planets undergo transformation.

**Fuxi’s Primordial Diagram**
To the right is Fuxi’s Eight Trigrams Diagram, transmitted by Wang Yu to Shao Kangjie, and obtained by Yaofu. The *Guicang*’s initial classic records Fuxi’s first drawing of the eight trigrams, which he then doubled. Its sequence begins with Qian and Kun, followed by Gen and Dui, then Kan and Li, and finally Zhen and Xun—each hexagram comprising six lines, forming these eight trigrams. Once the eight trigrams are doubled, the lines reside within them.

**The Square and Circle Generating Each Other Diagram**
Master Zheng stated: The ancient Primordial Diagrams include Yang Xiong’s *Canon of the Supreme Mystery*, Guan Ziming’s *Penetrating the Ultimates*, Wei Boyang’s *Triplex Unity*, and Shao Yaofu’s *Supreme Principles Governing the World*. Alas, Xiong’s *Supreme Mystery* and Ziming’s *Penetrating the Ultimates*, modeled on the *Yijing*, became mired in text, dismissed by later generations as redundant—like building a house atop a house or placing a head upon a head. Boyang’s *Triplex Unity* focused on alchemical refinement, veering into technique, and thus diverged from the sagely Dao. Yaofu discarded textual minutiae and minor arts in his writings, yet the world rejected them, deeming them mere tools for calendrics and music. How difficult it is! These four schools all preceded the ancient Primordial Diagram. Is the Primordial Diagram not the source of the *Yijing*? Lacking textual explanations, it was deemed useless. Now, I have created the Square and Circle Diagram, with annotations simpler than the four schools, yet encompassing their meanings. It is most essential to the study of the *Yijing*.

**The Diagram of Gazing Up at Celestial Patterns**
Fuxi gazed upward at celestial patterns to draw the eight trigrams. Thus, the movements and cycles of the sun, moon, and stars; the ten celestial stems; the four seasons—all phenomena adorning heaven—are subsumed by the eight trigrams.

**The Diagram of Examining Earthly Principles**
Fuxi examined earthly principles to draw the eight trigrams. Thus, the four directions, the nine provinces, birds and beasts, grasses and trees, the twelve earthly branches—all principles adorning earth—are subsumed by the eight trigrams.

**The Diagram of Hard and Soft Interacting**
Qian, yang, resides above; Kun, yin, resides below. Qian moves leftward from Zhen, while Kun moves rightward from Xun. Heaven turns left, earth turns right—thus, hard and soft interact.

**The Diagram of the Eight Trigrams Stirring One Another**
Zhen stirs Gen, Dui stirs Kun, Li stirs Xun, Kan stirs Qian—the eight trigrams come and go, alternately propelling one another. Jing Fang said: "Stirring yin enters yang; stirring yang enters yin."

**The Five Positions in Mutual Union**

**Diagram of the Emperor Emerging from Zhen**
**The Virtue/Power of Yarrow Stalks and Hexagrams**
The number of Cao’s stalks is seven; seven multiplied by seven yields forty-nine in use—thus its virtue/power is round. The number of hexagrams is eight; eight multiplied by eight yields sixty-four in distinction—thus its virtue/power is square. The round revolves without end, enabling foreknowledge of things to come. The square, with its fixed form, enables recognition of what has passed—thus the round images the numinous, the square images knowledge.

**Diagram of the Sequence of the Upper and Lower Canons**
Beginning with the second line of *Qian* (nine in the second place) transforming into *Fellowship*, then successively into *Innocence*, *Augmentation*, *Nourishment*, and concluding its transformations at *Radiance*. Beginning with the second line of *Kun* (six in the second place) transforming into *The Army*, then successively into *Ascent*, *Constancy*, *Excess*, and concluding its transformations at *The Abyss*—thus the Upper Canon begins with *Qian* and *Kun* and ends with *The Abyss* and *Radiance*.

Beginning with the second line of *Sensitivity* (six in the second place) transforming into *Excess*, then successively into *Oppression*, *The Abyss*, *The Army*, *Youthful Folly*, and concluding at *Unsettled*. Beginning with the initial line of *Constancy* (six in the first place) transforming into *Great Strength*, then successively into *Abundance*, *Thunder*, *Return*, *Difficulty*, and entering *Settled*—thus the Lower Canon begins with *Sensitivity* and *Constancy* and ends with *Settled* and *Unsettled*.

**Diagram of Hexagrams and Lines in the Twelve Pitch Pipes**

In the eleventh month, *Return* sees the birth of the first yang, resonating with the qi of *Huangzhong*. By the fourth month, six yang lines form *Qian*, thus the opening of the gate is called *Qian*. In the fifth month, *Conception* sees the birth of the first yin, resonating with the qi of *Ruibin*. By the tenth month, six yin lines form *Kun*, thus the closing of the gate is called *Kun*.

**Diagram of Cyclical Conjunctions and Calendar Numbers**
*Return* spans twelve generations, *Approach* twenty-four, *Peace* thirty-six, *Great Strength* forty-eight, *Breakthrough* sixty, *Qian* seventy-two, *Stagnation* eighty-four, *Pursuit* ninety-six, *Stagnation* one hundred eight, *Contemplation* one hundred twenty, *Splitting Apart* one hundred thirty-two, and *Kun* one hundred forty-four.

**Diagram of Qian and Kun as the Great Parents**
*Qian* transforms once into *Stagnation*, twice into *Meeting*, thrice into *Stagnation*, and by the fifth transformation reaches *Splitting Apart* where it halts. Things cannot be utterly exhausted; when *Splitting Apart* reaches its limit above, it turns below, thus it is followed by *Return*. *Kun* transforms once into *Return*, twice into *Approach*, thrice into *Peace*, and by the fifth transformation reaches *The Husband* where it halts. *Breakthrough* must encounter its match, thus it is followed by *Conception*.

**Diagram of Return and Stagnation as the Lesser Parents**

**The Advent of the Single Yang and the Beginning of Yin**

With the advent of the single yang, *Return* transforms into *Approach* as two yang, and further transforms into *Peace* as four yang. It evolves into *Great Strength* as eight yang, then into *Antagonism* as fourteen yang, culminating in *Marrying Maiden* with sixteen yang. With the inception of the single yin, *Conception* transforms into *Pursuit* as two yin, and further transforms into *Stagnation* as four yin. It evolves into *Contemplation* as eight yin, then into *Splitting Apart* as fourteen yin, culminating in *Following* with sixteen yin.

**Yang Hexagrams: Sequential Generation**
One ascends to unite with nine, returning to five as the ruler;
Ten descends to unite with six, returning to two as the minister—this is the sequential generation of yang hexagrams.

**Yin Hexagrams: Reverse Generation**
One descends to unite with nine, returning to five as the ruler;
Ten ascends to unite with six, returning to two as the minister—this is the reverse generation of yin hexagrams.

**Diagram of the Six Hexagrams—Return, Stagnation, Approach, Retreat, Peace, and Stagnation—Generating the Sixty-Four Hexagrams**

Eight hexagrams unchanged in opposition
Twenty-four hexagrams of three yin and three yang in opposing transformation

**Diagram of Qian and Kun as the Simplicity of the Changes**
*Qian* and *Kun* are the numbers one and two, the forms square and round, the qi pure and turbid, the principles dynamic and static. Thus, *Qian* embodies the meaning of the Two Modes, dividing above and below, while *Kun* encompasses the substance of the Four Images, dividing south, north, east, and west. The Two Modes and Four Images together number six; when their original essences of *Qian* and *Kun* are included, the numbers of the eight trigrams are complete. This is why *Qian* and *Kun* remain close to the Supreme Ultimate.

Inner constancy and outer regret are the principles of the Two Modes. Origination, flourishing, advantage, and perseverance are the Dao of the Four Images. Two, three, four, and five serve as the warp; seven, eight, nine, and six serve as the weft—such is the structure of the eight trigrams. Thus, from one to two, from two to four, from four to eight, from eight to sixteen, from sixteen to thirty-two, from thirty-two to sixty-four, the Dao of Heaven is complete, the work of the year is accomplished, and human affairs are fulfilled. This is why the *Changes* consist of sixty-four hexagrams, with *Qian* and *Kun* at the forefront. If scholars can return from the sixty-four to the one, and from the one awaken to the Supreme Ultimate, then Fu Xi, King Wen, and Confucius are all embodied within me. To master transformation, to act as spirits—this, too, is the Way.

At five, the youthful fool is struck from above—this is external learning. What enters through the ears and eyes, though sufficient to aid me, is precisely what harms my true nature, and thus it is "not advantageous to act as a bandit." At two, the receptive fool is enveloped within, and its activation lies in the initial—this is internal learning. What the heart creates values foresight above all; a single moment of stinginess is enough. Once imprinted upon the heart, it becomes a mechanism—is not the advantage I seek the very shackle that binds me?

**Diagram of *Waiting***
The yang within *Kan* serves as aid; the yang of the *Qian* hexagram seeks to await above. One yang comes to its assistance, one yin avoids it and advances; one yin obstructs it and it retreats again—this is the fortune and misfortune of *Waiting*. Yet the Sage’s intent does not blame the two yin but the three yang, nor does it blame the three yang but the yang within *Kan*—for the advantage lies there, and thus the blame is weighty. Hence, it is tied to the image of wine and food. Wine and food are the means to nourish people, what people seek and await. Yet to be ensnared by wine and food and thus harmed—this, too, occurs. To first covet its advantage and later suffer its harm is the constant way of the petty man. There must be a Dao to manage it, which is why "steadfastness and good fortune" are prized. "Steadfastness" means the meaning of central correctness. Inner central correctness ensures outer solidity; outer solidity ensures one does not fall into peril.

**Diagram of *Conflict***
*Qian* resides in the *Hai* position, *Kan* arises in the *Zi* direction—*Hai* and *Zi* are both north, both belonging to water, and thus there is no contention at the outset. Once *Li* takes form, heaven tilts westward and water gathers to pour in. Heaven coils above, water moistens below—thus *Conflict* arises.

**Diagram of *The Army* and *Alliance* Governing the Multitude**
*Kun* represents the multitude, and *The Army* also represents the multitude—this is the meaning of *The Army* commanding the multitude. To command the multitude, without virtue it cannot be done. Thus, the nine in the second place of *Qian* enters *Kun* to form *The Army*, for the virtue of *Qian* lies in the second. Laws arise from numbers, and numbers emerge from the center. The *Huangzhong* pitch-pipe gives rise to measures of length, capacity, and weight; even a hair’s breadth of deviation is unacceptable. The north’s *Kan* is the root of *Huangzhong*, which is why the text speaks of the "old man" and the lines speak of "laws." Are not measures and laws the products of those with virtue? The north governs the images of darkness, yin, and military action; the south governs the images of facing the light and court assemblies. The six lines divide the numbers of two, three, four, and five. Two resides in the south, the place of *Li*’s brightness, and thus *Alliance* is said to face south. Five resides in the center, not the north. Gazing north from heaven, one sees only the pivot of the Dipper and the pole star. The star is called the Northern Star, the Dipper the Northern Dipper—though named "north," they are truly the center of heaven. *The Army* faces north, hence the idea of five men forming a squad. *Alliance* faces south, hence the image of five ranks of nobility. The top line occupies the fifth position, lagging behind its lord—thus it is said: "The last man is inauspicious."

**Diagram of the Fortune and Misfortune of *Small Taming* and *Great Taming***
*Xun* resides in the southeast, and the qi of *Qian* travels from *Zi* to *Si*, entering the direction of *Xun*, where it is tamed by *Xun*—this is called *Small Taming*, for yin arises in *Xun*. *Xun* is the faintest of yin, and thus it is called "small." *Gen* resides in the northeast, and the qi of *Qian* travels from *Zi* to *Yin*, entering the direction of *Gen*, where it is tamed by *Gen*—this is called *Great Taming*, for yang culminates in *Gen*. *Gen* is the ultimate of yang, and thus it is called "great." From *Zi* to *Yin* is the three-line *Qian*; from *Zi* to *Si* is the six-line *Qian*—thus *Gen* tames *Qian*’s steadfastness, while *Xun* tames *Qian*’s regret. The reason *Great Taming* gains authority is that it transforms *Small Taming*’s nine in the fifth place to six in the fifth—humility and deference to others are why it gains authority and tames others. The reason *Small Taming* loses authority is that it transforms *Great Taming*’s six in the fifth place to nine in the fifth—arrogance and self-importance are why it loses authority and is tamed by others.

**Diagram of Treading on the Tiger’s Tail**
*Qian* resides in the *Hai* position; the first line is originally *Shi* and *Bi*, while the second line just rises to *Kui*. *Kui* strikes it—this is treading on the tiger’s tail. *Kun* resides in the *Shen* position; *Shen* is originally *Kun*’s first line. To link *Shen* with *Dui* is to show the tiger’s tail biting the man. If *Qian* were beneath *Dui*, there would be no image of treading on the tiger or of it biting or not biting. It is by *Qian* riding *Dui* that the image of treading on the tiger is made clear. The *Treading* hexagram moves from *Dui* into *Qian*, from *Xu* to *Hai*—this is the Dao of man responding to heaven.

**Diagram of *Obstruction* and *Peace* Coming and Going**
Observing the image of *Peace*, one sees where *Obstruction* arises; observing the image of *Obstruction*, one sees where *Peace* begins—this is the qi of yin and yang ascending and descending to form images. Thus, the hexagrams *Obstruction* and *Peace* are both called "coming and going."

**Diagram of *Fellowship***
*Qian* occupies the upper thirty-six counting rods; if its middle line is changed, it becomes the same as *Li*. *Li* occupies the lower twenty-four counting rods; if its middle line is changed, it becomes the same as *Qian*. This is called "two people with the same heart"—though their outward appearances differ, their hearts are the same.

**Diagram of *Great Possession* Guarding the Position**
In the *Great Possession* hexagram, when the multitude of yang is flourishing, and the fifth place is occupied by six, the lord embodies the origin and resides in correctness—how could one not know the benevolence of guarding the position? Extending this to clarify: the fourth is the attendant, and thus it is said, "It is not his neighbor"; the third is the Three Dukes, and thus it is said, "The duke offers a feast to the Son of Heaven"; the second is the regional lord, and thus it is said, "The great wagon is ready for loading"; the first is far from the lord’s position, bearing the image of remote barbarians, and thus it is said, "No harm from exchange." All are the Dao of enacting governance and bestowing benevolence.

Thus, blessings extend to the ancestral temples, and the enterprise endures for ten thousand generations.

**Diagram of the *Modesty* Hexagram**
*Gen* resides in *yin*, belonging to wood, embodying benevolence.
*Kun* resides in *shen*, belonging to metal, embodying righteousness.
Hence, the fifth and upper positions bear the image of military might.
Modesty takes utmost sincerity as its foundation—it is the voice of the heart.
Words devoid of genuine feeling do not arise from sincerity; they are not the heart’s essence but falsehood.
Thus, when modesty resides within, it is utmost sincerity; when it resides without, it is insincerity—this is why modesty is but an outward show, an external modesty masking an inner love of victory.

**Diagram of the *Delight* Hexagram**
*Zhen* rests beneath *Kun*, signifying the *Return* of a single yang, the heart of Heaven and Earth.
Now emerging above *Kun*, it is the *Delight* of yang rising from earth, likewise the heart of Heaven and Earth.
The line within *Kun* is stillness within stillness, hence it is said, "firm as a rock."
The line within *Zhen* is movement within stillness, hence it is said, "steadfast in illness, ever undying."

**Diagram of the *Following* Hexagram’s System of Loss**
From *Zhen* to *Dui*, from the eastern ancestor to the west, this embodies the principle of spring’s labor and autumn’s harvest.
This is called *Following*: yang arises from within yin, and yin follows yang’s movement.
Yin comes to welcome yang and delights in it, while yang follows yin’s gathering.
Thus, the upper line of *Dui* bears the image of restraint and friction.

**Diagram of the *Decay* Hexagram**
*Xun* occupies the *si* position, where metal is born.
When metal reaches its flourishing in *you*, *Xun*’s work is complete, hence the fifth line of *Xun* speaks of *geng*.
Now beneath *Gen*, it is as if dwelling in the *yin* position, the realm of wood, hence it speaks of *jia*.
*Jia* and *geng* divide the *zi* and *wu* positions, cycling endlessly—this is the Dao of exercising authority.
Metal overcomes wood, yet here it resides beneath wood, like decay born within the tree.
This is the natural image of *Decay*.
The ninth line, dwelling atop the mountain, possesses lofty aspirations, sufficient to rouse the winds of decay and embolden the timid to stand firm.

**Diagram of the *Approach* Hexagram**
The image of the *Approach* hexagram originally signifies the ruler’s approach to those below.
The art of approaching those below lies in bestowing virtue upon them while maintaining one’s heart above.
Bestowing virtue below means the two yang lines are below, like Heaven’s qi moving Earth.
Maintaining one’s heart above means acting with wisdom at the center while prioritizing sincerity and simplicity, like the lofty and bright yielding with gentle strength.
That sweetness of *Dui*’s mouth is but petty eloquence without action, like a ruler issuing empty decrees and exhortations while true benevolence remains unrealized.
How can this be considered the Dao of bestowing virtue and maintaining the heart?

**Diagram of *Observing the Nation’s Splendor***
Four yin lines arise, a hexagram of yin encroaching upon yang.
Compared to yang encroaching upon yin, this is the principle of *Great Strength*.
It is not called *Lesser Strength* but *Observation* because yin submits with compliance, harboring no intent to encroach upon yang.
Since the lower submits with compliance, the upper must embody central correctness to suffice in guiding the lower to observe and transform.
Once the lower observes and transforms, how could there be any encroachment upon yang?

**Diagram of the *Biting Through* Hexagram’s Body and Mouth**
*Biting Through* fundamentally takes the mouth as its image, yet the toes, nose, ears, and eyes are also connected to it, for the entire body relies on the mouth for nourishment.
Nourishment with Dao brings the blessings of *Biting Through*;
Nourishment without Dao brings the calamities of *Biting Through*.
Calamities are many, blessings few, for petty men are often driven by greed.
*Biting Through* begins with lightning and is followed by thunder—lightning flashes and thunder crashes, the tongue moves and the teeth chew—this is the natural principle.
*Biting Through* and *Adornment* both contain objects within *Nourishment*.
One becomes *Adornment*, the other *Biting Through*, because *Biting Through* obtains the lower movement of *Nourishment*, while *Adornment* obtains the upper stillness of *Nourishment*.
Only with lower movement does *Biting Through* arise.

**Diagram of *Adornment*’s Celestial Patterns**
Softness adorns hardness to form *Li*, *Li* is the sun, and the sun’s movement through the heavens embodies the meaning of prosperity.
Hardness adorns softness to form *Gen*, *Gen* is the mountain; the mountain remains unmoving, yet clouds emerge to bring rain, and trees are felled for use—does this not suggest a small profit in going somewhere?
Yet Confucius calls both "celestial patterns," omitting Earth, for he observed images to create the *Images*.
The *Images* contain the celestial patterns of the sun and moon’s mutual illumination.
The sun and moon, through mutual illumination, unite at the new moon, and the waxing and waning cycle gives rise to the four seasons—this is how one examines temporal changes.
*Li* embodies the meaning of continuous brightness, and when *Adornment* transforms the fourth line of *Li*, the sun and moon embrace—this is the essential Dao of celestial patterns.

**Diagram of *Splitting Apart* as the Seed of Yang Qi**
The single yang below in the *Return* hexagram is the upper yang of *Splitting Apart* falling to earth, hence the image of a great fruit that bears no seed.
Is this not the seed of yang qi? Thus, *Qian* is the wooden fruit, giving birth to wood in *hai*.
*Hai* is the position of *Qian*.
Wood has life but no sprouts; when it sprouts, it bears offspring—this is reproduction.
The unsprouted fruit originates from the upper yang of *Splitting Apart*, like a fruit at the tree’s end.

**Diagram of the Seven-Day Return**
Line positions correspond to the actual number six.
The Great Ultimate corresponds to the virtual number six.
The virtual number six arises from the accumulation of containing three.
The accumulation of containing three originates from the diameter of a circular object being one.
Thus, all numbers in the world—ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand—emerge from six.
When six advances, it becomes seven; when it retreats, it becomes five.
Five is six’s unfilled state, and six is five’s fullness; exceeding this is seven.
Six is the limit.
When one yang arises, the seventh day brings return;
When two yang arise, the eighth month brings misfortune.
Seven is lesser yang, and eight is lesser yin.

The sun is *Zhen* (Thunder), the moon is *Dui* (Lake).
In the *Lin* hexagram, though yang grows, it actually attains the number eight of *Dui*, hence the misfortune in the eighth month.
In the *Fu* hexagram, one yang returns, and the "seven days" refer to *Kun*’s yin reaching its extreme in *Hai*, the sixth number culminating in one, then re-emerging from *Kan*, together making seven.
The numbers complete a cycle of the Six Jia, the movements complete a cycle of the Three Systems, and return becomes the origin—this is also the meaning of "seven days bringing return."

**Diagram of *Wuwang* (No Delusion) and *Zhongfu* (Inner Truth)**
*Zhongfu* is trust.
And *Wuwang* is also trust.
The trust of *Zhongfu* is the sincerity of nature.
The trust of *Wuwang* is compelled by circumstance.
Thus it is said: "The firm comes from without and becomes master within."
The Dao of sincerity and trust originates from within.
And "within" is also the master of the center.
If it comes from without to become the inner master, how can it be natural?
This is what distinguishes it from *Zhongfu*.

**Diagram of the Nourishing Spirit-Turtle**
The *Yi* hexagram is hollow within, embodying the image of the spirit-turtle.
The noble person, seeing this, takes warning from the spirit-turtle.
The petty person, seeing this, drools with greed.
Three is the lower tooth, the moving force of biting—hence its misfortune exceeds that of two and five.
The movement of three arises because the first line bears the image of *Zhen*.

**Diagram of *Daguo* (Great Exceeding) and the Ridgepole’s Rise and Fall**
In the *Daguo* hexagram, good and ill fortune lie in the first and top lines.
The ridgepole’s rise depends on the thatch of earth—this is utmost caution.
The ridgepole’s fall corresponds to the water that destroys wood—this is great excess, hence the *Daguo* hexagram’s judgment appears in the ninth line of three.
Yang qi, when arrogant, becomes excessive in greatness.
Nine-two is paired with lesser yin, thus it can sprout the withered poplar’s shoots—this is the thatch of *Yang*.
Nine-five is paired with old yin, and the principle of sprouting is exhausted.
Thus there is the image of the withered poplar blooming, but the blooming poplar cannot bear fruit—it is but a bud.

**Diagram of *Xikan* (Practicing Danger) and Navigating Peril**
The *Xiang* of *Kan* states: "Only the center is unobstructed."

This heart holds no thoughts of good or evil, no movements of joy, anger, sorrow, or delight. Once it enters into habituation, the same becomes different. Thus the *Kan* hexagram, from beginning to end, images the petty person habituated to peril, entrapping himself—this is a warning against the evil of the heart’s use.

Moreover, yin and yang are the origins of good and evil, the division of movement and stillness. When the heart moves, evil sprouts. Yang moves while yin is still; yang is good while yin is evil. Six-three, a yin line in a yang position, is thus the greatest of evils. Further, it is submerged amid two yin lines—its habituation is entirely evil. Six-four, a yin line in a yin position, is the utmost stillness, returning to nature and reverting to sincerity. Moreover, it dwells between two yang lines—its habituation is entirely good. Hence the images of *zun* wine, *guan* vessels, and earthenware jars, evoking simplicity, honesty, and unadorned solidity. Though two and five are centered in yang, they are not immune to being mired in the company of two yin lines—traces of habituation’s influence remain. This is why Confucius points to the image of "not yet emerged from the center," for the center has not yet attained greatness.

**Diagram of *Li* Continuing Brightness**
The lower trigram *Li* is steadfast; the upper trigram *Li* is repentant. Thus the lower trigram is steadfast brightness, while the upper trigram is continuing brightness. The moon tends toward the sun to shine. At the time of conjunction, the moon is enveloped by the sun, then tends toward its brightness. This is why the upper trigram envelops the lower, evoking the image of the sun and moon tending toward brightness. *Li* is the sun, not the moon; yet in doubled *Li*, the moon’s image arises. Hence it is said: "brightness in two," and also: "the sun and moon adorn the heavens." Six-two, the yellow *Li*, shines from the center—this is the nature of sincere brightness. Six-five bears the image of sorrow and lament, for it is the moon after fullness, drawing away from the sun—brightness at its peak gives rise to obscurity.

**Diagram of *Xian*’s Companions Following**
One qi resides in the center, thus the clouds of the marsh steam upon the mountain, and the mountain’s springs flow into the marsh—this is the mutual resonance of mountain and marsh. The hexagram has three yang lines, and nine-four occupies the center, imaging the heart’s core. Yet it is a pity that it allies with two yang lines, for it cannot avoid intent, insistence, fixation, and self—hence its restless coming and going. Nine-five is linked above to six-six, so its use lies in six-six; thus six-six is the cheeks and tongue, while five is the spleen. Nine-three is linked below to six-two, so its use lies in six-two; thus six-two is the calf, while three is the thigh. The thigh moves following the calf, but the spleen does not follow the cheeks and tongue in speech—this is why good and ill fortune differ.

**Diagram of Constancy and Duration**
Among the six lines, only nine-two is taken, for it attains the Dao of one firm and one yielding, dwelling in the center. Confucius grants it the image of "able to endure in the center." Though six-five is one firm and one yielding, dwelling in the center, it shares the celestial position with a yielding line, hence the image of the chaste woman’s devotion to one—this is how it differs from two. Nine-three, a firm line in a firm position, moves beyond the center, imaging inconstancy—it is certainly not aligned with speech. The first and top lines, one dredging ever deeper, the other soaring upward, are both profoundly lost, failing to attain the center—hence both are ill-fortuned.

**Diagram of the *Dun* Image**
Two, with the virtue of central compliance, takes the image of the yellow ox. The ox’s ability to bear heavy loads lies in the toughness of its hide. Without its hide, the ox is but flesh upon the frame—what could it accomplish? Nine-three, a firm line in an outer position, bears the image of hide. If three were to follow *Qian* in retreat, two would encounter misfortune. This is why it is urged to hold fast. Four, a yin position occupied by a yang line, responds below to initial six—hence it is called "good." "Good" means mutual affection, for a yin position’s yang line befriends a yin line below. Five, a yang position occupied by a yang line, responds below to six-two—hence it is called "excellent." "Excellent" means consort, for a yang position’s yang line takes a yin position’s yin line as consort. If a petty person befriends me, I must sever ties—this is why it is auspicious. As consort, she is my proper mate—I cannot sever ties, but must rectify my resolve. When my resolve is rectified, lewdness and perversity cannot enter. This is why it is said to be "steadfast and auspicious."

**Diagram of the *Dazhuang* Ram’s Hedge**
The *Dazhuang* hexagram has four yang lines piled below, evoking the image of a ridgepole’s foundation in the north—hence it is called "mighty." Its upper trigram is *Zhen*, its lower *Qian*; *Zhen* is the verdant bamboo, hence the image of a hedge. If *Qian*’s nine-three changes, it enters *Dui*—hence the image of the ram. *Dui* is west while *Zhen* is east; *mao* and *you* are directly opposed—hence the image of the ram butting the hedge. The first line is the ram’s hoof. The ram uses its horns to butt, but the hoof bears the force; if the horns are entangled, the hoof is hindered. Nine-four is truly of my kind; if it breaks the hedge to open a great path, allowing the ram to advance and become entangled, then the three yang lines below will instead become the shafts of the mighty chariot. This is why nine-two and nine-four bear the auspicious judgment of steadfastness.

**Diagram of *Jin*’s Lord Kang**
Among the eight trigrams’ images, *Qian* is truly the horse. *Jin*, with *Kun*’s steadfastness and a yin line occupying the fifth position, how could it bear the image of a horse? It is rather the horse bestowed by *Qian*. Through the bestowal of horses, one attains flourishing multitudes—the image of the feudal lords is thus clear. The *Yi* takes the image of brightness emerging above the earth as the feudal lords because fire above the heavens is *Dayou*, imaging the Son of Heaven. The Son of Heaven and the feudal lords are both rulers facing south; they must possess bright virtue to pacify the people. When the people are at peace, their positions are secure—hence it is called Lord Kang.

**Diagram of *Mingyi*’s Viscount Ji**
In the *Mingyi* hexagram, the sage praises it with the *Xiang* and *Tuan* as most manifest and luminous, most evident in human affairs.

Five represents Viscount Ji, thus the top represents King Zhou. The line at nine-three speaks of a southern hunt yielding a great chief—could this not be King Wu? The "rescuing horse in its prime" refers to none other than King Wu’s ministers who aided in overthrowing the tyrannical minister. Six-four, originally a *Kun* line, now shares the human position below with three—could this not signify Weizi and Jiang Taigong’s allegiance to Zhou? The first nine and top six, both in the *Kan* water, wings drooping as if about to take flight, roots severed as if poised to depart—do they not yearn to rescue yet lack the strength, like Boyi and Shuqi’s followers?

**Diagram of the *Jiaren* Hexagram**
Someone asked Wen Zhongzi about the *Jiaren* hexagram’s image: "Illuminating within and ordering without"—is this not the hexagram of *Li* and *Xun*? The *Xiang* states: "One yin and one yang unite as mates within, embodying the intent of father and mother, husband and wife." This aligns with the Master’s *Xiang*. Jiao Yanshou took the top line as the ancestral temple and five as the ruler; applied to *Jiaren*, the ruler’s position becomes the father. Confucius said: "In the household, there is a stern lord—this refers to the parents."

**Diagram of the *Kui* Hexagram**
In the *Kui* hexagram, the six lines are mutually suspicious, for yin and yang are at odds. Yang occupies yin positions, thus their positions breed doubt. Two responds to five, yet five clings to the top; the top responds to three, yet three clings to two—thus their responses breed doubt. Doubt leads to estrangement and discord. Therefore, the sage’s words for each of the six lines resolve their doubts, allowing yin and yang to settle into their proper places. Hence, the *Kui* hexagram’s imagery surpasses other hexagrams in abundance, for it seeks to exhaust all meaning.

**Diagram of *Jian*’s Comings and Goings**
The two yang lines of *Jian* are both trapped within yin—hence it is called *Jian* ("Obstruction"). The *Jian* hexagram’s imagery depicts four movements of coming and going, while two remain unconstrained by such imagery. The four have lost the center, but the two have attained it. The sage, abiding in the central Way, nurtures himself, thus even amid obstruction, he remains serene in hardship, acting with ease through adversity. What coming and going could there be? Five, at the center of the upper position, has attained the center while occupying the heights—skillfully navigating obstruction without overstepping, making others gladly submit. This is how it attracts companions and avoids perpetual isolation in peril. Two, at the center of the lower position, has attained the center while below—skillfully navigating obstruction without clinging to the above, taking responsibility without presuming upon others. This is how it ensures no blame in the end and gains resonance above. The three yang lines, having lost the center, are urged to reflect and cultivate virtue. The four yin lines, having lost the center, are urged to align with the two yang lines. The initial line, being lowly, is encouraged to nurture its reputation and not act recklessly. The top line, near five, is exhorted to seek fulfillment and follow the great person, like four’s alignment.

**Diagram of *Xie* Emerging from *Kan* Peril**
The single yang within *Kan* is the same yang that begins below *Zhen*. First enveloped within *Kan*, it later emerges above *Kan*, moving as *Zhen* below—like the kernel’s essence transforming into a sprout. Thus it is said: "Obtains the yellow arrow." The arrow symbolizes centered straightness. With centered straightness, the sprout breaks through. The *Xie* hexagram depicts yin and yang in chaos, misaligned from their positions. The top line thus bears the image of resolving disorder, for *Zhen* resides within *Kan*. The noble person, humbled below and mingling with petty men in troubled times, does not forget the heart of generation and the unfolding of the *Yi*’s images and numbers. Alternatively, one sheds the shackles and departs, thus fulfilling their aspirations—this is why nine-four and six-three bear the image of the big toe.

**Diagram of *Sun* and *Yi* Employing the Center**
The *Xiang* of both hexagrams speaks of "advancing with the times." The lines of both hexagrams mention "the tortoise of ten cowries." "Times" refers to diminishing when it is time to diminish, so the world does not deem it stingy; augmenting when it is time to augment, so the world does not deem it extravagant. "Tortoise" refers to the harmony of divination, so ministers and people offer no resistance.

**Diagram of *Guai*’s Decision**
Five yang lines deciding one yin—five gentlemen removing one petty man—presents no difficulty. Yet the yin clings to the fifth position, and both five and four belong to it, forming the *Dui* hexagram. This is what is meant by "yin enveloping yang" and "a petty man clinging to the noble person"—hence the difficulty in deciding and removing. The *Dazhuang* hexagram’s ram displays its strength in *Zhen*. *Zhen* is of the same kind. The *Guai* hexagram’s ram displays its strength in *Dui*. *Dui* is not of the same kind—only by transforming does it become alike. This is why the four lines bear the image of leading the ram, and the three lines’ transformation yields the ram’s image.

**Diagram of *Gou*’s Encounter**
Viewed from the original line, it bears the image of a boar, with nine-three thrusting its rump. Viewed from the first, second, and fourth lines, it bears the image of a fish, signifying yang enveloping yin. Viewed from nine-five, it bears the image of vines and melons flourishing. *Gou* originates from *Qian*—one yin alters its beginning, and the dragon reverts to the image of a fish. The dragon transforms into a fish, and its horns become useless. This is why the *Ni* hexagram’s horns reach their limit above. *Qian*’s single yang arises at *zi* and ends at *si*, which truly occupies the *Xun* direction. Thus *Qian*’s six yang lines encounter *Xun* at the *si* position, and *Xun*’s single yin sprouts forth. This birth of yin is why it is called *Gou*.

**Diagram of *Cui*’s Gathering**
The *Cui* hexagram’s formation gathers things by their kind. The yang occupies the south-facing position—one as the Son of Heaven, one as the feudal lord. Below, they govern the three dukes, twenty-seven ministers, and eighty-one grand officers; above, they uphold the ancestral temple’s solemnity and guard against the way of chaos, entrusted to the initial line.

The image of caution against losing the multitude resides in the upper line. *Cui* represents things gathering only after autumn’s harvest. Autumn is fundamentally governed by *Dui*, and the *Dui* hexagram is inherently ruled by its upper line. Now, the *qi* of *Kun* in the southwest moves to the west, where yin lines proliferate. Thus, the two yang lines govern them, and the upper line loses the multitude.

**Diagram of Ascending the Steps**
The single yin below *Xun* is one with the three yin of *Kun*. Yin is stagnant, while yang ascends and soars. The ascending yang refers to the two yang lines. The initial line clings to the two yang and rises, while the three yin become one with them, hence the image of *Yunsheng* ("trustworthy ascent"). *Yun* means being trusted by others. *Kun* takes charge at *hai*, and *hai* is also where wood begins to sprout, though its form is not yet complete. At the *zi* position, *Zhen* resides below *Kun*, and *Zhen* is also wood—merely the first budding of its roots. If *Xun* resides below *Kun*, there are two yang lines, unlike *Zhen*’s single yang, hence it is called *Sheng* ("Ascent"). *Sheng* occupies the *chou* position, and by *mao*, wood flourishes. The outer trigram is described in terms of position, yet the fifth line is the celestial position, which cannot be ascended like steps. However, *zhen* means "upright." Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang ascended the celestial position with rectitude, as if climbing steps. Without rectitude, how could one avoid stumbling and falling?

*The Great Yi’s Diagrams of Profound Images and Numbers, Middle Scroll* concludes.

**Diagram of *Kun*’s Brambles, Vines, and Barren Trees**

The hexagram *Kun* (困) governs the ninth month, when the qi of *Dui* prevails and approaches the *xu* earth. As marsh water is dammed by earth, the *Great Image* states: "The marsh has no water—this is *Kun*." *Kun* arises from the overlapping of *Dui* and *Kan*. *Dui* rules mid-autumn, while *Kan* governs winter. The single yin line in *Dui* symbolizes the onset of autumn’s qi, when creeping plants have not yet withered—hence the entanglement of vines and brambles. At the *liu san* (sixth-three) position, the transition between autumn and winter, the leaves of creeping plants fall away, leaving only thorns—thus the entrapment of medicinal herbs. As for *chu liu* (initial-six), it lies beneath *Kan*, precisely at the time of severe cold, when creeping plants are killed by frost, leaving no trace, and only bare trunks remain. These three yin lines of *Kun* are thus represented by the imagery of plants and trees.

**Diagram of the Well and Cauldron: The Dual Functions of Water and Fire**

In the hexagram *Jing* (井), yang serves as the spring, for water is born from the yang of Heaven’s One. The yang within *Kan* emerges as a cold spring—this is the meaning of "the north generates cold, and cold generates water." Hence, it is also called *Taiyang Han Shui* (Great Yang Cold Water). Of *Xun*’s two yang lines, one resides in the earthly position and tends downward, forming a valley rather than a well; the other, though in the human position, lies beneath the well’s rim, unreachable by drawing—unlike the fifth line, which overflows above the rim. A well seeks to overflow, while a cauldron warns against fullness—this is the distinction between virtue and vessel.

In the hexagram *Ding* (鼎), the handles, ears, and legs are complete, save for one missing leg, which is why the initial line speaks of "the cauldron overturning its legs," meaning the cauldron is inverted with its legs above. The lower yin line paradoxically forms the image of two ears, while the fifth line is thus called *huang er* (yellow ear) to distinguish it from the first. The *Ding*’s structure is fully depicted here.

**Diagram of the *Ge* Hexagram: Furnace, Bellows, and Casting**

Though *Ge* (革) bears the image of a cauldron transforming raw to cooked, its true symbol lies in the furnace and bellows. Here, *Li*’s fire forges *Dui*’s metal, and metal submits to transformation. Only after forging does the cauldron emerge, for it is cast through smelting. The Xia sovereigns cast cauldrons, and Tang and Wu followed suit, treasuring these vessels—hence the image of Tang and Wu’s revolutionary change.

**Diagram of *Zhen*’s Stirring of the Heart**

The six lines of *Zhen* (震) begin by urging vigilance, then speak of laughter; the second warns against pursuing lost cowries, teaching that one should harbor no reckless impulses in the heart nor covet profit outwardly. The third line speaks of *zhen su su* (trembling cautiously), urging one to correct faults and discern delusions, lest one ultimately wander into confusion. These are the essentials of stirring the heart. The outer trigram discusses near-term movement: the fourth line speaks of "sinking into mud," illustrating stagnation and indecision; the fifth speaks of "no loss," signifying success; the top line speaks of "inauspicious advancement," signifying failure.

**Diagram of *Gen*’s Back Image**

The image of *Gen* (艮) speaks of cheeks and jaws but not the mouth, of the body but not the belly, of the spine and waist but not the navel—evoking the posture of standing with one’s back turned. Viewing the hexagram as a whole, the lower lines do not distinguish calf from toe, nor the upper lines body from cheek; the four yin lines arrayed thus resemble the spine’s structure. The uppermost yang line forms the shoulders, while the central yang line represents the backbone. The backbone is valued solely for its centrality.

In *Gen*, the *jiu san* (ninth-three) line is its master. With yang in a yang position, its nature is restless—like the waist, which governs bending, rising, movement, and stillness. Yet its motion is truly governed by the heart, so the sages attach the image of "fumigating the heart" to it. The *liu er* (sixth-two) line, with yin in a yin position, is inherently still, resembling the calf. When the heart desires movement but the calf cannot lift, how can the heart be at ease? Thus, the sages attach the phrase "its heart is not pleased."

**Diagram of the Wild Geese’s Southern and Northern Migration**

The hexagram *Jian* (渐) consists of *Gen* below and *Xun* above, corresponding to the first month after the *lichun* (Beginning of Spring), when wild geese begin their migration—hence all six lines are associated with geese. Geese follow the sun, and *Gen* and *Xun* are bounded by the yang of *zi* and *wu*; thus, linking them to geese is most fitting.

The third line stands at the top of *Gen*, and the fourth at the top of *Xun*—these are the southern and northern lands. The third line, a single yang hemmed in by yin, coincides with the geese’s northward return and the mating season of beasts, hence the image of a husband’s journey and a wife’s pregnancy. The third and fourth lines interact at the human position, thus producing pregnancy. As for the fifth and second lines, one resides in heaven and the other on earth, their distant correspondence keeping male and female distinct—hence no pregnancy.

**Diagram of *Gui Mei*’s Sleeves of Mistress and Concubine**

*Zhen* (震) resembles green bamboo, hollow above and solid below, forming the image of a basket. The hexagram *Gui Mei* (归妹) resembles *Tai* (泰), yet its two human-position lines intermingle, evoking the image of overlapping sleeves. The human body’s left is yang and right is yin; their union is like two sleeves crossing. The concubine (*di*) occupies the lower position, her line being yang; the mistress (*jun*) occupies the upper, her line being yin. The *Yi* regards yang as good and yin as evil, yang as noble and yin as base—thus the mistress’s sleeve is not as fine as the concubine’s.

The diagram’s arrangement reveals *Gui Mei*’s improper conduct. The hexagram shifts the yang of the east to join the yin of the west, as *Zhen*’s qi enters *Dui*—wood being constrained by metal. Thus, only when the moon nears fullness is it auspicious. At full moon, yin rivals yang, embodying the shift from youth to age, from base to noble. This is why *Gui Mei*’s judgment states: "Advance is inauspicious; nothing is advantageous."

The act of proceeding without propriety is no affair of the sage. Fu Xi placed *Zhen* in the east and positioned *Li* in the south to signify that the lesser yang’s qi stirs in the east while the greater yang’s brilliance flourishes in the south. King Wen doubled *Zhen* upon *Li*, naming it *Feng* ("Abundance"), for the lesser yang’s *Zhen* movement reaches the south to unite with *Li*’s greater yang brilliance, thus achieving fullness. Therefore, in *Feng*’s judgment, King Wen illuminated the principle that extreme prosperity must decline, stating "the sun at its zenith"; in *Feng*’s lines, he revealed the principle that extreme brightness must darken, stating "the sun at midday reveals the Dipper and the dim stars." The words King Wen appended to the hexagram and lines speak only of the sun and the Dipper. Why then did Confucius’ *Xiang* commentary extend to the moon? For *Feng* straddles the fifth and sixth months, when the sun resides in the degrees of the Willow constellation and the Dipper points between noon and the *wei* hour. The Willow’s degrees indeed span three celestial markers, hence the principle of the Dipper’s visibility.

**Traveling Lodging Diagram**
The second line, by adhering to the central Way, thus carries resources and gains servants. The fourth line, through the harmonious union of firm and yielding with correspondence, thus obtains the resource of an axe. Both secure proximate advantage, yet neither matches the fifth line. *Li*’s brilliance arises from proceeding in accord with its wisdom, hence "nurturing the cow brings good fortune." The top line’s loss of the ox signifies the loss of its brilliance. *Lü* ("Traveling") follows *Gou* ("Marrying Maiden") and precedes *Qian* ("Heaven"), for when yang flourishes, all is guest qi—thus it is called *Lü*. *Lü*’s top line, though gaining power and wielding authority, lodges its single self atop the blazing flames yet remains unaware of the disaster of a burning nest. The third line, hastening toward the blaze in restless advance, fails to recognize the calamity of a burning lodging. The second and fourth lines, though traveling by the yielding Way—one carrying resources, the other obtaining an axe—profit from the moment, yet the second must act in person to escape like a fleeing hare, while the fourth’s heart remains discontent. Does this not warn against seeking profit while traveling? As for the fifth line, it begins with the pheasant of *Li*, adorned with the beauty of civil brilliance, yet when shot, the arrow is lost and the bird escapes—thus the Way does not proceed, and profit is not gained.

**Xun Beneath the Bed Diagram**
*Xun* takes yang as the lung-basket and yin as the forest-feet, for beneath the lung lies the image of feet, and the four yang lines in sequence form the image of a basket. The second line marks the forest’s eastern wall, while the top line approaches its western wall, hence both state "*Xun* lies beneath the forest," with the forest-feet appended to it. The fifth line is the soaring dragon and the transforming tiger. The flying dragon is *jia*; the tiger’s transformation is *geng*—this is but the alternation of a single qi. The top line’s loss of the axe stems from excessive firmness. The second line employs scribes and shamans due to firm centrality yet lacking position. The third line’s frequent distress arises from lacking position and losing the center. From this, we see that authority is enacted by those with position who attain the center. If not the fifth line, then who?

**Dui Image Diagram**
*Kan*’s initial six governs the winter solstice; *Li*’s initial nine governs the summer solstice. *Zhen* and *Dui*’s initial lines govern the spring and autumn equinoxes. Thus, in *Dui*, the lower two lines, where yang qi is especially abundant, form the image of the seventh month; the middle two lines, where yin and yang are evenly divided, form the image of the eighth month; the upper two lines, where yin surpasses yang, form the image of the ninth month. This is why *Dui*’s fourth line speaks of "harmonious *Dui*," revealing the notes of *Zhen*’s *jiao*, *Li*’s *zhi*, and *Kan*’s *yu*; the fifth line speaks of "sincere stripping," revealing the principles of *Zhen*, *Yang*, *Li*, *Shi*, *Kan*, and *Fu*.**

**Dispersion of the Body Diagram**
A single yang arises at *zi* and six yangs reach excess at *si*. *Zi* belongs to *Kan*, while *si* belongs to *Xun*; *Xun* doubled upon *Kan* thus forms *Huan* ("Dispersion"). *Huan* means scattering. The hexagram’s qi corresponds to the period after the summer solstice and before great heat, when yang qi disperses outward. Though yang scatters outward, within it lies the inexhaustible generative force—this is *Kan*’s single yang. The qi of the primordial origin is *Kan*’s single yang. Yang governs qi; yin governs form. A single yang disperses outward, hence the mention of sweat and blood. Two yins divide within, hence the mention of limbs and body. The limbs divide into the four extremities; the body divides into the five viscera and six bowels—all are formed from the dispersion of the primordial qi. Human life originates from the primordial qi. The primordial qi emerges from *Kan*’s water, the essence of Heaven’s One, steaming into sweat and flowing into blood to nourish the four limbs and five viscera.

**Seasonal Qi Diagram**
When *Xun*’s top line and *Dui*’s bottom line change, both become *Kan*. *Kan*’s qi steams upward to moisten *Xun* wood’s branches and leaves; *Kan*’s qi seeps downward to gather water and plants in *Dui*’s marsh. When marsh water dries, it becomes *Kun* ("Exhaustion")—this is the downward draining of water. When *Dui*’s single yang drains downward, it presents the image of caution against desire. When *Kan*’s single yin is deficient above, it presents the image of caution against indulgence. Caution against desire: "Do not go beyond the courtyard gate." Caution against indulgence: hence the mention of sweet and bitter flavors. The initial line’s "Do not go beyond the courtyard gate—no blame" and the second line’s "Do not go beyond the courtyard gate—misfortune" express the meaning of caution against desire. The initial line’s change into *Kan* is Heaven’s One water, the origin of true essence. The noble person, understanding the principles of flow and blockage, acts with prudence and does not venture out, closing the gate of essence—this is the essential of nurturing life. *Kan*’s second line is fire; the courtyard gate is the opening that forms the heart.

The heart-fire is noble when it descends to aid the water; the clarity of the heart is noble when it outwardly illuminates things. Failing to emerge, one loses the central Way—this, too, is the meaning of caution against desire. The third line’s "alas" expresses regret and lack of restraint; the fourth line’s "peace" signifies contentment in restraint—both clearly reveal the advantages and harms to others.

The Way of nurturing life is fully encompassed in these two hexagrams.

*Chart of Generation and Formation in "Zhong Fu" and "Xiao Guo"*
*Zhong Fu* generates yang: feathered creatures are born from eggs. The hexagram *Xian* generates yin: creatures of blood and flesh are born from wombs. Thus, *Zhong Fu* marks the beginning of yang’s generation, while *Xiao Guo* signifies its completion. Birds lay eggs throughout the four seasons, flourishing in spring—hence the image of the Beginning of Spring. The egg of the winter solstice resides here.

*Zhong Fu* bears the image of a bird’s egg. Birds, by nature, blaze upward, and only with the offering of pig and fish does good fortune follow. Pig and fish are creatures that moisten and descend. The northern *zi* position is the domain of pig and fish.

The flying bird of *Xiao Guo* meets misfortune in *Li* because it moves eastward to the center, where the snares of the southern region await. Snares capture the yang of *Li*; when *Li* reaches its peak, yin qi arises.

The Huang Emperor’s *lü* and *lü* divide into *Qian* and *Kun*, pairing as *Kan* and *Li*. *Qian* and *Kun* separate into six yin and six yang lines, while *Kan* and *Li* form the *Ji Ji* and *Wei Ji* charts aligned with the pitch standards.

The yang within *Kan* ascends to reach *Zhong Lü*, where the *bi* hexagram becomes *Qian*—this is called *Qian*’s "nine full, its head unseen." The yin within *Li* enters *Kan* and reaches *Ying Zhong*, where the *bi* hexagram becomes *Kun*—this is called *Kun*’s "ten empty, guiding the hidden dragon’s qi."

The head of *Ji Ji* is the head of *Qian*; the tail of *Wei Ji* is the tail of *Kun*. The tail of *Qian* connects to the tail of *Kun*, nine followed by ten. The head of *Kun* follows the head of *Qian*, two preceding one.

Within: the twelve months and twelve pitch standards.

*Thirteen Hexagrams’ Symbolic Images Chart*
*Li*: The *Xun* cord forms the *Li* eye.
The mesh of eyes is called a net; two eyes linked become the cords of a net.
*Li* is the pheasant’s hunt.
*Dui* and *Xun* are fish—fishing.
*Yi*: *Qian* metal severs *Xun*, severing wood; the fourth line completes *Kan* (#10), *Kan* as the initial shaping of *Yi*.
*Zhen* is bent wood, entering *Kun* earth and *Xun*-ing forward—severed wood becomes a plowshare.
Moving behind, bent wood becomes a pestle.
*Shi He*: The many *Li* suns above form midday.
The many *Kun* below form the marketplace, the people, the populace.
*Li* has a hidden line; *Dui* is emaciation. *Kun*’s advance draws the world’s people, gathers the world’s goods.
*Kun* intersecting *Qian* is exchange.
*Qian*: *Qian*; *Kun* is non-action. The six children act on their own, draping robes and skirts so the world is ordered: *Qian* above is the robe.

The skirt adorns the lower body.
*Huan*: *Qian* metal splits *Xun*, floating above *Kan*—split wood becomes a boat.
Fire above sharpens; carved wood becomes an oar.
*Sui*: *Kun* is the ox, *Zhen* the foot—driving and yoking the ox.
*Zhen* makes the horse’s foot; the top line pulls it.
Pulling is weight.
The inner hexagram is near; the outer hexagram is far. The top line lies beyond the outer hexagram—reaching the distant.
*Yu*: *Yu* is the reverse of *Qian*.
*Qian*: *Gen* is the gate; the third line’s move to the fourth makes another gate—double gates.
*Gen* is the hand; *Kan* is hardness; *Zhen* is sound. The hand strikes hard wood and makes a sound—the watchman’s clapper.
*Kun* is the closed door, and *Kan* the thief presses upon it—the violent intruder.
*Xiao Guo*: *Dui* metal severs *Xun* wood—severed wood becomes a pestle.
*Xun* wood enters *Kun* earth, digging the earth to make a mortar.
*Kan* is the pit.
The image of the mortar: the pestle moves above, the mortar rests below. The fourth line responds to the first; the third responds to the top. Above and below correspond—this is the utility of pestle and mortar.
*Kan* transforms into *Xun* thighs—all the people cross over.
*Kui*: *Kui* is the reverse of *Jia Ren*.
*Jia Ren*: *Xun* is wood; *Xun* and *Li* are silk; *Kan* is the bow—stringing wood makes a bow.
*Dui* metal carves wood to sharpen it—carved wood becomes an arrow.

*Da Zhuang*: *Da Zhuang* comes from *Huan*, first changing into *Zhong Fu*.
*Gen* is the dwelling; *Dui* is the image of a cave’s mouth.
The cave is the dwelling.
A second change yields *Da Xu*: *Qian* above is the edge of heaven—the image of the wilds.
*Xun* enters and transforms into *Gen*, halting in the wilds to dwell.
A third change yields *Da Zhuang*: *Zhen*’s mighty wood above is the ridgepole.
*Qian*’s heaven below is the eaves.
*Xun*’s wind is hidden; *Dui*’s marsh flows—awaiting wind and rain.
*Da Zhuang* is thus unyielding.
*Da Guo*: *Da Guo* comes from *Dun*, first changing into *Song*: *Qian* appears, *Kun* is hidden—no enfeoffment.
A second change yields *Xun* wood, and *Dui* metal destroys it—no planting.
A third change yields *Ding*: *Li* is the eye; *Dui*’s marsh flows away—loss.
The top line changes and responds to the third: *Kan* and *Dui* form *Jie*—no change in the time of loss, no reckoning.
Wood beneath the marsh, with *Qian*’s person within—coffin and outer coffin.
Burial means the coffin encases the body, the outer coffin encases the coffin, earth encases the outer coffin—*Da Guo*.
*Guai*: *Guai* comes from *Gou*, four changes yielding *Da You*.
*Gou*: *Xun* is the cord—tying cords.
*Xun* transforms into *Li* and *Kun*.
*Li* is the document.

*Three Arrangements of the Nine Hexagrams Chart*

The *Lǚ* as the foundation of virtue, the *Qiān* as the handle of virtue, the *Fù* as the root of virtue,
The *Héng* as the firmness of virtue, the *Sǔn* as the cultivation of virtue, the *Yì* as the abundance of virtue,
The *Kùn* as the discernment of virtue, the *Jǐng* as the ground of virtue, the *Xùn* as the regulation of virtue.

II
The *Lǚ* arrives in harmony, the *Qiān* shines in honor, the *Fù* distinguishes the small in things,
The *Héng* is mixed yet unwearying, the *Sǔn* is difficult first then easy,
The *Yì* grows abundantly without contrivance, the *Kùn* is distressed yet penetrates,
The *Jǐng* abides in its place yet moves, the *Xùn* is measured yet concealed.

III
The *Lǚ* proceeds with harmony, the *Qiān* regulates ritual, the *Fù* knows itself,
The *Héng* unifies virtue, the *Sǔn* distances harm, the *Yì* promotes benefit,
The *Kùn* reduces resentment, the *Jǐng* distinguishes rightness,
The *Xùn* exercises authority.

The upper canon arranges three trigrams into nine, the lower canon arranges six trigrams into eighteen.
*Lǚ* ten, *Qiān* fifteen, *Fù* twenty-four, *Héng* two, *Sǔn* eleven, *Yì* twelve,
*Kùn* seventeen, *Jǐng* eighteen, *Xùn* twenty-seven—
the numbers of the nine hexagrams total one hundred and thirty-six.
Threefold summation yields four hundred and eight.
The complete reckoning of the celestial cycle is three hundred and sixty;
the remaining forty-eight are the means by which yin and yang advance and retreat.
Yang advances in *Qián*: six months, each forty-eight, from *Fù* to *Qián*.
Yin retreats in *Kūn*: six months, also forty-eight, from *Gòu* to *Kūn*.

*Chart of Triplets and Quintuplets in Transformation*
Heaven one generates earth six; earth two ascends to generate heaven seven.
Heaven three moves left to generate earth eight; earth four moves right to generate heaven nine.
*Cān* means union; *pèi* means pairing.
The numbers of heaven and earth each interweave and pair, crisscrossing and reciprocating to generate.
Thus the numbers of generation and completion are fully arrayed, and the patterns of heaven and earth arise.
As the *Xì Cí* states: "By threes and fives they transform, their numbers interlaced.
Through their changes they communicate, and so the patterns of heaven and earth are completed."
This is what is meant.

*Chart of Eighteen Transformations*
In the union of male and female, the upper and lower canons occupy only twelve positions.
The proper positions of the eight hexagrams—*Qián*, *Kūn*, *Kǎn*, *Lí*, *Xián*, *Héng*, *Sǔn*, *Yì*—
are divided into eighteen positions.
*Qián* and *Kūn* transform into *Yí* and *Dà Guò*; *Yí* and *Dà Guò* transform into *Kǎn* and *Lí*;
*Kǎn* and *Lí* transform into *Zhōng Fú* and *Xiǎo Guò*; *Zhōng Fú* and *Xiǎo Guò* transform into *Xián* and *Héng*—
thus human relationships are established.

*Chart of One Yin and One Yang*
The sixty-four hexagrams, one yin and one yang, begin with *Qián* and end with *Kūn*.
First from *Qián* and *Kūn*, one yin and one yang, arrange the sixty-four;
then from *Qián*, two yang and two yin; then four yang and four yin;
then sixteen yang and sixteen yin; then thirty-two yang and thirty-two yin—
thus the sixty-four hexagrams are completed.
Hence it is said: "One yin and one yang—this is called the Dao."

*Chart of Prior and Posterior Jia*
From *jiǎ-wǔ* to *guǐ-hài*, thirty days.
Commencing at *shēn* and proceeding to *sì*—prior *jiǎ*.
Black halo.
From *jiǎ-zǐ* to *guǐ-sì*, thirty days.
Commencing at *yín* and proceeding to *hài*—posterior *jiǎ*.

White halo.

**Yin and Yang, Ruler and People**
In yang hexagrams, the odd line serves as the ruler—thus one yang and two yin, where yang is the ruler and yin the people.
In yin hexagrams, the even line serves as the ruler—thus two yang and one yin, where yin is the ruler and yang the people.
In yang, the single line is the ruler and the two lines the people—its principle is harmonious, hence called the Way of the Noble Person.
In yin, the two lines are the ruler and the single line the people—its principle is perverse, hence called the Way of the Petty Person.

**Yin and Yang, Odd and Even**
*Zhèn*, *Kǎn*, and *Gèn* are yang hexagrams.
Why then do they contain more yin?
They derive from *Kūn*.
Each of these hexagrams has one yang and two yin—five in total—hence yang hexagrams are termed "odd."
*Xùn*, *Lí*, and *Duì* are yin hexagrams.
Why then do they contain more yang?
They derive from *Qián*.
Each of these hexagrams has one yin and two yang—four in total—hence yin hexagrams are termed "even."

**The Two Modes Yield Ten Transformations**
Ten days, five phases mutually engendering.

*Chart of the Great Expansion’s Numbers*
*Chart of the Yarrow-Stalk Divination Method*
First counting, second counting, third counting—
the first hexagram between the little finger: not five, then nine;
the second hexagram between the middle finger;
the third hexagram between the index finger: neither not four, then eight.
Five, four, four—this is three yin, totaling thirteen stalks.
From forty-nine stalks, subtract thirteen; the remainder is thirty-six, which is four nines—this is *old yang*.
Nine, eight, eight—this is three yang, totaling twenty-five stalks.
From forty-nine, subtract twenty-five; the remainder is twenty-four, which is four sixes—this is *old yin*.
Five, eight, eight—*young yang*.
Nine, four, eight—both are two yang and one yin, each totaling twenty-one stalks.
From forty-nine, subtract twenty-one; the remainder is twenty-eight, which is four sevens—this is *young yang*.
Nine, eight, four—*young yang*.
Nine, four, four—*young yin*.
Five, eight, four—both are two yin and one yang, each totaling seventeen stalks.
From forty-nine, subtract seventeen; the remainder is thirty-two, which is four eights—this is *young yin*.
Five, four, eight—*young yin*.

*River Chart’s One Hundred and Six*
Multiply the fifteen of Heaven and Earth by three to yield forty-five.
Multiply the fifteen of Heaven and Earth by five to yield seventy-five.
Multiply the fifteen of Heaven and Earth by seven to yield one hundred five?
The numbers of the Nine Palaces culminate at one hundred five, hence one hundred six is the utmost limit.
The use of three, five, and seven is to employ the median of yang numbers.

*Chart of the Eight Trigrams Governing Transformations*
*Qián* governs generation and covering,
*Kǎn* presides over cold transformation,
*Gèn* presides over damp transformation,
*Zhèn* presides over movement transformation,
*Xùn* presides over wind transformation,
*Lí* presides over heat transformation,
*Kūn* governs form and bearing,
*Duì* presides over dryness transformation.

*Chart of Categories Assembled and Groups Divided*
*Kǎn* to the north, *Zhèn* to the east,
*Qián* to the northwest, *Gèn* to the northeast—
these four trigrams are all yang.
*Lí* to the south, *Duì* to the west,
*Xùn* to the southeast, *Kūn* to the southwest—
these four trigrams are all yin.
Thus it is said: "Directions assemble by kind."
One assembly at six divides *Qián* and *Kǎn*,
four assemblies at nine divide *Kūn* and *Duì*,
two assemblies at seven divide *Lí* and *Xùn*,
three assemblies at eight divide *Zhèn* and *Gèn*.
Thus it is said: "Things divide by group."
Harmony with kindred brings fortune; discord with kindred brings misfortune—
this is how fortune and misfortune arise.

*Chart of Comprehending Day and Night*
*Zǐ* is the beginning of *Qián* and ends at *sì*.
*Wǔ* is the beginning of *Kūn* and ends at *hài*.
Two hundred ninety-two yang lines—day’s number—yield one thousand seven hundred twenty-eight.
One hundred ninety-two yin lines—night’s number—yield one thousand one hundred fifty-two.
In sum, two thousand eight hundred eighty, four times fourteen’s total, ten thousand one thousand five hundred twenty—
thus it is said: "Comprehending the Way of day and night, one begins..."

**Chart of Hexagram Sequence**
*Upper Canon*: thirty hexagrams; *Lower Canon*: thirty-four.

**Miscellaneous Hexagram Chart**
The *Miscellaneous Hexagrams* (*Záguà*) interweaves the many hexagrams, intertwining their meanings to unfold their boundless applications. Its principles focus on hardness and softness, ascent and descent, reversal and recurrence—unlike the *Sequence of Hexagrams* (*Xùguà*). Thus, Han Kangbo observed: "Some elucidate through likeness, others through contrast; the sixty-four hexagrams are intermingled to convey meaning."

**Xuan’s Alignment with the Yi Hexagram Names Chart**
One *Xuan* generates three directions, using three multiplied by one.
Three directions generate nine provinces, using three multiplied by three.
Nine provinces generate twenty-seven divisions, using three multiplied by nine.
Twenty-seven divisions generate eighty-one families, using three multiplied by twenty-seven.
Eighty-one families generate two hundred forty-three tables, using three multiplied by eighty-one.
Two hundred forty-three tables generate seven hundred twenty-nine eulogies, using three multiplied by two hundred forty-three.
Seven hundred twenty-nine eulogies generate twenty-six thousand two hundred forty-four *cè*, using thirty-six multiplied by seven hundred twenty-nine.
In all, one *Xuan* constitutes one year; seventy-two *cè* make one day, beginning in the eleventh month.

**Xuan’s Alignment with the Yi Hexagram Qi Chart**
The origin of pitch-pipes and calendars begins at the winter solstice; hexagram *qi* commences with *Zhōngfú*.

*Shào’s* *Huángjí Jīngshì Tú*, *Wēngōng’s* *Qiánxū*, *Nǐ Xuán Tú*, *Qiánxū Xìng Tú*

The sequence of natures begins by listing the ten pure states.
Once the ten pure states are thoroughly permeated, the next descends by one, then by two, then by three, then by four, and finally, the fifth is paired to complete the nature.
It begins with purity and ends with pairing—such is the Dao of heaven and earth.

*Shuō Guà Pèi Fāng Tú*

The single qi of creation is none other than the single heart of the sage.
The qi of creation originates in generation, just as the heart of the sage is also meant to succor the world.
Thus, it does not shun moving from stillness, entering from nonbeing into being, enabling the myriad things to fulfill their lives and secure their endeavors.
Yet the people of the world never perceive its nearness—why is this so?
For the qi of creation and the heart of the sage, though in motion, do not depart from stillness, and though in being, do not abandon nonbeing, pervading the myriad things and the myriad people.
They are aligned, seen, served, delighted, contended, and wearied within its midst, yet remain unaware of it.
This is why the sequence of the eight trigrams emerges from *Zhèn* and is completed in *Gèn*.
Is this not called "Emperor" precisely because the qi of creation and the heart of the sage are one?
