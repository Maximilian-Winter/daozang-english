**The Supreme Wondrous Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for Salvation of Humanity: The Comprehensive Diagram, Middle Scroll**
Compiled by Liu Yuandao, Purple-Robed Daoist of the Taiqing Chuqing Abbey and Guardian of the One

### **Thirty-Five Divisions: The Primordial Qi of the Upper Origin**
The Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper and the Twenty-Eight Constellations of the Four Directions together form the Thirty-Five Divisions. They govern the primordial *qi* of the Upper Heavens, presiding over creation and transformation.

The Northern Dipper is the Central Dipper. As stated in the *Records of the Grand Historian: Treatise on the Celestial Offices*: "The Dipper is the Emperor’s chariot, revolving at the center and overseeing the four quarters. It divides yin and yang, establishes the four seasons, harmonizes the Five Phases, shifts the nodal measures, and determines all celestial reckonings—all pivot upon the Dipper." This diagram is drawn to observe the directional configurations. I have arranged the constellations to clarify this chapter, depicting the Thirty-Five Divisions of the Primordial *Qi* of the Upper Origin.

### **The Thirty-Two Heavens: A Comprehensive Summary of Hidden Mysteries**
From the Great Yellow Emperor’s *Huang* Heaven to the *Shangming* and Seven Luminaries’ *Moye* Six Heavens form the Desire Realm.
From the *Xuwu Yueheng* Heaven to the *Wuji Tanshi* Eighteen Heavens form the Form Realm.
From the *Haoting Xiaodu* Heaven to the *Taisu Xiule Jin* Four Heavens form the Formless Realm.
These constitute the Three Realms.

From the *Taixu Wushang Changrong* Heaven to the *Taiji Pingyu Jiayi* Four Heavens are the Heavens of the Seed People.

Upon examining this scripture, I have divided it into ten matters:
1. **Heavenly Names** – The names established at the beginning of the kalpa.
2. **Imperial Titles** – The titles bestowed by the Primordial Beginning.
3. **Imperial Taboo Names** – The names of the Heavenly Emperors.
4. **Heavenly Emperor’s Governance** – The office of the Eternal Dao.
5. **Constellation Qi** – The *qi* descending in connection with the Twenty-Eight Constellations.
6. **Qi Names** – The names of the primordial *qi* as received.
7. **Qi Colors** – The colors of the primordial *qi* as divided by direction.
8. **Great Brahma’s Hidden Speech** – Established internally, composed by the Dao Lord. The details are explained in the chapter on the origin of inner sounds in the lower scroll.
9. **Divisional Boundaries** – The ascent and descent between upper and lower.
10. **Lifespans of Heavenly People** – The measures of longevity and brevity.

This diagram is the essence of the precious scripture; those who recite and uphold it should study it in detail and practice accordingly. I have synthesized the commentaries of Chen Jingyuan, Xuan Ying’s *Subtle Exegesis*, Li Shaowei, Xue Youqi, and Yan Dong, along with the *Hunyuan Tu Yi* and *Kongdong Lingzhang Jing*, to establish this chapter.

**Heavenly Names, Imperial Titles, Imperial Taboo Names, Heavenly Emperor’s Governance, Constellation Qi, Qi Names, Qi Colors, Great Brahma’s Hidden Speech, Divisional Boundaries, Lifespans of Heavenly People**

### **Explanation of Constellation Qi**
The twenty-eight heavens of the cardinal directions each correspond to the *qi* of one constellation. The four heavens of the intercardinal directions each correspond to the *qi* between two constellations. Furthermore, the descending and intersecting *qi* cause the northeast heaven to also connect with the northwest constellation, for the generative *qi* ascends in a spiral like a ram’s horn. Though the profound principles are thoroughly understood, confusion may arise regarding the directions and intercardinal points; thus, this diagram is made to clarify them.

### **Names and Taboo Names of the Five Directions’ Five Emperors and Their Governance**
According to the scriptural meaning, the Five Heavens—endowed with the *qi* of the Five Spirits—reside in the midst of the Great Void. Above them are the Five Dippers, and below stand the Five Peaks, governed by the Five Emperors. These are the heavens of directional colors, not the heavens of formed images.

The names, taboo names, and governance of the Five Elders, Five Emperors, Five Dippers, Five Heavenly Demon Kings, and Five Great Demon Kings must be known by those who recite the scripture. I have synthesized the commentaries of Chen Jingyuan, Xuan Ying’s *Subtle Exegesis*, Li Shaowei, the *Shangshu Zhiyao Tu*, and the *Wupian Zhenwen Jing* to establish this chapter.

**Division of Scripture’s Beginning and End**
The Heavenly Worthy expounded two chapters of scripture, each with a preface and postface.

All were composed by the Dao Lord.
The details are recorded in the lower scroll’s *Chapter on the Descent of the Bright Treasure Scripture’s Sealed Treasury* and the *Chapter on the Causes of the Inner Sounds’ Manifestation*.
Here, the beginning and end are separated, the sections divided, and the character count fixed according to the canon.
Including the titles, the total is 4,574 characters. Following Chen Jingyuan’s exegesis and integrating Zhang Wanfu’s oral instructions, I have established this chapter.

**Oral Instructions for Reciting the Two Principal Scripture Chapters**
On days appointed for scripture recitation, within a purified chamber, set up an altar facing east with a scripture stand and seating. Enter the chamber, turn your back to the mat, and face east to perform the three bows.
After bowing, withdraw and sit facing north upon the mat.
Once the *qi* settles, gradually turn left to sit facing east.

Recite the incantation:
*Silent, it reaches the ultimate source,*
*Vastly erect, beyond kalpas’ blade, Ah.*
*Profound and cavernous, the mysterious writ—*
*Who fathoms this hidden distance?*
*Entering the Great Vehicle’s path,*
*Who reckons the kalpas’ span?*
*Neither born nor extinguished,*
*Yet born from the lotus’ cause.*
*Transcending the Three Realms’ way,*
*Compassionate heart unbinds the world’s net.*
*Perfected One of supreme virtue,*
*Generation upon generation, a family of immortals.*

Upon completing the incantation, place your hands upon your knees and strike the teeth thirty-two times.
Close your eyes and visualize the thirty-two heavens, each with its Emperor Lord.
Contemplate one heaven’s name and bow in your heart to its Heavenly Emperor.
Beginning with *Huangceng Heaven*, follow the sun’s course, circling the four directions, gradually ascending to *Jiayi Heaven*.
In all, thirty-two bows—though the body remains still, the heart prostrates.
After bowing, envision yourself enveloped in clouds of azure, yellow, and white *qi*, filling the chamber with dense, misty radiance.
To your left, the Azure Dragon; to your right, the White Tiger; before you, the Vermilion Bird; behind you, the Dark Warrior.
Sixteen lions sit in two rows facing one another; an equal number of white cranes stand beyond them.
The sun shines before you, the moon behind, illuminating the chamber. A nine-colored halo arises from your crown, shining through all heavens.
Surveying all you have visualized, it stands vividly before your eyes.

Recite silently the incantation:

The Most High Mysterious Primordial Supreme Dao Lord, summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendants, the Jade Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, the Direct Talismans of the Five Thearchs, and the Daily Incense Officials—thirty-two of each—opening the passage for the words to be spoken.

The words to be spoken are those supplications for Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, the stellar lodges, the sovereign, teachers and friends, ancestors, oneself, and the multitudes of the people. When the incantation reaches the phrase "opening the passage," these are to be declared.

Today is an auspicious and joyous occasion; the hall is pure, the fast unbroken, the scripture recited for the boundless salvation of beings. This servant, together with [name or "so-and-so"], [name or "such-and-such matter"]—here state the same aspiration as above—prays that the petition ascend directly to the presence of the Most August Primordial Celestial Venerable of the Thirty-Two Heavens.

Upon completing the incantation, slowly draw in one breath of *qi* from each of the Thirty-Two Heavens, swallowing it in turn. Proceed as before. Cease.

Then open the eyes and recite the two chapters. Upon completing the recitation, face south and descend from the mat, bowing twice before withdrawing.

Following the interpretations of Chen Jingyuan and the methods of Zhang Wanfu, these chapters are established.

**Quiet Chamber Diagram**
The Great Elixir is thus; the affairs within the illuminated chamber need not face south to open the door.

**Recitation of the Inner Sounds Formula**

Recite the sixty-four characters of the East:
From *"Danlou Ahui"* to *"Four Images Xuyuan."*
Sit upright, click the teeth nine times, and visualize nine-colored dragons guiding before and behind, with nine layers of azure clouds enveloping the body.

Silently intone the incantation:
*"Vermilion brightness unfolds the diagram, eight qi return to the true.
Governing the Mysterious Gate, Great Azure Deity.
Flowing transformation beyond the nine, entwining my body.
Sacred sounds of eight writings, sixty-four chapters.
Penetrating Heaven and Earth, uniting with me as immortal.
Summoning the dragon chariot, ascending to the imperial axis."*

Conclude, draw in *qi* nine times and swallow it, then recite.

Recite the sixty-four characters of the South:
From *"Nanyan Dongfu"* to *"Divine tassels from the palace."*
Sit upright, click the teeth three times, and visualize a vermilion phoenix soaring before you, with three layers of crimson clouds enveloping the body.

Silently intone the incantation:
*"Three qi linger, the sacred phoenix arrives in flight.
Jade sounds of eight characters, resplendent in the Purple Tenuity.
Auspicious day, great celebration—my Dao opens wide.
Crimson cinnabar as sweet nectar, I gaze upward to absorb the sacred radiance.
Body born of water and fire, clad in crimson feathered robes.
Ascending the void with mystic steps, feet treading the phoenix ladder.
Circling the eight heavens, seven ancestors follow.
Conclude, draw in *qi* three times and swallow it, then recite."*

Recite the sixty-four characters of the West:
From *"Daoli Huiyou"* to *"Cypress Void Transcendent."*
Sit upright, click the teeth seven times, and visualize the White Tiger and lions guarding before and behind, with seven layers of white clouds enveloping the body.

Silently intone the incantation:
*"Seven qi of golden numen, honored deities of the eight heavens.
White Tiger steers the chariot, lions bear the shaft.
Seven qi entwine, refining me into an immortal.
Body ascends in golden light, illuminating the white clouds.
Inner and outer transformations, rising into the cavernous gate.
Seven ancestors escape the night, nine dark realms revolve their souls.
Eons of deliverance, enduring with the turning of fate."*

Conclude, draw in *qi* seven times and swallow it, then recite.

Recite the sixty-four characters of the North:
From *"Juewu Ziyu"* to *"Secluded Tranquility Delivers Beings."*
Sit upright, click the teeth five times, and visualize flying dragons and the Dark Warrior, their feathered canopies lush; divine youths and jade maidens in feathered robes and flying garments. Five layers of black clouds envelop the body.

Silently intone the incantation:
*"Mysterious Heaven lingers, flowing radiance ascends to the Upper Clarity.
Great Possession initiates the turning, eight characters exalted in brightness.
Flying darkness stills the void, the hidden yin spontaneously generates.
Five qi entwine, irrigating my form.
Crowned and girded in the Northern Loneliness, receiving refinement in the cavernous numen.
Kidney palace emerges from the north, inner and outer luminous essence.
Soaring through the Three Realms, roaming and feasting in the Purple Court.
Seven ancestors share fortune, rejoicing in kalpas of age.
Within the Forest of Seven Treasures, reborn in a returned womb.
Emerging from eternal night, names recorded in the Southern Palace.
Yellow Registers and White Tallies—lifetimes of immortals."*

Conclude, draw in *qi* five times and swallow it, then recite.

**Verification of Reciting the Two Chapters of the Orthodox Scripture**

During the long fast of the first month, recite and chant this scripture to sever the earthly bonds of ancestral spirits, delivering them to the Southern Palace.

During the long fast of the seventh month, recite and chant this scripture to attain divine transcendence, with names inscribed in the heavens.

Yellow Registers and White Tallies erase death and grant rebirth.

During the long fast of the tenth month, recite and chant this scripture for the emperor and sovereign, ruler and ministers, father and son, to stabilize the nation’s destiny and preserve Heaven’s enduring existence. Dynasties shall never cease, perpetually ruling as sovereigns. Stabilizing their realm, the people shall praise great peace.

On the eight seasonal nodes, recite and chant this scripture to become a Perfected of the Nine Palaces. On one’s natal day, recite and chant this scripture to purify the soul and spirit, preserving the myriad *qi* eternally, avoiding suffering, and radiating light from the body. Guarded by the Three Realms, welcomed by the Five Emperors, myriad deities pay homage, and names are inscribed in the heavens above. With merits fulfilled and virtue perfected, ascend to the Upper Clarity.

Recite ten times, and the heavens record the merit; recite a hundred times, and names are delivered to the Southern Palace; recite a thousand times, and demon kings provide escort; recite ten thousand times, and the Dao is complete—ascend to the Great Void.

If one encounters such an occasion and adheres to the formula in recitation, above it dispels celestial disasters and safeguards the emperor; below it wards off poison and harm to deliver the multitudes; in the middle, it liberates ancestors and grants oneself the Dao. This may be called the majestic and vast Great Brahma, the unparalleled one who strides the Jade Capital.

**Verification of Reciting the Inner Sounds**

The Great Brahma sounds of the East: recite for nine years, and the eight heavens each send eight Azure-Waisted Jade Maidens and Azure-Flora Jade Lads to attend and guard the body, descending the essence of Azure Teeth. The body radiates light, perceiving the formless. After ten thousand recitations, the Dao is achieved—soaring to the Upper Clarity, seven ancestors share fortune, all ascending to the Southern Palace.

The Great Brahma sounds of the South: recite for three years, and the eight heavens each send eight Great Cinnabar Jade Maidens and Great Yang Jade Lads to attend and guard the body, descending the essence of the three crimson *qi*. White returns to the complexion, enduring for ten thousand kalpas. Seven ancestors transcend and ascend, entering the Hall of Fortune, reborn in the immortal lineage—thus attaining renewal.

The Great Brahma sounds of the West: recite for seven years, and the eight heavens each send eight Luminous Jade Lads to attend and guard the body, descending the essence of the seven primordial *qi*. Age halts, countenance preserved—youthful for ten thousand kalpas. Blessings extend to seven ancestors, ascending and delivered to the Southern Palace, reborn in renewal, lifetimes of immortals.

The Great Brahma sounds of the North: recite for five years, and the eight heavens each send eight Great Primordial Jade Lads to attend and guard the body, descending the essence of the five nourishing *qi*. Years return, radiance preserved—lifespan secured in the Three Clarities. Fortune extends to the nine lineages, lifetimes of ascension.

If one adheres to the formula in reciting the inner sounds of the four directions, there is nothing that cannot be averted, nothing that cannot be warded, nothing that cannot be delivered, nothing that cannot be accomplished.

The Flying Celestials descend in observation, the Supreme Emperor chants from afar, myriad spirits pay homage in reverence, and the Three Realms attend in solemn procession. Subduing the host of spirits, purifying the ten directions, the Dao perfected and merits accomplished—one serves as minister to the Three Bounds.

I, in my foolishness, have arranged this fixed chapter of the *Zhang Wanfu Jue*.

**The Precious Scripture Sealed and Bestowed Upon the World**
The Heavenly Worthy, in the Azure Prime of Heaven, expounded this scripture and conferred it upon the Dao Lord. Later, in the Great Cinnabar Heaven, he bestowed the Great Brahma Sounds. After the Dao Lord had compiled and ordered it, the heavens treasured it as a sacred relic, secreting it within the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Jade Capital in the Mysterious Metropolis. Its sealing and concealment are of the utmost gravity—none but the sagely may transmit it. Later, the Queen Mother of the West petitioned the Heavenly Emperor to descend it for averting the calamity of the *jiashen* year, entrusting it to the adepts of perfected truth, whence it thereafter circulated among mortals.

This scripture comprises the hidden hymns of the Celestial Emperors of all heavens and the arcane chants of the Demon Kings. Within it are expounded the kalpic destinies of heaven and earth, the names and titles of the myriad spirits, the intercourse of *yin* and *yang*, and the generation and transformation of primordial *qi*. Its meanings cannot be fully fathomed, nor its principles fully unraveled. Those who attain enlightenment in the Dao shall naturally achieve profound clarity.

In the heavens, it is transmitted but once every forty thousand kalpas; among mortals, but once every forty years. To leak or profane it lightly brings misfortune upon nine generations, condemning them to eternal servitude in the dark nether realms. How can one not be cautious? How can one not be cautious?

I, Li Shaowei, in my foolishness, have annotated and fixed this chapter.

**The Origin of the Inner Sounds**
The Heavenly Worthy, seated in the Cypress Mound of the Vermilion Radiance World, was enveloped in dense clouds and mist for three days and nights, the gloom unrelieved. The Five Elder Thearchs addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "Such has never been seen in our attendance today." When the Heavenly Worthy expounds the teachings, mountains and seas fall silent, and heaven and earth grow solemn and clear. Yet now, in broad daylight, darkness prevails, and the celestial and mortal realms are filled with dread. We, your ministers, are perplexed and know not the cause.

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Today, the manifold heavens have manifested auspicious signs, and numinous responses arise spontaneously. Jade characters blaze with brilliance, obscuring the light of life. Let all present close their eyes and await the revelation." In an instant, the celestial *qi* surged forth, the gloom dissolved, and five-colored radiance illuminated the ten directions. Each bore a spirit-script, its characters a *zhang* in breadth, manifesting in the void. Their splendor dazzled, eight-cornered rays trailing, their luminous essence so blinding they could not be gazed upon directly.

The Heavenly Worthy proclaimed to the assembled spirits: "This is the *Lingshu Bahui*, its characters devoid of fixed form, its purport profound and recondite—difficult for you to fathom in detail." Thereupon, he commanded the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign to transcribe the characters and elucidate their sounds, bestowing them upon the Dao Lord, totaling two hundred fifty-six characters. The Dao Lord arranged and composed them into text, calling it the *Great Brahma Hidden Speech*. It was appended to the two preceding chapters in sequence.

The Sovereign was one who, in the time of the Yellow Emperor, descended upon Mount Emei to confer upon him the method of the Three Ones and Five Sprouts, later ascending to heaven.

I, in my foolishness, have collated the *Inner Sounds Scripture* with the *Biographies of the Immortals* to fix this chapter.
