**Miscellaneous Verses, Songs, and Chants from the Chan Tradition**

This [text] is for those who study the Dao yet fail to comprehend the principles of *xing* (nature) and *li* (principle), practicing only the Golden Elixir (*jindan*). If the Way of *xing* and *ming* (life) remains unrefined, the mind’s operation will not be all-pervasive, and self and other will remain divided. How then can one attain ultimate perfection and transcend the Three Realms?

Thus the scriptures say: There are ten kinds of immortals, all of whom refine their minds to firmness and purity within the human realm, living for thousands or tens of thousands of years. Yet without cultivating the Samādhi of Right Awakening (*zhengjue sanmei*), when their retribution is exhausted, they return and scatter into the various destinies.

Hence Maitreya Bodhisattva’s *Verses on the Diamond Sutra* declares:
*"Though you endure for a hundred thousand kalpas,*
*In the end, you still fall into emptiness and annihilation."*

Thus this *Awakening to Reality* first entices practitioners with the lifeline of immortality through inner alchemy, then expands their spiritual powers with the wondrous functions of all buddhas, and finally relinquishes their illusory delusions through the awakened nature of *zhenru* (suchness), returning to the ultimate source of quiescent emptiness.

**Six Verses on the Ground of Nature**

The Buddha-nature is neither identical nor distinct;
A thousand lamps share a single light.
To augment it—how could it overflow?
To extinguish attachment—yet no harm is done.
Grasping and rejecting are both errors;
Burning and drowning—neither obstructs.
The dharmas of seeing, hearing, knowing, and perceiving—
Not one can be fathomed.

How wondrous! The sublime body pervades the Ganges’ sands,
The myriad forms and phenomena—unobstructed, unbarred.
When you awaken to the true Dharma-eye of perfect penetration,
You will know the Three Realms reside within your own home.

Gazing, you cannot perceive its form;
Yet when called, it responds with alertness.
Do not say this sound is like an echo in a valley—
If there were no valley, what sound would there be?

One thing encompasses hearing, seeing, knowing, and perceiving,
Veiling all sense-realms to reveal its mechanism.
Even this wondrous "one thing" is not truly existent—
On what, then, do the four depend?

Without moving a single step, you arrive in the Western Heaven;
Sitting upright, all directions lie before you.
The light behind your neck is still an illusion;
Even if you purchase immortality with a radish, treading on the soles of your feet, you are not yet a transcendent.

Seeking immortality is originally from non-birth;
Fearing annihilation—when has it ever been momentarily extinguished?
Eyes seeing is not as good as ears seeing;
Words spoken cannot compare to words smelled.

**No Merit or Demerit**
All day long, walking—yet never walked.
All day long, sitting—yet never sat.
Cultivating goodness does not accumulate merit;
Committing evil incurs no transgression.
If people of this age have not yet awakened to the mind,
Do not cling to these words and act in confusion.
After death, you must face King Yama—
How can you escape the boiling cauldrons and grinding stones?

**The Three Realms Are Only Mind**
The Three Realms are only the wondrous principle of mind;
The myriad things are neither this nor that.
Not one thing is not my mind;
Not one thing is my self.

**Seeing the Mind in All Things**
Seeing things, you see the mind;
Without things, the mind is not seen.
Within the ten minds’ openness or obstruction,
The true mind is never obstructed.
If discriminating knowledge arises,
It becomes inverted perception.
When you can behold phenomena without mind,
Only then do you approach the bodhisattva’s visage.

**Perfect Penetration**
Seeing true emptiness—emptiness is not empty;
Where is perfect clarity not perfectly penetrating?
Root, dust, mind, and dharma—all are without substance;
Only then do you know the wondrous function is one with the Buddha.

**Following It**
The myriad conditions surge before you;
Follow them in motion or stillness, amidst clamor or silence.
Perfect clarity, concentration, and wisdom remain unstained—
Like a lotus born from water, the lotus dries itself.

**Jeweled Moon**
A single wheel of the jeweled moon hangs in the empty sky,
Its pure radiance illumining all lands without obstruction.
Gather it—it does not congeal; stir it—it does not disperse.
Advance—it does not proceed; retreat—it does not withdraw.
That is not distant, this is not near;
Outer is not external, inner is not within.
Same within difference, different within same—
Tell me, puppet, do you understand?

**Verses on the *Heart Sutra***
The aggregates, sense-spheres, roots, dusts, emptiness, and form—
Not one dharma can be spoken.
Inverted perceptions are exhausted;
The quiescent body is naturally cultivated.

**Self and Others, Also Called "Equalizing Things"**
I am not different from others;
Others’ minds differ of themselves.
People have close and distant relations;
I have no self and other.
Water-dwellers, land-dwellers, fliers—
All are equally observed as one body.
Noble and base, honored and humble—
Head and feet are the same as myself.
I am not even existent—
How could there be a "you"?
When self and other both vanish,
All bubbles return to water.

**Reading the *Ancestral Teachings Collection* of Chan Master Xuedou**

A single drop from Caoxi divides into a thousand streams;
Illuminating the ancient, it clarifies the present without obstruction.
Yet recent scholars do not fathom the source,
Mistaking a hoofprint’s puddle for the great ocean.

Master Xuedou of Snowy Peak grasped the true essence,
Striking the Dharma-drum with thunderous roars.
The lion-king emerges from its den with a mighty roar—
A hundred beasts and a thousand demons all tremble in fear.

Sometimes in song, sometimes in verse,
He earnestly points out the path for the deluded.
His words are bold, his meaning profound,
Striking jade and ringing gold—echoing through the ages.

Alas! The deluded chase after conditions,
Clinging to words and appearances, seeking names and numbers.
The true suchness and real mark are originally wordless,
Without high or low, without edges or bounds.
Neither form nor emptiness, nor a dual body—
The ten directions’ dusty lands are a single wheel of perfection.

What division is there in true concentration between speech and silence?
It cannot be grasped, nor can it be abandoned.
Simply not dwelling on any phenomena—
This is the true rule of the Tathāgata.

To dispel the myriad forms, pair them with the real;
If delusion does not arise, the real is not obscured.
Only when both real and delusion are negated
Do you attain the true mind without obstruction.

Without obstruction, you gain freedom;
A single awakening instantly dissolves eons of transgressions.
Without exerting effort, you realize bodhi—
From this, you forever depart the sea of birth and death.

My teacher’s Dao is lofty, his words fluent,
Left in the world as a model.
Last night, I summoned him,
Pierced his nostrils with a staff,
And asked him, "What is the foremost truth?"
He replied, "Any words spoken are all slander."

**Precepts, Concentration, and Wisdom**

Precepts (*jie*), concentration (*ding*), and wisdom (*hui*) are the wondrous functions within the Dharma. Though buddhas and ancestors have spoken of them, those who have not yet realized their meaning still cling. Here, I briefly expound them to aid awakening.

When mind and environment are both forgotten, and a single thought does not move—this is *precepts*.
When the awakened nature is perfectly luminous, and inner and outer are crystal-clear—this is *concentration*.

**Wisdom**

Responding to conditions with boundless marvelous function—this is *wisdom*.
These three—precepts, concentration, and wisdom—mutually support and complete one another, each serving as both substance and function.
When *precepts* are the substance, then *concentration* and *wisdom* are its function.
When *concentration* is the substance, then *precepts* and *wisdom* are its function.
When *wisdom* is the substance, then *precepts* and *concentration* are its function.
The three never part for even an instant.
Like the sun, which relies on light to illumine, and light, which relies on illumination to shine—
without light, there can be no illumination; without illumination, there can be no shining.
Yet precepts, concentration, and wisdom all arise from a single nature,
just as light and illumination arise from a single sun.
If even the one is not truly one, how can the three be three?
When both three and one are forgotten, clarity and purity abide.

**The Mind Is Buddha**

The Buddha is the mind, the mind is the Buddha—
mind and Buddha have always been empty illusions.
Only when you know there is no Buddha and no mind
do you encounter the true Dharma-body Buddha.

The Dharma-body Buddha has no form,
a single sphere of radiance containing all images.
The formless form is the true form,
the imageless image is the true image.
Neither form nor emptiness, yet not non-emptiness,
neither moving nor still, neither coming nor going,
neither different nor identical, neither existent nor non-existent,
difficult to grasp, difficult to abandon, difficult to hear or see.
Within and without, perfect clarity pervades everywhere—
a single Buddha-land in a grain of sand,
a single grain of sand containing a great chiliocosm,
one body and mind in ten thousand identical forms.
To know this, you must realize the Dharma is without mind,
untainted and unobstructed—this is pure karma.
Though good and evil arise in a thousand forms, take no action,
and you are Namu and Mahākāśyapa.

**Song of the Pearl**

A treasure pearl lies within your robe,
naturally perfect and luminous.
Not knowing to seek it yourself,
you count the treasures of others.

Counting others’ treasures brings no benefit,
only teaching you to waste your strength.
How much better to recognize your own jewel,
whose value equals gold beyond measure.

This pearl’s light is supreme,
illuminating the three-thousandfold great chiliocosm.
Never has it diminished in the slightest,
yet floating clouds obscure it.

Since recognizing this cintāmaṇi,
who still clings to bubbles and empty flowers?
The Buddha’s pearl and my pearl are the same—
my nature returns to the Buddha-nature sea.

Pearl is not pearl, sea is not sea,
the vast expanse of mind embraces all worlds.
Though dust and clamor fill your eyes,
concentration and wisdom remain perfectly clear.

Neither emptiness nor form,
within and without, luminous as a flawless jade.
The six supernormal powers manifest boundless wonders,
self-benefit and benefiting others reach their utmost.

Seeing is completion, all matters end.
Without study, without action, the day is spent.
Fearful as an unborn infant,
movement and stillness follow conditions without fixation.

Neither severing delusion nor severing truth—
the minds of truth and delusion are both dust.
All dharmas have always been without form;
within the formless, the Dharma-body abides.
The Dharma-body is the natural, true Buddha,
neither human nor thing.
Vast and boundless, filling the world,
it is only the subtle and indistinct.

Dust does not stain, light shines of itself.
No dharma arises that is not born of the mind.
If the mind does not arise, dharmas vanish of themselves—
then you know that sin and blessing have no inherent form.

No Buddha to cultivate, no Dharma to expound.
The wise discernment of a true person arises naturally.
Words spoken become the roar of a lion,
not like the wild ox debating birth and death.

**Song of Pointing Out Delusion in Chan Concentration**

The Tathāgata’s Chan nature is like water—
when the body is still, wind and waves cease of themselves.
In movement and rest, profound and ever-clear,
not only when sitting is this so.

People today seek realization through silent sitting,
not knowing it depends entirely on seeing nature.
If nature is clear within seeing,
seeing settles of itself within nature.
When concentration is perfected, wisdom’s function is boundless—
this is called the buddhas’ supernormal powers.
If you wish to investigate its substance and function,
you see only the emptiness of the ten directions.

Within emptiness, nothing exists,
not even the subtle or indistinct.
If you seek the subtle and indistinct,
you err and lose the way.
Yet these two words—erring and losing—
cannot be grasped as evidence.
Even emptiness is like space,
how could there be gain or loss, subject or object?

Simply cast aside all dharmas,
leaving nothing remaining.
Suddenly, perfect clarity manifests of itself—
then you are no different from the buddhas.

The physical body is my post and thatch,
so I blend with the world and harmonize with custom.
In all actions, without mind,
why dispute right and wrong, honor and disgrace?

This born body is but a temporary abode,
the host of the inn is called Vairocana.
Vairocana neither comes nor goes—
then you know birth and death leave no trace.

If asked what Vairocana is,
it is only that which is not form.
Before your eyes, every leaf and speck of dust—
neither same nor different, neither close nor distant.
Within each speck of dust and every leaf,
each is Śākyamuni and Mahākāśyapa.
If different, the ten thousand sounds all resound;
if the same, a single wind gathers all.

If you wish to recognize the cintāmaṇi,
do not say you must attain the Dharma to know.
When sick, use medicine to heal;
once healed, what need is there for medicine?

When the mind is deluded, rely on the Dharma to illuminate;
when the mind is awakened, the Dharma is no longer needed.
Like a tarnished mirror polished—
blemishes and dust vanish of themselves.

All mind and dharmas are delusion,
so I teach you to leave all forms behind.
When all forms are left behind, what remains?
This is called the supreme, true reality.

If you wish to adorn the Buddha-land,
practice equality, compassion, and relief of suffering.
The bodhisattva’s original vow must be profound—
do not grasp at appearances.

This is called the perfect union of merit and wisdom;
in the future, you will receive prediction together.
If even a speck of dust stains you,
you will have no affinity with the buddhas.

Turning the thought, ordinary beings are deluded and attached,
all stained by the habits of love and desire.
Only because of excessive craving and clinging
do they constantly dwell in womb, egg, transformation, and moisture births.

To learn the Way, you must be fierce and resolute,
your heart of non-emotion hard as iron.
Even toward father, mother, wife, and children,
how are they different from others?

Always guard a single sphere of radiance,
seeing no desires to contemplate.
All dharmas are unattached at once—
what need to speak of hell and heaven?

Then my life is in my own hands,
in emptiness, neither ascending nor descending.
Appearing and disappearing in the buddhas’ lands,
I never leave the original seat of bodhi.

Guanyin’s thirty-two manifestations—
my learning too is verified through them.
Transformations beyond all conception,
all arise from the nature of carefree ease.

I am a Chan practitioner of no-mind,
indiscriminate in all matters.
Once a black ox,
now wholly white.
Sometimes I sing, sometimes I laugh—
others say I lack sense,
but how would they know
that beneath this coarse robe
lies a priceless treasure?

Should they see me speak of emptiness,
they swallow the jujube whole.
This Dharma only buddhas can know—
how could the foolish and dull grasp its outward signs?

Then there are those esteemed Chan practitioners
who only learn to match lips and contend with words.
They boast of my quick replies,
yet fundamentally fail to recognize the host.

They merely pluck branches and gather leaves,
unable to fathom and investigate the root.
With the root attained, branches and leaves flourish;
without the root, branches and leaves cannot endure.

Though they flaunt their grasp of the luminous pearl,
they remain entangled in self and other.
Far removed from the wondrous source of awakening,
separated by a thousand miles.

Such people are pitiable and laughable—
vainly claiming years of Dao-learning,
too proud to seek guidance,
wasting their lives in futility.
They are dull and deluded roots,
burdened by heavy karmic wrong views.
If they fail to awaken in this life,
how will they escape sinking in the next?

*Verse of No-Mind*
Laughable, my heart—
stubborn and coarse,
dull and drifting,
letting things rest as they are.

I neither cultivate practice
nor commit offenses,
neither benefit others
nor profit myself.

I do not uphold precepts,
nor observe taboos,
know not rites or music,
nor practice benevolence or righteousness.
Ask what I can do—
not a single thing.

Hungry, I eat;
thirsty, I drink.
Weary, I sleep;
awake, I walk.
Hot, I wear light clothes;
cold, I cover myself.

No thoughts, no worries—
what sorrow, what joy?
No regret, no scheming,
no念, no intent.
Life and death, honor and disgrace—
but a traveller’s inn.

Trees and nesting crows—
what comparison can be made?
Coming, I do not forbid;
going, I do not stop.
I neither avoid nor seek,
neither praise nor blame.
I do not shun the ugly,
nor covet the good and beautiful.

I neither dwell in quiet chambers
nor shun bustling markets.
I eat when meat is served,
drink when wine is offered.
I do not speak ill of others,
nor boast of my own rightness.
I neither favor the noble
nor slight the lowly and young.
Loved ones and enemies,
great and small, inner and outer—
all are met with equanimity,
whether in gain or loss, respect or insult.
My heart holds no dual views,
treading a single, unobstructed path.

I neither initiate blessings
nor begin misfortunes.
I respond only when moved,
rise only when pressed.
Unafraid of blades,
how could I fear tigers or rhinos?

I follow things in their naming,
unbound by fixed designations.
Eyes do not pursue forms,
sounds do not enter ears.
All appearances are but delusion.
Male and female, form and voice—
none are fixed entities.
Forms and appearances are without mind,
untainted and unloved.
At ease and carefree,
nothing can burden me.

The radiance of wondrous awakening shines through,
illuminating inner and outer.
It encompasses the six directions,
without near or far.

Light yet not light—
like the moon in water.
Hard to grasp or relinquish,
what comparison can be made?

Understanding this wondrous function,
one transcends all bounds.
Should one ask of my宗,
it is just this.

*Twelve Western River Moon Lyrics*

Deluded thoughts need not be forcibly extinguished;
the real—why seek it?
The original source and self-nature are equally cultivated as buddha.
Does enlightenment or delusion depend on sequence?

Awakened, one becomes buddha in an instant;
deluded, one drifts for ten thousand kalpas.
If one can align a single念 with true cultivation,
countless karmic stains are wiped away.

Originally without birth or extinction,
yet forcibly divided into birth and extinction.
How can sin and blessing have roots?
The wondrous essence has never increased or diminished.

I possess a luminous mirror,
long obscured by dust.
Today, polished and bright, it illumines heaven and earth—
all phenomena stand revealed, beyond concealment.

My nature enters the nature of all buddhas;
the buddha-nature in every realm is thus.
The moon’s clear reflection shines on cold springs—
one moon appears in a thousand pools.

Small—beyond the minutest fraction;
vast—pervading the three thousand worlds.
High and low, unconstrained, naturally round.
What need to speak of short or long, deep or shallow?

Dharmas, dharmas—fundamentally no dharma;
emptiness, emptiness—yet not empty.
Stillness, speech, silence—originally the same.
In dreams, who ever spoke of dreams?

Use within use—no use;
effort within effort—bestowing effort.
Like fruit ripening naturally red,
ask not how it was cultivated or planted.

Good and evil—fleeting deluded念;
glory and decay—unrelated to the heart.
Darkness and brightness, concealment and display—
let them drift as they will.
Eat when hungry, drink when thirsty.

The spirit, serene and ever still,
does not hinder singing or chanting outside.
A pool of autumn water, deep and clear—
wind stirs, fish startle—let them be.

Before the mirror, no need to forcibly extinguish;
provisional names are but expedient bodhi.
Form and emptiness, brightness and darkness—originally equal.
True and deluded—two distinct bodies.

Awakened, it is called the Pure Land;
no need for India or Caoxi.
Who says the Land of Ultimate Bliss lies in the western heavens?
Awakened, Amitābha manifests.

Self, others, sentient beings, lifespan—
why distinguish high and low?
The dharmakāya illumines all,
without you or I.
Each念 discerns sameness and difference.

Seeing—when was it ever truly so?
Hearing—what is not necessarily so?
Coming and going, all functions—unknown to one another.
Who can hinder your birth and death?

Abiding in念, cultivating practice, giving—
their fruition does not transcend gods and humans.
Like shooting an arrow upward at floating clouds,
it falls only when its force is spent.

How much better the true mark of non-action—
return to simplicity, restore purity.
Forget circumstances, let nature follow its course,
to realize the patience of the unborn.

If fish and rabbit come to hand,
one naturally forgets the trap and snare.
The raft for crossing the river,
the ladder for ascending the sky—
once arrived, all are discarded.

Before awakening, one relies on words;
awakened, words are all false.
Though the four phrases belong to non-action,
why need they be cast aside?

Awakened, do not seek extinction;
follow conditions to guide the deluded.
In ordinary dealings, correct wrong views and lead others—
expediently point to the real.

The five eyes and three bodies, the four wisdoms,
the six perfections and ten thousand practices—all cultivated in harmony.
A single orb of perfect radiance, a flawless mani jewel,
benefiting others while benefiting oneself.

I see people of this age speak of nature,
boasting hastily to match the moment.
Yet when they encounter circumstances, they turn deluded—
how do they differ from the foolish?

To speak is to act accordingly;
only then is speech and conduct without flaw.
Wield the sword of wisdom to sever demonic illusions—
this is called the Tathāgata’s true wisdom.

To comprehend the wondrous Dao of the unborn,
nothing surpasses seeing one’s true mind.
The true mind is without form, without sound—
only the pure Dharma-body remains.

This Dao is neither outside nor within,
nor is it to be sought in the middle.
Cast aside both extremes, abandon the center—
seeing thus is called the highest rank.
