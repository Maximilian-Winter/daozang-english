**Scroll One of *The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Inner Sounds of the Various Heavens, Spontaneously Manifested in Jade Characters***

### *The Jade Instructions of the Great Brahma’s Hidden Language and the Infinite Cavernous Chapters*

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared: *"The Jade Characters of the Heavenly Scripture"* condense the soaring mystery of *qi* to form numinous script, unite the Eight Assemblies to compose sound, and harmonize the Five Convergences to complete its chapters. When the great cosmic cycle commences, jade-like tones arise of themselves; divine winds play in emptiness, and the *shao* melodies resound through the caverns. They shine brilliantly above the various heavens, illuminating the depths of the Great Obscurity, evolving in unison with the Dragon Han era and unfolding the Crimson Clarity of the Yan Kang epoch. They refine water and fire within life and death, enduring through kalpas without end, opening the Eight Enclosures at the hidden pivot and planting the numinous radiance within the Great Yang. The Two Modes uphold them to divide [heaven and earth], and the Three Luminaries sustain them to distinguish [time and space]. The exalted sages ride them to ascend in glory; the Five Peaks treasure them for their numinosity. All things attain life through them, and the fortunes of states enjoy peace by their virtue. Vast and boundless is their great model, lofty and revered their supreme dignity. From being arises non-being, and they are the root of heaven and earth. Those who attain them do not die; those who venerate them endure forever. Those who treasure them receive the descent of the Perfected; those who cultivate them become immortals. They deliver the dead from eternal night and refine the living souls in the Vermilion Palace. The wondrous transformative script emerges from spontaneity—blended, it is not turbid; clarified, it is not pure; destroyed, it is not extinguished; extinguished, it revives again. Towering and transcendent above the Great Void, they are the ancestral origin of the myriad emperors. Their majestic numen is vast and boundless, beyond all naming.

**Year of the Great Year-Star [Tai Sui], [specific] month, [specific] jiazi day as the new moon, [specific] jiazi day as the appointed day:**

The Perfected of [specific] Sacred Peak, whose natal destiny is [specific], born in the [specific] jiazi month, and whose celestial register is under the jurisdiction of the Qi Sovereign of [specific] Qi Heaven, now in [specific] Qi Heaven, receives the scriptural talisman from Master [specific], the Daoist of [specific] Sacred Peak, to wear upon the body. With the Seven Treasures sealing the spirit, golden silk pledging the heart, and a covenant sworn before the numinous heavens, this talisman is bound as the body’s treasure. Reverently upholding the Great Law, adhering to ancient canons, and petitioning the overseers of the Thirty-Two Heavens—those who monitor the scriptural decrees of salvation, the Attendant Immortal Gentlemen of the Scriptures, Han the Controller of Records, the Flying Heaven Perfected, and the Divine Kings of the Three Realms—[the initiate’s] name is stricken from the register of mortal death and inscribed upon the golden tablets and jade registers of the Three Primordials. In accordance with the majestic rites of the Great Enclosure, the qi of the true immortals descends and enters the initiate’s body.

The Supervisory Immortal Marshals of the Thirty-Two Heavens and the Feathered Gentlemen of the Scriptures, each according to their register, dispatch the qi of jade lads and jade maidens—one portion each—to attend and guard the numinous scripture, bestowing it upon the initiate’s body. This universally binds all heavens, all earths, and the boundless worlds; the sun, moon, and stellar lodges; the officials of the Three Realms; the Five Sacred Peaks, famous mountains, and the water palaces of the Nine Rivers; the Three Officials who mete out punishments; and the spirits of the Nine Darks, the Long Night, and the Yellow Springs—those without shadow or form, without name or sound, without size or stature, without rank or station—all shall clearly recognize that the initiate upholds the Great Law, bears the celestial scripture upon the body, and has a name inscribed in the registers of the Three Primordials. In all goings and comings, they shall attend and welcome as before, thrice daily, as in the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace. The earthly writs of the Nine Darks are expunged, the roots of past transgressions severed, and evil affinities gradually dissolved. No restraint or arrest shall befall the initiate; through countless kalpas, no entanglement shall arise. Seven generations of ancestors shall share in this blessing, all ascending to roam freely in the Seven-Treasured Grove of the Mysterious Capital, where souls undergo refinement and salvation, and in due time, attain rebirth.

The initiate pledges to uphold the Great Law, ever mindful of the Perfected’s scrutiny, vigilant in sincerity, to achieve immortality in life and death, befriend the Five Emperors, and wander playfully through the heavens. Should the covenant be broken, the celestial scriptures divulged, or transmission occur outside the proper time, the consequences of life and death shall be faced, and the debt to the River Source shall endure eternally. For ten thousand kalpas, the Wind Blade shall strike nightly upon the mountains. Recompense for transgressions and blessings shall be meted out precisely as sworn in the covenant.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declares: Upon receiving the *Innate Jade Characters of the Inner Sounds of All Heavens*, one must adhere to the canonical standards of the Illuminated Perfected. Inscribe in vermilion upon white silk, present the Seven Treasures, seal the spirit with golden silk, and offer a yellow-silk memorial with reverent devotion. Proclaim the salvific scripture of the heavens, exposing it upon the central altar for three days and nights, unmarred by wind or rain, the scripture undisturbed. Only then may it be transmitted in accordance with the Perfected.

*The chambers of the dark realms grow bright and clear.*
*The Three Evils cease,*

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign Lord said: These incantations are the words of the Four Assemblies’ qi and the Eight Harmonies’ sounds, the spontaneous chapters. Those who practice them will have the heavens chant from afar, the Three Realms prepare rites, and the myriad spirits don their regalia to attend and guard the numinous script. Following the seasonal observances, reciting the incantations and swallowing qi for a hundred days, the heavens will record it, and the earthly officials will erase the transgressions. After eight years, the divine Perfected will descend of their own accord, the body will generate jade light, and one will penetrate the dark and numinous, sitting to behold the spontaneous. The dead corpse revives, returning to humanity with the moon’s renewal, revolving without extinction, attaining immortality through life and death. The Dao is most wondrous and exalted, transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas. Those who lightly disclose or neglect it will bear the burden of the river’s source, suffering the wind-blade for ten thousand kalpas, never attaining immortality. The Perfected have set the rules; it is fitting to keep this secret.

The Most High Cavernous Mystery, Numinous Treasure, *The Heavenly Inner Sounds of the Spontaneous Jade Script*, Scroll Two

The Great Brahmā’s Hidden Language, the Immeasurable Cavernous Chapters

At that time, the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning was seated with the Five Venerable Thearchs, the great sagely hosts of the ten directions, and the boundless perfected lords and elders in the Cypress Mound Lodge within the Crimson Clarity World, beneath the Long Mulberry in the Fragrant Grove Garden. As the Celestial Worthy turned his carriage, the hosts of heaven descended from their seats. Then clouds and mist surged thickly, the four directions darkened, and for three days and nights, the mysterious yin did not disperse, heaven and earth lost their light, as if before the Dragon Han—a profound and obscure gloom.

The Five Venerable Thearchs stepped forward, made obeisance, and addressed the Celestial Worthy: "Today, as we attend your seat, we have never before experienced such a thing. When the Celestial Worthy departs, the hosts of heaven overturn their carriages, the divine and sagely thearchs, the jade maidens, the sun, moon, and stars, the pivot and jade balance, the officials of the Three Realms, the immortals of the Five Peaks, the water thearchs of rivers and seas—all spirits without exception—stand in solemn reverence, attending the Heavenly Perfected. Yet now the heavens are bright and the air clear, the wind does not stir the branches, the earth is free of flying dust, rivers and seas are still, mountains and peaks conceal their mists, the time is harmonious and the qi settled, causing the living and the dead to rejoice together. But the celestial light is obscured, the daylight grows dim, the heavenly beings are alarmed, and the assembly is uneasy. We do not know the reason for this, nor why it has come to pass. We humbly beseech your instruction, that all may see the light, and all beings universally attain peace."

The Celestial Worthy replied: "Today, as we sit together, such joy is rarely encountered. The heavens emit auspicious signs, and the numinous responses arise spontaneously. The jade script shines brilliantly, veiling the celestial light. At the beginning of its transmission, this causes the daylight to darken—a rare and auspicious convergence. Now, for the sake of the four assemblies, I shall reveal the wondrous celestial portent, delivering all beings. Let all in the assembly close their eyes and prostrate themselves upon the earth."

Thereupon, the sagely hosts of heaven simultaneously closed their eyes and prostrated themselves to receive the command. In an instant, the celestial qi cleared, the gloom dissipated, and five-colored light illuminated the five directions. Suddenly, a celestial script of characters a *zhang* square appeared spontaneously in the empty mystery above, within the five-colored light. Its radiance shone brilliantly, eight rays trailing from its corners, its luminous essence dazzling the eyes, making it impossible to gaze upon.

The Celestial Worthy addressed the great assembly: "The numinous script of the Eight Assemblies has no fixed form; its meaning is profound and obscure, difficult to fathom. Since heaven has bestowed this response, the wondrous Dao should be made clear. Now, take up your brushes and interpret its true sounds, so that the imperial Dao may flow freely, and its blessings extend to the ten directions."

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign Lord bowed his head, made obeisance, and addressed the Celestial Worthy: "Since following the turning of the kalpas through countless eons, I have repeatedly attended your seat, yet never before have I encountered such an occasion—witnessing the opening of the dharma gates and beholding the celestial script, the spontaneous and utmost real. This qi of the Eight Assemblies harmonizes with the Five Harmonies’ sounds, beyond the capacity of foolish thoughts and shallow reflections to fully comprehend."

Now, having taken my place among the assembly and gazed upon these profound mysteries, I have received this command in trepidation. Unworthy as I am, I dare not conceal my thoughts, though my heart trembles as if bereft of divine protection. Thus, I shall exhaust my understanding to interpret and annotate its sounds, hoping that the myriad beings may align with it, and that future generations may grasp what was once beyond reach. May your boundless compassion be upon me.

Thereupon, the Divine Consort took up her brush, the Supreme Perfected swept the mat, jade maidens held the silk, golden youths wafted incense, moon-palace maidens scattered blossoms, sun spirits poured nectar, the Five Elders oversaw the trial, and the Three Realms guarded the true. Their ranks were arrayed by measure.

The thirty-two heavens each bear eight characters. The Great Yellow Sovereign Ever-Heaven, the Great Bright Jade Perfect Heaven, the Clear Bright How-Child Heaven, the Mysterious Womb Level-Nurturing Heaven, the Primordial Bright Literary Ascendant Heaven, the Upper Bright Seven Luminaries Majestic Heaven, the Void Transcending Balance Heaven, and the Supreme Ultimate Veiled Heaven—these eight heavens, comprising sixty-four characters, belong to the Eastern Quarter’s Nine Qi Azure Heaven. The Radiant Bright Harmonious Yang Heaven, the Mysterious Bright Reverent Splendor Heaven, the Shining Bright Ancestral Whirlwind Heaven, the Bamboo-Falling August Reed Heaven, the Void Bright Hall-Shining Heaven, the Contemplative Bright Upright Stillness Heaven, the Mysterious Bright Reverent Celebration Heaven, and the Great Resplendent Ultimate Jade Heaven—these eight heavens, comprising sixty-four characters, belong to the Southern Quarter’s Three Qi Cinnabar Heaven. The Primordial Bearing Perforated Ascent Heaven, the Great Peace August Cliff Heaven, the Manifest Determined Ultimate Wind Heaven, the Beginning Yellow Filial Awn Heaven, the Great August Venerable Double-Floating Vessel Heaven, the Non-Thought River Origin Heaven, the Upper Casting Joyous Heaven, and the Boundless Vow Pledge Heaven—these eight heavens, comprising sixty-four characters, belong to the Western Quarter’s Seven Qi Pale Heaven. The Luminous Court Rosy Dawn Heaven, the Abyssal Penetrating Primordial Cavern Heaven, the Great Literary Flourishing Wondrous Completion Heaven, the Great Plain Elegant Joy Forbidden Upper Heaven, the Great Void Non-Above Constant Fusion Heaven, the Great Release Jade Dragon Ascendant Victory Heaven, the Dragon-Transforming Brahman Transcendence Heaven, and the Supreme Ultimate Level-Nurturing Splendid Prosperity Heaven—these eight heavens, comprising sixty-four characters, belong to the Northern Quarter’s Five Qi Mysterious Heaven. The four sets of eight heavens make thirty-two heavens in all, totaling two hundred fifty-six characters—all the thirty-two heavens’ great Brahmanic hidden language of boundless sound.

Each heaven possesses the soaring mysterious spontaneous qi, harmonizing with the five tones to form the heavens’ boundless cavernous hymns. Above, they unfold the heavens’ profound mysteries; they praise the Great Existence’s radiant clarity. At their center, they govern the spontaneous qi, universally delivering those who study immortality. Below, they deliver the lives of the dead, rescuing souls from endless night. The Primordial Beginning’s wondrous dharma endures for kalpas uncounted. Now that its sounds are resounding, its Way is practiced.

As the great dharma is revealed, the heavens rejoice. The Boundless Great Sage Host, the Perfected Lords, the Venerable Elders, the Five Elder Thearchs, the deities of the ten directions, the divine immortals, and the jade maidens all circumambulated thrice, offering incense, and intoned this hymn:

The Heavenly Worthy turned his jade chariot,
Descending to the fragrant garden’s seat.
The Perfected, the Great Sages,
The Boundless Kings of Heaven’s midst—
Divine immortals guide the sun and moon,
Lushly arrayed in cloudy palaces.
The Five Thearchs flank the radiant axle,
The Three Realms prepare for the ten directions.
The day celebrates the assembly of the Perfected,
Joy unmatched in its splendor.
The wondrous gathering stirs spontaneous response,
Auspicious omens arise in the empty cavern.
Resplendent, it inaugurates the hidden age,
Outshining the light of sun and moon.
The mysterious yin does not dissolve the night,
The four images stand in tranquil reverence.
The numinous workings follow their destined course,
Revering the clarity of the great void.
The Eight Assemblies’ celestial script,
The five tones harmonize to form its text.
The Heavenly Perfected unravel its wondrous rhymes,
Resonant and vast, it pervades the Great Existence.
The jade sounds defy comparison,
Universally accomplishing heaven and earth’s work.
Above, they plant the roots of the heavens,
Lofty, the lineage of divine immortals.
At their center, they unfold the mysterious cavernous palaces,
Illuminating the eight dark chambers.
They deliver the lives of the dead,
Rescuing souls from endless night.
The Five Pains of hell are dissolved,
The Blade Mountains’ edges no longer form.
The Five Paths hold no opposing souls,
For kalpas uncounted, all become youthful.
Majestic, the Great Vehicle’s transformation,
Its merit universal, without partiality.
The Primordial Beginning revealed the jade script,
Thus is he the King of Heaven’s midst.
Overcome with joy, unable to contain it,
They step lightly, chanting the numinous hymn.

The Heavenly Worthy opened the Great Existence,
The heavens, vast and bright, were illumined.
Wondrous indeed, the Dragon Kalpa’s Way,
The Eight Assemblies coalesced into form.
Resplendent, they soar within the void,
Their flowing light fills the Three Realms’ courts.
The divine chart inaugurates the numinous gathering,
The jade script responds to the scene’s arising.
The Heavenly Perfected penetrate its wondrous essence,
The Five Harmonies unite to form the scripture.
Resonant, the jade sounds ring,
Wafting, they ascend to the emerald Upper Clarity.
They deliver through kalpas without end,
The Nine Darks receive illumination.
Majestic, the great dharma gate,
Instructing all living beings.
Its merit is beyond reckoning,
Joyously delivering for ten thousand ages.

At that time, beneficent grace flowed universally, blessings extended to the ten directions. Those who believed and turned toward the undying all attained long life. The aged reverted to youth, the sick were instantly healed, withered bones revived with qi, dead souls returned to their bodies. The Five Pains were released, hells stilled. All who harbored sincere intent became divine immortals.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the four assemblies of the Perfected: "Today, we sit together within a single kalpa, revealing the heavens’ numinous mysteries, the spontaneous jade script, delivering all beings. Its blessings are vast and universal, broadly benefiting the multitude. The great dharma now perfected, its grace knows no bounds. The boundless worlds all receive illumination; the Nine Darks are opened, souls of the endless night are pardoned. The living rejoice, the dead are restored. The peoples of the heavens, the karmic ties of past lives, whether male or female, the roots of good and evil, from the beginningless past to this present life—birth and death revolving, misfortunes and karmic bonds entwined—heaven and earth’s successes and failures, merits and transgressions, are difficult to discern. Now, in accordance with the Great Existence, I universally proclaim to the heavens: the sun, moon, and stars; the jade celestial pivot; the Southern and Northern Dippers; the Directors of Destiny and Records; Lord Han, Keeper of Records; the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace; all earth and water deities; the sacred mountains of the Five Marchmounts; the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus; the Twelve River Sources; the courts of endless night; the midst of the Nine Darks; the Four Directors and Five Thearchs; and all spirits—examine the ledgers, trace the origins, weigh the roots of good and evil, distinguish the paths of life and death, list the names and details, erase all entries, sever the threads of causation, and universally grant a single amnesty."

Beginning anew from this moment, may all beings attain the true Dao, and may the great blessings be universally bestowed without partiality. The Heavenly Worthy has decreed, and all heavens reverently comply.

Thereupon, the four assemblies rose as one to bow in homage. Raising their hands, they pointed upward; lowering them, they pointed downward—without above, without below; without limit, without end; without depth, without distance; without darkness, without concealment; without greatness, without smallness; without beginning, without conclusion. All are universally delivered, together receiving radiant illumination. With a snap of the fingers, the assembly was addressed, and all heard.

At that time, the four assemblies simultaneously raised their hands and snapped their fingers toward heaven. The thirty-two heavens, the sun, moon, and stars all shone brightly as one. Beneath the earth, in the nine depths and the boundless abyss, the light penetrated completely, leaving no darkness or obscurity. All that was hidden became visible; Earth Treasury revealed its form. Mountains, rivers, streams, and ravines were all leveled as if stretched smooth. Winter blossoms bore fruit, withered trees flourished anew. Joy spread to all, and merit filled the multitude of beings. Fish and dragons leapt, birds and beasts rejoiced in song. Divine hymns harmonized, and no sorrowful cries were heard upon the paths. Heaven stilled, earth fell silent; the Three Officials withdrew into tranquility, their ledgers and judgments at rest. The Five Paths ceased to arise; humans and spirits rejoiced in peace. The sagely Dao flourished in great harmony.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared: *"The Inner Sounds of the Heavens, the Spontaneous Jade Characters"*—these are the great Brahmanic hidden words within all heavens, weaving the qi of soaring mystery and harmonizing the sounds of the five directions. They arise above the Primordial Beginning, emerging from the midst of the Empty Cavern. Following the turning of the kalpa, they universally accomplish the work of heaven and earth. This scripture is revered and wondrous, beyond comparison to the ordinary. Thus, at the inception of the Great Existence, the celestial radiance was sealed to treasure the Dao and honor its text. Its characters are profound and subtle, not like the formless writings of heaven. Truly precious are its wondrous symbols, concealing the utmost truth. The marvelous responsive chart follows its ordained course. The Heavenly Worthy did not consider my humble talent but commanded me to elucidate its meaning and convey its jade sounds. The mysterious statutes have their regulations; I dared not disobey the decree. On the day I took up my brush, my form and soul were instantly overwhelmed. Following what I beheld, I humbly annotated its text. Whether right or wrong, I have exhausted my heart’s sincerity. Now that the imperial Dao is illuminated, all heavens rejoice. All that is borne and sustained, the living and the dead, share in this joy. Great blessings universally encompass; my spirit naturally delights. I only wish that the four assemblies may all perceive and embody its clarity.

Thereupon, the perfected deities of the four assemblies as one voiced their approval. From heaven above to heaven below, from earth above to earth below, in the boundless and infinite, throughout the worlds of the Miraculous Net, all spirits without exception modeled their virtue, revering the Great Sage. Rejoicing in the Dao’s revelation, they only wished that the great Dharma would broadly deliver without end, that blessings would flow for kalpas unnumbered, and that the generations would endure forever. Joy and aspiration converged; all universally attained the true Dao, their gratitude boundless.

The four assemblies simultaneously rose as one, bowing in homage and prostrating to receive the decree.

**First Chant of the Supreme Yellow August Once-Heaven**

Within the Supreme Yellow August Once-Heaven, there are eight spontaneous characters, which read: *Dǎn Lóu Ā Huì Wú Hé Guān Yīn*.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared: These eight characters are the spontaneous writings of soaring mystery, each a *zhang* in breadth, their radiant patterns illuminating the eight directions. The Primordial Beginning descended to teach, commanding the transcription of these characters, the interpretation of their sounds, and the harmonization into the great Brahmanic hidden words of boundless sound within the August Once-Heaven. These were entrusted to the Dao Lord, to instruct those in the August Once-Heaven who bear immortal names, delivering those destined to attain the Dao.

*August Once’s primordial record,*
*Lóu’s capital at the upper realm.*
*Ā Nà resounds with jade chimes,*
*Cāng Xiù’s grace extends afar.*
*From Non-Being, the true arises,*
*Hé’s response bridges the luminous beam.*
*Guān’s awakening illumines the four darknesses,*
*Its tones and rhymes form verses spontaneously.*

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared: This verse harmonizes the qi of soaring mystery from the five directions within the August Once-Heaven with the spontaneous sounds of the eight characters, called the *"Boundless Cavern Verse."*

The August Once-Heaven lies nine billion ninety-nine thousand *qi* from the Supreme Bright Jade Complete Heaven. The *Yuán Jì* marks the farthest reaches of the eight directions and the four维. *Lóu Dū* is the name of the central long tower in heaven, upholding the Supreme Mystery Palace and the Jade Capital Mountain. *Ā Nà*, under the supervision of *Lóu Dū*, governs the reckoning of the six Brahmanic numbers. When these numbers intersect, *Lóu Dū* sounds its drum, and the assembled perfected ascend to court. *Huì Xiù* is the imperial lord’s wandering terrace; *Hé Dá* is the gateway of the sun and moon. Perfected beings ride golden wheels to open the darkness; jade maidens wield floral banners to unfurl the *Guān Jué*, presiding over the records of the long night. The four darknesses extricate the nine depths’ abodes. If one can perform purification rites on the eight solar terms, recite the Cavern Verse to harmonize the soul, then the seven ancestors will be illumined, withered bones will return to the gate, and one will wear the red script of the eight characters, mastering the boundless sounds. They will ascend upon cloud chariots to the carefree groves of the seven treasures, where immortal youths and jade maidens attend them.

**Second Chant of the Supreme Bright Jade Complete Heaven**

Within the Supreme Bright Jade Complete Heaven, there are eight spontaneous characters, which read: *Xū Yán Míng Shǒu Fǎ Lǎn Pú Tán*.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared: These eight characters are the spontaneous writings of soaring mystery, each a *zhang* in breadth, their radiant patterns illuminating the eight directions. The Primordial Beginning descended to teach, commanding the transcription of these characters, the interpretation of their sounds, and the harmonization into the great Brahmanic hidden words of boundless sound within the Jade Complete Heaven. These were entrusted to the Dao Lord, to instruct those in the Jade Complete Heaven who bear immortal names, delivering those destined to attain the Dao.

*Great brightness gathers at Xū’s numinous assembly,*
*Yán attends to unveil the jade truth.*
*The bright Dao traverses the mysterious Brahmanic path,*
*A hundred unfoldings enter the three conveniences.*
*The Dharma wheel penetrates the distant and obscure,*
*Lǎn’s awakening renews the great model.*
*Bodhi steers the net’s turning,*
*Tán’s countenance revolves like the sunwood.*

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared: This verse harmonizes the qi of soaring mystery from the five directions within the Jade Complete Heaven with the spontaneous sounds of the eight characters, called the *"Boundless Cavern Verse."*

The Jade Complete Heaven lies eight billion ten thousand *qi* from the Clear Bright Harmonious Youth Heaven. *Xū Yán* is the name of the northwest gate of the Jade Complete Heaven.

At the turning of the great kalpa, Xū Yán opens the gate,
The Jade Perfected Sovereign thus returns.
The bright Dao is the capital of the Primordial Beginning—
awaiting the Primordial Beginning’s unfolding of the kalpa.
When the capital awaits the activation of the Dao,
the Brahmanic qi of all practices suddenly shines forth.

The Three Conveniences are the gates of the Three Realms.
Those who know the sound of the eight characters
ascend beyond the Three Conveniences,
their bodies ascending to the Great Lofty Heaven.
The Dharma Wheel is the field of sin and fortune,
while Lǎn’s awakening is the threshold of life and death.
Reciting the numinous sound of the Cavern Verse,
one’s name is inscribed in the Purple Palace’s Dharma Wheel,
registered in the Bureau of Destiny’s Lǎn’s Awakening,
and souls are delivered to rebirth.

The Three Primordial Upper Saints of Bodhi and Tán
grasp the nine-colored banners,
while Tán’s countenance holds the ten absolute pennants.
The Upper Perfected revolve the nine colors to return the wheel,
and Tán’s countenance rotates the ten absolutes to halt the wheel.
Heaven and Earth thereby avoid collapse,
the myriad Dao endure forever,
immortals recite it to soar through the void,
the Five Peaks preserve it to attain peace,
and the nation’s destiny enjoys it without end.
The great kalpa may thus preserve life,
life and death may be favorably resolved.
Those who uphold it extend their years,
those who cultivate it ascend as flying immortals.

**Third Verse: The Clear Bright Harmonious Youth Heaven**

Within the Clear Bright Harmonious Youth Heaven,
there exists a spontaneous script of eight characters,
whose text reads: *Jià nà ā yì hū jué hē liú yín*.
The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared:
These eight characters are the spontaneous script of soaring mystery,
each a *zhang* in breadth, their radiant patterns illuminating the eight directions.
The Primordial Beginning descended to teach,
commanding the transcription of these characters,
the deciphering of their sounds,
and their harmonization into the great Brahmanic esoteric speech of the Harmonious Youth Heaven—
the *"Boundless Cavern Verse"*—
to be entrusted to the Dao Lord,
who instructs those in the Harmonious Youth Heaven
with immortal names to deliver the destined.

*Clear brightness ripens the harvest of blessings,*
*That path returns to Dragon Mountain.*
*Ā Xiù’s jade grove spreads its branches,*
*Luminous, the four quarters unfurl.*
*Suddenly awakened to the numinous kalpa’s transformation,*
*He-mó spreads the dawn.*
*The flowing truth enters the Three Realms’ court,*
*Chanting and whistling, it comes with diligent motion.*

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared:
This verse harmonizes the qi of soaring mystery from the five directions within the Harmonious Youth Heaven
with the spontaneous sounds of the eight characters,
called the *"Boundless Cavern Verse."*
The Harmonious Youth Heaven lies seven billion ten thousand *qi* from the Mysterious Womb Nurturing Heaven.
*Jià nà* is the name of the Heavenly Jade Chart Master,
who governs the Golden Flower Palace,
connected in script to Dragon Mountain,
resplendent above the Jade Clarity,
flourishing within the vibrant emptiness of the Cavern.
He oversees the records of life and death,
presiding over all immortals.
*Ā yì* is the name of a tree in the Seven Treasures Grove,
its canopy shading the gardens where Upper Saints wander,
the playgrounds where Perfected Ones sport—
a sudden awakening.

The Primordial Beginning is a flying celestial,
who governs the great and minor kalpas.
*He-mó* is the title of the Nameless One.
When the kalpa’s destiny reaches its end,
*He-mó* opens the darkness to spread the Dharma’s teachings,
universally delivering celestials and humans.
At that time, joy abounds,
the Dao’s teachings flow,
the celestial kalpa’s qi hastens,
the human realm declines,
the final destiny collapses—
hence the *"flowing chant."*
Those who plant goodness across ten thousand kalpas,
who bear immortal names from former lives,
encounter the Heavenly Sound,
cultivate and recite the Cavern Verse—
the Jade Chart Master erases their sins from the eternal night,
inscribes their names in the Southern Culmen’s Palace of Longevity.
Their seven ancestors, long confined, are reborn,
the gates of death transform into the realm of *huálínláng*,
causal connections unbroken,
lifetimes become immortal kings.

commanding the transcription of these characters,

and their harmonization into the great Brahmanic esoteric speech of the Nurturing Heaven—
the *"Boundless Cavern Verse"*—
to be entrusted to the Dao Lord,
who instructs those in the Nurturing Heaven
with immortal names to deliver the destined.

*The Flower Capital graces the Eastern Palace,*
*The Capital’s Brahmanic hymns soar as celestial songs.*
*Curved clarity purifies the vast emptiness,*
*Luminous grace follows the harmony of the void.*
*Fresh clouds shade the numinous abode,*
*Bodhi’s tiers greet the uneven heights.*
*The Nurturing King rides the radiant chariot,*
*Arriving at the domain of ghosts and spirits.*

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared:
This verse harmonizes the qi of soaring mystery from the five directions within the Nurturing Heaven
with the spontaneous sounds of the eight characters,
called the *"Boundless Cavern Verse."*
The Nurturing Heaven lies six billion ten thousand *qi* from the Primordial Brightness Literary Flourishing Heaven.
*Huá dū* is another name for the Heavenly Supreme Unity Palace’s Azure Flower Gate.
Above it, Brahmanic celestials fly and wander beyond the Supreme Ultimate,
eternally singing the *"Boundless Cavern Verse,"*
the qi of the *qū shuǎng* numinous wind
perpetually wafting the melody of the Cavern’s verse.
*Lì wǎn* is the Jade Maiden of Supreme Harmony,
who, at the Flower Capital’s gate,
harmonizes with the celestial songs.
*Xiān yún* is the unfolding of auspicious clouds,
dispersing above the eight sounds.
*Píng yù* is the hidden name of the Heavenly Emperor,
who constantly rides the eight-scene chariot,
roaming beyond the Supreme Ultimate,
revolving the ten absolute pennants
to summon the kings of great demons.
*Píng yù*—the Heavenly Sound—
is reverently recited by all Perfected Ones.
Flying celestials chant it from afar,
adorned with its script,
the Three Realms await its arrival,
the seven ancestors emerge from eternal night,
ascend to the Southern Palace,
the wheel turns to transform rebirth,
lifetimes become royal lineages.
Immortal youths and jade maidens
attend and guard their forms,
the Dao perfected, they ascend in flight
to the Nurturing Heaven.

who instructs those in the Literary Flourishing Heaven
with immortal names to deliver the destined.

**The Literary Flourishing Harmony Gate**

The Literary Flourishing Harmony Gate stands aloft,
its towering heights crowning the Three Portals.
The Great Possession unfolds in the Dragon-Han,
the Brahmā Heaven spreads its radiant clouds.
Fragrance scatters, ascending the celestial steps,
mist and haze spontaneously bloom into splendor.
A numinous wind carries returning incense,
while above, the empty wheel dances in the clouds.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared:
This verse harmonizes the five-directional soaring mystery *qi* of the Literary Flourishing Heaven
with the spontaneous sounds of the eight characters—
the *"Boundless Cavern Verse."*
The Literary Flourishing Heaven lies five hundred million *qi* from the Māyā Heaven.
The Harmony Gate is the jade palace within the heavens,
demarcating the Three Convenient Portals.
When the Great Brahmā moves, the primordial *qi* becomes luminous.
Thus, the Dragon-Han reckons its cycles and unfolds of itself,
while the Crimson Brightness awaits its turn to spread the dawn.
True persons scatter incense in the jade court,
mist and haze waft their fragrance,
brushing the true celebratory clouds to rest in the Purple Chamber.
The flying heavens dance in the empty wheel,
celebrating the great amnesty of the Primordial Beginning,
rejoicing in the eight characters of spontaneity.
The luminous mystery script delivers the multitudes,
while the sounds of the Cavern Verse perfect immortality.
Those who uphold it escape suffering;
those who cultivate it attain perfection.
Seven generations of ancestors share in the joy,
and the world gives birth to the gates of immortality.

and lost souls gain illumination.
The Dao opens the Cavern Verse through the eight characters,
delivering the dead to renewed peace.
Spirits and demons submit in reverence,
while the five clouds of mystery nourish as sustenance.
The Celestial Thearch nurtures the firstborn spirits,
and the Gatekeeper Han Lord records the accounts in the Southern Palace.
Only those with preordained virtuous names from ten thousand kalpas prior
may glimpse its passages and partake in this Cavern Verse.
Those who uphold it bring fortune to nine clans,
and both the living and the dead receive grace.
Those who cultivate it traverse water and fire,
ascending in broad daylight to the dawn.

**The Void Transcendent Yuheng Heaven**

Within the Void Transcendent Yuheng Heaven,
there exists a spontaneous script of eight characters,
whose text reads: *Wú xíng shàng shǒu huí bá liú xuán*.
The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared:
These eight characters are the spontaneous script of soaring mystery,
each a *zhang* in breadth, their radiant patterns illuminating the eight directions.
The Primordial Beginning descended to teach,
commanding the transcription of these characters,
the deciphering of their sounds,
and their harmonization into the great Brahmanic esoteric speech of the Yuheng Heaven—
the *"Boundless Cavern Verse"*—
to be entrusted to the Dao Lord,
who instructs those in the Yuheng Heaven
with immortal names to deliver the destined.

**The Seven Luminaries Uphold the Supreme Dao,**
**the Net of Conduct Braids the Mystery Mechanism.**
**Above, the Celestial One’s Gate Turns,**
**the First Motion Swiftly Unfolds.**
**The Returning Spirit is Not the Primal Chariot,**
**the Heel Rises to Soar in the Void.**
**The Flowing Dawn Governs the Long Night,**
**the Mystery Tower Returns of Itself.**

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared:
This verse harmonizes the five-directional soaring mystery *qi* of the Yuheng Heaven
with the spontaneous sounds of the eight characters—
the *"Boundless Cavern Verse."*
The Yuheng Heaven lies three hundred million *qi* from the Obscured Heaven.
*Wú* is the *qi* of the Primordial Beginning,
opening the luminous path of the Supreme Dao.
*Xíng* is the fundamental net of conduct,
encompassing the eight directions.
*Shàng shǒu* is the palace of the Four Non-Existent in the Northern Dipper.
The Celestial Gate turns, reckoning the cycles of time.
When the celestial reckoning reaches its limit, the great kalpa shifts.
The transformations of the Five Realized Scriptures return,
riding the end of the great cycle to illuminate the Five Scriptures.
Emerging from the void, heaven and earth open of themselves.
Those with meritorious deeds and preordained names in the Mystery Capital
are plucked from the long night,
truly escaping the nine nether realms,
reborn into the gates of goodness,
eternally freed from the dark yin,
dwelling in the blessings of life and death.
Above the capital of the Yuheng Heaven lies the Empty Peak Mountain,
the realm where ten thousand sages wander,
the destination of life and death.
Those who study the Cavern Mystery Dao,
upon attaining perfection, ascend directly to the Empty Peak,
receiving their title and soaring into the void.
If the Dao is not yet fully cultivated when the body perishes,
the soul ascends to the Empty Peak,
undergoes refinement, and is delivered to the Southern Palace.
The essence of the Yuheng Heaven culminates in this principle.

**The Supreme Ultimate Obscured Heaven**

Within the Supreme Ultimate Obscured Heaven,
there exists a spontaneous script of eight characters,
whose text reads: *Ā tuó lóng luó sì xiàng xū yuán*.
The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared:
These eight characters are the spontaneous script of soaring mystery,
each a *zhang* in breadth, their radiant patterns illuminating the eight directions.
The Primordial Beginning descended to teach,
commanding the transcription of these characters,
the deciphering of their sounds,
and their harmonization into the great Brahmanic esoteric speech of the Obscured Heaven—
the *"Boundless Cavern Verse"*—
to be entrusted to the Dao Lord,
who instructs those in the Obscured Heaven
with immortal names to deliver the destined.

**The Obscured Asaṃkhya Ridge,**
**the Dāra Hill Intertwines with Numinous Might.**

At Dragon Mound, standing in empty heights,
Luo’s radiance illumines the cloud-sleeved sky.
The Four Palaces engender true visions,
their discourse on symbols pervades the Three Realms.
*Xū* nurtures and refines the decayed souls,
*Yuán* lads deliver the covenant of life.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared:
This chapter blends the five-directional soaring mystery *qi* of the Obscured Heaven
with the spontaneous sounds of the eight characters,
called the *"Boundless Cavern Verse."*
The Obscured Heaven lies two hundred million *qi* from the Crimson Clarity Harmonious Yang Heaven.

*Ā* denotes the nine-fold mountain range within the heavens, linked in continuous succession.
*Dāra* signifies the tower upon the mountain, its summit connecting to the Jade Clarity *qi*,
gazing across the Three Realms’ domains.
The Thearch mounts clouds of threefold purity,
rides a chariot drawn by nine dragons,
ascends the ridges of Ā Hill,
and surveys the karmic fortunes of all beings below.

*Lóng* refers to Dragon Mountain, nine hundred million *li* from Ā-Dāra,
where the ranges intertwine, and sun and moon converge between the two peaks—
hence the radiant Luo jade illumines the clouds, both names of sun and moon.
*Four* signifies the Four Ultimate Palaces,
wherein dwell the Four Ultimate Perfected, keepers of life’s registers.
They ever ride chariots of elephant wheels,
traversing the Three Realms to audit the ledgers of life and death,
liberating those who study the Dao.
Whoever bears this scripture and recites the *Boundless Cavern Verse*
shall have their names itemized by the officials of the Three Realms,
enumerated in the Nine Darks,
erased from the earthly register,
their souls delivered from eternal night,
their jade names inscribed in the Thearch’s annals,
their lives and deaths transcended in the Southern Palace.

*Xū-Yuán* are the Lords of Life-Deliverance in the Palace of Longevity,
who enter the Southern Palace,
refining and delivering decayed souls.
*Yuán* lads are the life-lads born of the sun,
who anoint their essences,
inscribe the covenant of life in the Four Ultimates,
harmonize with the spontaneous feathered regalia,
where seven generations rejoice in the Hall of Blessings,
prolonging life for ten thousand years,
giving rise to generations of immortal kings.
The body transcends the Three Evil Paths,
passes through the Eight Perilous Realms,
the Three Realms bow in attendance,
the Five Thearchs reverently welcome.
These eight heavens pertain to the east’s Primordial Azure *qi*,
each *qi* generating the next, filling the Eight Ultimates—
thus the heavens possess eight sounds,
all formed from the *qi* of the Eight Convergences, coalescing into verse.

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable addressed the Supreme Dao Lord:
When Crimson Clarity first opened, its eight heavens’ *qi*
were apportioned and assigned to the Eastern Azure Heaven.
The heavens possess eight characters, combining into sixty-four sounds,
all the great Brahmanic esoteric speech of the heavens—
the boundless sounds.
Those who practice the Way of the Nine *Qi* Heavenly Lords
should bear these sounds, recite this verse,
and when entering or exiting, traveling or wandering,
strike the teeth nine times,
meditate on the nine-colored dragons leading before and behind,
with nine layers of azure clouds enveloping the body.
The secret incantation reads:

*Crimson Clarity unfolds the chart,*
*eight qi return to the true.*
*Govern the Mysterious Pass,*
*Great Thearch Divine.*
*Flowing transformation through the Nine Heavens,*
*entwining my form.*
*Numen-sounds of the Eight August Ones,*
*sixty-four stanzas.*
*Illuminating heaven and earth,*
*uniting with me as immortal.*
*Summoning the dragon-chariot,*
*ascending the Thearch’s hall.*

Conclude by drawing *qi* nine times and swallowing.
Practicing this for nine years,
each of the eight heavens shall dispatch eight Azure-Waisted Jade Maidens
and eight Azure-Flower Jade Lads to attend the body,
bestowing the essence of nine azure sprouts’ *qi*,
illuminating the body’s radiance to penetrate the Void.
After ten thousand cycles, the Dao is accomplished,
and one gains the power of flight.
This Way is revered, its teachings vast,
universally delivering the boundless.
Seven generations share its blessings,
all ascending to the Southern Palace.
After nine years, one is reborn within the Gate of Goodness,
diligently safeguarding and delivering—
receive this with sincerity and never forget.

The Dao Lord bowed once and received the decree.

**The Crimson Clarity Harmonious Yang Heaven, First Scripture**
Within the Crimson Clarity Harmonious Yang Heaven,
there exists a spontaneous script of eight characters,
whose text reads: *Nán yán dòng fú yù móu shēn shēn*.
The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared:
These eight characters are the spontaneous script of soaring mystery,
each a *zhang* in breadth, their radiant patterns illuminating the eight directions.
The Primordial Beginning descended to teach,
commanding the transcription of these characters,
the deciphering of their sounds,
and their harmonization into the great Brahmanic esoteric speech of the Harmonious Yang Heaven—
the *"Boundless Cavern Verse"*—
to be entrusted to the Dao Lord,
who instructs those in the Harmonious Yang Heaven
with immortal names to deliver the destined.

**The Crimson Azure ascends in the south,**
**Yán’s light flows with eightfold essence.**
**The Cavern Gate exhales cinnabar radiance,**
**its trustworthy splendor naturally sublime.**
**Jade moisture fills the Crimson Palace,**
**pupil-splendor rides the course of destiny.**
**Washing defilements to clarify the Void,**
**expounding and discoursing, pacing the Three Numinous.**

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared:
This chapter blends the five-directional soaring mystery *qi* of the Harmonious Yang Heaven
with the spontaneous sounds of the eight characters,
called the *"Boundless Cavern Verse."*
The Harmonious Yang Heaven lies ninety million *qi* from the Mysterious Clarity Reverent Florescence Heaven.

*Nán yán* denotes the Flowing Fire Courtyard within the Harmonious Yang Heaven,
its scorching light blazing across the eight directions.
*Dòng fú* signifies the Cavern Yang Palace,
where the Southern Ultimate Perfected governs.
All who study the Dao,
upon first attaining the Way,
must visit the Flowing Fire Courtyard to undergo refinement and become perfected,
only then may they enter the Cavern Yang Palace.
*Yù móu* is the essence of the Flowing Fire.
Having undergone fire-refinement, the body generates jade radiance,
filling the Crimson Palace, with all spirits converging,
attending the body, assisting with feathered robes—
ascending to the rank of Upper Perfected,
roaming and feasting in the Purple Tenuity.
If the Dao’s work is incomplete and the time of transcendence arrives,
the soul passes through the Cavern Yang to be refined and cleansed,
dust and grime purged,
quickly reborn to revolve through the Three Realms without hindrance.
Thus, *shēn shēn* paces the Three Numinous.
Without prior lifetimes’ myriad kalpas of accumulated good affinity,
one cannot glimpse its sounds and verses.

**The Mysterious Clarity Reverent Florescence Heaven, Second Scripture**
Within the Mysterious Clarity Reverent Florescence Heaven,
there exists a spontaneous script of eight characters,
whose text reads: *Fàn xíng luò kōng jiǔ líng tuī qián*.
The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared:
These eight characters are the spontaneous script of soaring mystery,
each a *zhang* in breadth, their radiant patterns illuminating the eight directions.
The Primordial Beginning descended to teach,
commanding the transcription of these characters,
the deciphering of their sounds,
and their harmonization into the great Brahmanic esoteric speech of the Reverent Florescence Heaven—
the *"Boundless Cavern Verse"*—
to be entrusted to the Dao Lord,
who instructs those in the Reverent Florescence Heaven
with immortal names to deliver the destined.

**The Supreme Perfected’s Brahmanic Primordial Beginning**
transforms in form to contemplate the wondrous tones.
Falling radiance follows the turning of the kalpa,
in empty space they praise the jade grove.
The Nine Mysteries guide the luminous head,
the numinous youths awaken the withered heart.
Pushing forth the primordial, they pluck the night’s guide,
the former souls soar and chant in the heavens.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared:
This verse harmonizes the five directions’ soaring mystery *qi*
with the eight characters’ spontaneous tones in the Reverent Florescence Heaven—
called the *"Boundless Cavern Verse."*
The Reverent Florescence Heaven lies eight thousand myriad *qi* from the Ancestral Florescence Heaven.

*"Brahmanic Form"* refers to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy.
At the dawn of the Dragon Han kalpa,
ascending the Crimson Clarity’s turning,
he was named *Primordial Beginning*.
When the Highest Sovereign inaugurated the kalpa,
he was called *Primordial Elder*,
transforming and manifesting through the ages—
thus embodied as a single spirit.

*"Falling into Emptiness"* means the Primordial Beginning emerged from the void.
Once Heaven and Earth existed,
with the sun, moon, and three luminaries,
the true script within emptiness was known.

*"Numinous"* refers to the Ninefold Splendor Perfected,
who governs the Southern Upper Palace,
presiding over the nine glooms below to tally the dead souls’ reckoning.

*"Pushing Forth"* means calculating life and death merits.
If one possesses good deeds,
the Three Officials record them,
and the Nine Numinous Ones command the tallying of merits,
plucking the souls of the seven generations from the nine glooms.
The souls’ spirits disperse,
ascending to the Southern Palace,
where joy arises spontaneously,
and they soar, chanting in the heavens.

Within the heavens stands the Scattered Blossoms Terrace,
where the Four Dipper Perfected reside.
Beneath the terrace lies the Three Treasures Grove,
where the Primordial Beginning inscribed the Cavern Verse.
The Four Dipper Perfected inscribed the *Welcoming Extension Talisman* upon the terrace’s eaves.
Those who bear the celestial tones,
who recite the celestial verses,
may receive the *Welcoming Extension Talisman*.
Upon beholding it,
they wander freely upon the Reverent Florescence Terrace.
This talisman causes one’s neck to bear jeweled radiance,
the body to gleam with jade light,
the *qi* to harmonize with the Three Primes,
and the spirit to penetrate the Great Void.
The tones of the Reverent Florescence Heaven
are wondrously ordered by nature.

**Third Scripture of the Radiant Clarity Ancestral Florescence Heaven**
Within the Radiant Clarity Ancestral Florescence Heaven,
there exists a spontaneous script of eight characters,
whose text reads: *Zé luò pú tái lǜ luó dà qiān*.
The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared:
These eight characters are the spontaneous script of soaring mystery,
each a *zhang* in breadth, their radiant patterns illuminating the eight directions.
The Primordial Beginning descended to teach,
commanding the transcription of these characters,
the deciphering of their sounds,
and their harmonization into the great Brahmanic esoteric speech of the Ancestral Florescence Heaven—
the *"Boundless Cavern Verse"*—
to be entrusted to the Dao Lord,
who instructs those in the Ancestral Florescence Heaven
with immortal names to deliver the destined.

Radiant Clarity’s marsh-dragon steps,
Luo’s awakening delights the hidden depths.
The bodhisattvas number in the millions,
upon the terrace shine thirty thousand suns.
Green robes flutter in flight,
the net’s blossoms flourish with jade essence.
The Great Net’s primordial supreme hue,
through a thousand kalpas remains in one rank.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared:
This verse harmonizes the five directions’ soaring mystery *qi*
with the eight characters’ spontaneous tones in the Ancestral Florescence Heaven—
called the *"Boundless Cavern Verse."*
The Ancestral Florescence Heaven lies seven thousand myriad *qi* from the Imperial Reed Heaven.

*"Marsh"* is the name of a mountain in the heavens.
Upon this mountain, myriad dragons arise,
and it bears the Yellow Chamber,
also called the Jade Guest Terrace.

*"Luo’s Awakening"* is the esoteric name of the True Dawn Dao Lord,
who governs within the Yellow Chamber,
abiding through the great kalpa without end,
passing through the Dragon Han to shine anew—
thus delighting the hidden depths.

*"Bodhisattva-Title"* is the hidden name of the Flying Heaven Perfected,
of whom there are countless multitudes,
flying above the Jade Terrace.
The Jade Terrace lies on the southern face of Marsh Mountain,
with thirty thousand suns and moons illuminating its sides.

*"Green Net"* is the esoteric name of the Sun-Moon Heavenly People,
who govern within the Sun-Moon Palace,
ascending the Great Net Heaven’s Brahmanic *qi*,
moving the Six Perfections’ barrier
to accord with Heaven and Earth’s numbers.
When the numbers near their end,
the great kalpas converge,
and once converged,
the heavens’ suns and moons gather at the Jade Terrace.

The divisions of the great thousandfold worlds,
Heaven and Earth transform,
yet the great thousandfold remains as one.
Those who bear the celestial tones,
who recite the celestial verses,
may ride feathered chariots to ascend
the Yellow Chamber’s halls,
the Jade Terrace’s heights.

**Fourth Scripture of the Bamboo Grove Imperial Reed Heaven**
Within the Bamboo Grove Imperial Reed Heaven,
there exists a spontaneous script of eight characters,
whose text reads: *Miǎo mǎng jiǔ chǒu sháo yáo yuán zhān*.
The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared:
These eight characters are the spontaneous script of soaring mystery,
each a *zhang* in breadth, their radiant patterns illuminating the eight directions.
The Primordial Beginning descended to teach,
commanding the transcription of these characters,
the deciphering of their sounds,
and their harmonization into the great Brahmanic esoteric speech of the Imperial Reed Heaven—
the *"Boundless Cavern Verse"*—
to be entrusted to the Dao Lord,
who instructs those in the Imperial Reed Heaven
with immortal names to deliver the destined.

The Bamboo Grove dimly transforms,
the Dragon Han’s beginning vast and boundless.
Nine paths converge in evil’s origin,
the ugly ghosts’ bodies do not arise.
The *shao*’s brightness roams within the primordial,
the *yao*’s songs scatter the Great Void.
The green net orders the Three *Qi*,
*Zhān* meets the Net Heaven’s thoroughfare.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared:
This verse harmonizes the five directions’ soaring mystery *qi*
with the eight characters’ spontaneous tones in the Imperial Reed Heaven—
called the *"Boundless Cavern Verse."*
The Imperial Reed Heaven lies six thousand myriad *qi* from the Hall Radiance Heaven.

*"Dimly"* means the Primordial Beginning sank into the Central Heaven of Extended Peace,
inscribing jade characters veiled and unmanifest.
When the Dragon Han inaugurated the kalpa,
its script was vast and boundless.
In that age, when the true Dao was encountered,
men and women alike lived thirty-six thousand years.
When that kalpa reached its end,
another kalpa passed,
and the nine *qi* each produced beasts to harm the wicked.
After that kalpa’s opening,
the nine beasts were renamed the Nine Ugly Ghosts.

The Northern Emperor’s Supreme Perfected governs the Register of Life and Death,
thus establishing the Nine Ugly to assist the Three Officials.
When the numbers reach their limit of eighty-one myriad,
the celestial *qi* reverses the Nine Ugly,
who then transform into the Nine Capital Envoys.

*"Shao"* is the esoteric name of the Divine Empyrean King in the Imperial Reed Heaven.
The Divine Empyrean King is the lord of demon kings,
constantly testing those who study the Dao—
whether their learning is upright or not.

The Demon King constantly composes deceptive songs to disturb their minds. Those who remain steadfast—the King will then protect and recommend them, and upon receiving the King’s endorsement, they ascend directly to the Imperial Reed Heaven. *Yuanchan* is the esoteric name of the Lords of the Northern and Southern Dippers. When a person accumulates good deeds, their name is recorded in the Southern Dipper, which then delivers them from the trials of the Three Realms, rescues them from the sufferings of the Nine Dark Prisons, and declares to the Demon King that he dare not harm them. If a person commits evil, the Three Officials report their transgressions to the Northern Dipper, which then informs the Demon King, and the Demon King destroys them. Their souls are consigned to the depths of the Nine Dark Prisons, condemned to eternal servitude in the Long Night, with no end through ten thousand kalpas, forever sunk in wicked karma.

Within the Imperial Reed Heaven stands the Mountain of Golden Splendor, upon which lies the Palace of the Five Emperors, perpetually wreathed in clouds of five colors. The sun and moon flank it on either side, while flying immortals attend its resplendent chariots. Those who complete their studies and attain the Dao all journey to the Mountain of Golden Splendor to receive the token of the Great One, thereby controlling the Divine Empyrean King and extinguishing the trials of the Great Demon. Only then may they ascend the chariot of luminous radiance and roam freely through the Eight Directions.

**Fifth: The Resplendent Void Hall’s Heavenly Sound**
Within the Resplendent Void Hall Heaven, there exists a spontaneous script of eight characters, which reads: *Above the clouds, the Nine Capitals’ flying life arises from the soaring one.*

The Heavenly Perfected of the Celestial Worthy states: These eight characters are the *Flying Mystery Spontaneous Script*, each a *zhang* in size, their radiant patterns illuminating the Eight Directions. The Primordial Beginning descended to teach, instructing the transcription of these characters, the deciphering of their sounds, and the composition of the great esoteric Brahmanic sounds of the Resplendent Void Hall Heaven—sounds of boundless resonance—entrusted to the Dao Lord. He was to teach them to those in the Resplendent Void Hall Heaven whose names were already inscribed among the immortals, so as to deliver those destined for the Dao.

The Cloud Emperor of the Resplendent Void Heaven governs the Gate of Profound Mystery.
Nine-fold layers rise in dense array,
Palaces of the Capitals arrayed with jade roots.
Flying incense encircles the Ten Absolutes,
Vital *qi* refines the Five Souls.
The path of immortality opens of itself,
In the soaring groves, the essential words are sung.

The Heavenly Perfected of the Celestial Worthy states: This hymn harmonizes the *Flying Mystery Qi* of the Five Directions within the Resplendent Void Hall Heaven with the spontaneous sounds of the eight characters, forming the *Boundless Cavern Hymn*.

The Resplendent Void Hall Heaven lies five thousand myriad *qi* from the Upright Serenity Heaven. *Above the clouds* is the esoteric name of the flying divine beings. It opens the Dragon Han kalpa, inaugurates the Crimson Brightness kalpa, unfolds the Spontaneous Script, and establishes the root of Heaven and Earth. Once the Three Images were divided, there arose the Nine-Tiered Terrace, situated upon the Jade Capital Mountain, resplendent above the Mysterious Capital. Flying immortals perpetually scatter the hundred harmonies of incense and pour forth the blossoms of the five clouds in libation.

Upon the terrace of the Flying Immortals stands the Jade Lad of the Great Perfected, who thrice daily revolves the Ten Absolutes’ banner. With each revolution of the banner, the myriad heavens ascend in audience, circling the terrace thrice while chanting the *Cavern Hymn*. *Flying life* is the divine spirit of renewed existence in the Southern Upper Realm. If a practitioner can recite the *Cavern Hymn* with a voice that reaches the Upper Palace, the myriad heavens rejoice, and *Flying Life* then opens the path of immortality, bestowing the *qi* of eternal life to refine the spirits of the Five Souls below. Once the soul-spirits receive refinement, the Eight Radiant Ones are preserved. When the Eight Radiant Ones are fully guarded, they collectively uplift the human body to ascend the Nine-Tiered Terrace, roaming within the soaring groves. Clad in the Heavenly Script and chanting the *Cavern Hymn*, after twenty-four years, they are destined to ascend in audience to the Palace of the Mysterious Capital.

**Sixth: The Observant Brightness Upright Serenity Heavenly Sound**
Within the Observant Brightness Upright Serenity Heaven, there exists a spontaneous script of eight characters, which reads: *Nayū yùfù móluó fǎlún.*

The Heavenly Perfected of the Celestial Worthy states: These eight characters are the *Flying Mystery Spontaneous Script*, each a *zhang* in size, their radiant patterns illuminating the Eight Directions. The Primordial Beginning descended to teach, instructing the transcription of these characters, the deciphering of their sounds, and the composition of the great esoteric Brahmanic sounds of the Upright Serenity Heaven—sounds of boundless resonance—entrusted to the Dao Lord. He was to teach them to those in the Upright Serenity Heaven whose names were already inscribed among the immortals, so as to deliver those destined for the Dao.

Upright Serenity’s Brahmanic sound,
*Nayū* extends the Ten Turning Heavens.
In solemn silence, the sacred hymn is chanted,
The fragrant youths sing of kalpic years.
*Moyi* bows in reverence upon hearing,
*Luomi* binds himself in restraint.
The Dharma unfolds the path of extinction and deliverance,
The Wheel turns, all return to the True.

The Heavenly Perfected of the Celestial Worthy states: This hymn harmonizes the *Flying Mystery Qi* of the Five Directions within the Upright Serenity Heaven with the spontaneous sounds of the eight characters, forming the *Boundless Cavern Hymn*.

The Upright Serenity Heaven lies four thousand myriad *qi* from the Reverent Celebration Heaven of Mysterious Brightness. *Na* is the esoteric name of the Heavenly King’s attendant, who generates the *qi* of the Four Seasons and the guidelines of empty non-action, thereby rectifying the divisions of the Upright Serenity Heaven. *Yū* is the empty wheel of the Heavenly Pass. *Yùfù* are the names of the divine youths of the Central Dipper, who perpetually revolve the *Yū* wheel within the Great Non-Being, invoking the Heavenly Pass through the Ten Turnings. With the Ten Turnings, the great sages of the Ten Directions ascend in audience to the Jade Palace, and the myriad spirits, in perfect unity, sing with *Yùfù*. *Móluó* is the esoteric name of the Great Demon within Heaven. When *Yùfù* sings, the Demon King binds himself, and the Eight Methods’ Dharma Wheel Gate of Heaven opens to deliver the bodies of worldly scholars. Those who comprehend the *qi* of the Four Seasons and the mechanism of the Ten Turnings enter the Dharma Wheel Gate, mount the chariot of the Eight Radiant Ones, ascend into the Jade Clarity, and present themselves in audience at the Purple Tenuity Terrace, attaining the rank of guests among the host of perfected beings.

**Seventh: The Mysterious Brightness Reverent Celebration Heavenly Sound**
Within the Mysterious Brightness Reverent Celebration Heaven, there exists a spontaneous script of eight characters, which reads: *Hóng chí wújìng lǎnzī yùnróng.*

The Heavenly Perfected of the Celestial Worthy states: These eight characters are the *Flying Mystery Spontaneous Script*, each a *zhang* in size, their radiant patterns illuminating the Eight Directions. The Primordial Beginning descended to teach, instructing the transcription of these characters, the deciphering of their sounds, and the composition of the great esoteric Brahmanic sounds of the Reverent Celebration Heaven—sounds of boundless resonance—entrusted to the Dao Lord. He was to teach them to those in the Reverent Celebration Heaven whose names were already inscribed among the immortals, so as to deliver those destined for the Dao.

The Mysterious Brightness’ *hóng* and *diāo* abide in the Capital,
*Holding* the vase, they pour into the Eastern Splendor.
The colorless, the profoundly profound lineage,
The mirroring whirlwind, the vast encompassing *Dàluó*.

Grasping Awareness returns to the wondrous of itself,
How could the arising of forms be called excessive?
The revolving resistance does not endure through kalpas,
The encompassing of appearances holds the thread of Great Harmony.

The Perfected Sovereign of the Next Rank said: This *zhang* combines the flying mysterious *qi* of the Five Directions within the Reverent Celebration Heaven with the spontaneous sounds of the eight characters, called the *Boundless Cavern Zhang*. The Reverent Celebration Heaven lies thirty million *qi* from the Ultimate Jade Heaven. *Xuánmíng* marks the boundary of the Reverent Celebration Heaven. *Hóng* is the inner name of the celestial capital’s supervisory deity. *Diāo Capital* is the designation of the Purple Tenuity Palace’s winding chambers, where the supervisor’s altar governs the innermost recesses, collating the registers of all perfected beings and the texts inscribed on yellow slips. *Té* is the name of the dragon stables, where all dragons coil within, perpetually holding golden vases to convey the splendor of the Eastern Well, irrigating the perfected of all heavens. *Huá* is the essence of the moon’s yellow blossom, its numinous infusion flowing into the Eastern Well as an inexhaustible source of fluid. *Wújìng* refers to the flying divine kings who roam above the *Dàluó*, emitting colorless light, overseeing the registers of life and death, and delivering those who study the Dao. *Lǎnzī* is the gate of the Three Realms; knowing the name *Lǎnzī*, the divine kings extract souls from the Nine Glooms, unlock the long night’s repository, and deliver them through the gate of the Three Realms. *Yùnróng* refers to the Jade Maiden of Great Harmony; when one is delivered through the Three Realms, she revolves their appearance, guiding them with vermilion numinous *qi* and irrigating them with the fluid of Great Harmony. Their form abides in the Hall of Blessings and Virtue, preserving kalpas and kalpas without end.

The *Supremely Radiant Ultimate Jade Heaven* Eighth
Within the Supremely Radiant Ultimate Jade Heaven, there are eight characters of spontaneous script, which read: *Fùlǎng Kuòyì Shényīng Zìgōng*. The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: These eight characters are the *Flying Mystery Spontaneous Script*, each a *zhang* in size, their radiant patterns illuminating the Eight Directions. The Primordial Beginning descended to teach, instructing the transcription of these characters, the deciphering of their sounds, and the composition of the great esoteric Brahmanic sounds of the Ultimate Jade Heaven—sounds of boundless resonance—entrusted to the Dao Lord. He was to teach them to those in the Ultimate Jade Heaven whose names were already inscribed among the immortals, so as to deliver those destined for the Dao.

The supremely radiant *Fù* ascends the capital,
The luminous terrace graces the Western Numinous.
*Kuò* serves as the great model,
The resplendent divine lord is born.
The divine is the lineage of extinction and deliverance,
The garlanded cords extract from the long darkness.
Entering anew, they rise through the gate,
Within the palace, joy endures for eternal ages.

The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: This *zhang* combines the flying mysterious *qi* of the Five Directions within the Ultimate Jade Heaven with the spontaneous sounds of the eight characters, called the *Boundless Cavern Zhang*. The Ultimate Jade Heaven lies twenty million *qi* from the *Kǒngshēng* Heaven. *Tàihuàn* marks the primordial origin of the Ultimate Jade Heaven. When the Crimson Clarity first opened, the eight characters blazed above the empty mystery, and thus the Ultimate Jade Heaven was established. *Fùlǎng* is another name for the Jade Capital’s Mysterious Terrace within this heaven, where the Western Numinous Perfected constantly recite the *Boundless Cavern Zhang*, circling above it. *Kuòyì* is the inner name of the divine lord of this heaven, who was born together with the Primordial Beginning as the model of mysterious *qi*, opening the gate of extinction and deliverance to instruct those who study immortality. If one can clarify the sounds of the eight characters, the divine lord will open the door of the long darkness, and the body will enter the gate of renewal, ascending to the terrace of the Jade Capital. Rejoicing in the Purple Tenuity Palace, there is the *Divine Garland Zhang*; the corpse of extinction and deliverance, having obtained the divine garlanded youths, sings the *Boundless Zhang* once and immediately regains form within the Three Refinements’ chamber, receiving the spontaneous *qi* and rejoicing in boundless ages.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy addressed the Most High Dao Lord, saying: When the Crimson Clarity first opened, the *qi* of the Eight Heavens was apportioned and assigned to the Southern Cinnabar Heaven. Each heaven possesses eight characters, combining into sixty-four sounds, all of which are the great esoteric Brahmanic sounds of boundless resonance within the heavens. Those who practice the Way of the Three *Qi* Heavenly Lords should wear these sounds, recite this *zhang*, and when entering or exiting, traveling or wandering, always knock their teeth three times. Visualize the Vermilion Phoenix soaring before them, with crimson clouds in three layers enveloping their form. The secret incantation reads:

The Three *Qi* meander,
The numinous phoenix comes flying.
The eight characters of jade sound
Blaze resplendent in the Purple Tenuity.
Auspicious day, great celebration,
My Dao opens boundlessly.
Vermilion cinnabar, sweet as nectar,
I gaze upward to the numinous radiance.
Body born of water and fire,
Crimson mantle and feathered robe.
Ascending the empty mystery’s steps,
Feet tread the phoenix’s ladder.
Circling the Eight Heavens,
Seven ancestors follow.
Conclude by drawing in *qi* and swallowing three times. Practicing this for three years, the Eight Heavens will each send eight Jade Maidens of Great Cinnabar and eight Jade Lads of Great Yang to attend and guard one’s form, bestowing vermilion cinnabar, the essence of the Three *Qi*, reversing whiteness to preserve appearance, enduring ten thousand kalpas without decline. Seven ancestors ascend together, entering the Hall of Blessings, returning to the womb of the royal family, and immediately attaining rebirth. This method is vast and universal, delivering boundlessly. Diligently apply the mind, receive it earnestly, and never forget. The Dao Lord bowed his head and reverently received the decree.

The *Primordial Qi Kǒngshēng Heaven* First
Within the Primordial Qi *Kǒngshēng* Heaven, there are eight characters of spontaneous script, which read: *Rènlì Chányóu Póní Jiùtōng*. The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: These eight characters are the *Flying Mystery Spontaneous Script*, each a *zhang* in size, their radiant patterns illuminating the Eight Directions. The Primordial Beginning descended to teach, instructing the transcription of these characters, the deciphering of their sounds, and the composition of the great esoteric Brahmanic sounds of the *Kǒngshēng* Heaven—sounds of boundless resonance—entrusted to the Dao Lord. He was to teach them to those in the *Kǒngshēng* Heaven whose names were already inscribed among the immortals, so as to deliver those destined for the Dao.

The primordial *Yuán* delights in joyous realms,
*Lì* floats upon the flaming Yang cavern.
*Chán* offers in the realm of suffering’s arising,
*Yóu* commands transformation in the Southern Palace.
*Pó* possesses refining pools,
*Ní*’s fluid adorns carved appearances.
*Jiù* and *chǒu* obstruct the source of life,
*Tōng* and *bó* wildly drum the vast expanse.

The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: This chapter combines the flying, mysterious *qi* of the five directions within the *Kǒngshēng* Heaven, harmonizing it with the spontaneous sounds of the eight characters, called the *Wúliàng Dòng* Chapter. The *Kǒngshēng* Heaven lies nine million *qi* from the *Huángyá* Heaven.

*Yuán* is the beginning of origins, the *qi* of Brahmanic conduct that forms the *Kǒngshēng* Heaven. *Rènlì* is the name of the boundless world to the south, and *chán* is the land of *Rènlì*. Those born in that realm take suffering as their root, devoid of goodness. Above its domain stands the Cavern of Yang, where floating flames form a flowing fire-court, its radiance resplendent. Once the numinous script is revealed, the land of *Rènlì* transforms into a hall of blessed virtue, and the souls of the suffering are all delivered into the Cavern of Yang.

*Yóu* is the inner name of the Lord of Life in the Southern Palace. *Pó* and *ní* are the divine youths of the refining pools. Those delivered to the Cavern of Yang all proceed to the refining pools to undergo the refinement of the divine youths, reborn into a world of blessed virtue. *Jiù* and *tōng* are demonic spirits of the *Rènlì* world, ever obstructing the path of life’s renewal. When one learns the name of the Lord of Life, proceeds to the divine youths for refinement, the demonic spirits submit. Mastering the sounds of the eight characters, the *Rènlì* realm’s boundless numinous officials guard one’s body. Journeying to the Southern Palace, immortals await to receive them. After three years, they shall surely ride the cinnabar wheels of the clouds, ascending to the Heaven of Three *Qi*.

**Second Chant: The Heaven of Supreme Peace and Imperial Cliff**
Within the Heaven of Supreme Peace and Imperial Cliff, there exists a spontaneous script of eight characters, which reads: *Wǎn Sǒu Dí Sè Tài Miǎo zhī Táng*. The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: These eight characters are the flying, mysterious spontaneous script, each a *zhàng* in breadth, their radiant patterns illuminating the eight directions. The Primordial Beginning descended to teach, instructing the transcription of these characters, the deciphering of their sounds, and the composition of the great esoteric Brahmanic sounds of the *Huángyá* Heaven—sounds of boundless resonance—entrusted to the Dao Lord. He was to teach them to those in the *Huángyá* Heaven whose names were already inscribed among the immortals, so as to deliver those destined for the Dao.

Supreme Peace in the vast desert,
*Sǒu* distant in the Crimson Clarity.
Washing away the dust’s miasma,
The realm of form shines with the azure of the Great Net.

The vast desert guides the true code,
The distant and subtle, the empty cavern’s scripture.
Traversing the sincerity of flying heavens,
Majestic, they transform and rebirth.

The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: This chapter combines the flying, mysterious *qi* of the five directions within the *Huángyá* Heaven, harmonizing it with the spontaneous sounds of the eight characters, called the *Wúliàng Dòng* Chapter. The *Huángyá* Heaven lies eight million *qi* from the Heaven of Ultimate Wind.

*Tài* is the name of emptiness, by which the *Huángyá* Heaven is established in peace. This heaven has its sovereigns, whose oversight is named *Wǎn Sǒu*, opening the path of the vast desert to reveal the script of the eight characters. Once the Dao is made manifest, the Great Net above becomes serene and clear. *Dí Sè* are the flying immortals of the realm of form, ever riding chariots of luminous clouds, drawn by nine-colored dragons. They roam above the Three Realms, entering and exiting the Jade Clarity, sweeping away the *qi* of dust and defilement, delivering those of good roots.

*Tài Miǎo* is the transformation of the empty cavern, weaving spontaneous chapters to clarify the Dao’s principles and exhort salvation for the myriad beings. Those who study and perceive the sounds of the eight characters, penetrating the names of the heavens, shall have flying immortals descend with chariots of luminous clouds to bear them upward to the Terrace of Transformed Birth.

**Third Chant: The Heaven of Manifest Determination and Ultimate Wind**
Within the Heaven of Manifest Determination and Ultimate Wind, there exists a spontaneous script of eight characters, which reads: *Liú Luó Fàn Méng Jǐng Wèi Xiāo Yú*. The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: These eight characters are the flying, mysterious spontaneous script, each a *zhàng* in breadth, their radiant patterns illuminating the eight directions. The Primordial Beginning descended to teach, instructing the transcription of these characters, the deciphering of their sounds, and the composition of the great esoteric Brahmanic sounds of the Heaven of Ultimate Wind—sounds of boundless resonance—entrusted to the Dao Lord. He was to teach them to those in the *Huángyá* Heaven whose names were already inscribed among the immortals, so as to deliver those destined for the Dao.

The ultimate wind flows with primordial radiance,
The net’s brilliance illuminates the nine mysteries.
The Brahmanic net turns the kalpas of heaven,
The profound sprouts firmly root the jade.

The radiant path traverses the long night,
Lush and flourishing, the years fall like blossoms.
*Xiāo* stands in the void,
*Yú* above faces the pure guest.

The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: This chapter combines the flying, mysterious *qi* of the five directions within the Heaven of Ultimate Wind, harmonizing it with the spontaneous sounds of the eight characters, called the *Wúliàng Dòng* Chapter. The Heaven of Ultimate Wind lies seven million *qi* from the Heaven of Filial Vastness.

The Ultimate Wind is the *qi* of the utmost extremity, the net that binds the eight directions to form the heavens. Once the heavens are established, the eight characters become manifest. *Liú* is the inner name of the Heavenly King, dwelling above the Purple Empyrean, roaming the Jade Capital’s mountains. *Luó* is the taboo name of the Moon Maiden. Her flowing radiance pervades the Heaven of Ultimate Wind, illuminating the nine mysteries. *Fàn* are the flying immortals, *méng* the spirit of the Primordial Beginning. The flying immortals turn the gates of the nine heavens, while the great spirit secures the root of the Ultimate Wind.

The Four Supreme Perfected of the Radiant Emperor, *Xiāo Wèi*, are also immortals of the Radiant Empyrean. Together, they govern the Terrace of the Jade Capital, ever riding clouds of three colors. They traverse the long night, reviewing the registers of life and death, delivering the souls of those with good roots. For ten thousand kalpas, they remain ever attendant, recording all.

Those who cultivate the numinous script of the *Dòng* Chapter shall gaze upward to the chambers of the nine mysteries, then ride clouds of three colors to ascend to the grasses of the Radiant Emperor. They shall rescue the souls of the Nine Glooms, and the dead shall be reborn through the Dharma Wheel’s gate.

**Fourth Chant: The Heaven of the August Beginning and Filial Vastness**
Within the Heaven of the August Beginning and Filial Vastness, there exists a spontaneous script of eight characters, which reads: *Yì Miǎo Wú Jì Wǎn Shǒu Shào Dū*. The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: These eight characters are the flying, mysterious spontaneous script, each a *zhàng* in breadth, their radiant patterns illuminating the eight directions. The Primordial Beginning descended to teach, instructing the transcription of these characters, the deciphering of their sounds, and the composition of the great esoteric Brahmanic sounds of the Heaven of Filial Vastness—sounds of boundless resonance—entrusted to the Dao Lord. He was to teach them to those in the Heaven of Filial Vastness whose names were already inscribed among the immortals, so as to deliver those destined for the Dao.

The Primordial August’s *qi* is vast—how boundless its emptiness!
In formless void it abides, in silent courts its jade splendor stands.
Awakened, it meets the Mara Perfected;
its head bears the Three Pure Winds.
The Lesser Lad attends the Vermilion Sun;
the Capital Round illumines the depths of darkness.

The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: This verse harmonizes the flying, mysterious *qi* of the five directions within the Heaven of Filial Vastness, blending it with the spontaneous sounds of the eight characters, called the *Wuliang Dong* Chapter. The Heaven of Filial Vastness lies six million *qi* above the Heaven of Floating Countenance. The great Brahmanic *qi* of the Primordial August Heaven governs and sustains the Heaven of Filial Vastness. Within this heaven resides a Heavenly King, named *Yi Miao*. He has come since the Dragon Han and emerged in the Vermilion Brightness, dwelling amid the primal unfolding—hence called "boundless emptiness." Within the formless void, he abides in the silent, silent courts; his divine radiance and jade beauty mark the standard of the myriad Ways. *Wan Shou* is the title of the Most High Dao Lord. The Dao Lord rides the Eightfold Radiance Jade Chariot, urging the Three Pure Clouds, unfolding the profound mysteries of the Primordial Beginning, and expounding the great Dharma to deliver beings. *Shao Du* is the name of the divine lad within the sun. He ever scatters solar essence to bathe the Perfected, streams flying blossoms to brush the numinous, opens the gates of long night, and illumines the chambers of the Nine Dark Realms. Those who study and hear the sounds of the Heavenly Center will know the names within the Cavern Heavens. The Heavenly King descends in his flying radiance chariot, alighting upon the Three Pure Carriages, delivering beings above the Three Realms and entering the silent, silent courts.

The Fifth Scripture of the Heaven of Grand August Venerable Floating Countenance

Within the Heaven of Grand August Venerable Floating Countenance, there exists a spontaneous script of eight characters, which reads: *Ā Lán Yù Zhú Huá Mò Yán Yóu*. The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: These eight characters are the flying, mysterious spontaneous script, each a *zhàng* in breadth, their radiant patterns illuminating the eight directions. The Primordial Beginning descended to teach, instructing the transcription of these characters, the deciphering of their sounds, and the composition of the great esoteric Brahmanic sounds of the Heaven of Grand August Venerable—sounds of boundless resonance—entrusted to the Dao Lord. He was to teach them to those in the Heaven of Grand August Venerable whose names were already inscribed among the immortals, so as to deliver those destined for the Dao.

The Grand August Azure Cloud Tower,
Lán’s waves chant upon the clouds.
Yù silently obstructs the dark path,
Zhú’s songs echo in the void.

The Florid Realm’s Gate of Multitudinous Desires,
Vast and trackless, none may trace its way.
It extends to host ten thousand myriad crowds,
Where the Courtyard of *Yóu* becomes a forest of ghosts.

The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: This chapter blends the flying, mysterious *qi* of the five directions from the Heaven of Floating Countenance with the spontaneous sounds of the eight characters, called the *Wúliàng Dòng* Chapter. The Heaven of Floating Countenance lies five million *qi* distant from the Heaven of *Jiāngyóu*. The *qi* of the Grand August Middle Prime, the warp of the Vast Brahmanic Silence, forms the Heaven of Grand August Venerable. The heavens possess nine-tiered towers, their cloud-*qi* soaring in majesty. *Ā* is the hidden name of the Heavenly King. He ever rides the Wheel of Radiant Clouds, roaming the nine-tiered *Ā*, dwelling atop the Jade Tower, where he intones the *Dòng* Chapter to summon the Demon Kings. Above lies the abode of perfected immortals; below, the dwelling of ghosts and spirits. *Yùmò* is the hidden name of the Demon King of Heaven’s Center. *Zhú* is the Demon King’s capital overseer. They dwell above the Realm of Desire, chanting the empty and cavernous hymns; *Yán* is the Courtyard that binds ghosts, and *Yóu* the chamber that imprisons them. When the Heavenly King ascends the Cloud Tower and intones the *Wúliàng* Chapter, the heavenly demons respond in echo, and the grass ghosts prostrate themselves in the Courtyard of *Yóu*. The Perfected ever wear the eight characters to soar through the void, reciting the *Wúliàng* to ascend to Jade Clarity. Whoever steals their sounds gains penetrating clarity; whoever gazes upon their verses attains profound numinosity. Those who uphold them see their nine ancestors flourish; those who cultivate them witness their dead bones reborn.

**Sixth: The Sounds of the Heaven of Thought-Free *Jiāngyóu***

Within the Heaven of Thought-Free *Jiāngyóu* lies spontaneous script of eight characters, which read: *Jiǔkāi zìbiàn Ānà pǐnshǒu*. The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: These eight characters are the flying, mysterious spontaneous script, each a *zhàng* in breadth, their radiant patterns illuminating the eight directions. The Primordial Beginning descended to teach, instructing the transcription of these characters, the deciphering of their sounds, and the composition of the great esoteric Brahmanic sounds of the Heaven of *Jiāngyóu*—sounds of boundless resonance—entrusted to the Dao Lord. He was to teach them to those in the Heaven of *Jiāngyóu* whose names were already inscribed among the immortals, so as to deliver those destined for the Dao.

The Nine Mysteries ride the luminous fate,
Opening the palaces of eternal night.
By their own numinous fortune they converge,
Discerning the great transformations’ flow.
*Āqiū* transcends the Dragon Ridge,
*Nàyē* wings the Three Chambers.
They ferry the flying heavenly hosts,
First transforming them into youths.

The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: This chapter blends the flying, mysterious *qi* of the five directions from the Heaven of *Jiāngyóu* with the spontaneous sounds of the eight characters, called the *Wúliàng Dòng* Chapter. The Heaven of *Jiāngyóu* lies four million *qi* distant from the Heaven of *Ruǎnlè*. The *Jiǔkāi* is the great reckoning number; before heaven and earth shone, there were the ninefold barriers, the revolving wheel of the Three *Qi*, and the ninefold illumination. The *qi* of the Heaven of *Jiāngyóu* thus arose, the nine and five arrayed in their positions, opening and fixing yin and yang, their transformative laws flowing forth, whereby the ten thousand kinds receive life. *Āqiū* is the Heavenly King’s inner name. He ever rides the nine-colored dragon, driving the Three Simplicities’ chariot, ascending the Dragon Mountain’s peak to roam amid the Nine Mysteries. *Nàyē* is the hidden name of the flying heavenly spirits, who traverse the Three Realms, passing through the palaces of eternal night, opening the nine dark chambers to deliver the souls of the virtuous. Those who master the sounds of the eight characters and chant the *Wúliàng* Chapter enable their nine ancestors to escape the long night’s prison, their dark souls reborn in the Scarlet Mound’s palace—truly like withered wood blossoming, dead bones restored to youth. Those who cultivate this without ceasing will see their flying heavenly merits equal the gods.

**Seventh: The Sounds of the Heaven of Upper *Shé* *Ruǎnlè***

Within the Heaven of Upper *Shé* *Ruǎnlè* lies spontaneous script of eight characters, which read: *Wúliàng fúgài fúluó héshén*. The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: These eight characters are the flying, mysterious spontaneous script, each a *zhàng* in breadth, their radiant patterns illuminating the eight directions. The Primordial Beginning descended to teach, instructing the transcription of these characters, the deciphering of their sounds, and the composition of the great esoteric Brahmanic sounds of the Heaven of *Ruǎnlè*—sounds of boundless resonance—entrusted to the Dao Lord. He was to teach them to those in the Heaven of *Ruǎnlè* whose names were already inscribed among the immortals, so as to deliver those destined for the Dao.

*Ruǎnlè* begins in non-action,
Measuring the flying heavenly hosts.
*Fúxī* bridges the dark night,
The *Gài*’s blessings flow to the Upper Mystery.
The *Fú*’s clarity rides fate’s return,
The *Luó* realm opens the great thousand.
The *Hé*’s blessings renew the guests,
The Divine Duke fixes their destined years.

The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: This chapter blends the flying, mysterious *qi* of the five directions from the Heaven of *Ruǎnlè* with the spontaneous sounds of the eight characters, called the *Wúliàng Dòng* Chapter. The Heaven of *Ruǎnlè* lies three million *qi* distant from the Heaven of *Tánshì*. Within the Heaven of *Ruǎnlè* dwell the boundless hosts of great sages, *Wúliàng* being the primal spirit of the great assembly. They govern the flying heavenly hosts, all of whom receive their measured ranks and attain promotion. *Fúxī* is the inner name of the Reborn Perfected. He ever reviews the records of the dark night, examining the roots of good and evil. The virtuous receive deliverance; the wicked face their karmic roots. *Gài* is the great title of the Blessing Hall within the Mystery. The souls of the dark night, delivered by the Perfected, are called *Fú*, riding fate’s return to ascend to the Blessing Hall. *Luó* is the Great *Luó*, opening the great thousand worlds to welcome the reborn guests, who ascend to the Heaven of Great *Luó*. The Divine Duke is the prime minister of the Heaven of Great *Luó*, who, for the reborn guests, fixes their life registers in the Scarlet Palace and erases their death roots in the Three Bureaus. Those who study the sounds of the eight characters see their nine ancestors receive blessings from the Perfected, their dark night’s ten thousand kalpas ended, and their rebirth granted by the Divine Duke.

**Eighth: The Sounds of the Heaven of Boundless *Tánshì***

Within the Heaven of Boundless *Tánshì* lies spontaneous script of eight characters, which read: *Yùdàn chángsāng bókōng dùxiān*. The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: These eight characters are the flying, mysterious spontaneous script, each a *zhàng* in breadth, their radiant patterns illuminating the eight directions. The Primordial Beginning descended to teach, instructing the transcription of these characters, the deciphering of their sounds, and the composition of the great esoteric Brahmanic sounds of the Heaven of *Tánshì*—sounds of boundless resonance—entrusted to the Dao Lord. He was to teach them to those in the Heaven of *Tánshì* whose names were already inscribed among the immortals, so as to deliver those destined for the Dao.

Atop the Jade Capital of *Tánshì*, the wondrous birth soars o’er Eastern Florescence.
Long branches adorn the Purple Grotto; mulberry groves weave emerald mists.
Cypress blooms harmonize with divine winds; emptiness births spontaneous song.
They ferry beings through the courts of the Three Realms, where immortal halls nurture cloud-sprouts.

The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: This verse combines the flying, mysterious *qi* of the five directions within the Heaven of *Tánshì*, harmonizing with the spontaneous sounds of the eight characters, called the *Boundless Grotto Verse*. The Heaven of *Tánshì* lies two million *qi* beyond the Heaven of *Xiāodù*.

*Yùdàn* is the name of the capital within the Heaven of *Tánshì*. Above it stands the *Qiān* Forest, whose canopy shades the Palace of Eastern Florescence. The leaves of the *Qiān* Forest bear the *Great Grotto Verse*, inscribed in purple with jade characters, radiant as the Highest Clarity. Below grows the Fusang Tree, its towering boughs entwined with the *Qiān* Forest’s thickets. Azure phoenixes sing beneath its canopy, while verdant mists gild its peaks. Divine winds waft the fragrance of returning grasses, stirring the hundred reeds of the mulberry groves. With a single chant of the divine wind, emptiness gives birth to the *Grotto Verse*.

The *Dùxiān* are the flying divine beings of the Heaven of *Tánshì*. At the first crow of the cock, they ascend to the Jade Terrace, entering the halls of the immortals. There, they gather the essence of the five-directional cloud-sprouts and, gazing upward, swallow the light of the sun, moon, and three dawns. They constantly review the registers of life and death for those who study immortality, liberating the souls of the Nine Glooms and guiding them into the Gate of the Dharma Wheel. Those who master this method can summon divine winds to ride the mist, ascending into the thickets of the *Qiān* Forest. Then, their seven ancestors will emerge from the abode of eternal night, ascending to the Palace of Renewed Life.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy addressed the Most High Dao Lord: When the Crimson Clarity first unfolded the *qi* of the Eight Heavens, it apportioned and bestowed them upon the Western Plain Heaven. That heaven possesses eight characters, comprising sixty-four sounds—all great esoteric Brahmanic sounds of boundless resonance. Those who practice the Way of the Seven *Qi* Heavenly Lords must bear these sounds, recite this verse, and in all their comings and goings, perform seven knocks of the teeth. They should visualize the White Tiger and Lion guiding left and right, with three layers of plain clouds enveloping their form. The secret incantation reads:

*Seven* qi *of golden numen, divine spirits of the Eight Heavens.*
*White Tiger steers the chariot; Lion bears the shaft.*
*Seven* qi *entwine and refine me into immortality.*
*My body emits golden light; my lungs reflect plain clouds.*
*Transformed within and without, I ascend into the Grotto Gate.*
*Seven ancestors escape the night; Nine Glooms release their souls.*
*The Three Paths and Five Sufferings sever their evil roots forever.*
*Together we rejoice in the abode of blessings, receiving the joys of spontaneity.*
*For kalpas unnumbered, we ferry and endure, following destiny’s course.*

After reciting, draw in *qi* and swallow seven times, then cease. After seven years of practice, the Eight Heavens will each send eight Jade Maidens and Jade Lads to attend and guard your form, bestowing the fragrance of the Seven *Qi* of Primordial Plainness. You will abide in the world with youthful countenance for ten thousand kalpas, your blessings extending to your seven ancestors. They will ascend to the Southern Palace, return to the womb for rebirth, and in every life be born into royal houses. This is the wondrous Great Vehicle Dao, universally ferrying heaven and humanity. Be diligent in your practice and never forget my words.

The Dao Lord bowed his head and received the sacred command.

**First Verse of the Heaven of *Xiāodù***

Within the Heaven of *Xiāodù* lies spontaneous script of eight characters, which read: *Juéwú zìyù jiǔrì dǎoqián*. The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: These eight characters are the flying, mysterious spontaneous script, each a *zhàng* in breadth, their radiant patterns illuminating the eight directions. The Primordial Beginning descended to teach, instructing the transcription of these characters, the deciphering of their sounds, and the composition of the great esoteric Brahmanic sounds of the Heaven of *Xiāodù*—sounds of boundless resonance—entrusted to the Dao Lord. He was to teach them to those in the Heaven of *Xiāodù* whose names were already inscribed among the immortals, so as to deliver those destined for the Dao.

The *Xiāodù*’s *Jué* spirit moves; the *Boundless Grotto* attains truth.
Self-resisting, it nears not the kalpa’s end; nurturing life, it preserves long years.
Nine gatherings align with the mysterious mechanism; the Solar Lads unveil the night’s return.
Guiding and sweeping the gates of eternal night, the *Qián* Gate refines the Five Immortals.

The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: This verse combines the flying, mysterious *qi* of the five directions within the Heaven of *Xiāodù*, harmonizing with the spontaneous sounds of the eight characters, called the *Boundless Grotto Verse*. The Heaven of *Xiāodù* lies ninety-nine thousand *qi* beyond the Heaven of *Yuántóng*.

*Xiāodù* is the *qi* of the Primordial Beginning’s first unfolding, within the formless chaos of primordial darkness. *Juéwú* is a flying divine being of the Heaven of *Lónghàn*. At the dawn of the Primordial Beginning’s unfolding, *Juéwú* emerged with the turning of destiny, condensing the essence of spontaneity to establish the Heaven of *Xiāodù*. Thus it is said: *boundless* and yet attaining truth. Once *Xiāodù* was established, it resisted the kalpa’s end. *Yù* is the inner name of the Heavenly King of *Xiāodù*. He constantly rides a chariot of elephant wheels, traversing the Nine Mysteries’ gates, turning the nine mechanisms’ measures to align with the kalpa’s appointed time. When the heavenly revolution ends and the Solar Lads suspend their light, he ferries those who study the Dao, bathing them in the essence of the Water Mother and guiding them with the *qi* of Supreme Harmony. He summons the souls of eternal night, liberating them from the gates of the Nine Glooms. All ascend to the Heavenly Gate, where they refine their five spirits, advance to the Crimson Mound Palace, receive blessings and emoluments in the Heavenly Hall, and abide in carefree non-action, dwelling forever in spontaneity.

**Second Verse of the Heaven of *Yuántóng***

Within the Heaven of *Yuántóng* lies spontaneous script of eight characters, which read: *Kūnmǔ dōngfù xíngshè shàngxuán*. The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: These eight characters are the flying, mysterious spontaneous script, each a *zhàng* in breadth, their radiant patterns illuminating the eight directions. The Primordial Beginning descended to teach, instructing the transcription of these characters, the deciphering of their sounds, and the composition of the great esoteric Brahmanic sounds of the Heaven of *Yuántóng*—sounds of boundless resonance—entrusted to the Dao Lord. He was to teach them to those in the Heaven of *Yuántóng* whose names were already inscribed among the immortals, so as to deliver those destined for the Dao.

The *Yuántóng*’s *Kūn* darkens the gates; the Mother’s Palace turns the earth’s pivots.
Eastern rivers receive the numinous gathering; encircling mountains wind through long sources.
Form dwells within boundless *qi*; the *Shè* bird faces the Emperor Lord.
Above, the *Huángshēng* Register is selected; the *Xuán* Chart records the immortals.

The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: This verse combines the flying, mysterious *qi* of the five directions within the Heaven of *Yuántóng*, harmonizing with the spontaneous sounds of the eight characters, called the *Boundless Grotto Verse*.

The Heaven of *Yuándòng* lies eighty-eight thousand *qi* from the Heaven of *Miàochéng*. The *Yuān*’s passage refers to the *qi* of primordial communication, where *qi* congeals to form the Heaven of *Yuándòng*. The Mother of *Kūn* is the sovereign of the Grand Yin, governess of the Nine Numinous Mothers, ruling in the abyss of *Fúsāng Yánggǔ* in the Eastern Sea. She constantly governs the earth’s mechanisms, turning the Wheel of Primordial *Qi*, which responds above to the Celestial Pivot. When the Celestial Pivot turns, the earth’s mechanisms move, and the heavens revolve once. Waters surge three thousand three hundred times, the Nine Rivers overflow, and the waters fill the sky. The Eastern Sea receives the gathering, controlling the appointed sources of rivers. The spirits of encircling mountains and waters govern here. They dwell upon Mount *Sumeru*, where the mountain anchors the vast sea, blocking the long sources. Thus, the earth’s mechanisms do not sink, and the kalpa is preserved for long endurance. When the gathering is about to converge, the Mother of *Kūn* emerges above the Eastern Sea, summoning the Bird Mother. The Bird Mother is the spirit who observes the waters, ascending to the Emperor Lord to report the kalpa’s convergence and deliver those who study the Dao. The "selected above" refers to the Celestial Controller of Destiny. When waters are about to emerge, the Controller examines the names of Dao students, reporting to the Palace of *Xuándū*. Those who know the sounds of the eight characters—when the great waters arise—are welcomed by the Bird Mother with phoenix chariots, ascending Mount *Sumeru*. In an instant, heaven and earth are entirely purified.

*The Wondrous Script of Miàochéng Heaven*, Third Chant
Within the Heaven of *Miàochéng*, there exists a spontaneous script of eight characters, which reads: *Tuóluó Yù Miǎo Qì Héyún*. The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: These eight characters are the spontaneous script of flying mystery, each a *zhang* in size, their radiant patterns illuminating the eight directions. The Primordial Beginning bestowed teaching, instructing the transcription of these characters and the interpretation of their sounds, combining them into the boundless resonance of the Heaven of *Miàochéng*—the great Brahmanic hidden language—entrusted to the Dao Lord. He was to teach them to those in the Heaven of *Miàochéng* whose names were already inscribed among the immortals, so as to deliver those destined for the Dao.

*Miàochéng Ātuó* Ridge,
*Luó*’s radiance gleams on jade steps.
*Yù* gives birth to ten divisions,
*Miǎo* governs the three realms’ borders.
Vast and distant, they tread upon clouds,
*Qi* weaves into feathered robes.
Joining light in the Northern Numinous Lodge,
above the clouds, they grasp hands and fly.

The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: This verse combines the flying, mysterious *qi* of the five directions within the Heaven of *Miàochéng*, harmonizing with the spontaneous sounds of the eight characters, called the *Boundless Grotto Verse*.

The Heaven of *Miàochéng* lies seventy-seven thousand *qi* from the Heaven of *Jìnshàng*. *Miàochéng* arises from the *qi* of the *Lónghàn* Grotto Mystery, when the Crimson Clarity inaugurates the kalpa. Its *qi* within the empty grotto coalesces with the True Writ of the Five Scriptures, together illuminating the Primordial Beginning, named the Heaven of *Miàochéng*. *Tuó* is the inner name of the Heavenly Emperor, born with *Miàochéng* upon the cloud-wreathed ridge. *Luó* is the inner name of the Moon Consort. *Tuó* dwells upon the cloud ridge, embracing the moon to shine. When *Miàochéng* is established, there appears the celestial spirit named *Yùshēng*, who commands the flying gods of the ten directions. *Miǎo* is the celestial spirit king, overseer of the Feathered Forest. The spirit king constantly governs above the three realms, reviewing the registers of human life and death, presiding over the Demon King’s protection of those who attain the Dao. Those protected by the Demon King ascend to the Feathered Forest Overseer, receive talismans, and rise to heaven. Vast and distant, they tread within the cloud palaces. The Feathered Forest weaves cloud-*qi* into robes; their bodies clad in cloud-woven garments, they enter the Crimson Numinous Palace to receive blessings from the celestial palace. Then, they join the flying immortals above the radiant clouds and soar. Those who study and know the sounds of the celestial script are praised throughout the three realms. Earth spirits pay homage, grotto spirits and ghosts are illuminated, and one sits in spontaneous knowledge. After thirty-two years, they can ride the void, flying through the three realms, roaming the *Shàngqīng*. Their seven ancestors immediately escape the long night, their bodies delivered to the Crimson Palace, carefree and unconstrained, their clothing and sustenance spontaneously provided.

*The Luminous Script of Tàisù Xiùlè*, Fourth Chant
Within the Heaven of *Jìnshàng*, there exists a spontaneous script of eight characters, which reads: *Fēitiān Dàchǒu Zǒngjiān Shàngtiān*. The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: These eight characters are the spontaneous script of flying mystery, each a *zhang* in size, their radiant patterns illuminating the eight directions. The Primordial Beginning bestowed teaching, instructing the transcription of these characters and the interpretation of their sounds, combining them into the boundless resonance of the Heaven of *Jìnshàng*—the great Brahmanic hidden language—entrusted to the Dao Lord. He was to teach them to those in the Heaven of *Jìnshàng* whose names were already inscribed among the immortals, so as to deliver those destined for the Dao.

*Xiùlè* soars through the empty scriptures,
heavenly beings chant the numinous writ.
*Dàwěi*’s wondrous dharma net,
*Chǒu*’s lord hastens the kalpa’s end.
Gathering the *qi* of eight convergences,
overseeing the deliverance of long-night bodies.
Above, receiving sustenance in the Southern Palace,
celestial guests share the blessings of the heavenly abode.

The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: This verse combines the flying, mysterious *qi* of the five directions within the Heaven of *Jìnshàng*, harmonizing with the spontaneous sounds of the eight characters, called the *Boundless Grotto Verse*.

The Heaven of *Jìnshàng* lies sixty-six thousand *qi* from the Heaven of *Chángróng*. *Xiùlè* is the flying, mysterious *qi* of the Heaven of *Jìnshàng*, which coalesces into the empty grotto scriptures to deliver the people of *Jìnshàng*. The Flying Immortals are the divine kings of the ten directions’ flying immortals. They constantly dwell above the flying mystery, chanting the empty grotto scriptures to harmonize with the spontaneous *qi*, delivering those who study the Dao. *Dàwěi* is the registrar of the three realms, governing the charts of life and death. *Chǒu*’s lord is the Demon King of the three realms, constantly serving *Dàwěi*. Those who study and know its sounds enjoy blessings; those who do not suffer calamity. Thus, protected by the Demon King, they ascend to the Three Clarities. *Zǒng* is the overseer of the flying immortals, constantly gathering the *qi* of the eight convergences to hasten the *qi* of heaven and earth’s kalpa. *Jiān* is the overseer of the Heavenly King, governing the Palace of the Long Night, reviewing the registers of Dao students, and delivering the souls of the Nine Glooms. Those who study and know the sounds of the celestial script are reported by the overseer of the Heavenly King, who diligently records their names in the immortal registers, allowing them to become Perfected Ones. Their nine generations of ancestors immediately escape the long night, ascending to the Southern Palace, carefree and joyful, sharing the company of the flying immortals.

**The Fifth Celestial Sound: The Supreme Void’s Ever-Pervading Heavenly Tone**

Within the Supreme Void’s Ever-Pervading Heaven, there exists a spontaneous script of eight characters: *Sha Tuo Jie Liang Long Han Ying Xian*.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared: These eight characters are the *flying mystery* of the spontaneous script, each a *zhang* in breadth, their radiant patterns illuminating the eight directions with resplendent brilliance. The Primordial Beginning descended with instruction, commanding the transcription of these characters, the deciphering of their sounds, and the harmonization into the Ever-Pervading Heaven’s great Brahma esoteric speech—the boundless tone—bestowed upon the Dao Lord. He was to teach those in the Ever-Pervading Heaven whose names were already inscribed among the immortals, so as to deliver those destined for the Way.

*Chang Rong Sha Lan Palace, a host of Tuo Qiu numbering in the billions.*
*The kalpa’s turning alters the Great Net; the measure of flight ascends the Perfected.*
*The Dragon abides in boundless constancy; attaining the Way, renewal remains arduous.*
*Ying Bo guards the numinous fate; the Radiant Youth rejoices in eternal years.*

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared: This verse, composed by harmonizing the *qi* of the five directions’ *flying mystery* within the Ever-Pervading Heaven with the spontaneous sound of the eight characters, is called the *Boundless Cavern Verse*.

The Ever-Pervading Heaven lies fifty-five thousand *qi* above the Ascendant Victory Heaven. It is the supreme *qi* of the Cavern Ultimate, coalescing to form this heaven. Within it stands the *Sha Lan Palace*, a detached abode of the Purple Tenuity, situated above the Jade Clarity and resplendent amid the Purple Void. Therein dwells the multitude of *Tuo Qiu*, ministers numbering in the millions. The *Tuo Qiu* are those newly delivered, recipients of the numinous. As their merit and virtue remain incomplete, they are dispersed throughout its precincts. When the kalpa’s turning arrives, the *Tuo Qiu* host is assessed by the weight of their merit, ascending to the Vermilion Numinosity Palace to receive blessings and transcendence.

The *Dragon* refers to the era of *Long Han*, when the Way was pure and unadorned, its transformations present yet difficult to renew. *Ying Bo* were the flying immortals and divine beings of the *Long Han* era, constantly delivering the souls of the Nine Glooms within the *Lan Palace*. The *Radiant* are the youths of the Southern Palace; when disciples attain deliverance, the Radiant Youths refine their forms, elevating them above the Vermilion Numinosity to receive blessings in the Hall of Joy.

**The Sixth Celestial Sound: The Great Release’s Jade Ascendant Victory Heavenly Tone**

Within the Great Release’s Jade Ascendant Victory Heaven, there exists a spontaneous script of eight characters: *Bi Luo Fu Li Kong Ge Bao Zhen*.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared: These eight characters are the *flying mystery* of the spontaneous script, each a *zhang* in breadth, their radiant patterns illuminating the eight directions with resplendent brilliance. The Primordial Beginning descended with instruction, commanding the transcription of these characters, the deciphering of their sounds, and the harmonization into the Ascendant Victory Heaven’s great Brahma esoteric speech—the boundless tone—bestowed upon the Dao Lord. He was to teach those in the Ascendant Victory Heaven whose names were already inscribed among the immortals, so as to deliver those destined for the Way.

*The Ascendant Victory’s azure layers of cloud, the Net’s radiance gleams upon the supreme mystery.*
*Floating voids reverence the Seven Treasures; the Black Shine measures the jade script’s grace.*
*Empty whistles chant the numinous wind; the hymn’s verses delight the celestial guests.*
*Preserve this beyond the kalpa’s end; treasure this spontaneous composition.*

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared: This verse, composed by harmonizing the *qi* of the five directions’ *flying mystery* within the Ascendant Victory Heaven with the spontaneous sound of the eight characters, is called the *Boundless Cavern Verse*.

The Ascendant Victory Heaven lies forty-four thousand *qi* above the Brahma Measure Heaven. It is the *qi* of the Crimson Clarity’s nine refinements, coalescing to form the Ascendant Victory Heaven. Within it, azure rosy clouds perpetually arise, shading the Ascendant Victory’s expanse. The *Falling* are the flying deities within the clouds, ever riding the azure rosy ranks to roam the Ascendant Victory Heaven. Thrice daily, they lead the celestial host of sages to ascend and pay homage at the Seven Treasures Palace. *Fu Li* is the inner name of the Heavenly King. When the sages ascend in audience, the Heavenly King rejoices. The *Void* are the attendants of the celestial throne; their whistles summon the numinous wind, and as the wind stirs, the sound forms the Cavern Verse. Those who master the eight characters comprehend the celestial tone, and their seven generations of ancestors depart the Nine Glooms’ abode, ascending to the Southern Palace as guests of the flying immortals. Preserving this beyond the kalpa’s end, they treasure the merit of spontaneity, entering the Hall of Non-Action to safeguard the scripture of the Utmost Perfected.

**The Seventh Celestial Sound: The Dragon Transformation’s Brahma Measure Heavenly Tone**

Within the Dragon Transformation’s Brahma Measure Heaven, there exists a spontaneous script of eight characters: *E Yi Wu Pin Dong Miao Zi Zhen*.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared: These eight characters are the *flying mystery* of the spontaneous script, each a *zhang* in breadth, their radiant patterns illuminating the eight directions with resplendent brilliance. The Primordial Beginning descended with instruction, commanding the transcription of these characters, the deciphering of their sounds, and the harmonization into the Brahma Measure Heaven’s great Brahma esoteric speech—the boundless tone—bestowed upon the Dao Lord. He was to teach those in the Brahma Heaven whose names were already inscribed among the immortals, so as to deliver those destined for the Way.

*The Brahma Measure’s baleful karmic bounds, resplendent ascent through the numinous gate.*
*From nothingness, the long night is plucked; the ranks measure the Nine Glooms’ souls.*
*The Cavern illumines the roots of past karma; wondrous awakening has a beginning.*
*Entering the Hall of Joy, they join the Perfected in harmonious assembly.*

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared: This verse, composed by harmonizing the *qi* of the five directions’ *flying mystery* within the Brahma Measure Heaven with the spontaneous sound of the eight characters, is called the *Boundless Cavern Verse*.

The Brahma Measure Heaven lies thirty-three thousand *qi* above the Jia Yi Heaven. After one kalpa following the *Long Han* era, it received the title of *Dragon Transformation*, coalescing the great Brahma *qi* to form this heaven. *E Yi* is the inner name of the Heavenly King, dwelling within the *Long Han* era. When all karmic conditions are exhausted, he transcends the three realms’ courts, ascending into the Supreme Void’s halls to receive the nine immortals’ refinements and advance to the title of Great Sage. At the dawn of the Crimson Clarity’s kalpa, the Primordial Beginning bestowed upon him the kingship of the Brahma Measure Heaven, hence his resplendent ascent through the numinous gate.

*Nothingness* refers to the Supreme Origin Perfected, who receives the Heavenly King’s talisman to deliver the souls of the long night, measuring the records of merit and virtue, severing the roots of past karma. Once delivered, the souls depart the Nine Glooms’ opposition, attaining the wondrous transformation’s hall. Recognizing their past karma and its origins, their thoughts and conditions exhausted, they dwell carefree in the Hall of Joy, harmonizing with the flying immortals in Perfected assembly.

**The Eighth Heavenly Tone of the Supreme Polarity’s Harmonious Florescence**

Within the Supreme Polarity’s Harmonious Florescence Heaven, there exists a spontaneous script of eight characters, which reads: *Primordial Brahma, Vast and Boundless, Profound and Serene, Deliverer of Humankind.*

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared: These eight characters are the *Flying Mystery’s* spontaneous script, each a full *zhang* in breadth, their radiant patterns resplendent, illuminating the eight directions. The Primordial Beginning descended to instruct, commanding the transcription of these characters and the elucidation of their sounds, blending them into the Great Brahma’s esoteric, boundless tones of the Harmonious Florescence Heaven, bestowing them upon the Dao Lord to teach those within the Harmonious Florescence Heaven whose names are already inscribed among the immortals, delivering those destined for the Dao.

*The Supreme Polarity’s Primordial Qi,*
*Brahma’s conduct in Great Loftiness’ azure.*
*Vast and expansive, the cavernous heights,*
*Boundless and formless, void of semblance.*
*Within the profound, wondrous Perfected dwell,*
*In stillness, essence spontaneously arises.*
*Deliver me through the Six Brahma Practices,*
*That humankind may transform within the Three Realms’ courts.*

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declared: This verse harmonizes the Five Directions’ *Flying Mystery Qi* within the Harmonious Florescence Heaven with the eight characters’ spontaneous tones, called the *Boundless Cavern Verse.*

The Harmonious Florescence Heaven lies twenty-two thousand *qi* from the Brahma Conduct Heaven. The Supreme Polarity is the boundless extremity ascending above Great Loftiness, named the Harmonious Florescence Heaven. *Primordial Brahma* refers to the Primordial Beginning’s wind and mist *qi*, uplifting and clarifying the Han River’s essence, high and pervading the void, suspended yet never falling. *Vast and boundless* describes that which is distant yet unimpeded, existent yet as if nonexistent, subtle beyond naming, wondrous beyond seeking. Profound and serene, within it lies the Perfected; within the Perfected, essence is born, delivering the practitioner’s body through the Six Brahma Practices. When one embodies the Six Brahma, their form transforms, roaming carefree above the Three Realms, wandering through Great Loftiness’ azure. Their names enter the Harmonious Florescence Heaven’s register, and their nine ancestors together ascend to Great Loftiness’ palace, receiving blessings within the Seven Treasures Grove.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy addressed the Most High Dao Lord: When the great kalpa commences and the Crimson Clarity first dawns, the *qi* of the Eight Heavens is apportioned and bestowed, all belonging to the Northern Mystery Heaven. The eight characters combine into sixty-four tones, all constituting the Heavenly Great Brahma’s esoteric, boundless sounds. Practicing the Way of the Five *Qi* Heavenly Lords, one should bear these tones, recite this verse, and in all ingress and egress, constantly perform the Fivefold Tooth-Knocking, envisioning the luxuriant *Flying Tortoise Feather Canopy* swirling to the left and right, with threefold layers of mysterious clouds enveloping the body. Divine lads and jade maidens, clad in feathered robes and flying garments, attend before and behind. The secret incantation reads:

*Mystery Heaven’s meandering,*
*Flowing radiance ascends to the Upper Clarity.*
*Great Existence inaugurates the kalpa,*
*The eight characters soar in luminous clarity.*
*Flying Mystery settles the void,*
*Cavernous tones arise spontaneously.*
*Five Qi entwine,*
*Irrigating my form.*
*Crowned and girded in the Northern Singularity,*
*Receiving refinement in the Cavernous Numinous.*
*The Kidney Palace transforms into immortality,*
*Inner water gleams with essence.*
*Soaring through the Three Realms,*
*Roaming and feasting in the Purple Court.*
*Seven ancestors rejoice together,*
*Delighting in kalpic ages.*
*Within the Seven Treasures Grove,*
*Returning to the womb to renew the form.*
*Long night’s death extinguished,*
*Names recorded in the Southern Palace.*
*Yellow Registers and White Tallies,*
*Generation upon generation born as immortals.*

Upon completion, draw in the *qi* and swallow five times. Practicing this for five years, the Eight Heavens each dispatch five *Great Mystery Jade Lads* and *Jade Maidens* to attend the body, descending to bestow the essence of the *Mysterious Nourishment’s Five Qi*, halting aging and preserving the kalpa, safeguarding life within the Three Clarities. Seven ancestors rejoice together, generation upon generation born as immortals. This method is lofty and wondrous; treasure it deeply and do not treat it lightly.

The Dao Lord bowed his head and reverently received the decree.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign bowed and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: Since receiving the sun and moon, I have followed the kalpa’s flow, coming and going in the turning wheel. One radiance, one darkness; one extinction, one renewal; one death, one birth. The body endures destruction, one ruin and one completion. Traversing heaven and earth, light and brightness alternate. Profound and distant, beyond all conception.

Since the Dragon Han kalpa, ninety-nine million nine hundred and ninety thousand great kalpas have passed. Karmic ties entangle, generation after generation unbroken, even unto this day. I have been born into royal gates, and also into humble homes; into wealthy chambers, and also into destitute cold; into human nobility, and also as a servant; afflicted by the six illnesses, and also blessed with radiance; granted wisdom, and also stricken with foolish deafness. Having experienced all manner of existences, my body has yet to find peace. Evil karmic ties arise, leading to unrighteous conduct beyond human bounds: disrespecting heaven and earth, unafraid of ghosts and spirits, lacking compassion and filial piety, harming living beings. In death, I followed the Sword Tree, feet treading the Knife Mountain, entering the Frigid Night or the Cauldron’s Scalding Waters, dragged through the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, body and soul tormented, enduring every agony. After ten thousand kalpas of karmic suffering, I was reborn among the six livestock, my lifespan brief, only to face death and destruction again, then compelled to serve as a long-term laborer in the Five Peaks, toiling under the Eastern Peak, enduring every hardship. After a thousand kalpas of suffering, I was reborn among the frontier barbarians. Though possessing human form, I lacked human sentiment, my lifespan brief, my body perishing once more. My soul departed to the Four Rivers, tossed upon the dark waves, mired in filth and freezing ice, day and night without respite. After a hundred kalpas of karmic retribution, I was reborn among the lowly, afflicted by the six illnesses, hideously deformed, utterly detestable. My lifespan brief, I faced death again, my soul entering the Long Night’s Nine Glooms, conscripted to labor in the Three Rivers, damming the long sources, frostbite piercing the flesh, enduring every suffering. Only when all karmic ties were exhausted was I reborn among humankind, my form comely, my humanity complete. Yet my lifespan remained brief, and I faced death again, my soul returning to the Three Offices, driven to toil through a hundred hardships, wandering the ghostly courts. After ten thousand years, my sins were finally expiated, and I was reborn into a good family, lacking nothing in wealth and treasure, enjoying ease and comfort. Yet my lifespan remained brief, and I faced death again, my soul returning to the Three Offices as a benevolent ghost, appointed as a capital overseer, governing life and death. After a thousand years, my roots were severed, and I was reborn with penetrating spiritual vision, able to perceive ghosts and spirits, commanding and summoning them to aid the nation and save the people.

At times I aided emperors and kings in pacifying the four quarters, yet my lifespan remained brief, and I faced death again. My soul then became a companion and friend to the Five Emperors, consorting with divine immortals. After a hundred years, my karmic roots were dissolved together, my earthly banishment completed, and I was appointed as a general overseer of the Three Offices, my name recorded in the heavens. Thus I was reborn into the gates of wealth and nobility, into a household of kings and marquises. My glory and emoluments were boundless; when my roots were exhausted, blessings arose. I vowed great vows, dispersed alms to the destitute, and broadly performed meritorious deeds, thereby attaining extinction and ascending directly to heaven, where I roamed freely in joy, my clothing and food naturally provided. After twenty-four years, I was reborn into a noble household, receiving qi and wisdom, my five centers opened to understanding. I cultivated and upheld the scriptures and methods, disdaining wealth and honoring the Dao, my heart compassionate toward all. Reverent toward my teachers and treasures, my merits were not yet complete, and I again attained extinction, ascending to the Southern Palace. The Vermilion Numinance expunged my name from the registers of fate, and the Three Realms inscribed my merits and name. I wandered through the thirty-two heavens of the ten directions, consorting with the highest sages as a guest of the Most High. After ten years, I returned among humankind, my body becoming a master and patriarch, proclaiming and transmitting the Dharma’s sounds, opening the path to salvation for gods and humans, teaching and transforming all living beings. Through countless kalpas, I experienced all things—death, the servitude of the Three Offices, and the reckoning of my allotted years. Yet when my term neared its end, I once more harbored evil intentions, my sins exceeding the norm. I faced death again, returning to the Three Offices to confront my servitude and banishment, my suffering surpassing that of before. Thus, in a single kalpa, good and evil alternated, ease and urgency shifted, death and life succeeded one another, vexation and joy intermingled, and hardships and setbacks endured without end.

When all evil defilements were exhausted and blessings and virtue arose of themselves, I was once more reborn into the gates of wealth and nobility. Through the Dao’s karmic conditions, I made offerings to the scriptures and methods, invoking the Seven Treasures to reveal their numinosity. I vowed good intentions, and my merits and name were perfected, commended by the Three Realms and illuminated by the Five Emperors. Cloud chariots descended, and the eight-jewelled jade wheels carried me through the void, ascending at dawn beneath the white sun. I was enveloped in the Heavenly Worthy’s grace, my profound kindness repaid, my decayed form adorned. I beheld the light, transcended the Three Realms, and ascended to the rank of Heavenly Perfected. Today, seated in attendance, my joy is beyond words.

The Heavenly Worthy, not disdaining my former narrowness and incompetence in all matters, commanded me to take up my brush and expound the celestial sounds. Under the weight of this solemn teaching, I dared not conceal the truth, and so I have fully expressed all that I have witnessed, laying bare my heart. Though I have not elaborated in detail, I have traversed countless kalpas since former lives, roaming the celestial origins, following the Dharma through life and death. I have always encountered the true scriptures, yet I have not trodden the path of their mysterious transformation or penetrated their fundamental roots. Moved by my private limitations, I have earnestly presented this natural scripture to elucidate the text of profound kindness, to resonate with the sound of jade chimes, and to echo the tones of jasper and jade. Though its meaning is not entirely complete, it is sufficient to expound the roots of heaven and earth.

As for the vastness and constriction of the heavens, the transformations of their qi and phenomena, the sun, moon, and stars, the palaces, mountains, and forests, the cities and terraces of the Perfected, and the origins of the demon kings and spirits—these matters are profoundly abstruse and cannot be fully detailed. Moreover, the causes and conditions of questioning and difficulty have already been recorded in ancient texts, and I shall not reiterate them one by one to avoid prolixity and burden.

Now I have roughly explained the meaning of the celestial scripture’s Fivefold Union. This Dao is sufficient to open the path to salvation for gods and humans, to eradicate the roots of all suffering. The great Dharma unfolds, its blessings extending to the ten directions. In this life and the next, men and women of goodwill shall receive this grace.

According to the *Primordial Yang Jade Treasury*, as the Nine Heavens reckon the movements of fate, the numinous passes revolve in cycles. When the thirty-two heavens complete one revolution, false ways emerge, and the hearts of the myriad people are filled with deceit, all revering and upholding them together. This scripture shall return to the Great Canopy above, to the Seven Treasures Palace. When three or five cycles are complete and the power of the myriad ways is exhausted, the Great Sage shall arise in glory, descending to the world to save humanity. The false seats shall be abolished, the rebellious people subdued, the Dao and virtue shall flourish, and the world shall know great peace. The lord of the nation shall enjoy long reigns, and the ten directions shall be at rest. The true scriptures shall aid the world, and auspicious signs shall arise daily.

At the beginning of the *renzi* year, in the *yimao* year, during the *jiazi* decade, the Nine Varieties of Immortals of the Azure Emperor shall ride nine-colored dragons, emerging to roam Mount Tai, bearing this true scripture to sweep away inauspicious omens. When the true scripture descends to the world, the sounds of horns and dragons shall resound. Those who encounter this Dao shall strengthen their destiny, preserving the *jiashen* year, universally saving gods and humans. At that time, joy shall abound—such is the merit of this scripture. Those who uphold it shall enjoy blessings; those who cultivate it shall become immortals.

This text is profoundly mysterious, its vast embrace boundless. The great Dharma is revered and weighty. I humbly pray that the Heavenly Worthy shall universally proclaim it to the Emperors of the Heavens, the Great Sage Honored Spirits, the sun, moon, and stars, the deities above and below the earth, the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, the Water Emperors of rivers and seas, the Perfected Immortals, the divine officials of the ten directions, and all worlds. May they, in accordance with the statutes of the Great Existence and the regulations of reverence and deference, forbid negligence and carelessness, and secretly uphold it.

At that moment, the Heavenly Worthy raised his hand and snapped his fingers. In the heavens above and below, on the earth above and below, and in the boundless worlds, all divine spirits secretly upheld it. The hosts of the Great Sages of the Heavens simultaneously bowed their heads and knelt, praising its goodness.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the assembly of Great Sages and the boundless Most High Lords of the Great Dao of the thirty-two heavens and the ten directions. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign said: Before the Dragon Han kalpa, during the Yan Kang era, I followed the movements of fate through life and death. When the Dragon Han arrived, I received karmic reckoning, my soul and form enduring hardships, suffering in the Three Offices. When my karma was exhausted and my roots severed, I entered the gates of blessings. I traversed heaven and earth, experiencing success and failure without limit, witnessing the celestial origins and always encountering the Numinous Treasure. In every generation, the Dharma emerged to transform and save gods and humans.

Thus, I thoroughly investigated the affairs of heaven and was able to explain the celestial scripture’s natural text. The great Dharma is now revealed, revered by all heavens. It is fitting to proclaim this ultimate principle, its sounds resounding clearly.

Thus, I commanded the brush to be taken up, to elucidate its intricate details, harmonizing the boundless sounds of the Five Directions to complete the formation of all heavens, universally delivering future lives. Within it lies profound mystery, truly worthy of reverence. Once the numinous sounds resound clearly, all heavens shine with radiance—above the heavens and below, upon the earth and beneath, throughout the ten directions and the infinite worlds—every divine spirit without exception venerates and upholds it.

Following the ancient statutes of the *Mingzhen Xuanke*, twenty-four Jade Lads and twenty-four Jade Maidens are appointed to burn incense and attend the Perfected, inspecting negligence and correcting transgressions. It must not be lightly transmitted. Once every forty thousand kalpas, it descends to the world to deliver humanity. Be vigilant in its stewardship, ensuring no careless words are spoken.

At that moment, the four assemblies bowed as one, prostrating and praising its excellence. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign then declared: The celestial scripture is revered, delivering countless beings. Those who honor it gain blessings; those who slight it invite calamity. All the past Perfected, the boundless great sages of the heavens, the utmost true and venerable spirits, the flying celestial immortals, the divine immortals of the Five Peaks, and the transcendents of the sacred mountains—none fail to receive and revere the celestial scripture’s natural sounds, thereby attaining utmost perfection.

Unless one’s name is already inscribed in the Golden Register or the Jade Characters of the Upper Clarity, one shall never behold it. Should one, mired in carelessness and negligence, glimpse even its title, the spirit will be confounded, and enlightenment will remain forever closed. Only those with predestined affinity shall naturally awaken the heart, yearning for the divine scripture. Born in an age when it appears, encountering its text, one must present the pledge of seven-jeweled patterned silk, seek out a master, and swear an oath, reporting to the heavens above before receiving and wearing it upon the body.

Those who wear this scripture are revered by all heavens, praised by the Three Realms, attended by the Five Emperors, welcomed by earthly deities, and approached in homage by all divine spirits. It shall rescue the nine generations of ancestors from eternal night, deliver the dead souls from the nine shades, return them to the womb of numinous qi, and grant rebirth through the gates of wealth and nobility. Forever shall they wander among the heavens, lifted as guests of the Most High.

The Five Elder Thearchs proclaimed to all heavens, to the sacred mountains of the Five Peaks upon the earth, the Three Rivers and Four Seas, the divine immortals, Perfected, Jade Maidens, and all divine spirits: The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign has unveiled the wondrous transformation of *Dàyǒu*, conveying the numinous scripture of nature. The celestial scripture is sacred and must not be lightly transmitted. Men and women of this generation who harbor no duplicity in their hearts and revere the natural shall receive it and ascend. Those who uphold it shall attain long life. Those who value the Dharma over wealth shall not speak of demonic obstacles.

Men and women of future generations, their hearts corrupted, each harboring deceit and cunning, prizing wealth and scorning the Dao, disbelieving in the utmost truth—even if they turn toward it, their devotion shall be superficial, their will divided, covetous and scheming, inviting demonic slander. Thus, the *Xuanke* decrees prohibitions, requiring seven-jeweled patterned silk to test the sincerity of the heart. For those true scholars who follow the statutes and present the precious pledge, their names shall be announced to the heavens, proclaimed to the Five Peaks, and recorded by the earthly immortals. They shall be reported to the demon kings, vouched for before the Three Clarities, and only then may transmission proceed. Those who violate the *Xuanke* shall bear the wind-blade upon their bodies, forever barred from return through ten thousand kalpas, their nine generations consigned to eternal night, eternally enslaved at the River Source. Let all divine spirits clearly heed these words.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign addressed the Five Elder Thearchs: In the midst of the Dragon Han kalpa, I received this scripture from the Eternally Abiding Lord of No-Name. According to the rites of reverence, I inscribed with cinnabar brush the eight celestial sounds, totaling two hundred fifty-six characters, upon yellow silk to be worn upon the body. Following the *Mingzhen Xuanke*, it is consecrated with the seven treasures—gold, silver, coral, lapis lazuli, giant clam, crystal, and agate. Forty feet of five-colored patterned silk are offered as the pledge of the divine statutes, never to be diminished.

For those of sincere heart who are destitute and unable to prepare the full offering, the essence of devotion must be preserved. The measure of their capacity shall determine what is fitting to bestow. In the first year of the *Shanghuang* era, on the *bingwu* day of the seventh month, the Queen Mother of the West taught this in the grotto chamber of Southern Florescence, transmitting it to the Perfected of Pure Emptiness, Lord Wang, who passed it to Yu. It was sealed within the stone crags of the Southern Florescence grotto chamber. When the great kalpa turns and fate shifts, it shall emerge into the world to deliver those who attain the Dao.

*The Fourth Scroll of the Jade Characters of the Numinous Treasure’s Inner Sounds of All Heavens, Spontaneously Arisen*
