**Upper Section: Commentary by Zou Xin, the Daoist of Kongtong (崆峒道士邹欣注)**

**Upper Section:**
To observe the Dao of Heaven, to grasp Heaven’s actions—this is complete.
The Dao divides into Heaven and Earth; Heaven and Earth divide into the myriad things.
Among the myriad things, humans are the most spiritually refined (灵),
their essence originally one with that of Heaven and Earth.

Yet what humans receive from Heaven and Earth differs in purity and mixture,
so one must observe the Dao of Heaven and grasp its actions—
then the Dao resides within me.

When it speaks of Heaven without mentioning Earth,
Earth is already contained therein.

Heaven has Five Thieves (五贼), and those who perceive them thrive.
The Five Thieves dwell in the heart, manifesting in Heaven’s operations.
The cosmos lies within the hand; all transformations arise from the body.
The Five Thieves—these are the Five Phases (五行).

The virtues of the world emerge from these five,
while evils also arise from them—
hence, when discussing their reversals, they are called Five Thieves.

Though the Five Thieves belong to Heaven and Earth,
they are also the very elements that give rise to Heaven and Earth.
Descending into humans, they become this heart.
If one recognizes their origins,
then one may apply them to Heaven and Earth,
and creation will be within my grasp.
Thus it is said: *Those who perceive them thrive.*

Zhuzi (Master Zhu) says:
The *Yin Fu Jing* speaks of those five things
interacting in generation and restraint (相生相克),
calling them Five Thieves in the heart, manifesting in Heaven’s operations.
If one does not use a proper heart to observe them,
they all become thieves.

The Five Thieves refer to the Five Natures’ virtue (五性之德),
manifesting in Heaven’s operations as the Five Phases’ *qi* (五行之气).
Heaven’s nature—this is humanity (人).
Human hearts—these are mechanisms (机).
To establish the Dao of Heaven is to regulate humanity.

What Heaven and Earth possess as nature (性)
is tranquil and boundless, unseen and unattainable.
Yet the human heart inherits Heaven’s nature,
so it is said: *Heaven’s nature, this is humanity.*

The human heart, acting spontaneously,
unaware of its own origins—this is the mechanism (机),
the means by which Heaven moves and Earth remains still.

This mechanism in humans—what cannot it achieve?
To become Yao and Shun, or Jie and Zhou—
the same mechanism applies.
Only by establishing the Dao of Heaven
can one regulate it, achieving wisdom (智).
Thus, when one departs from it, reason is restored.

When Heaven unleashes destructive intent (杀机),
the stars shift their courses.
When Earth unleashes destructive intent,
dragons and serpents rise upon the land.
When humans unleash destructive intent,
Heaven and Earth are overturned.
When Heaven and humanity jointly unleash destructive intent,
all transformations find their foundation.

Destructive intent (杀机)—this is the mechanism’s excess.
When Heaven and Earth’s *qi* (气) oversteps,
strange phenomena appear, and dragons and serpents rise upon the land.
When the human heart oversteps,
delusions arise, and Heaven is overturned while Earth is covered.
When Heaven and humanity jointly unleash destructive intent,
the Dao is present—Heaven’s will and human emotions align.

Yet Heaven’s order has its principles,
Heaven’s hierarchy has its rites—
these are humanity’s greatest relationships (伦).
The fourfold schools (四方之学) use this as their worldly net,
cutting it off, yet unable to shake it—
for its foundation of myriad changes is fixed and unalterable.

**Note:** According to the Tang official Chu Suiliang (褚遂良),
he obtained a copy of the *Yin Fu Jing*
commented by the *Taiji True Person* (太极真人)
from the household of Longsun Zhao Guogong (长孙赵国公).
He believed the text was not the work of a single individual,
as his annotations reveal:
The first two sentences are attributed to *Saintly Mother Qibo* (圣母岐伯).
The next four sentences to *Heavenly True Person* (天真皇人).
And so forth below.

「Among the various versions, the differences include:

- *"Heaven unleashes destructive intent, shifting stars and altering constellations"* (天发杀机，移星易宿),
- *"Earth unleashes destructive intent, dragons and serpents emerge from the land"* (地发杀机，龙蛇起陆),
- *"Humanity unleashes destructive intent, Heaven and Earth invert and overturn"* (人发杀机，天地反覆).

Other versions omit *"shifting stars and altering constellations"* (移星易宿) and the eight characters of *"Earth unleashes destructive intent"* (地发杀机八字), yet the *Chu Suiliang* version should be considered authoritative.

*Siu Qi Liu* (须溪刘氏) states:
*"When Heaven and humanity’s destructive intent align,
it is the chaotic movement of the primordial age—
alignment brings certainty.
Nature has its cleverness and clumsiness,
which can be suppressed or concealed.
The nine orifices’ (九窍) malevolent forces
lie within the three critical points (三要),
and they can be activated or stilled (动静).
The Sage’s nature aligns with Heaven and Earth,
yet common folk cannot—
due to their differing cleverness and clumsiness.
Only by knowing how to suppress and conceal (伏藏),
can the clumsy become clever (巧).
Humanity knows how to suppress and conceal
because of the nine orifices’ malevolent forces (九案之邪).
Though the orifices number nine,
the three critical points are:
ears, eyes, and mouth.
By knowing how to activate or still (动静),
one can return three times (三返),
and the nine orifices will have no malevolent forces (无邪).
The eyes must see (目必视),
the ears must hear (耳必听),
the mouth must speak (口必言)—
these cannot be forced into stillness (静),
yet movement (动) never truly departs from stillness (未尝离静),
and stillness is not mere inaction (静非不动者).
Thus, one can speak of activating and stilling.

Fire arises from wood (火生於木),
yet calamity must first be subdued (祸发必克).
Deceit arises from the state (奸生於国),
yet turmoil must first be quelled (时动必溃).
Knowing this and refining through practice (修炼),
is what is called a Sage (圣人).

Fire arises from wood (火生於木),
yet sometimes it consumes the wood (有时而焚木);
Deceit arises from the state (奸生於国),
yet sometimes it must inevitably collapse (有时而必溃).
The five thieves’ (五贼) destructive intent
also follows this principle.
Knowing this and refining through practice (修炼),
who but a Sage can achieve it?
The method of refinement (修炼之法)
is the theory of activating and stilling (动静伏藏之说).

**Middle Section**

Heaven’s birth and Heaven’s death—this is the Dao’s principle.
Birth and death are the Dao’s descent into *qi*, natural and inescapable.

Heaven and Earth are the thieves of all things;
All things are the thieves of humankind;
Humankind are the thieves of all things.

When the three thieves are just, the Three Powers are at peace.
Heaven and Earth give birth to all things and also kill them;
All things give birth to humankind and also kill them;
Humankind give birth to all things and also kill them.
Because they give birth while also killing,
Thus, when reversed, it is called *theft*—just as the Five Thieves are named.

Yet when birth and death each find their measure,
the three thieves are just, and the Three Powers are settled.
Thus it is said:
*"Eat the season’s due, and the hundred limbs are in order.
Stir the mechanism, and all transformations are at peace."*

Heaven, Earth, and all things are governed by humankind.
If humankind eats the season’s due,
then the hundred limbs are in order;
If humankind stirs the mechanism of birth and death,
then all transformations are at peace—
this is the *thief’s* Dao.

*The season* refers to the early and late of spring and autumn.
*The mechanism* refers to birth, death, growth, and nourishment.

As Master Liu of the Han dynasty said:
*"Eating the season’s due"* is like Liezi’s saying—
*"stealing the harmony of Heaven and Earth."*

Humankind knows the *spirit* of the spirit,
but does not know how the *unmanifest* is spirit.
*Spirit* is the uncanny and unfathomable.
*The unmanifest* refers to Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, mountains and rivers, the living and the growing.

Humankind knows the uncanny as spirit,
but does not know that Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, mountains and rivers, the living and the growing—
what the ears and eyes perceive—
are also spirit.

Sun and moon have their numbers, great and small have their limits.
From this, *sagely* works arise; from this, *spiritual* power emerges.
Sun and moon—humankind does not know their spirit.
The sun’s number is great, completing three hundred sixty days;
The moon’s number is small, completing three hundred sixty *chén* (辰).
Heaven and Earth’s transformations do not exceed three hundred sixty.

The origin of *sagely* works lies in knowing this;
The emergence of *spiritual* power lies in this.

When stealing the mechanism,
none under Heaven can see it, none can know it.
The virtuous one who attains it preserves himself;
The petty one who attains it risks his life.

*Stealing the mechanism*—
this is the Five Thieves flowing between Heaven and Earth,
as mentioned above regarding the numbers of sun and moon.
To see and know it is to make the three thieves just,
and the Three Powers at peace.

Yet whether the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun gained renown and longevity,
or whether Su Qin, Zhang Yi, Shen Buhai, and Han Fei perished with their clans—
all were by the Dao.

The people can be made to follow it,
but not made to know it.
Truly profound words!

**Lower Section**

The blind excel in hearing, the deaf in sight.
Cut off one source of profit, and the use of troops is tenfold;
Threefold reversals of day and night, and the use of troops is ten-thousandfold.
The blind’s hearing and the deaf’s sight—
their focused intent is undivided, one can suffice for ten.

The "threefold reversals" refer to ear, eye, and mouth.
"Reversal" means returning to their origins.
Day and night are the operation of yin and yang.
When these three are reversed,
they transcend the operation of yin and yang,
and harmonize day and night, life and death.
One can suffice for ten-thousand—
as the *Yijing* says: *"The divine warrior who does not kill."*

Zhuzi says:
The blind excel in hearing, the deaf in sight—
their singular focus is evident.
"Cut off one source of profit" means to sever profit and guard a single source.
"Cut off profit" means to abandon the secondary;
"one source" means to unify the fundamental origin.
"Threefold reversals of day and night" means further refinement—
not just in warfare, but in all matters.
The ancients said, *"Double the effort, halve the work,"*
and again: *"The saying of threefold reversals of day and night*
is like the Daoist practitioner’s *zi-wu* [子午] discipline—
today as such, tomorrow as such,
the more practiced, the more effective it becomes."*

Xu Han Liuzi says:
"Threefold reversals" simply means *sanxing* [三省].
The mind arises from things, dies from things—
the mechanism lies in the eyes.
The mind perceives through things—that is to arise from things;
to chase things and lose oneself—that is to die from things.
When humans encounter things,
their orifices number nine, but their essence lies in three,
and the eyes are the most essential of these.

Laozi says:
*"See no desirable sights, and the heart will not be disturbed."*
Confucius replied:
*"Conquer the self through the eyes—*
*for vision is the first step."*

Western teachings on the six senses and six consciousnesses
first name *eye* and *form*—
all are rooted in intent.

Heaven’s lack of favor is the greatest favor.
Swift thunder and fierce winds—
none fail to act with overwhelming force.

The Grace of No Grace—this is the Dao of Heaven.
Only through no grace can grace arise,
only through non-action can action be wrought—
this is the use of the Sage, tenfold multiplied,
yet only through threefold reversals can it be achieved.

According to the *Zhu* edition, the following three characters are added here: *"The principle lies in qi."*

The utmost joy leaves a surplus—
the utmost stillness, a purity.
Heaven’s utmost selfishness
becomes the utmost public use.

The principle of *qín* lies in qi.
The utmost joy is without affairs,
thus its nature is surplus—
abundant, yet it can anticipate the world’s worries.
The utmost stillness is without defilement,
thus its nature is purity—
clean, yet it can share in the world’s calamities.

This is the Dao of threefold reversals,
the pinnacle of non-action.
It is the work of those who do not pluck a single hair.

Yet Heaven’s Dao, though most private,
in its use is most public—
thus the utmost joy and utmost stillness
are the means by which action arises.

So too with things: what can be taken is called *qín*.
The mutual subjugation of all things—
do they not act within this?
It is merely the natural unfolding of qi.

The tiger and leopard toward the *lín*,
the eagle and falcon toward the *fèng*—
they do not prevail by their own prowess or shock.
This is the threefold reversal of day and night,
by which one attains to one against ten thousand.

According to the *Zhu* edition, the phrase *"The principle of qín lies in qi"* is omitted here.

Life is the root of death;
death, the root of life.
Grace arises from harm;
harm arises from grace.
Life, death, grace, harm—
the Dao is never otherwise.
Thus the destruction of frost and snow
is the source of utmost grace;
the nourishment of rain and dew
is the source of utmost forbearance.

Pushed to its extreme, there is no mechanism of having or not-having,
no ceasing or motion that does not intermingle.
Thus, true speech is like reversal.

The foolish see Heaven and Earth as having patterns and principles—sacred.
I see time and things as having patterns and principles—wise.
Men see patterns in Heaven, principles in Earth,
and call it sacred—
yet they do not know why it is sacred.
I see the patterns of time, the principles of things,
and thus know why Heaven and Earth are sacred.
Heaven’s patterns have their seasons,
Earth’s principles have their things—
this is wisdom.

Speaking of Heaven and Earth’s constancy,
their Dao is indeed as such;
speaking of what changes,
it is also as such.

This is observing Heaven’s Dao,
grasping Heaven’s workings,
until it harmonizes with day and night,
and aligns with the unity of creation—
motion and stillness without contradiction.

Master Liu of Shuxu said: *"Time and things are coarse and near."*

According to the *Lishan Laomu* and *Cai* editions,
*"I see time and things as having patterns and principles—wise"*
is the final sentence of the text.
The *Zhu* edition and *Zhang* annotated edition include twenty-one additional sentences (114 characters) below,
which Master Zhu deeply valued.
Now, the *Zhu* edition is taken as the standard.

Men see the sacred as foolish and simple,
I see the sacred as not foolish and simple.
Men marvel at its sacredness,
I see its sacredness as not to be marveled at.
Water plunging into fire—
self-destruction is its own doing.

According to the *Zhang* annotated edition:
*"Men see the sacred as foolish and simple,
I see the sacred as not foolish and simple;
Men expect its sacredness,
I see its sacredness as not to be expected."*
Thus it is said:
*"How much more so water entering fire—
self-destruction is its own doing."*

The Dao of Nature is still,
thus Heaven and Earth and all things are born.
The Dao of Heaven and Earth is gradual,
thus yin and yang prevail.
Yin and yang, pushing against each other,
bring about smooth transformation.

Master Zhu said: *"These four sentences are wonderfully expressed.*
Stillness can generate motion—
this is gradualness.
Gradualness consumes and grows again gradually,
gradualness nurtures Heaven and Earth’s Dao—
this is constancy.
Thus it instructs people.
Again he said: *"The character *gradual* is most excellently placed.*
How could Heaven and Earth act abruptly?
Thus yin and yang prevail?
Again he said: *"The sentence ‘The Dao of Heaven and Earth is gradual’ is excellent.*
The Dao of yin and yang—
no day passes without their mutual victory.
They proceed step by step—
one retreats a fraction, the other advances a fraction.
Again he said: *"If it were not for extreme stillness,
Heaven and Earth and all things would not be born.
*Gradual* means slow transformation.
The Dao of Heaven and Earth—
gradually consuming and growing—
thus, when justness and gentleness prevail,
this is the principle of auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, of yin and yang victory.
The *Yinfu Jing* is particularly excellent here."

Thus the Sage knows the Dao of Nature cannot be defied,
and acts accordingly.
The Dao of utmost stillness
cannot be measured by calendars or instruments.
Yet from this arise wondrous devices,
giving birth to ten thousand phenomena.
The Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems—
divine mechanisms, hidden like ghosts.
The arts of yin and yang victory
are clearly manifested in symbols.

*Gao Shi’s Halting Summary* says:
Master Cai said:
*"Gou’s calligraphic *Yinfu Jing* is the most refined of books,
masterfully concealing its brushstrokes.*
I observe this text—
not only is Gou’s penmanship vigorous and compact,
unlike other scripts,
but its preface, attributed to Zheng Dan,
is even more extraordinary.
Its lines—
*‘Thunder and rain above, ritual vessels spreading far,
refining its essence, flowing into wisdom’*—
are exquisitely precise, unlike Tang dynasty prose.
And it says:
*‘The encounter at Panxi,
the secrets of the Golden Case—
Liu Bang and Wu Qi pondered them to their depths,
making *Yinfu*’s use manifest.’*
According to the final lines,
the text hints without revealing,
resembling a profound, mysterious device—
ten thousand phenomena unknown.
The Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems—
divine mechanisms, hidden like ghosts—
perhaps this is what is meant by *arts*.
It lies in human silent enlightenment,
and in skillful use."

Again, Master Wei of He Mountain said:
*"Master Li Jiayou was well-versed in the Classics, histories, and hundred schools,
yet deeply studied the *Yijing*.
In his later years, he encountered the theory of *gathering qi and softness*,
and correlated it with the *Yinfu Jing*.
Through exhaustive research and contemplation,
he firmly believed without ceasing.
Thus, those who understand the Dao
must integrate these two books with the *Yijing* in practice."*
