### **Preface to the Scripture of the Great Antiquity**

The supreme Dao is wordless; true emptiness is formless. Those who contemplate it cannot fathom it; those who behold it cannot see it. It cannot be grasped through inquiry, nor attained through practice. Yet it shapes heaven and earth, follows the transformations of creation, remains still and unmoving, and pervades the six directions of space, bestowing blessings upon the myriad things and restoring the lives of all beings.

How lofty and perfect it is! Who but a sage could comprehend it?

Moreover, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, in boundless compassion and wisdom illuminating the ten directions, observed that sentient beings had forgotten their origin and lost their root, drifting endlessly through the world, trapped in the unceasing cycle of rebirth, suffering through kalpas without awakening. Moved by this, he sent forth the rain of the Dharma to nourish all, proclaiming the wondrous Dao, guiding and delivering beings from the sea of birth and death, that they might wander in the realm of purity and tranquility, transcend the dust and filth, tread the vast expanse, roam freely in solitary transformation, subtle and profoundly penetrating, effortless and spontaneous, returning to the primordial state of undifferentiated chaos.

### **Commentary on the Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s Scripture of the Great Antiquity**

**"Primordial" (元)** is that which precedes qi.
**"Beginning" (始)** is the inception of all things.
Thus, from the natural state of emptiness and non-being, pure and quiescent, it encompasses all mysteries and responds to all beings—hence it is called *Primordial Beginning*.

**"Heavenly Worthy" (天尊)** is the supreme mystery, the most exalted and luminous, the true and noble one, lord of the Three Realms, teacher of gods and humans, the revered title of hidden virtue.

**"Spoke" (说)** means to proclaim, expound, and unfold, to create and let flow. Like compassionate clouds spreading wide and the Dharma-rain descending, it universally moistens the hearts of all beings, nurturing the sprouts of goodness.

**"Great Antiquity" (太古)** is nameless and imageless, unchanging and immutable, one with the void, enduring through kalpas. It precedes heaven and earth yet does not age; it follows the six directions yet is not inferior. Still and silent, it stands alone and unaltered, passing through yin and yang without exhaustion. Neither born nor dying, neither coming nor going, it abides in serene tranquility.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion, widely opened the gates of expedient means, proclaiming the wondrous essence and expounding subtle teachings to save and deliver all beings, utterly eradicating their sufferings.

**"Scripture" (经)** is no vulgar or base discourse, but an alternate name for the wondrous Dharma and the eternal truth. It is the essential path of all goodness, the ladder to sagehood, the true way of carefree wandering, the level and mysterious road, the boundless wilderness, the land of nothingness. All wise ones of past and present have journeyed here.

If, among the beings drowning in the sea of suffering, there are those who inherently possess the wind of immortality and the bones of the numinous, who encounter this golden text, they will, upon hearing it, attain liberation, cast off the fetters of karma, distance themselves from afflictions, and roam beyond the mundane—how could this not be the greatest fortune?

The Heavenly Worthy said:
"The sage’s teachings descend like the heavens’ movement through the four seasons, ever faithful and perfectly responsive."

Words function like the pivot of a crossbow—once loosed, they strike straight and true, never missing their mark. Uttered, they radiate majesty and clarity, never failing to be fitting. They are like fine medicine and jade nectar, the lamp of great illumination, able to cure all the ailments of sentient beings, to shatter the darkness of delusion and the karma of ignorance. Their power surpasses gold and stone, penetrating the mind’s earth.

They move like the spring wind, awakening ordinary beings and suddenly opening the heart’s ground. Their glory pervades the myriad transformations, each returning to its root. They guide and receive the people of the world, resolving enmity and untying bonds, emerging from birth and death, transcending being and non-being, and wandering in the great Dao—what could they not attain?

The movement that moves lies in non-movement. The movement that moves is response to the moment; non-movement is embracing the origin and guarding the One, returning to the root and restoring life. Thus the scripture says: “The clear is the source of the turbid; the still is the foundation of the moving.” Only through refinement and singularity can one truly hold to the center.

All things flourish and flourish, each returning to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; ultimate stillness is non-movement. The activity of action lies in non-action. The spirit is fundamentally profound and quiescent; moved, it then responds. Arising only when unavoidable, it adapts to circumstances and receives beings, its wondrous function boundless.

Discarding wisdom and benevolence, one follows the principle of Heaven, remaining serene and without limit, and all wonders return to them. When qi abides, the myriad things are all born. Concentrating qi to attain softness, one can be like an infant. Embracing and guarding harmony, the true qi steams and swirls, and all things attain long life.

To know harmony is called constancy; to employ the mind to move qi is called force. Force leads to rigidity, old age, and death—it is the path of the dead. When qi dissipates, the myriad things all perish. When qi is cut off and spirit departs, the nine orifices and hundred bones crumble into dust—what doubt can there be?

All things mutually sustain one another, each nurturing its root. With emptiness nurture emptiness; with fullness nurture fullness. Why? Forgetting form nurtures qi; forgetting the mind nurtures spirit with qi; forgetting spirit nurtures emptiness. When the empty chamber generates brightness, auspiciousness abides, and spirit and qi interpenetrate in tranquility. The numinous root is deeply established, thus forming the Dao of long life and enduring vision.

Silently comprehend it, and I plant it myself. The ultimate Dao is utterly mysterious, obtained without reliance on external things. Silent and obscure, without response or inquiry, the solitary radiance of the numinous light shines, freed from root and dust. The body reveals true constancy, not following the myriad dharmas. Thus one can preserve life and return to the origin.

Emerging from the gapless—“gapless” means “without anything.” This is the teaching of non-words, the benefit of non-action, perfectly unobstructed, responding and transforming without end, pervading the ten directions. Moving ceaselessly, without interruption, it is neither dead nor alive. The mysterious pearl shines brilliantly, ever luminous through past and present. The myriad things are blended into one, all dharmas equal. Neither still nor defiled, without beginning or end—thus it is called neither dead nor alive.

How could one not unite with Heaven and Earth? The Dao of Heaven is clear and empty, thus it endures long. The Dao of Earth is tranquil and still, thus it lasts long. If one can comprehend the principle and grasp its wondrous Dao, attaining the ultimate in emptiness and guarding stillness firmly, remaining serene and undisturbed, not burdened by the myriad things, abiding in purity and non-action—how could one not unite with Heaven and Earth?

The Heavenly Worthy said:
The Heavenly Worthy is inherently possessed by every person, fully present in each. Yet because sentient beings are shallow in conditions and meager in fortune, obscured by afflictions, their deluded emotions heavy and turbid, they do not awaken to the true source. Even when encountering an enlightened teacher, they do not believe or understand.

To forget the eye is to have light overflowing without limit, the five colors confusing brightness, blinding the eye. “Color” is manifestation; “all colors” have never truly appeared. What does this mean? With the Dharma-eye perfectly unobstructed, illuminating the ten directions and three realms, observing things as no-things, observing emptiness as not-empty, one’s vision is dark and obscure. Within this profound obscurity, one alone sees the dawn. The numinous light fills and pervades, without end.

To forget the ear is to have the mind’s awareness always profound. The five sounds confuse hearing, deafening the ear. The mind is a clear abyss, originally pure and still. Right and wrong, words, beautiful and ugly sounds—all are false emotions and illusory things, like gusting winds and sudden rains, disturbing the heart’s source and dulling the spirit’s chamber. If one can extinguish right and wrong, not receiving them within, then within the soundless, one alone hears harmony. Only then can one hear the mysterious song and the white snow, the unstrummed *Yangchun*, the melodies of immortal music.

When both mechanisms are forgotten, this is called the Great Mystery. When sound and color are both extinguished, movement and stillness both forgotten, hearing without qi, seeing without spirit—this is the wonder of the Great Mystery, the numinous emptiness of vastness. Deep and ever deeper, it can become things; spirit and ever more spirit, it can become refined. The action of non-action, knowing without knowing, numinous brightness vast and clear, boundless emptiness—wondrous beyond all limits.

Vague and undifferentiated, it accords with the great square; self and other both forgotten, being and non-being not established. Obscure and silent, dark and profound, boundless and without limit, neither external nor internal. Its wandering has no beginning, its emergence no direction. Nurturing the myriad things, it cannot be represented—blended and without corners.

Vast and boundless, it accords with the peerless. The profound Dao is doubly mysterious, vast and unbounded, its principle without equal. Concealed, it is original essence; employed, it is the myriad spirits. Contained, it is the Great One; released, it is the Great Clarity. Without form or name, most honored and noble—deluded, it is an ordinary being; awakened, it is a sage. Though Heaven and Earth are great, they do not fill me. The sages of past and present, the perfected ones who attained the Dao—lifting Heaven and Earth, grasping yin and yang, carving and polishing the myriad things, bestowing blessings on all beings—was this difficult for them?

The myriad things are the multitude I sustain. The cosmos is in their hand; the myriad transformations arise from their body. How could there be an end, that one might speak of its limitations?

The sage speaks of the wondrous Dao in plain terms, universally manifesting its radiance, yet fearing that later generations of ordinary beings might doubt or hesitate, humbly declares as though words fail to capture its principle, lest misstatements lead to error.

The Heavenly Worthy says:
The Heavenly Worthy is subtly wondrous and profoundly penetrating, so deep as to be unfathomable—thus, the mouth speaks of the mysterious yet finds no path, the tongue discourses yet does not discourse. Nurture the true fire, and the body endures forever. True qi steams and pervades, rendering time without cold or heat; pure yang flows and infuses, so that people know neither death nor life. Thus it is said: when the heart-lamp shines brightly, the dharma-body endures forever. If the wisdom-candle remains unlit, how could the Dao’s vessel bear its weight?

Consolidate the true water, and the body abides eternally. When Heaven and Earth unite, sweet dew descends, nourishing all beings. If one can remain tranquil and harmonious, the precious vessel firm, the jade nectar fragrant and sweet, true water descending to nurture the wondrous body—returning to youth like a child—is this not excellence?

When true realities complement one another, it is called longevity. When water and fire are in harmony, hun and po guard each other, lead and mercury congeal, and the great elixir is refined, the golden pill is formed. Resplendent and luminous, it illumines even the darkest depths. Pure and white, it enters simplicity; effortless, it returns to the uncarved block. Abiding in eternal life, never perishing even in bodily death—this is called the Perfected One.

Heaven attains its truth and thus endures forever. Having obtained the pure, unadulterated Dao, it can cover all existence, embrace the ten thousand forms, remain clear and serene through kalpas, reflect all things without partiality, respond without speech, and wield boundless marvels—lofty, empty, and vast, encompassing all, unchanging through eternity.

Earth attains its truth and thus abides long. Having attained its truth, it nurtures the myriad things, roots deep and stems firm, tranquil and effortless—thus enduring forever.

Humans attain their truth and thus live long. Those who die yet do not perish are long-lived. If worldly people awaken to its true essence, grasp its wondrous origin, and merge with the Dao in truth, never perishing even in bodily death, they become sages and worthies, ensuring that later generations never cease their veneration—what could surpass this?

The reason worldly people cannot attain longevity is that they nurture the external: the five flavors foul the mouth, the five odors assail the nose, sounds and sights clog the ears and eyes, preferences and aversions disturb the heart, causing the nature to soar and the emotions to chase after things. Thoughts entangle one another, the mind and intellect wander outward, while spirits and demons enter within. Right and wrong, favor and disgrace—all disrupt the spirit’s source. Engaging in mutual conflict with things, they exhaust themselves in lifelong toil, entangled in the web of karma, unaware of their return—is this not lamentable?

Though the body dwells in luxury and finery, the mind is deluded by perverse views, thoughts inverted and delusional, even unto life’s end, never knowing Heaven’s mandate. Those who lose themselves in things and forfeit their nature to worldly customs are called the inverted people—is this not pitiable? This is the ruin of the inner self.

The inner self is originally pure, luminous, empty, and radiant—why then cling to the myriad conditions, never turning inward in reflection? The solitary nature drifts away, sinking into the delusion of ten thousand kalpas, making it difficult to awaken to the true body, which is then displaced by another form. Losing the true source, the inner self is ruined. Trapped in the cycle of rebirth through endless kalpas, adrift in the sea of birth and death, unable to transcend—how sorrowful and pitiable!

The Way of long life is to embody the true and constant, unbound by written words. The heart-nature, unstained, is originally perfect and complete. Simply depart from delusive conditions, and the Way of long life may be attained.

Not seeing, not hearing—
Not seeing, not hearing means breaking the limbs, dulling the senses, outwardly not observing the cosmos, inwardly unaware of the Great Beginning. Neither ascending Kunlun nor roaming the Great Void, sitting in forgetfulness and abandoning reflection, merging with the profound mystery—identical yet without preference, transformed yet without constancy. Subtle and wondrous, beyond measure.

Neither flourishing nor prosperous—
Not coveting wealth, not pursuing riches or honor, not currying favor with others, not adorning oneself with things. While the multitude bustles and glows, I alone remain cautious; while others shine brightly, I alone seem dim. Discarding fame and forgetting power, preserving the body and avoiding harm—this accords with the Heavenly Dao.

Rejecting the world and leaving the俗—
Not seeking prominence in the marketplace, not imprisoned by wife and children.

Like a solitary cloud or a wild crane, soaring freely and at ease—unfettered in movement, without intent—such is the adept of true cultivation. Accumulating essence and preserving spirit, the worthy cherish aspiration, the sage treasures essence. Inwardly, they nurture spirit with the harmonious qi of the Void; outwardly, they nourish the life of wisdom with the wondrous methods of all sages. Within and without, luminous and clear, the nature of awakening becomes perfectly radiant. Mind and realm both forgotten, they instantly transcend all leakages. Only by embodying this method can one engage in cultivation.

Serene and without action—
To be without action is to lack nothing in action. Tranquil and without striving, this accords with Heavenly virtue. Thus it is said: nothing is not forgotten, nothing is not possessed. In profound stillness and boundless simplicity, all excellence follows. Thus it is said: serenity and tranquility, emptiness and non-action—these are the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth, the essence of the Dao and virtue. Therefore the sage is tranquil and unperturbed, level and easy. Level and easy, tranquil and unperturbed—then sorrow and joy cannot enter, perverse qi cannot assail. Their spirit remains unharmed, thus their virtue is whole. Still and unified, they do not change. Hence, among all the worthy and sages, their Dao is subtle and unobtrusive. That one could attain sagehood through methods other than non-action is a principle never heard of. Thus they attain the Dao.

As for the Dao—
It has sentiment and trust, yet is without action and without form. It may be transmitted but not obtained, received but not seen. It existed before Heaven and Earth, born yet without name; though it was never born. It endures beyond past and present, abiding yet without form; though it never abides. Thus it is said: beyond thought and discussion. Since it cannot be pursued through inquiry, how can reflection attain it? For all beings, when mind and realm are both forgotten, when not a single thought arises—whether in breath or movement, step or stride—when one knows not who acts, then cease seeking fire with a lamp or crossing water to find a ford. In sudden awakening to the original mind, the Dao is attained.

For this, a gāthā is now proclaimed for all beings:
The Heavenly Worthy reveals the secret,
With expedient means shows compassion.
Dharma rain nourishes all kinds,
Mysterious discourse resolves all doubts.
Seeing the mundane as dream and illusion,
Guiding beings to awaken to the subtle and wondrous.
Water and fire return to the furnace,
Clouds and mist enshroud Kan and Li.
The Void communicates the sagely Dao,
Purity and stillness bear the numinous mushroom.
Things thus endure,
People thus walk free from calamity and peril.
Beyond the Three Realms they roam,
Forever realizing non-action.

Thus concludes the *Commentary on the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning’s Scripture of the Great Antiquity*.
