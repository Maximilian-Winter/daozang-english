**Preface to the *Yin Fu Jing* Commentary**

The *True Classic of Yin Fu* contains over three hundred characters—its words are few yet its meaning profound, its text deep yet its principles complete. The Dao/Way of life and death’s subtle mechanisms, the principles of yin and yang’s transformation and generation, all wondrous applications and authentic powers, are encompassed and summarized within. In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor, amid his myriad affairs, attained profound silence and emptiness, and through this, he encountered the True Classic. On **Kongtong Mountain**, he questioned the **Celestial Sovereign of Truth** and **Master Guangcheng**, gaining their essential insights. Diligent in practice, he one day ascended to Heaven by riding the **Fire Dragon** from **Ding Lake**, and thus the Dao/Way was passed down to the world. Later practitioners who sought immortality and embraced the Dao/Way, those who could silently perceive its mysteries and deeply cultivate its realms, often raised themselves high and far, ascending with the shadows and rising into the void—such achievements were not few.

Yet across countless ages, none directly annotated or explained this text, revealing its true meaning. All merely employed flowery metaphors and oblique allusions, leaving its authentic source concealed. Thus, students became entangled in endless branches, their doubts persisting even to old age, their labor yielding no fruit. The more they sought, the more confused they grew, abandoning their path halfway—such cases are innumerable. Consequently, many deemed the Daoist classics as empty words, a fate most lamentable.

**True Person Liu, the Immortal of the Divine Peak**, instructed **Law Order and the Vessel** (器). **Master Liu**, whose vast talents spanned antiquity and modernity, whose mind wandered through the Dao of Virtue and Power, pondered deeply and refined his understanding. He delved into profound mysteries and explored hidden truths, annotating this text with clarity and openness, making it easily known and practiced for the benefit of future generations. Truly, he was a compassionate and virtuous scholar.

**Graduate Bishou from Jinan**, whose name was **Zhenyi**, wrote this preface, intending to spread the text far and wide as a guide for students. Those who carefully examine this work may awaken from doubt, resolve confusion, and all attain liberation from the dusty entanglements of the world. They may directly enter the realm of True Dao/Way, wandering freely in the boundless expanse.

On the **twenty-second day of the second lunar month in the Year of the Ox (1191)**, **Fan Zhenyude**, the **Learning Official of Ninghai Prefecture**, prefaced this text.

**Chapter on the Dao/Way of the Embracing-One Immortals**

To **observe the Dao/Way of Heaven** and **hold fast to Heaven’s actions**, is to attain completeness. To **observe** is to **perfect the Five Eyes** (五眼) and attain clarity. When one’s **Heavenly Eye** (天眼), **Palm of Wisdom Eye** (慧眼), **Dharma Eye** (法眼), **Dao/Way Eye** (道眼), and **Divine Eye** (神眼) are all radiant and piercing, the **Five Aggregates** (五蕴) dissolve into emptiness, and one perceives the **Heavenly Dao/Way**.

Within Heaven lies the **Heaven Beyond Heaven** (天外天), above the earth. **Pure Qi** (清炁) is Heaven—its loftiest realm extends **eighty-four thousand li** (至高八万四千里), the **Highest Heaven** (高天). In the human body, each receives a portion of Heaven’s Qi; the Qi varies in thickness. If it is **harmonious and balanced**, one becomes a **sage or worthy**; if it is **contrary and dispersed**, one descends into the realm of ghosts.

The **Dao/Way** is the **formless essence** beyond Heaven and Earth, the **source of all ten thousand things**. In the human body, if one **glimpses the boundless expanse** with a **mind of emptiness**, then one’s **innate nature** (至性) aligns harmoniously with the Dao/Way.

To **hold fast** means to **guard the True** while rejecting the false, to **awaken to the Right** while avoiding the perverse.

**Heaven** refers to Heaven’s **generative power** over all things. Heaven generates all things yet does not **hoard or take** them back; it benefits the **ten directions, the Three Realms, and all beings**, yet does not expect repayment. It merely wishes that all beings **awaken to and fully comprehend** the principles of Heaven. One must **neither hate nor love** all things, maintaining the **equality of Heaven**.

When humans, who possess **emotion**, comprehend Heaven’s **lack of emotion**, they fulfill their **gratitude to Heaven**. If one does not follow the **principles of Heaven**, even if one indulges in **filth, evil, licentiousness, and depravity**, one will suffer **disease, early death, and untimely demise**, descending into the **Hell Realms** and enduring **exhaustive suffering**. Then one falls into the **animal realm**, losing one’s human form.

If one follows **Heaven’s singular Dao/Way**, **constant goodness** brings **harmonious Qi**; **constant purity** refines one’s **innate nature**; **constant detachment from emotion** preserves one’s **life-force**; **constant freedom from defilement** clarifies the Dao/Way; and **constant non-transgression of Heaven’s laws** ensures **no guilt**.

Without cultivating **worldly blessings**, one **embraces the Dao/Way** and preserves its **authentic essence**. **Blessings do not cling to minor, external methods**; one **suddenly comprehends the principle of Non-Action** (無為), and all **laws** (萬法) are thereby **fully liberated** across the Three Realms.

Heaven has **Five Thieves** (五贼)—those who see them flourish. The **Five Thieves** are not the **worldly bandits** nor the **human Six Thieves** (六贼), but what kind of thieves are they?

Heaven’s **Five Rectifying Qi** (五方正炁) reside within the human body as the **mother of the spirit**. The **Celestial Cycle’s twelve hours** naturally **withdraw, supplement, and revolve**, their **limitless subtlety** termed **Non-Action** (無). Within this cycle, **Heaven and Earth transmit yin and yang**, **refined Qi** (秀炁) generates in all things, and humans consume **the Five Grains**, nourishing their **physical form** yet harboring **filth and impurity**. They are **immersed in water and fire**, and the **essence of the Five Grains** in the human body, if preserved, becomes **life-force**.

When **life-force** (命) aligns with **innate nature** (性), one’s lifespan extends; when **innate nature** harmonizes with **life-force**, one’s vitality flourishes. **Life-force** is like the **tortoise of the Northern Sea** (北海之乌龟), which **Master Ding** (丁翁) constantly holds to form its shape. The **Five Thieves** are the **True Yang** (真阳). When Heaven’s **True Yang** encounters its **True Yin** (真阴), the **Five Thieves** steal the **treasure of the Northern Sea**. Those who **guard this treasure** flourish, just as all beings and humans are **plundered by thieves**.

The **Five Thieves** dwell in the heart; their actions extend to Heaven. The **cosmos lies within one’s grasp**, and **all transformations arise from the body**. The **Five Thieves** in the heart are the **disordered Five Phases** (五行颠倒). Within the heart, **True Water** (真水) ascends—if **contrary**, the **heart’s orifices are blocked**, and **Kidney Water** (肾水) descends, leading to **the path of death**. All who do not follow the **Dao/Way of the Sages** are thus.

The **ancient enlightened sages** often spoke of the Dao/Way in varied terms, while the **common folk** each cling to their own limited perceptions, distinguishing between **high and low** paths.

The righteous can contain the wicked, yet when wickedness prevails, it slanders the righteous.
Wicked teachings multiply false perspectives—
like fireflies flickering beside the true Dao/Way,
comparable to the light of sun and moon.
When night is dark, their faint glow appears bright,
but how could one mistake firefly light
for the radiant splendor of sun and moon
illuminating the ten directions and three realms?

The Sage grasps the cosmos’ yin-yang transformations,
Earth and Heaven in harmonious union,
all transformations arising from the body,
all forms taking shape.

Among all things, only humankind is supreme and noble—
to seize the workings of Nature,
to cultivate the inner and outer self, is to attain the Dao/Way.
To master all transformations,
to externally rescue suffering beings,
to awaken from the golden fetters,
the jade shackles,
the fleeting spark of stone,
the wind-lit illusions of the world—
to distance oneself from filth and evil,
to draw near to purity and virtue,
to outwardly conform to human morality,
to inwardly follow the Supreme One,
to return to the Buddha’s true essence,
to unify all dharma,
to blend with the world while one’s nature emerges like a lotus from water—
this is to perfect one’s virtue.

This is the ultimate clarity of the Dao/Way’s transformations and immortality.

**Heaven’s nature is humanity; humanity’s heart is the mechanism.**
To establish Heaven’s Dao/Way is to govern humanity.

Human nature, from ancient times to now,
is born, dies, and reborns—
selling bones, changing forms,
like ants circling endlessly,
never pausing for an instant.

The heart’s mechanism shifts daily in myriad ways—
each with its own cleverness or clumsiness,
righteousness or wickedness,
depth or shallowness,
filial piety or cruelty,
generosity or narrowness,
length or brevity,
clarity or turbidity,
virtue or folly,
love or hate,
right or wrong.
To discern the heart’s mechanism is to know human nature.

To establish Heaven’s Dao/Way—
Heaven’s Dao/Way is foolish,
for it does not know the greatness of Heaven’s grace:
spring’s warmth, summer’s heat,
autumn’s coolness, winter’s cold—
the four seasons transform,
nurturing all things,
benefiting humanity.
The wealthy wear silk and feast on delicacies,
the poor eat coarse grains and wear rough cloth—
each finds contentment as they will.

The Dao/Way arises from things,
undifferentiated simplicity dispersing into forms,
adornment for the world—
like flowers in full bloom,
rich as brocade,
bringing joy to all people.

Heaven’s Dao/Way governs humanity.
The virtuous understand Heaven’s principles,
practicing them silently,
speaking not yet acting rightly,
responding with universal virtue without seeking recognition,
bestowing blessings without expecting reward.

If one follows Heaven’s Dao/Way,
their virtue governs and benefits humanity.
With inner wisdom unfettered,
one comprehends all transformations,
all dharma,
all things without attachment,
all dust without defilement—
nature harmonizes with fate,
fate with Heaven,
Heaven with the Dao/Way,
the Dao/Way with Nature.
To perfect the Dao/Way within,
to perfect virtue without—
this is the Sage and the virtuous.

When Heaven unleashes its killing intent,
dragons and serpents rise from the land.
When humanity unleashes its killing intent,
Heaven and Earth invert.

**Heaven’s killing intent:**
When warmth reaches its peak, it shifts to coolness,
coolness to the metal winds;
metal transforms into the winter solstice’s breath,
all trees wither and fall,
dragons coil in the deep sea,
serpents hibernate in hidden caves.
At the winter solstice, one yang arises,
gradually generating harmonious qi,
until the spring equinox, when all things sprout—
dragons and serpents emerge from their slumber onto the land.

**Humanity’s killing intent:**
Human nature is the pure yang radiance of spirit—
the heart clings to desires for worldly things,
to the flames of attachment—
love, affection, the seven emotions,
striving for fame and gain.
Lost in wine, lust, wealth, and ego,
endless cravings bind them.
Each thought of desire belongs to yin.

When nature clings to yin,
below, the Kidney Sea’s golden tortoise drains,
above, the heavy jade elixir dissipates—
the soul wanders, the spirit scatters,
true nature lost.
When external yin flourishes, internal yang decays—
pursuing things leads to death,
sinking into the ghostly depths.

If one suddenly awakens to the supreme Dao/Way,
comprehending all things’ existence—
this is yang destroying yin.
Nature like the bright moon,
the heart clear as Heaven,
ten thousand miles without clouds—
its light shines naturally.
All phenomena manifest.
Humanity’s killing intent scatters all yin,
naturally purifying soul and spirit,
yin and yang inverted—
Heaven and Earth reverse,
Creation renews,
the Three Elixirs coalesce,
breaking free from Heaven and Earth’s shell,
shedding form to reveal the true body beyond.

Heaven and humanity act in unison—
all transformations find their foundation.

**Heaven and humanity:**
Human nature communicates with Heaven—
when united, the heart is exhausted by things.
One who penetrates the illusions of the human world
knows that honor and disgrace,
favor and humiliation,
success and failure,
calamity and fortune,
joy and sorrow,
life and death—
are the eternal cycles of past and present.

One who comprehends Heaven’s principles
experiences true honor without decay,
true favor without humiliation,
true success without failure,
true fortune without calamity,
true joy without sorrow,
true life without death—
this is the constant of the Dao/Way.

The Dao/Way is constant yet embraces all transformations,
establishing the fundamental nature of existence.

When supreme nature is fully realized,
all transformations naturally harmonize—
like the highest goodness in roundness and straightness,
all streams converging into the Yangtze, Huai, and Ji rivers,
merging into the great ocean, blending into one—
this is profound comprehension.

Nature has its cleverness and clumsiness,
capable of concealment.
The ancient enlightened ones,
with inner nature refined and skillful,
externally appeared clumsy and foolish,
hiding their light—
like beautiful jade buried in stone,
or a pearl nestled in a clam.

Birds differ—
the clever parrot speaks,
yet is caged like an iron dragon;
the clumsy dove remains silent,
soaring freely among the branches.
Thus, worldly cleverness brings endless calamity,
while true clumsiness brings pure blessings.

Therefore, Heaven acts without speech yet transforms naturally,
Heaven is without emotion yet never ages.
Humans must understand Heaven’s Dao/Way—
to forget speech is to fathom Nature’s mysteries,
to forget emotion is to grasp eternity’s essence.

Human desires,
when excessive in cleverness, lead to transgression.
When excessive in emotion, bring suffering.
To forget the world and sever attachments
is the key to joy in the Dao/Way and preserving life.

The nine orifices’ wickedness
lies within the three essentials,
governable by stillness and motion.

「The Nine Orifices,
the luminous paths of the Nine Passages.
Those not yet opened,
are the Nine Yin’s wicked bolts and bars.

The human heart, a square inch of emptiness,
yet within holds luminous clarity.
The superior person’s heart has nine orifices,
the mediocre seven,
the inferior five—
a heart devoid of orifices is called a fool.

Wicked Yin spawns turbid nature,
while radiant Yang descends to purify the spirit—
this depends on the Three Essentials.
Heaven’s light has the Sun, Moon, and Stars,
Earth’s treasures hold gold, jade, and rare gems,
The Dao’s passage contains lead and mercury’s true essence—
governable by stillness and motion.
When Heaven moves, the Three Lights shine,
when Earth stirs, the Three Treasures manifest,
when luminous clarity arises, the Three Spirits coalesce.

Motion is the movement of form,
stillness is the stillness of nature.
The ancient sages and recluse masters
mixed with the world yet never moved their hearts,
dwelt in mountains yet never clung to still forms—
they understood the interplay of motion within stillness,
and stillness within the bustle of life.
To forget both motion and stillness,
one attains the Dao’s eternal subtlety.

Fire arises from wood,
and calamity follows, inevitably suppressed.
Deceit arises within nations,
and when stirred, it must collapse.

To know and refine this,
is to be called a Sage.

Fire constantly touches the human heart,
yet to not fall prey to its endless transformations
is the essence of human nature.
When thoughts arise without clarity,
fire consumes the wood of one’s nature—
calamity follows, and the auspicious is defied,
while blessings are lost to ruin.
To suppress is to slay the true.

Deceit arising within nations,
the *Tàishàng Jīng* says:
Not to govern with cleverness is the nation’s blessing;
to govern with cleverness is the nation’s thief.
Flatterers and schemers flourish within nations,
making it difficult for the people to live in peace—
when stirred, they must scatter and dissolve.
The foolish, not understanding principle,
bring chaos to the world,
and must face punishment by law.
Not to govern with cleverness,
but to govern with no disturbance—
this brings great peace and harmony to the people.

To know and refine this,
is not the alchemy of burning five metals and eight stones—
but to cultivate life and nature,
to reach principle and penetrate the Mysterious,
which the Three Teachings call *enlightenment in the Dao*.

To constantly save beings and pity the world,
to know Heaven’s grace and call it *accumulating virtue*.
Since the Yellow Emperor’s enlightenment in the Dao,
there has been this *Yīnfú Jīng*,
and in the Zhou era, the Golden Wheel King enlightened to Release,
thus came the *Jīngāng Jīng*—
after attaining Buddhahood,
he was named *Shìjiā Móní Buddha*.
The *Jīngāng Jīng*’s thirty-two chapters
discuss the Dao, emphasizing the removal of:
the *I-relative*,
the *person-relative*,
the *sentient-being-relative*,
and the *life-span-relative*.
Without these four attachments,
the heart bears no transgressions.

Like Heaven without clouds,
nature as bright as the moon—
it reveals its perfect, luminous essence.
Nature is like the root of a tree,
the body like a person’s form,
all dharmas like branches and leaves.
The *Yīnfú Jīng*’s unfolding of creation,
is like the blooming of flowers and the bearing of fruit.
Worldly people studying the Dao,
claim they cannot fully grasp its principle—
each clings to roots, tips, branches, or leaves,
to blooming flowers or bearing fruit,
each asserting their own view as right,
others’ as wrong.

With the four attachments,
the heart not yet purified—
this is called *lateral paths*.

In the chapter on *enriching nations and securing people*,
Heaven gives and Heaven takes—
this is the Dao’s principle.
Heaven and Earth are thieves of all things,
all things are thieves of humans,
humans are thieves of all things’ essence.
When the Three Thieves are harmonized,
the Three Talents are at peace.
Heaven gives and Heaven takes—
when spring’s gentle *qi* warms,
Heaven nurtures all things;
when autumn’s golden wind stirs,
all things wither and die—
Heaven’s taking.

The principle of giving and taking,
Heaven acts without emotion yet naturally.
Heaven and Earth transform through the four seasons,
creating all things.
Within all things lies the refined *qi* of Heaven and Earth’s Yin and Yang,
and all things steal this refined *qi*.
All things are humans’ thieves—
humans steal all things’ brilliance,
plundering Heaven and Earth’s refined *qi*.

To extinguish desires and thoughts,
to preserve clarity and stillness,
is to guard life.
Humans are thieves of all things—
humans covet all things’ splendor and allure,
eyes feasting on five colors,
ears indulging in five sounds,
tongues relishing five flavors,
drunk on richness, sated on decadence,
yielding to wickedness and lust,
losing life—
joy to its extreme brings sorrow.

If one abandons the world and awakens,
without attachment, external things cannot steal.
When the Three Thieves are harmonized,
the stolen treasures are boundless—
creation’s perfect gems,
priceless beyond measure.
When the Three Talents are at peace,
one returns to the Three Sages,
the Teachings illuminate the Three Vehicles,
the Mysterious enlightenment of the Three Emperors,
the celestial movement of the Three Lights,
the inverted momentum of the Three Chariots,
the cultivation of the Three Fields,
the alchemical refinement of the Three Fires,
the furnace’s formation of the Three Elixirs—
the divine manifestation of the Three Yangs,
ascending to the Three Heavens,
true and uncorruptible,
born yet never perishing—
exhausting the Dao of things,
the true and the Dao as one body brings peace.

Thus it is said:
*Eat of its time*, and the hundred limbs are in order.
*Move its mechanism*, and all transformations are secure.

Humans know their spirit’s brilliance as brilliance,
yet do not know the brilliance of not knowing—
this is how brilliance arises.

*Eat of its time*—
when hungry, one meets fine meals yet does not covet,
encounters coarse food yet does not scorn.
One neither slaughters for meat nor refines abstinence,
but when hungry, eats without distinction of coarse or fine,
when weary, sleeps,
when idle, hums,
when joyful, recites—
to sit when one wishes to sit,
to lie when one wishes to lie,
to dwell when one wishes to dwell,
to move when one wishes to move—
to release the Four Great Elements,
unbound and free—
then the hundred limbs are in order.

Within the twelve hours,
confronted with myriad sights,
one must only keep the true heart ever serene.
Motion—
one must not let the heart be moved.
Internally manifesting radiant light,
responding to things while the form moves.

Mechanism—
the Sage calls it *wisdom*,
the martial general calls it *strategy*,
the common person calls it *mechanism*,
the petty calls it *trickery*.
The Void Sage acts with profound wisdom,
worldly people cannot fully comprehend its principle—
they hold to subtle cleverness,
yet speak with ordinary mechanisms.
The faithful listen,
the virtuous follow,
all things harmonized and transformed—
sudden enlightenment brings peace and stillness in the Dao’s birth.

Humans know their spirit’s brilliance as brilliance,
yet worldly people only know the brilliance of Earth’s Yin spirit—
they carve wooden statues and mold clay idols,
calling them *spirit*—
the foolish do not know.
Every transgression committed,
Heaven brings a corresponding calamity.
To slaughter and harm pigs and sheep,
to burn vast amounts of money and paper,
to pray—
when sick, one seeks healing,
when in misfortune, one seeks blessings—
yet they do not know the brilliance of not knowing—
this is how brilliance truly arises.»

「People do not know that the Heavenly Yang Dao/Way is most divine, with its energies divided across all directions—
it subtly observes the virtues and vices of mortals below.
When mortals create virtue for three years,
Heaven does not wait a thousand days before bestowing blessings and auspiciousness;
when mortals commit evil for a thousand days,
Heaven does not wait three years before sending calamity.

Worldly people do not know that the most responsive and luminous entity among all things is themselves—
their original spirit/qi (*yuánshén*) penetrates Heaven and Earth with radiant clarity.
The sages and worthies of old were all those who attained the Dao/Way and cultivated true essence (*xiùzhēn*),*
transforming from the ordinary to the enlightened.

In the Western lands, from one Buddha to the twenty-eighth lineage,
before the Buddhas cultivated the Way,
they were all sentient beings—
with pure six senses and bright five eyes,*
extinguishing the four outward forms,*
they were called Buddhas.

The Buddha is the nature of humanity.
Nature is spirit/qi, spirit/qi is nature—
only differing in name.
The Buddhist school (*shìmén*) calls nature without the four outward forms a Buddha;
the Daoist school (*dàomén*) calls spirit/qi that forgets the four outward forms an Immortal (*xiān*).

The sun and moon follow their ordained cycles,
great and small have fixed limits.
From this, the sages’ virtues arise,
and the brilliance of the divine manifests.»

「The sun and moon follow their ordained cycles—
on the summer solstice, daylight lasts sixty *kè* and gradually diminishes,
as one *yin* begins to form;
on the winter solstice, daylight lasts forty *kè* and gradually increases,
as one *yang* arises.
At the *mǎo* hour, the sun is born from the Eastern Sea,
and at the *yǒu* hour, it sets behind the Western Mountains.

*The Scripture of Purity and Stillness* states:
*The Great Dao is without sentiment,*
yet it governs the sun and moon in their cycles.
The sun is the radiant light of wisdom (*huìguāng*) in motion,
its waxing and waning measured by the Dao’s decree;
the moon is the essence of human life (*yīngmìng*).

At sixteen, a man’s *yin-yang* essence reaches its fullness—
the true gold of sixty-four *guà* (hexagrams).
If he fails to awaken to the Dao’s lack of sentiment (*wúqíng*),
three years pass, and one *liǎng* (unit) of essence diminishes,
until the sixty-four *guà* are exhausted at eighty-eight,
when the kidney sea (*shèn hǎi*) withers away.
Excessive desire drains the essence prematurely,
cutting short one’s lifespan;
restrained desire preserves it,
lengthening one’s years.
When fullness turns to depletion (*yíng ér kuī*), death follows;
when perfection remains unbroken (*yuán ér bù quē*), life endures.
Great and small have fixed limits—
the great is the Dao (*dào*), which encompasses heaven and earth;
the small is the subtle (*wēi*), whose mysteries penetrate even the finest hairs.
In motion, it transcends heaven and earth’s measure;
in application, it eludes the perception of spirits and gods.
Yet naturally, it is fixed within the inch-square heart (*fāngcùn*).
From this, the sages’ virtues arise—
the Dao of heaven.

Heaven’s great grace (*yīngmìng*) is born,
nourishing humanity and sustaining form.
The Dao’s virtues arise, saving people and cultivating true essence (*xiūzhēn*).
The divine brilliance (*shénmíng*) manifests—
hidden, it roams through the Three Palaces (*sāngōng*);
revealed, it permeates the Eight Extremes (*bābiāo*).
Its stolen mechanism (*dàoqì*) is unseen by all under heaven,
unknowable by all under heaven.
The virtuous one attains it and endures poverty (*gùqióng*);
the petty one seizes it and risks his life (*qīngmìng*).
Its stolen mechanism is the mechanism of all things.
What is stolen is the *qi* of heaven and earth—
unseen by all under heaven,
unknowable even by heaven’s great grace (*yīngmìng*).

The foolish know only that they can nourish their own bodies,
yet fail to recognize heaven’s bestowed grace (*tiānchuí’ēn*) that nurtures all people.
Spring planting, autumn harvest,
summer gathering, winter storing—
in response to the seasons, frost and snow, rain and dew,
they foster and enrich all transformations.
Those who understand heaven’s grace (*tiān’ēn*) possess a nature that is clear and penetrating (*tōngmíng*).

The virtuous one attains it and endures poverty,
for poverty leads to the Dao (*qióng tōngdào*).
When the Dao is understood, heaven and earth become transparent (*tiāndì tōng*).
When heaven and earth are transparent, all transformations are clear (*wànhuà tōng*).
When all transformations are clear, the divine is luminous (*shéntōng*).
The divine luminous responds to all mechanisms (*yìngjī qī wànbiàn*),
embracing unity without separation (*bàoyī wúlí*).
Thus, he rests in perfection (*zànrán yízhēn*), returning to the origin.

The petty one seizes it and risks his life,
for when the petty one gains it, he deceives heaven and earth,
disrespects the virtuous and the wise,
ignores the laws of the land,
lacks benevolence and righteousness,
strengthens himself while weakening others,
harms creatures and injures people.
When his crimes reach their extreme (*qiānjí*), heaven’s retribution follows.

The virtuous one values nature and attains communion with the wise and the divine (*tōngxiánshèng*);
the petty one risks his life and falls into the fate of lesser beings (*bàngshēng*).

**On the Chapter of Military Strategy and the Art of Victory**

The blind excel in hearing,
the deaf excel in sight.
Cutting off one source of profit (*jué lì yī yuán*),
one’s teacher’s (*shī*) effectiveness is tenfold;
turning back three times through day and night (*sān fǎn zhòuyè*),
one’s teacher’s effectiveness is ten-thousandfold.

The blind excel in hearing—
the human moon is the window through which the five *zàng* (viscera) perceive.
When the *fēng* (wind) circulates, it reveals external things.
Like a breeze through paper screens,
separated as if by the blind,
external things cannot be seen.
When external sights do not enter within,
the void within holds true resonance and clarity—
thus, the blind hear the soundless sound.

The deaf excel in sight—
yet when the world’s coarse *qi* reaches the ears, it is like deafness;
when Daoist reflection reaches the ears, even hearing perverse speech is like deafness.
Selecting the proper principle (*zhènglǐ*), the ear’s aperture becomes clear.
Like light piercing through a drilled wall,
illumination enters within.
Seeing the formless form,
one attains the marvel of indistinct clarity (*mínghuǎng*).
Cutting off one source of profit,
one forgets greed and achieves purity (*wàngtān ér qīngpíng*).
It also extinguishes profit and hoards no wealth,
reducing excess while benefiting deficiency (*sǔnyǔ ér huì bùzú*).
One’s teacher’s effectiveness is tenfold—
until one attains full clarity (*zhànmíng*), tenfold the merit.
Nurturing creatures and loving people,
one gains tenfold blessings.

Turning back three times through day and night—
the first reversal is at the *shàngyuán* (upper solstice), bestowing grace (*cìfú*).
The *qi* descends, and clarity arises.
The second reversal is at the *zhōngyuán* (middle solstice), absolving sins (*shèzuì*).
The divine shifts, and its power becomes luminous (*shén yì ér líng*).
The third reversal is at the *xiàyuán* (lower solstice), dissolving calamity and connecting fate (*jiě è mìngtōng*).
The *yin* transforms into *yang*.

One’s teacher’s effectiveness is ten-thousandfold—
for when the world engages in commerce,
all suffer countless hardships,
yet even doubling their profit is difficult.
Awakening to the Dao and cultivating true essence (*wùdào xiūzhēn*),
one preserves his nature and life (*quán qí xìngmìng*),
attaining boundless blessings and longevity (*fúshòu*).
He dwells in the Immortal’s Palace (*xiāngōng*), rich in treasures (*bǎosuǒ*),
receives heaven’s honors and earth’s nobility (*shòu tiānshàng fùguì*).
By analogy, when one seeks blessings and profit,
he attains ten-thousandfold—
transforming the sea into mulberry fields,
dwelling eternally in the land of endless day (*bùyè zhī xiāng*),
where true joy surpasses even ten-thousandfold profit.

---
The mind is born from things,
dies from things—
the mechanism lies in the eyes.
The mind is born from things,
attaching to external forms;
it dies from the mind—
for death is communion with the spirit-form (*língwù*).
Seeking life leads one’s nature into the path of death (*xìng guī sǐlù*),
while attaining the Dao guards death (*shǒu sǐ*),
and the divine roams the path of life (*shén yóu shēnglù*).
The Dao’s life and the world’s life,
the Dao’s death and the world’s death,
are contrary in form.

The mechanism lies in external sights—
the eyes perceive things,
and the mind stirs at the mechanism.
Profit brings harm,
greed invites conflict.
The enlightened eyes see spirit-forms (*língwù*),
discerning heaven’s mechanisms (*tiānqì*).
Understanding the Dao’s subtle essence (*dào yào miào*),
one transcends the duality of self and other (*wùwǒ jù míng*).

Worldly mechanisms benefit oneself,
yet harm others;
Daoist mechanisms harm oneself,
yet benefit others.
Heaven’s grace is without grace,
yet great grace arises.

Swift thunder and fierce winds
move all things in their course (*mòbù shǔnrán*).
Heaven’s grace is without possession—
it disperses *qi* to give birth to things,
yet does not claim them.
Yet great grace arises,
as all things flourish in their formation (*wànwù shēngchéng*).
Without heaven and earth’s *qi*,
all things cannot manifest and take form (*zàohuà*).
Heaven’s great grace, though without possession,
is like grace without expectation of return (*tiān bù wàng qí bào*).
Human grace, when seen, expects return (*rén huì jiàn qí yǒu*).
Heaven’s grace and human grace differ.

Swift thunder roars, and sweet rain descends—
heaven and earth sprout with life;
fierce winds stir, and floating clouds disperse—
ten thousand miles of clear sky.
All things move in their course (*shǔnrán*).
This movement abandons the lifeless (*shě líng*),
for creatures born of eggs, seeds, or dampness (*péiluǎn shīhuà*)
all receive heaven’s singular *qi* to manifest.
How much more so for all things that are formless and lifeless?

---
The utmost joy lies in nature’s excess (*xìngyú*),
the utmost stillness lies in nature’s restraint (*xìnglián*).
Constant joy comes from the Dao’s nature without excess (*dào xìng zhī wúyú*),
disgust with the body’s nature of excess (*yàn shēnshì zhī yǒuyú*).
When I have no joy, there is no sorrow (*wǒ wú xǐ zé wú yōu*),
yet when others rejoice, they also know grief (*rén yǒu huān zé yǒu chóu*).
Awakening to tranquility and simplicity (*wù tián dàn*),
one attains the eternal truth (*dé zhī zhēncháng*);」

The lost in sound and color,
lose themselves in phantom dreams.

The utmost stillness is nature’s restraint (*xìnglián*),
and when stillness is complete, it pervades all things.
Nature’s restraint is like the lotus—
unattached to water.

Those who grasp the Dao dwell amid dust yet remain unstained,
in desire yet without desire.
Like polishing a treasure mirror,
what hindrance are the forms and shadows of things?

Yet there are those who, failing to penetrate the middle path,
mistake fleeting stillness for ultimate truth—
discarding the real for the illusory,
clinging to nothingness while rejecting all.
They boast of Dao’s subtleties like weeds in the world.

As the *Tàishàng Dàodéjīng* says:
*"The virtuous do not speak beautifully,
the beautiful do not speak virtuously."*
True Daoist speech is unadorned,
while false teachings dazzle with ornament.
Those who love beauty’s clarity
are ensnared by deceit,
unable to reach the Great Way.

Heaven’s utmost privacy is its utmost fairness.
Heaven bestows its grace unseen—
the utmost privacy;
yet its nurturing sustains the world—
the utmost fairness.

The Daoist is like jade hidden in stone:
the world’s dull eyes see no treasure,
yet with ceaseless polishing, one day
the work is complete—
a body beyond the body,
crude clay refined into a noble vessel.

The unenlightened are like rotten wood:
Heaven’s eye sees the axe and saw,
and in an instant, decay consumes them—
their souls scattered, their filth trapped in darkness forever.

In a degenerate age, the Daoist endures hardship,
yet sweetness follows suffering;
the wicked reap ruin,
as calamities descend upon them.

Heaven’s will reverses the perverse,
and aligns the upright.
The sage above reveres virtue and the Dao—
Heaven’s reward is swift, private yet public.
The petty below compete for wealth and desire—
Heaven’s retribution is first public, then private.

The nature of birds lies in *qi*.
Among all birds, the South Mountain’s crimson phoenix prevails.
It absorbs the light, clear *qi*—
its spirit soars into the ninth heaven.
When *qi* is turbid, it sinks to earth;
when pure, it ascends to heaven—
descending from the low to rise with the clear.

The tortoise draws from the Northern Sea’s *yuan qi*,
exhaling eight hundred and ten *zhang* of light, pure essence—
the ninefold yang number.
The bird’s three-inch *chōnghé* aligns with *yuan qi*,
never dispersing.
*Qi* communicates with spirit,
spirit with the Dao,
the Dao with nature.

Life is the root of death,
death the root of life.
Grace arises from harm,
harm from grace.
Life is the root of death—
the world’s obsession with life prolongs suffering,
excessive gain brings ruin,
leading to the path of death.
Death is the root of life—
embracing the Dao without clinging to life,
virtue preserves the body,
entering the path of life.

The deluded hoard worldly treasures by day,
yet lose their inner essence by night;
the awakened forget the world,
dreaming while guarding their true self within.

Grace arises from harm—
the seven emotions foster false pity,
the six demons secretly harm the true.
Harm arises from grace—
harm’s wisdom cuts desire like a blade,
while enlightenment recognizes Heaven’s grace.

The *yú* bird eats without harming,
the *chún* bird dwells without attachment.

The foolish revere Heaven and Earth’s patterns as sacred.
I see the patterns of time and things as profound.

The foolish lose their lives,
pleading to Heaven for safety,
daily accumulating sins,
praying to the sage for blessings.
The wise know to preserve life—
their virtue is self-nourishing,
their guiltless nature invites Heaven’s abundant grace.

When people are filthy and wicked,
Heaven and Earth bring calamity.
When people are pure and good,
the sages bestow blessings.

All beings on Earth persist in unrepentant deeds.
Praying to sages cannot escape ten thousand calamities.
The Chinese people, male and female, revere the true with resolve—
they do not petition Heaven and Earth;
their blessings are ever encroached upon.

I see the patterns of time and things as profound.
Through the twelve celestial hours, I fathom all transformations,
refining brilliance to display ten thousand hues,
clarifying principles to reveal ten thousand paths,
perfecting wisdom to elucidate ten thousand changes—
naturally serene, effortless, and without action.
This is the Dao.

The pure is Heaven,
the still is Earth,
the void is the essence of nature and the Dao.
Action is bestowing grace without expecting return.
The creation of all things mirrors human creation.

Heaven and Earth circulate *qi*—
things undergo transformation.
Lead refined in a jade cauldron
is mercury purified in a golden furnace.
Seven returns awaken the spirit,
nine elixirs complete the alchemy—
the maiden of the Vermilion Chamber
is the infant of the Black Hut.
The tortoise and serpent coil,
the dragon and tiger roar.
The Vermilion Bird leads,
the Black Tortoise follows,
the Metal Elder guards *gēngxīn*,
the Yellow Mother accompanies *jiǎyǐ*.
Dredging gold from the great sea
is carving jade from Kunlun.
The yellow sprout grows,
the white snow forms.
The jade flower blooms,
the golden lotus takes shape.
The three luminaries shine,
the seven treasures gleam.
The two eights are unbroken,
the six threes are complete.
Metal and wood are separated,
water and fire meet.
In confusion, hidden and revealed are indistinguishable—
the workings of the Dao.
