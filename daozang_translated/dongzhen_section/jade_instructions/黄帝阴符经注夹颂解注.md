**Preface to the *Yellow Emperor’s Yinfu Jing* with Interlinear Commentary and Exegesis**

*"Heaven follows humanity, humanity follows Heaven"*—this is the purpose of the *Yinfu Jing*.

In antiquity, the Yellow Emperor, earnest in his devotion to the Dao, ascended Mount Kongtong to pay homage to Guangchengzi and inquire about the ultimate Way, receiving the secret precepts of returning to eternal life. Later, upon Mount Emei, he again paid homage to Huangren, who imparted the *Wuyaya-Sanyi* scriptures, which he kept secret and cultivated, thereby ascending to the highest immortality. Worried that future generations might lose the true teachings, he composed the *Yinfu Jing* in three sections—upper, middle, and lower—to correspond with the Three Powers (*san cai*), elucidating the marvels of *jing* (essence), *qi*, and *shen* (spirit) in their utmost refinement.

Yet fearing that mortals might not grasp the principle of return, he first declared: *"Observe the Dao of Heaven, grasp Heaven’s movements, and exhaust them."* This is the overarching framework of the three sections of the *Yinfu Jing*.

To know the Dao of Heaven, one must know the Dao of humanity;
to know the Dao of humanity, one must know the Dao of the Elixir (*dandao*);
to know the Dao of the Elixir, one must grasp the mechanics of yin-yang motion and stillness;
to grasp those mechanics, one must know the principles of internal and external return.

Knowing these principles, one refines lead and mercury without missing the proper moment, and governs the elixir fire without failing to observe its signs. As the text states: *"Cutting off the single source of profit, the adept’s effort is tenfold; three returns of day and night, the adept’s effort is ten-thousandfold."* This further teaches that the essence of cultivating the True lies in maintaining an unshaken resolve to gather and refine the mind and body, and secondarily, in applying unremitting *chou-tian* (withdrawal and addition) techniques without interruption.

The Way of *Quanzhen* is nothing else:
First, *jing* must be complete;
Second, *qi* must be complete;
Third, *shen* must be complete.

Fixing the gaze refines the spirit;
returning the hearing refines the essence;
sealing the speech refines the *qi*.

When these three completions and three truths are realized, they naturally merge within, and the True Fire polishes the embryo, forming a golden fetus. After ten months of work, yin is exhausted and yang is pure. At this moment, the fetus is shed, the spirit transforms, and the adept manifests without bounds, transcending birth and death to become an indestructible golden body—this is what is meant by *huan dan* (returning the Elixir).

I say that this text is concise yet profound in meaning. Those who fail to comprehend its teachings may seek explanations externally, straying from the Dao, and thus incur the guilt of presumption and madness. Therefore, I have sequentially explicated each passage of the Master’s secret precepts, supplemented with verse and verification, revealing the hidden mechanisms, awaiting those of like mind. I do not presume to exhaust the subject, but hope this may serve as an aid for beginners.

**The *Yin Fu Jing* Exegesis by Master Róngrán Zǐ Wáng Dàoyuán**

**Preface by Master Róngrán Zǐ Wáng Dàoyuán of Nánchāng’s Xiū River**

*"Heaven begets, heaven slays—this is the Dao’s principle.*
*In worldly terms, heaven begets yang, heaven slays yin. One yin, one yang—this is the Dao; one begetting, one slaying—this is principle.*

*Heaven begets in spring, when all things arise from yang—this is Heaven’s *ren* (benevolence).
*Heaven slays in autumn, when all things withdraw into yin—this is Heaven’s *yì* (righteousness).
*The waxing and waning of yin and yang—this is the Dao’s principle.*

*Thus, the Sage observes Heaven’s Dao, holds principle in mind, and governs the people with *wuwei* (non-action)—this is the Sage’s *ren*.
*He establishes the Five Punishments to harmonize the laws of the world—this is the Sage’s *yì*.
*The embodiment and function of *ren* and *yì*—this is the Sage’s Dao.*

*Speaking of Dao’s application: whenever the Winter Solstice arrives within one’s body, one must seal the pass and attain stillness, disperse the mind into fire, refine essence into *qi*, and advance the yang fire upward from the *Tai Xuang Gong* (Supreme Darkness Palace) to the *Nan Gong* (Southern Palace)—this is the principle of Heaven’s begetting.
*From this point onward, as yang reaches its peak and declines, a single yin arises beneath the five yangs, and one must then gather yang and withdraw the *Yin Fu* (Yin Symbol).
*Descending from the Jade Mountain to the Upper Capital, then to the Heavy Tower, sending it to the *Kun* position and halting—here, the martial fire is kindled to temper yin into yang—this is the principle of Heaven’s slaying.
*To circulate this within the body, continuous as if ever-present—is this not the Dao’s principle?

*Master Shao said:*
*‘When Qian meets Xun, observe the Moon Cavern;
When Earth meets Thunder, tread upon the Heavenly Root.’
*The Heavenly Root and Moon Cavern drift in leisure—
Thirty-six palaces are all spring.*

*Thus it is said:*
*‘The yang dragon and yin tiger coil in rotation,
Heaven’s hidden mechanisms of life and death unfold naturally.
Refined, the true seed of One-Nine emerges,
Within the vessel, spring overflows—Dao eternal.’*

**Heaven and Earth are the thieves of all things;
All things are thieves of humanity;
Humanity is the thief of all things.**

*Heaven and Earth are the thieves of all things*—this means Heaven and Earth generate all things, and the life and form of all things are formed by the interplay of yin and yang’s transformation. At every thought and impulse, Heaven and Earth know.
*Those who do good are protected by ghosts and spirits;
Those who do evil are struck by thunder and punishment*—this is how Heaven and Earth govern all things.

*All things are thieves of humanity*—this means all things arise alongside humanity, and within the human body dwell eighty-four thousand worms. Briefly stated: internally, the five viscera are consumed by *qí* and *huí* worms; externally, the skin is attacked by lice and fleas. As *Tan Jing Sheng*’s *Book of Transformation* says:
*‘The worms that camp within the belly
Plunder my vital *qi*, melt my spirit-soul,
Steal my flavors, yet live by them.’*
This is how all things steal from humanity.

*Humanity is the thief of all things*—this means humanity is the most refined of all things, encompassing within one mind the principles of all things. It learns from Heaven and Earth to know transformation, from spiders to weave nets, from bees to establish hierarchy, from moles to institute rites, from phoenixes to compose music, from ants to arrange armies. The Sage can take the principles of all things and perfect them within the self—this is how humanity steals from all things.

*In summary, the generation of Heaven, Earth, and humanity all lies within the Great Transformation. Forms steal from forms, things deceive things—none of this is outside the influence of yin and yang, the Five Phases’ *qi*. Only the Daoist, who comprehends the Three Thefts and transcends yin and yang, is free from the Three Corpses’ plunder.*

*Students should ponder this deeply.*

*Ode:*
*Heaven, Earth, and humanity share in all things’ birth,
Each family, each orifice holds its own spirit.
Forms steal from forms through yin and yang’s transformation—
The enlightened transcend the mundane, entering the Supreme Clarity.
The Three Thefts are resolved, the Three Powers are at peace.*

*This follows the earlier discussion of the Three Thefts, thus it says:*
*The Three Thefts resolved, the Three Powers secure*—this refers to the enlightened one, whose single nature illuminates all principles, who can discern that the body’s four elements are but yin and yang, the Five Phases’ *qi*, artificially combined. Unbound by form, one secretly practices the Symbol Fire to refine form and spirit. When spirit condenses and *qi* solidifies, this is the Golden Elixir’s great medicine, capable of slaying the Three Corpses’ worms. Once the Three Thefts are extinguished, the Three Powers naturally settle.

*As Master Shao said:*
*‘Having known all things are within me,
Why would I separately establish the Three Powers?’*

*Zhang Zǐyáng said:*
*‘Pursue the Two *Qi* along the Yellow Path,
Unite the Three Natures in the Primordial Palace.
When spirit is whole, there is no need for sleep;
When *qi* is whole, there is no need for food;
When essence is whole, there is no need for desire.
When practice reaches this point, how could the Three Powers be unstable?’*

*Ode:*
*The Three Thefts and Three Powers are complete within the body,
The Heart-Sovereign turns all things, each returning to root.
When Heaven and Earth’s positions are fixed, demons are subdued,
The myriad lands enjoy peace under the Sage’s grace.*

*Thus it is said:*
*‘Eat in season, and the hundred limbs harmonize.
Stir the mechanism, and all transformations settle.’*

*This further elaborates on the Three Powers being secure, thus it says:*
*‘Eat in season, and the hundred limbs harmonize’*—this means the practitioner must daily regulate the five viscera, ensuring meals are taken at their proper times. If no time is lost, then the three hundred sixty bones and blood-*qi* flow unimpeded throughout the body, with no place unnourished, and illness cannot arise. Having secured bodily health, one can then nurture spirit and embrace *qi*, dwelling eternally in the Central Field, drawing from the *Hua Chi* (Flower Pond) and *Yu Ye* (Jade Liquid) to irrigate the sacred root—its shoots will naturally flourish.
*As Laozi said:*
*‘When the Dao prevails in the world, even warhorses are used for manure—
I alone differ from others, valuing the Mother’s nourishment.’*

*‘Stir the mechanism, and all transformations settle’*—this means when the first yang stirs, one must immediately turn the Dipper’s handle to respond to it. Each practice of the Dao will make the myriad spirits within the body feel at ease.*"

「The Pure Yang True Person’s *Alchemical Poems* state:
*Within the vast Dao of Heaven and Earth, alone I dwell,
From head to toe, each step refines the Primordial Essence’s work.
With nimble skill, I wield the Dipper’s Cross,
Boldly overturning the Southern Star’s mechanism—my *qi* as fierce as steel.*

*When the myriad spirits wail and demons lament, the golden cauldron cracks,
As roosters take flight and dogs dissolve, the jade furnace stands empty.*

*How can the common man seek such ordinary ways?
The Dao’s subtleties are boundless—its mysteries fathomless.*

*The *Alchemical Canon* says:
*‘Deliberate well—this is wondrous indeed!
Each dawn, I urge the *Zi Xia* [Purple Cloud] Cup to rise.’*

*If one binds the Earthly *Po* [embryo/soul] with precision,
The Heavenly *Hun* [ethereal soul] will naturally come to bless longevity.*

*Thus it is said.*

*Praise:
*To cultivate the True, one must balance food and breath.
A single *qi* harmonizes the Five Organs, cleansing them all.
The Golden Elixir refines the form, the Divine Fire tempers the spirit—
Every pore in the body radiates brilliance.*

*Men know the spirit’s spirit,
But fail to grasp the source of the non-spirit’s spirit.*

*The spirit, for its name, is *Ling* [numinous],
And *Xing* [inherent nature].*

*Before the parents were born, its beginning was not known;
After the parents were born, its end was not seen.*

*Most numinous, most sacred,
Most profound, most subtle—
It encompasses all forms,
It encompasses all spirits,
Unborn, unending,
Neither square nor round.*

*Thus the Pure and True True Person said:
*‘This spirit is not the spirit of deliberation,
But one that stands equal with the Primordial Origin.’*

*This passage speaks of how the student’s daily cultivation must first focus on clarifying inherent nature.
Within the heart-mind, one must always maintain purity and stillness,
Never allowing even a thread of private desire to obstruct it,
Nor clinging to forms while seeking the mysterious.*

*If one merely conjures an intention,
The spirit ceases to be spirit.*

*The *Sutra* says:
*‘The human spirit loves clarity, yet the heart disturbs it—
The spirit’s full brilliance lies in the heart’s emptiness, profound silence, and containing the True.
It shares its essence with the Great Void,
Its luminosity with the sun and moon.’*

*In all interactions with affairs and beings,
One must let inherent nature respond spontaneously,
Turning with the natural flow—
Thus the Three Realms are traversed in harmony,
And this is why one does not know the non-spirit’s source of spirit.*

*The True Person said:
*‘It cannot be seen, yet when called, it responds.’*

*The *Diamond Sutra* declares:
*‘If one seeks the Tathāgata through form and appearance,
Or through sound and voice,
They tread the wrong path and cannot see the Buddha.’*

*These words are complete.*

*Praise:
*A single point of Primordial Spirit is the ultimate numinous.
When the spirit knows itself, it is no longer true.
If one awakens to the spirit’s empty essence,
The resplendent void shines without a trace of cloud.*

*The sun and moon have their cycles,
The small and great have their limits.
From here arise the sacred works,
From here emerge the divine luminosities.*

*This follows the previous explanation of clarifying inherent nature,
And now reveals the method of cultivating life.*

*Having secured the dwelling of inherent nature,
One must then attend to the life-gate.*

*If one can cultivate both inherent nature and life,
Only then does the form and spirit attain perfect harmony.*

*The method of cultivating life is such:
The student may observe the Dao of Heaven,
Where the sun and moon revolve, marking the Winter and Summer Solstices,
And the Yin-Yang equilibrium at the Spring and Autumn Equinoxes.
Days accumulate into months,
Months accumulate into years—
Thus the sun and moon have their cycles,
And the small and great have their limits.*

*Has it not been heard?
The sun belongs to Yang, the moon to Yin;
The moon itself has no light, but borrows the sun’s.*

*At the month’s dark and new phases,
The Great Yin and Great Yang meet in the same palace,
And the moon, at this time, is dark and without light;
From the second to the third day, the moon gradually departs from the sun,
And the sun’s light shines upon it, generating a small brilliance—
The *Hun* grows, the *Po* diminishes.*

*By the eighth day, night and day share equal light—
This is called the Upper Crescent.*
*From here onward, until the fifteenth day at night,
The moon faces the sun, its light full and great—
At this point, the *Hun* reaches its peak, and the *Po* emerges.*

*From the sixteenth to the seventeenth days onward,
The *Po* grows, the *Hun* fades,
And the moon’s light gradually wanes.*

*By the twenty-third day at night,
The light is equally divided below—
This is called the Lower Crescent.*
*From here, until the thirtieth day at night,
The moon’s light fades completely, returning once more to darkness.*

*Thus it cycles endlessly, without end—
A natural and effortless movement of Heaven’s Dao.*
*Therefore, the great cultivator applies this principle within his own body,
And refines the *Fire Elucidation* [周天火候] of the Heavenly Cycle.*

*The sun and moon spoken of here are the spirit and *qi*,
Water and Fire,
Lead and Mercury,
And inherent nature and emotions.*

*When making the elixir,
One must merge spirit with *qi*,
Consolidating its foundation within,
And letting the spirit soar forth in the *Yin* [Tiger] Hour.
By the *Shen* [Monkey] Hour, one must increase the fire,
As the sun’s light shines upon the moon—
Gradually, the brilliance grows and strengthens.*

*The essence transforms into *qi*,
Directly entering the *Cinnabar Field* [泥丸],
As the moon faces the sun—
Following this, Yin emerges,
And according to the *Green Maiden Transmission* [《青女传》],
The elixir is withdrawn into the Earthly Palace,
Where the sun and moon join as one—
The elixir begins to form, small at first,
But with deep cultivation, it grows great—
Thus it is said: ‘The sun and moon have their cycles,
And the small and great have their limits.’*

*Diligently gather, diligently refine,
Timely cook and temper—
The True Embryo flourishes,
Wisdom and insight open wide—
Thus it is said: ‘From here arise the sacred works,
From here emerge the divine luminosities.’*

*Praise:
*The sun and moon cycle endlessly, their work applied—
The elixir’s essence is born from the *Dharma-qi* [梵气].*
*From the subtle to the manifest, the spirit transcends the sacred,
And within the fire, lotuses bloom one by one.*

*As for stealing the mechanism,
No one in the world can see or know it.*
*The noble man attains it and secures his body,
The petty man gains it and risks his life.*

*This follows the previous explanation of refining the sun and moon within one’s body,
And thus attaining the sacred works and divine luminosities—
Hence it is said:*

*‘The stealing here refers not to the worldly thievery of common men,
But to the method of refining the Heavenly Cycle’s elixir-fire—
In a single breath’s time, one can surpass a year’s transformation of Heaven and Earth.’*

*The *Alchemical Canon* says:
*‘When the Five Phases flow in order,
A tiger emerges from water;
When the Five Phases are inverted,
A dragon arises from fire.’*

*Those who practice this Dao
Cannot be confined by Heaven and Earth,
Nor bound by the *Bazi* [六十甲子, sixty-year Heavenly Stem-Earthly Branch cycle].*
*Thus, the great cultivator is a thief beyond Heaven and Earth.’*

Zhang Wǔyáng said:

*"The practice is easy, but the medicine is not distant—
Is this not the very essence of the ‘thief’s method’?*

This ‘thief’s method’ is supremely simple, yet supremely subtle—
It is the form without form, the image without image.
Thus, none under Heaven can see it, none can know it.

The noble one who attains it
Is humble, retiring, and unassuming,
Nurtures simplicity and preserves authenticity;
Discards sharp intellect, relying solely on virtue as his body;
Diminishes further, blending with the mundane and dust;
Responds naturally to all that comes, without joy or anger.
He never flaunts his Dao—
This is how he holds it close to his essence.

As *Laozi* says:
*'I have three treasures, guarding and preserving them:
First, compassion;
Second, frugality;
Third, not daring to lead the world.'*
And again:
*'The highest virtue is without virtue—
Thus, it is truly virtuous.'*

The petty one, if he attains this Dao,
Will instead flaunt it, unable to conceal himself.
He grows arrogant, self-aggrandizing,
Boasting and vainglorious,
Deceiving others and scornful of the Way,
Completely without restraint,
With shallow virtue and shallow conduct—
All despise him.

Such a man has never failed to court harm
And risk his life—
Like Páng Juān’s kind.

The *Classical Text* says:
*'Those who praise themselves are blind,
Those who insist on being right are unilluminated,
Those who boast of their achievements gain no merit,
Those who brag of their virtue do not endure,
The overbearing meet no natural end.'*

Confucius thus said:
*'The petty one reverses the Mean—
The petty one has no restraint.'*

Is this not true speech?
The student should carefully examine this.

「The *Preface* states:
The *Burning Mountain* [1] seals the Dao of Heaven’s theft,
The *Great Symbol* [2] hides the subtle mysteries of the Way.
The virtuous one attains it and retreats to preserve himself,
While the petty one, once he gains it, acts recklessly.

*Yellow Emperor’s Obscure Precepts* [3]—*Interpretation of the Interspersed Precepts*—[4] therein concludes:
*Yellow Emperor’s Obscure Precepts* [3]—*Interpretation of the Interspersed Precepts*—[4]—[5] *Master Rúndàoyuān* of *Nánchāng Xiūjiāng* [6] annotates:
Heaven’s birth and Heaven’s death are the Way’s principle.
Speaking in terms of worldly law,
Heaven’s birth is *yang* [7], Heaven’s death is *yin* [8];
One *yin* and one *yang* is called the Way,
One birth and one death is called principle.

Heaven’s birth occurs in spring,
When all things arise from *yang*—Heaven’s benevolence;
Heaven’s death occurs in autumn,
When all things withdraw into *yin*—Heaven’s righteousness.
The ebb and flow of *yin* and *yang* are the Way’s principle.

Thus, the sage observes Heaven’s Way,
Holds principle within his heart,
And transforms the people of the world through non-action—this is the sage’s benevolence;
With the five punishments [9], he harmonizes the laws of the world—this is the sage’s righteousness.
Benevolence and righteousness in essence and application are the sage’s Way.

Speaking in terms of application,
When one encounters the winter solstice [10] within his body,
He must close the gate [11] and remain still,
Sending his mind aloft to transform fire,
Refining essence into *qi*,
Advancing the *yang* fire,
From the *Tàixuān Palace* [12] drawing upward to the *Nán Palace* [13]—this is Heaven’s birth principle.

Once this is done, the *yang* reaches its peak and declines,
So when one *yin* arises beneath the five *yang*,
He must withdraw the *yang* and suppress the *Obscure Precept* of *yin*.
From *Yùshān* [14] descending to *Chónglóu* [15],
Conveying it to the *Kūn* [16] position and halting,
Igniting the *Martial Fire* [17] to temper and refine,
Cooking *yin* into *yang*—this is Heaven’s death principle.

Cultivating within one’s body,
Continuously as if sustained—
Is this not the Way’s principle?

*Master Shào* [18] says:
When *Qián* [19] meets *Xùn* [20], observe the *Moon Cavern* [21];
When earth encounters *léi* [22], tread upon Heaven’s root.
Heaven’s root and Moon Cavern come and go at leisure,
Thirty-six palaces [23] are all spring.
This is what is meant.

The *Preface* states:
The *yang* dragon and *yin* tiger intertwine in circles,
Heaven’s birth and death principles unfold naturally.
Refining yields the *One Nine* [24] true seed,
A caldron full of spring—Dao stretches endlessly.

Heaven and Earth are the thieves of all things;
All things are thieves of man;
Man is the thief of all things.
Heaven and Earth are the thieves of all things—
This means Heaven and Earth generate all things,
And the vitality of all things,
None escape the *yin-yang* transformations that form their bodies.
Every thought and intention—Heaven and Earth know them all.
Doing good brings protection from spirits and gods;
Doing evil invites punishment by thunder and lightning—
This is how Heaven and Earth treat all things.

All things are thieves of man—
This means all things arise alongside man,
And within the human body, eight thousand four hundred insects [25] thrive.
Speaking briefly,
Internally, the five viscera [26] are consumed by *wēngzhì* [27] worms,
Externally, the skin is attacked by fleas and lice.
As *Tán Jǐngshēng*’s *Book of Transformation* [28] says:
*Wēngzhì* [29] insects, the worms of the belly,
Struggle with my *qi* and essence,
Melt my spirit and soul,
Steal my nourishment,
And yet sustain their own lives.
This is how all things steal from man.

Man is the thief of all things—
This means man is the most refined of all things,
One mind encompassing the principles of all things,
Learning from Heaven and Earth to know transformations,
Learning from the *spider* to weave nets,
Learning from the *bee* to establish hierarchy,
Learning from the *gopher* to create rituals,
Learning from the *phoenix* to compose music,
Learning from the *ant* to arrange armies and formations.
The sage can extract the principles of all things to perfect himself—
This is how man steals from all things.

In summary,
The birth of Heaven, Earth, and man,
All lie within the Great Transformation [30],
Each form stealing from another,
Each thing deceiving another,
None but the *yin-yang* and Five Phases *qi* [31] acting thus.
Only the Daoist who understands the Three Thefts [32],
Transcending beyond *yin-yang*,
Will escape the harm of the Three Corpses [33] stealing from him.
The student should ponder this well.

The *Preface* states:
Heaven, Earth, and man share the birth of all things,
Each family and orifice holds its own spirit.
Forms steal from forms through *yin-yang* transformations,
The enlightened transcend the mundane to enter *Tàiqīng* [34].
The Three Thefts [35] being understood,
The Three Powers [36] are at peace.
This follows the previous discourse on the Three Thefts,
Therefore it says:
When the Three Thefts are understood,
The Three Powers are at peace—
This refers to the Daoist,
Whose singular nature is awakened and illuminated,
Whose myriad principles are unified,
Who can discern that the body’s Four Great Elements [37]
Are but *yin-yang* and Five Phases *qi* falsely combined.
He is not bound by form,
But secretly practices the *Obscure Precept* fire
To refine body and spirit.
When spirit condenses and *qi* solidifies,
This is called the *Great Elixir* [38],
A medicine capable of annihilating the Three Corpses [33].
Once the Three Thefts are extinguished,
The Three Powers naturally rest.

As *Master Shào* says:
When one knows all things are complete within me,
Why would he separately establish the Three Powers?

*Zhāng Zǐyáng* [39] thus said:
*"Chasing the Two Qì [40] along the Yellow Dao [41],
Uniting the Three Natures [42] in the Primordial Palace [43],
The spirit is whole and does not crave sleep,
The *qi* is whole and does not crave food,
The essence is whole and does not crave desire—
When cultivation reaches this point,
What fear is there that the Three Powers will not be at peace?"*

The *Preface* states:
The Three Thefts and Three Powers are complete within one’s body,
The heart—*sovereign*—[44] turns and governs all things, each returning to its root.
*Qián* and *Kūn* [45] secure their positions, demons and evils are subdued,
The myriad lands are in harmony, bearing the sage’s grace.
Thus it is said:
*"Eat in accordance with the seasons, and all bones and joints will be in harmony.
Stir the mechanisms of the body, and all transformations will be at peace."*

This again follows the previous discourse on the Three Powers being at peace,
Therefore it says:
*"Eat in accordance with the seasons, and all bones and joints will be in harmony"*—
This means the student’s daily essentials:
Regulating the five viscera,
Eating and drinking must not be untimed.
If he does not lose the proper timing,
Then the three hundred sixty bones and joints,
Blood and *qi* flow unrestricted throughout the body,
No place remains blocked,
And ailments will not arise.
With his body now healthy and at ease,
He can nurture his spirit and embrace his *qi*,
Dwelling in the *Central Field* [46],
Taking *Huápú* [47] and *Yùyè* [48] elixirs seasonally
To irrigate the *Root of the Mysterious* [49],
And its shoots will flourish.

Thus *Laozi* [50] said:
*"When the world has the Dao,
Even warhorses are turned back to plow fields.
I alone differ from others,
Valuing the *Mother of the Ten Thousand Things* [51]."*

The stirring of its mechanism, all transformations finding peace—
This means when the first *Yáng* [52] stirs, one must immediately turn the *Dòugǎng* [53] mechanism to respond,
For each practice of the *Dao* brings vitality to all ten thousand spirits within the body.

The *Pure Yang True Person*’s *Gold Elixir Poetry* states:
*"Alone within the vast *Kàn* and *Kūn* [54] forms,*
*From the crown, meticulously refining the Primordial Function.*
*Wielding the *Beidou*’s [55] cunning heart-mechanism,*
*Inverting the *Nánchén* [56] with heroic resolve.*
*Ghosts wail, gods lament as the Golden Cauldron cracks,*
*Roosters take flight, dogs transmute—*
*The Jade Furnace stands empty.*
*How can the vulgar seeker grasp this commonplace?*
*The *Dao*’s profundity is boundless, its mysteries unfathomable."*

The *Alchemical Classic* says:
*"Carefully ponder this marvel—*
*Each dawn, urging the *Zǐxīa* [57] cup to its depths.*
*If you seize the *Earth’s Soul* [58] with precision,*
*Then the *Heavenly Spirit* [59] will naturally bestow longevity."*

Thus it is said:

*Ode:*
*"Cultivation’s diet must be balanced and regulated,*
*The *Qi* harmonized, the five viscera cleansed.*
*The Golden Elixir refines form, the *Shénhuǒ* [60] tempers essence,*
*Every pore in the body radiates luminous clarity."*

Men know the *shén* of *shén* [61],
But do not know the *non-shén* of *shén*’s essence.
For *shén*—this word for *ling* [62], for *xìng* [63]—
Is the human’s luminous, formless nature.
Before parents conceived, it had no beginning;
After birth, it has no end.
Most subtle, most sacred,
Most profound, most refined,
It encompasses all forms,
Embraces all spirits,
Neither born nor destroyed,
Neither square nor round.

The *White-Purple Pure True Person* thus declared:
*"This *shén* is not the *shén* of deliberation,*
*But stands equal to *Yuānshǐ* [64] himself."*

This section speaks of the student’s daily cultivation—
First, one must clarify the nature,
Keeping the heart-mind ever serene,
Free of even a thread of private desire.
Nor should one cling to forms while seeking the mysterious.
If but a thought arises,
The *shén* is no longer *shén*.

The *Classic* says:
*"The human *shén* loves clarity, yet the mind disturbs it.
The marvel of the *shén*’s entirety lies in the heart’s emptiness—
Silent, containing truth,
In harmony with the *Tàixū* [65],
As luminous as the sun and moon."*

In all interactions and encounters,
One’s nature responds spontaneously,
Turning with the *Three Realms* [66] in perfect unity—
Thus the saying: *"One does not know the *non-shén* of *shén*."*

The *True Person Zhang* said:
*"It cannot be seen, yet when called, it responds."*

The *Diamond Sutra* states:
*"Worldly beings seek me through form and sound—
These are the paths of delusion,
And they cannot see the *Thus-Come One*."*

Thus it is said:

*Ode:*
*"A single point of Primordial Spirit is the utmost *shén*,
Yet when the *shén* knows its dwelling, it is no longer true.
If one awakens to the *shén*’s empty essence,
The boundless true void shines without obstruction."*

The sun and moon follow their cycles,
Small and great have their fixed measures.
From this, the sacred function arises,
And the divine luminosity emerges.

This follows the earlier discussion of clarifying the nature’s essence,
And thus expounds the method of nurturing life.
Having settled the nature,
One must then address the *mìng* [67].
If both nature and life are cultivated together,
Only then will form and *shén* both attain perfection.

The secret of nurturing life:
The student may observe the *Dao* of Heaven—
The sun and moon revolve, marking the *Winter* and *Summer Solstices*,
*Yīn* and *Yáng* pause at the *Mao-Yǒu Divisions* [68],
Days accumulate into months, months into years—
Thus the sun and moon have their numbers,
Small and great their fixed measures.

Has it not been said:
*The sun belongs to *Yáng*, the moon to *Yīn*,
The moon itself has no light, borrowing the sun’s radiance.*
At the *new moon* and *full moon*,
The *Great Yin* and *Great Yang* meet in the same palace,
And the moon, at this time, is dark and without light;
From the second and third days onward,
The moon drifts farther from the sun,
And the sun’s light strikes it—
Its brilliance grows, yet it remains small,
The *hún* [69] lengthens while the *pò* [70] diminishes;
By the eighth day’s night,
Its light is half-illuminated above—
This is called the *Upper Crescent*;
From this point onward, until the fifteenth night,
The moon faces the sun, its light full and vast—
At this juncture, the *hún* reaches its peak while the *pò* arises;
On the sixteenth and seventeenth days,
The *pò* grows while the *hún* wanes,
And the moon’s light gradually diminishes;
By the twenty-third night,
Its light is half-illuminated below—
This is called the *Lower Crescent*;
From this retreat until the thirtieth night,
The moon’s light fades entirely, returning to darkness once more.
This cycle repeats endlessly, without end—
A natural unfolding of Heaven’s transformations.
Thus, the great practitioner embodies this principle within oneself,
Circulating the *Zhōutiān* [71] fire and timing within the body.

The *sun* and *moon* refer to:
*Shén* and *qì*, water and fire, lead and mercury, nature and emotion.
When refining the elixir,
One merges *shén* with *qì*,
Consolidating within—
The *shén* flies forth to the *Yín* direction,
By *Shēn* hour, the fire advances,
As the sun’s light strikes the moon,
Its brilliance grows and strengthens;
The *jīng* [72] flows, transforming into *qì*,
Straight into the *Níhuán* [73],
As the moon faces the sun—
Following this, *Yīn* arises,
Using the *Qīngnǚ* [74]’s words,
The *Fù* symbol retreats downward into the *Kūn* palace,
The sun and moon unite in harmony,
Forming the *Returning Elixir*—
At first, the elixir is small,
But with deepened practice, it grows vast—
Thus it is said: *"The sun and moon have their numbers,
Small and great their fixed measures."*

Diligently gather, diligently refine,
Timely cooking and tempering—
The true embryo flourishes,
Wisdom opens fully—
Thus it is said:
*"The sacred function arises,
And the divine luminosity emerges."*

*Ode:*
*"The sun and moon revolve in their celestial cycles,*
*The *Dàfàn* [75] *qi* refines the sacred embryo.*
*From the subtle to the manifest, the *shén* transcends the sacred,*
*Lotus blossoms unfold within the fire."*

Its mechanism is stolen—
None in the world can see it,
None can know it.
The virtuous man who attains it guards it within himself,
While the petty man who grasps it risks his life.

This follows the discussion of circulating the sun and moon within the body,
Thus the sacred function arises and the divine luminosity emerges—
Hence it is said:
*"Its mechanism is stolen"*—
This *thief* is not the common thief of the world,
But the method of circulating the *Zhōutiān* fire-symbols.
A single breath’s work can surpass Heaven and Earth’s year-long transformations.

The *Alchemical Classic* says:
*"The Five Phases move in order,
And the tiger emerges from the water."*

The Five Phases inverted—
The dragon emerges from the fire.

Practitioners of this Dao/Way
Cannot be confined by Heaven and Earth,
Nor restrained by the *jiǎzǐ* cycle.
Hence, the great adept becomes
A thief beyond the bounds of Heaven and Earth.

As Zhang Ziyang said:
*"The practice is easy, the medicine is not far away—
Is this not the stolen mechanism?"*

This stolen mechanism is supremely simple and easy,
The state of the formless form,
The symbol of the shapeless symbol—
Thus none in the world can see it,
None can know it.

The virtuous man who attains it
Is humble, modest, and withdraws,
Holding fast to purity and preserving truth;
Abandoning sharp intellect, discarding cleverness,
He alone lets *virtue/power* be his body;
Diminishing further, diminishing yet again,
Merging with the common, blending with the dust;
Responding to what comes, without joy or anger.
He never openly proclaims his attainment of the Dao/Way—
This is why he who possesses it guards it within himself.

The *Laozi* says:
*"I have three treasures,
Preserve and uphold them:
The first is compassion,
The second is frugality,
The third is not daring to act before all under Heaven."*

And again:
*"The highest virtue/power is without virtue/power—
Thus it is said: 'He who has virtue/power is truly virtuous/powerful.'"*

The petty man, if he grasps this Dao/Way,
Will surely flaunt it,
Unable to conceal himself—
Self-aggrandizing, self-proclaiming,
Self-praising, self-boasting,
Cheating others and defying the *dharma*,
Completely without restraint,
Shallow in virtue/power and shallow in practice—
All men despise him.
Such a man has never failed
To fall into harm and risk his life,
Like Páng Juān of old.

The scripture says:
*"Those who see themselves are not enlightened,
Those who insist on their own ways are not renowned,
Those who praise themselves achieve no merit,
Those who boast of themselves do not endure,
The overbearing meet no peaceful death."*

Thus Confucius said:
*"The petty man inverts the *zhōngyōng*,
The petty man is without restraint."*
Is this not true?

The student should carefully examine this.

「Preceding verse states:
The *fúzi* burns mountains to steal the heavens’ secrets,
The Great Symbol vanishes—its Dao/Way is subtle and profound.
The virtuous man, attaining it, retreats to guard his self,
The petty man, once gaining it, acts recklessly.

**Huángdì’s *Yīnxíng Jīng* (夹颂解注) in its upper and lower volumes**
**The *Rúndào Yuān* (王道渊) of Nánchāng’s *Xiūjiāng* (修江) explains thus:**

The blind excel in hearing, the deaf excel in sight.
Cut off the source of profit, and one’s skill surpasses that of a teacher tenfold;
Threefold return through day and night, and one’s skill surpasses that of a teacher ten thousandfold.

The blind—those without eyes—
The deaf—those who cannot hear.
In worldly terms, though a man has two eyes, he may still be blind,
And though his two ears are deaf, his sight may yet be keen.

This illustrates how ordinary men, driven by insatiable desires,
Follow the openings where their passions leak,
Pursue the external while neglecting the internal—
Thus, the common man clings to worldly affairs,
And so this metaphor is offered as a warning to the student.

Yet speaking of the Dao/Way,
A great adept’s perfect wisdom flows unimpeded,
His divine responses are effortless—
His eyes hear, his ears see.
Ah! The marvel of sight and hearing lies not in eyes and ears,
But in the divine responses of mind and spirit.

Cutting off the source of profit yields tenfold skill over a teacher,
For this refers to the cultivation of one’s true nature,
Extinguishing all desires for gain,
Cleansing the heart to its pure source—
Thus, one attains clarity of spirit,
Yet still cannot match the labor of martial practice.
Hence, it is said that one’s skill is tenfold that of a teacher,
Merely as a figure to describe the effort of cultivating nature.

Even if one achieves stillness like the void,
It remains but the work of the shadow-spirit (*yīnshén*).
How much more wondrous is the threefold return of day and night,
With its power to restore yang, transmute bones!

Of the threefold return, there are two explanations:
The external threefold return refers to the eyes, ears, and mouth,
The internal threefold return refers to essence, *qi*, and spirit.

Within the twenty-four hours,
Externally, one must return the light of the eyes,
Concentrate the resonance of the ears,
Seal the breath of the mouth—
Day and night, reflecting inward without pause,
Not for a moment to be interrupted.
Internally, one must merge the three treasures (*sān bǎo*) into unity,
Never missing the heavens’ divine opportunities.
When the time arrives for the birth of *yǐn* (癸) from *yīn* (铅),
One must suspend the *sùzhū* (黍珠) within the boundless void,
Clutching it firmly without motion,
As the spirit soars and sinks to the depths of the sea,
Refining essence into *qi*,
Driving it upward to the Southern Palace (*Nángōng*),
Supplementing *lí* (离) to become *qián* (乾).
Continuing thus, one refines *qi* into spirit,
Descending directly to the Yellow Court (*Huángtíng*) and halting.
The *xùn* (巽) gate opens in pairs,
The great fire warms and refines—
Within the space of a meal,
The spirit is refined and returns to the void.

The void resounds with clarity,
Restoring the original nature—
This is the Dao/Way of dual cultivation of nature and life.

The *Dùrén Jīng* (度人经) states:
*"Harmonize the five *qì* (气) in their midst,
Blend the hundred spirits into unity,
Ten revolutions restore the soul’s essence,
Ten thousand breaths align with the immortals."*

The *Dān Jīng* (丹经) says:
*"Do not carve time into divisions of *zǐ* (子) and *wǔ* (午),
Nor fix the *yáo* (爻) and *guà* (卦) to determine *qián* (乾) and *kūn* (坤)."*

Thus, when one practices the Dao/Way once,
The myriad heavens resound in distant hymns,
The ten thousand lords arrange their rites.
The cultivation of the elixir (*dān*)—
Its merit is boundless.

Threefold return through day and night—
Is this not ten thousandfold skill over a teacher?

**Preceding verse states:**
The blind hear, the deaf see—wondrous mind unites.
Cutting off profit, the heart’s source clears, tenfold the skill.
The great medicine’s threefold return through day and night,
Divine transformations endless—Dao/Way knows no bounds.

Mind arises from things, dies by things—divine responses are clear.
In worldly terms, the common man’s mind is enslaved by form,
His day filled with chaotic deeds and recognition,
His mind never free from things.
Mind arises from things—it dies by things—
Its divine responses lie in the two eyes.

When any object appears before the eyes,
Love and attachment stir the mind,
The thoughts and perceptions chase outward,
Day by day, month by month, they grow—
Planting the seeds of death below,
All trace back to the eyes’ leakage.

*The Lǎozǐ* says:
*"Man’s birth is his movement toward death.
The people’s disregard for death stems from their excessive pursuit of life."*

The mind is hard to subdue
Because its divine responses lie in the eyes.

Yet speaking of the Dao/Way,
A great adept steadies his mind, clears his stillness,
Taking the Dao/Way as his very self.
Whenever the mind arises from things,
He summons the six transcendent powers (*liùtōng*),
Emits vast golden light,
Illuminating the boundless world,
Deploying the Northern Dipper and Southern Pole to restore it—
Thus, things die while the Dao/Way flourishes,
Its divine responses rooted in the heavens’ eyes,
The flowing, absorbing, and revolving of intent.

This must be transmitted orally—
I dare not reveal it openly.

The *Chuān Lǎo* (川老) annotates *The Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra* (金刚经):
*"The Vajra treads upon the earth,
The flagpole points to the heavens.
To know the true foundation,
Look to the Northern Dipper facing south."*

**Preceding verse states:**
Mind arises from things, dies by things—divine responses are clear.
Ten revolutions restore the soul’s essence,
Returning to the marvelous orifices—
The spirit condenses, the *qi* settles, and the Dao/Way flourishes.

The heavens have no deliberate kindness yet great kindness arises.
Swift thunder and fierce winds—
None fail to tremble in awe.

The heavens have no deliberate kindness yet great kindness arises,
For the heavens take the birth of all things as their heart,
The four seasons’ transformations as natural law—
How could they intend to bestow kindness?

It is because all things arise,
That demons and evil forces act in turn,
Their rebellion harming the upright—
Thus, the heavens’ great kindness is compelled.

Hence, they use thunder to proclaim their edicts,
And unleash fierce winds to display their might,
So that all things submit and return to the right.
Those demons and evil forces that refuse to mend their ways,
Thunder obliterates their forms,
The wind’s blades shatter their bodies—
Removing one harm to ensure the peace of all.

The heavens’ awe is manifest—
How could they tolerate their transgressions?

This is how the heavens, though without deliberate kindness,
Yet great kindness arises,
And when great kindness arises,
Swift thunder and fierce winds tremble in awe,
Their divine marvels roused and inspired—
In an instant, they fill the void,
Their transformations beyond measure.

The Sage also embodies the Dao/Way and acts accordingly,
To bring peace to the people of the world.
When the people are pure and joyful in their transformations,
No kindness need be bestowed—
Yet if some rebel and harm the people,
The Sage must establish lords and marshal armies,
Deploying armor and weapons to strike them down,
Removing one tyrant to ensure the welfare of the good.

It is like swift thunder and fierce winds,
Shaking their awe and might,
Showing the stubborn their strength,
Aligning them with the rightful path—
This is how the Sage, though without deliberate kindness,
Yet great kindness arises in action.»

The Dao/Way’s principles likewise apply when speaking of alchemical cultivation—its essence is the same.

When the mind is empty and nature still,
The form forgets, the world is forgotten—
No kindness need be bestowed.

Yet with the interplay of yin and yang qi,
Their ceaseless motion and division,
At times when yin demons encroach,
I stand firm in the central realm,
Summoning divine forces with swift authority—
The Thunder Mother’s fire strikes bold,
Fierce winds sweep the Central Mountain’s yin.
In an instant, all dark emotions dissolve,
As if intoxicated by boundless grace—
Thus arises great kindness,
And the alchemical transformation is complete,
Forging the Elixir’s marvel.

**Ode:**
Heaven’s kindness is not given, yet vast it springs,
The void’s twin qi surges in wrathful flow.
Thunder crashes, winds rage—all tremble and rise,
Creation’s ways defy the heart’s desires.

When joy is boundless, nature overflows with ease,
When stillness is perfect, virtue shines with purity.
Heaven’s deepest self-interest
Becomes universal when applied with right intent.
The bird’s mastery lies in qi.

True joy is wholeness of spirit,
True stillness is wholeness of essence.
Thus, the spirit unbroken knows no wrath,
While nature’s ease abounds with grace.
The essence untainted by desire,
Its stillness gleams with purity.

The Venerable Laozi taught the essence of peace:
*"Heaven grants the body spirit,
Earth grants the body essence,
The harmony of both is qi.
If one treasures essence and rejects desire,
Nurtures qi and cherishes spirit,
Within, the body attains longevity;
Without, the land achieves great peace.
Moreover, inner perfection manifests outwardly—
Clarity of nature brings bodily stillness,
Mastery of fate completes the Elixir.
When nature and fate are both preserved,
Joy overflows, stillness gleams with virtue.
Heaven’s deepest self-interest
Becomes universal when applied with right intent."*

For the bird’s mastery lies in qi—
A metaphor urging focus:
The heart is the bird, the spirit its fire,
The Southern Phoenix’s flame.
Heed this warning: concentrate on regulating qi,
Use qi as medicine, spirit as incantation,
Harness timing, refine with method—
Then yin transforms to yang,
The recognizing spirit becomes the True Person,
Merging into oneness.
Bones grow light, the body soars—
Like birds in boundless sky,
All through mastery of qi.
Thus, the immortals are called *Feathered Guests*.

Shi Jianwu said:
*"Qi is the elixir to prolong life,
The heart directs qi, the spirit guides.
Whoever knows to govern qi’s master
Has grasped the way to transcendence."*

**Ode:**
Qi steadied, spirit harmonized—joy overflows,
An empty heart, pure and frugal, nurtures the true form.
When the Elixir is complete, it aligns with Heaven’s enduring way,
The body, like birds, ascends to the boundless void.

Life is death’s root;
Death is life’s root.
Kindness arises from harm,
Harm arises from kindness.
These four—life, death, kindness, harm—
Yin and yang in constant return,
Opposites interdependent:
Where life is, death lurks;
Where death is, life takes hold.
Where kindness is, harm may hide;
Where harm is, kindness may dwell—
Thus the flow of fate unfolds.

Common folk, clinging to life’s excess,
Their hearts ensnared by the world,
Plant the seeds of death.
But if they abandon desire, guard their portion,
Severing attachments, purifying the source,
They grasp life’s root.

As the ancients said:
*"Greed for others’ gain is loss;
Loss becomes gain when met with wisdom."*
Thus the Sage perceives this truth with clarity:
When the heart arises from things,
It is death—kill the heart;
When the heart dies,
The Dao lives within.

Yin Xi’s True Person declared:
*"Hear the Dao at dawn,
Die to the heart by dusk."*

The *Diamond Sutra* teaches:
*"Do not dwell in form and give rise to mind;
Do not dwell in sound, scent, taste, or touch—
Where contact arises, the mind takes form.

The learned, hindered by their cleverness,
ensnared by the written word,
refuse to bow and seek instruction.

The Perfect Ones, exhausting their own nature’s Dao/Way,
merely search for scripted texts on the surface—
counting the Dao/Way’s patterns,
speaking swiftly and decisively,
and they thus take this as virtue/power.

Ah! How utterly foolish they are.
From the perspective of those who follow the Dao/Way,
they are the true fools.

I say that those who grasp the Dao/Way’s patterns with wisdom are the wise—
for such are those who truly perceive the Dao/Way,
who encompass the four seasons’ transformations
and all things’ principles,
and integrate them into their own being,
illuminating the depths to become the Sage.

As the Yellow Emperor gazed upward and downward,
observed the markings of birds and beasts,
and took from near and far,
he first drew the Eight Trigrams
and established written symbols.

Again, like the Yellow Emperor’s wide consultations,
or Confucius’ many studies,
is this not the path from wisdom to virtue/power?

Some recent commentaries halt here,
but I have examined the *Taiji Dan* version
annotated by the True Person Dan Zhenren
and Zhang Gu Lao’s version—
both continue with **216 characters in 21 sentences**,
exquisitely expressed.
This should be taken as the authentic text.
Later editions omit these lines—
errors in transmission,
not the original intent.

The verse says:
*"Fools debate the empty void externally,
clinging to principles, bound by words—
their nature remains impenetrable.
Do they know the marvels of my family’s Dao?
The morning sun rises, crimson on the peaks."*

Others take ignorance and virtue/power as virtue/power,
I take **not** ignorance and virtue/power as virtue/power.
Others take strangeness and expectation as virtue/power,
I take **not** strangeness and expectation as virtue/power.

Thus it is said:
*"Plunge into water, enter fire—
self-destruction awaits."*

Those who take ignorance and virtue/power as virtue/power
refer to those who seek meditation or the Dao/Way
but lack proper guidance.
They begin without a true teacher’s instruction,
merely clinging to dull emptiness as their nature,
studying no scriptures,
fixating on a single lifeless thought—
a heart of stone, withered wood—
obsessively grasping a notion,
neither desiring nor seeking.
They deem this virtue/power,
yet they know not:
the fool who guards an empty hole
will never catch the mouse.
Or like one who drills ice seeking fire,
but never finds the fire.

I say that those who truly practice must
consult a luminous master,
unlock profound insights,
master all scriptures,
and penetrate the deepest mysteries—
what is this so-called *nature*?
What is this so-called *fate*?
How does one refine *nature*?
How does one forge *fate*?

Go back and forth in inquiry until you reach that point where inquiry itself is exhausted—only then are you free from folly. When you arrive at this state, you need but a single word: *"subtract"*—let all entanglements be diminished until they reach *wuwei* (non-action). Then, naturally, wisdom shines forth, the Dao/Way flows with spontaneity, and responses arise with divine clarity. Thus, I say you are free from folly and attain sainthood.

Have you not heard that the sage Shun was ever eager to question and examine even the smallest matters? That Yu, upon hearing a single good word, would bow in reverence? That Yan Hui, upon gaining one virtue, would cherish it deeply and never lose it? The Way of these three sages was nothing but a love of learning, and yet they attained it. With the resources of today’s people, how could they hope to succeed without study?

The *Sutra of Guiding Beings* says: *"One must penetrate the ultimate truth of these words."*

People who seek sainthood through the extraordinary are deluded. They say: *"Those who practice do not seek the true teachings but cling to bizarre sects and minor methods—strange arts to deceive others."* Like sorcerers and shamans who dabble in mud-and-water elixirs, selecting beautiful women as crucibles, using the Three Peaks as their battlefield, relying on the Unshakable Spear for salvation, extracting female essence, and making the Yellow River flow backward as their elixir foundation. They take in much but produce little, calling this *"refining fire."* Such perversions disrupt the true Dao.

Others use their hands as yin-yang swords, taking female menstrual blood as their elixir foundation. Others abandon their wives, fast, rinse their mouths with saliva, circulate qi, rub and convulse, absorb the essences of sun and moon, burn reeds and play with fire—such methods number in the thousands.

They believe these tricks will bring sainthood. The *Elixir Scripture* says: *"The Dao/Way has three thousand six hundred methods, yet each person clings to one as their root."* Yet they do not know that the true essence of Daoist subtlety lies beyond these three thousand six hundred methods.

The *Diamond Sutra* also says: *"All conditioned things are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, and shadows—like dew or lightning. Thus, one must observe them in this way."*

I say that those who seek sainthood without relying on the extraordinary are correct. True practitioners of the Dao/Way govern the world with effortless ease. Internally, they preserve their true nature and cultivate their purity; externally, they respond to circumstances with spontaneity. In times of peace, they find joy in non-action; when demons arise, they suppress their emotions in an instant. Naturally, without contrivance, they embody the highest principle.

Thus it is said: *"To sink into water and enter fire is to court self-destruction."* This has two meanings.

For those who dabble in strange arts, they stray from the true Dao, lose their genuine path, and exhaust their vital roots. Such people court their own ruin by plunging into their own cauldrons of fire and water.

But for those who truly understand the Dao, when refining the elixir, they follow the *wuji* (Steel-Water) method: letting the *wu* (Steel, metal) descend into the watery abyss to grasp the *kan* (Water) yang and supplement the *li* (Fire) yin. After achieving *qian* (Heaven), they retreat the *ji* (Earth) to restore the elixir pearl to the divine chamber. Through fire’s purification, impurities dissolve, and the body and mind merge as one. The boundless void opens—this is why it is said: *"To sink into water and enter fire is to court self-destruction."*

Master Yin’s *Exposition on the Scripture Platform* says:
*"The heart obscured by mystic speech sinks into the underworld,
while true nature, enlightened by profound words, aligns with Heaven’s will."*

The ode says:
*The foolish cling to six hollow unions, using tricks to deceive their own nature.
I follow the Dao of effortless stillness—
golden elixir refined, the furnace glows red.*

The Dao/Way of nature is still, and thus all things flourish.
The Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth is fluid, and thus yin and yang prevail.
When yin and yang interact harmoniously, transformation flows naturally.

The Dao/Way of nature is still—this means the Heavenly Principle moves spontaneously, the four seasons breathe their qi naturally, and all things arise from this effortless stillness. Thus, the sage embodies the Heavenly Principle and acts in accordance with nature, governing the world without contrivance. Therefore, the people of the four seas rejoice in the nameless simplicity.

Thus *Laozi* says:
*"Practice the teaching of non-action.
I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves.
I love stillness, yet the people rectify themselves."*

The Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth is fluid, and thus yin and yang prevail—this means Heaven’s qi does not descend, Earth’s qi does not ascend, and the two do not communicate. Thus, Heaven and Earth are blocked, resulting in solitary yin and scarce yang. When the two qi become imbalanced, the five stars lose their courses, the sun and moon clash, the seasons fall out of order, winter thunders, summer snows, droughts and floods ravage the land, and all things wither.

Master Peng says:
*"When yang fire burns excessively, drought and flood go unchecked, turning winter into great heat.
When the *yinfu* (Yin Symbol) loses its rhythm, cold and warmth clash, turning summer into thick frost."*

If the Golden Palace fails to nurture the cinnabar and mercury, then pests and calamities arise—greatly, causing mountains to collapse and earth to split, with the Metal Tiger and Wood Dragon churning in chaos; or slightly, with violent rains and howling winds, as the *kan* (Water) male and *li* (Fire) female escape their bounds.

When yin and yang interact harmoniously, transformation flows naturally—this means yin and yang have the mystery of separation and union, and water and fire have the method of *ji* (completion). Gathering herbs according to the seasons and aligning with the stars, yin and yang naturally interact, and transformation flows in harmony. Thus, form and spirit are both perfected, and one attains true unity with the Dao.

The ode says:
*The Dao of nature is still, and all things thrive complete.
When yin and yang are misaligned, imbalance follows.
To grasp the reversal of yin and yang is to cast off old age,
returning to youth and matching Heaven’s longevity.*

Thus, the sage knows that the Dao/Way of nature cannot be defied and acts accordingly. The most profound stillness transcends even the measurements of calendars and divinations. Strange instruments give rise to all phenomena. The Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems conceal divine mechanisms. The arts of yin-yang victory are clearly manifested in their symbols.

Thus, this is the concluding summary of the essence within the three chapters of the *Yinfu Jing* (Yin Symbol Scripture).

The term *"sage"* is an honorific for those who embody virtue and power.

*"To know that the Dao/Way of nature cannot be defied"* means: Having understood that the Great Dao is the natural principle, one must uphold this natural Dao without deviation—seeking nothing else.

Thus, *"to act accordingly"* means: My body’s **qi**—like the **spirit-energy** of dragons and tigers—is hard to train and discipline, so I must follow the **cosmic cycles** and turn with the seasons, countering the **yin-yang revolutions** of the **Five Phases** to subdue it. A student who grasps this truth can refine the **elixir of immortality**.

*"The most profound stillness"* transcends even calendars and divinations: When the **inner alchemy** is complete, the **true emptiness** shines clear, like a sky without clouds for ten thousand *li*. At that moment, form and objects are forgotten, **nature** is still and boundless, and words and images cannot capture it—how could calendars and divinations ever measure this?

*"Strange instruments"* refers to the **Three Treasures** blended together, nurturing the **soul elixir** to pierce stone and transmute gold, changing at will—this is the **nameless instrument**, which is not strange at all? When a **great adept** possesses this **strange instrument**, they wield the **Great Transformation** as easily as one’s fingers, giving rise to the **Ten Thousand Phenomena**, the **Eight Trigrams**, and the **Heavenly Stems**.

*"The Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems conceal divine mechanisms; the arts of yin-yang victory are clearly manifested in their symbols"* means: The **divine spirit-energy** is fierce and unyielding; the **ghostly forces** submit and hide. When **yin is exhausted and yang is pure**, the **embryonic transformation** reaches its peak. From this point, the **spirit** ascends to dwell in the **cinnabar field** (the **brain’s upper cavity**), but one must tread firmly on the earth and carefully preserve it. When the **celestial gate** bursts open and the **yang spirit** seeks to emerge, do not let it stray lightly—wait until it is cherished like a newborn child, strong enough to walk, before the **spirit** can depart.

Thus it is said: There are **arts of yin-yang victory**; when the **inner work** is complete and the **outer practice** fulfilled, the **Celestial Sovereign** is naturally moved to send **imperial decrees** summoning you. Then, your body rides the **cloud chariot**, your **crane-like ascent** shines with **radiant light**, enveloping the **heavenly fragrance** of **imperial favor**, ascending to the **Jade Capital** and **Golden Gates**, entering the **palaces of the immortals** according to your **merits and cultivation**. Is this not the clear manifestation of the **arts of yin-yang victory** in their symbols?

Like **Yellow Emperor** of **Xuanyuan**, who ascended with his **consorts and ministers** seventy-two in number on a **dragon** from **Ba Mountain**; or **Emperor Shun**, who ascended in **Cangwu** at the **Five Elders’** home when they presented the **decree**; or **Zhang Daoling**, the **Celestial Master** of the **Han**, and **Xu Jingyang**, **Ge Xianweng** of the **Jin**, who all ascended with their **wives and children** in broad daylight to become **ministers of the Golden Gates**.

The **Dao of the Immortals** is indeed verified. How many **adepts** have there been from ancient times to today?

Students must not dismiss the **Immortal Way** as absurd and lose heart. The key is to **truly believe** and then seek a **worthy teacher** for direct transmission, diligently practicing without hesitation. Then, the **Heavenly Immortals** will naturally recommend you, and you will surely attain the **rank of the Immortal Sage**—this is no idle claim.

The **Hymn** says:
*"The embryonic immortal is nurtured, free from yin’s constraints,*
*Worshipping the **Highest Venerable** in the **Jade Void**.*
*The **arts of yin-yang victory** manifest clearly,*
*Soaring like cranes and phoenixes, riding the **cloud chariot**.*
*The **Yellow Emperor’s** *Yinfu Jing* **interprets and illuminates**,
*Completing the **volumes of the Way’s essence**."*
