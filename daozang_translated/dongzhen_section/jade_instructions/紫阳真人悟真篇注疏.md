Postface to *Awakening to Reality*

The *Awakening to Reality* divides *xing* and *ming* into two lineages, instructing people to advance separately; it distinguishes internal and external medicines into two elixirs, instructing people to advance together. Truly, it is the progenitor of alchemical classics through the ages. Its teachings, handed down for the world, may stand immortal alongside the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*.

Before Ye Wenshu’s annotations, the Dao was transmitted by masters, yet none had glossed its meaning. After Ye Wenshu’s annotations, people were obscured by the Dao, yet none discerned its errors. Of the dozens of commentaries I have seen, all rely on one-sided cultivation or misguided marginalia. Thus, the great Way of the Golden Elixir remains unheard in the world, leaving no path to enter its profound gate, and even master-disciple transmission has nearly ceased. If transmission from masters is severed, from where can one hear it? Thus, those who can hear it are few—how could there be those who can practice it?

The world transmits the commentary attributed to Master Purple Worth, merely venerating the text for its association with the Perfected One, unaware that later generations have plagiarized Weng Baoguang’s annotations, falsely attributing them to Dao Guang. I have detailed this distinction at the end of the fascicle.

The Nameless One is also of the Perfected One’s lineage. Formerly, in the *qiangui* year of the Qiandao era, I met Wenshu and found his annotations riddled with errors. Fearing that later generations would be misled and the great Way obscured, I resolved to explicate its meaning, unfolding and clarifying its principles. I extolled the divine power of a single grain and expounded the three vehicles’ truths, fully revealing the celestial mechanism to illuminate the master’s intent.

Once, in Ruiyang, someone showed me several passages from the *Awakening to Reality* as annotated by the world’s version of Purple Worth. I found its marginalia at odds with other commentaries. Comparing it with what my father and master had transmitted, none aligned, deepening my suspicions. After reading it repeatedly, I gradually grasped its subtleties.

Upon obtaining the complete text, I pored over it again and again, forgetting meals and sleep, scrutinizing each word and phrase with profound and unbroken reflection. Together with my elder brother, Zhongfu, and the assistant magistrate, we engaged in discourse—questioning, answering, challenging, and refining—studying it for years before recognizing its alignment with the great elixir principles of the *Triple Concordance Canon*. For I had long received the profound teachings of the *Triple Concordance*, yet found its methods incomplete; thus, I devoted myself solely to the *Awakening to Reality*. Though I grasped its intent thereafter, the *Awakening* itself distinguished inner and outer practices, and its temporal mysteries remained obscure—how much more so the secrets the immortals guarded, never committing them to writing.

Longing to seek a master yet finding none to instruct me, yearning to consult texts yet discovering no texts to consult, my heart remained fixed, my thoughts unceasing. Heaven, moved by my sincerity, in the summer of the *xinsi* year of the Zhishun era, led me to a master who bestowed the oral transmission. Returning, I told my brother, and we rejoiced without sleep. Later, upon seeing Wumingzi’s annotations, they matched as if tallying tokens—then I knew that celestial immortality could be cultivated and the primordial spirit never perishes. The immortals Zhong and Lü all followed this same Way. With but a moment’s effort, one ascends to the sacred realm. No wonder the heavens guarded it so closely, swearing never to transmit it to others.

Alas! Since the *guihai* year of the Yanyou era, when I served as instructor of the Confucian school in Shaoxing Circuit at the age of fifty-two, trials and hardships have followed one upon another. Yet I have remained steadfast in my resolve, forsaking fame and profit to devote myself wholly to completing both nature and destiny. My devotion to the Way has been unwavering, my inquiry diligent—I have not betrayed the heart of the Dao. Had I met my master and received the teachings earlier, my life might have passed smoothly, untroubled by worldly burdens, my wealth not exceeding a hundred taels, my rank advancing but a few grades—what benefit would such a muddled existence have brought me? Now, knowing the truth yet failing to refine oneself is to court folly; to lose this human form is to forfeit an encounter that comes but once in a thousand kalpas—how much more so the chance to hear the Way!

After hearing the Way, I vowed to universally deliver all beings. Yet in the stillness of midnight, I dared not recklessly divulge celestial secrets—how then could I guide others to stride freely upon the path? Defying heavenly retribution and breaking my master’s oath, I set it forth in writing and gave it voice. But the world has long been deluded—how could it readily believe? Thus, I gathered the critiques of heterodox schools by past patriarchs, that others might recognize their futility in attaining celestial immortality, and so turn their thoughts to the true gateway of the Way. This I titled *Dispelling Delusions in the Study of Immortality*.

Once delusions are dispelled, how then to guide others into the profound mysteries of the Way? I selected ten passages from the immortals’ scriptures and Daoist classics that shared a single principle, elucidating their immortal intent through the master’s secret transmission, composing annotations to clarify the true path of immortality. This I titled *The Orthodox Tradition of Immortal Study*, compiled separately.

Who could have foreseen that my elder brother would suddenly depart, leaving me to cultivate alone—deepening my vigilance and resolve.

As the years advance and my strength wanes, I redouble my resolve to cultivate with urgency. Finding that the annotations of Master Wuming sometimes lacked clarity and failed to fully expound the symbolic imagery of the methods, I composed explanatory discourses for each chapter to illuminate the mechanisms of thorough attainment and the symbolic forms of the Golden Elixir, thereby revealing their principles of mutual interaction.

Moreover, the *Wuzhen Pian* presents distinct inner and outer teachings, resulting in variations in its poetic verses. It speaks of "setting up the furnace and establishing the cauldron," yet also of "tending the medicinal furnace without firewood or charcoal"; it says the work is "completed in one hour," yet also "accomplished in a day" or "ripened in ten months." At times, a single object serves as metaphor while the methods applied differ; at others, many stones are used as analogies while the object signified remains the same. Such divergent expressions abound, easily leading readers astray—affirming one passage may cause them to err in another, or grasping one may cause them to lose another. Thus, they may mistakenly perceive partial alignments with heterodox schools, their knowledge becoming skewed and their confusion ever more entrenched. Those who err in their own practice will teach others in error, perpetuating delusion without end—how lamentable!

Now, I have categorized and grouped the verses by theme, with headings listed to the left. Reading the main text alone suffices to grasp the general meaning, let alone with the detailed annotations, which render the Way resplendently clear. Those who obtain this book share a karmic affinity with immortality. Those who hear this teaching share a karmic affinity with immortality. Those who hear this teaching should cultivate without hesitation. I shall retreat to seclusion, embracing the One with an empty heart, fully realizing the true cultivation of the Three Vehicles, that I may not squander this life in vain.

Having received transmission from the immortals, I dare not slacken in diligent progress. As for the supreme Vehicle, it must be personally realized—it does not lie in the transmission of words or speech. Yet those who rely on superficial learning through hearsay fall into the emptiness of external paths, conflating it with the profound mysteries of the immortal Way. Both schools are misguided; both medicines are applied incompletely. Many drown in the currents of delusion. May those who study immortality strive for unity in their advancement, harmonizing their ascent to the celestial ranks, thereby repaying, if only in part, the boundless kindness of their teachers, parents, and elder brothers.

**Preface to the Annotated *Wuzhen Pian***

On the day of his ascension, the Perfected Lord of Xishan declared: "One thousand two hundred and forty years after my ascension, eight hundred people within the Five Mounds will attain immortality. A great isle will emerge in the middle of the Gan River, stretching across its mouth—this shall be the sign." From that time to the Jiazi year of the Chunxi era, one thousand two hundred and twenty-six years have passed, and the isle now spans the river, matching the prophecy as if by divine tally.

Alas! Heaven appointed Jingyang to oversee immortal affairs during the Jin dynasty, and now his prophecy has come to pass. I know that among those in the Five Mounds who cultivate this Way, they are either the true disciples or the true descendants of *Wuzhen*. For Heaven shall spread the true wind across the cosmos and fulfill the immortal prophecy in Yuzhang. How majestic is our Song dynasty, which gave birth to *Wuzhen*, who presided over the immortal registers and secretly aided the imperial house—how else could he have received the title of "Purple Mystery" from the Nine Heavens?

The Immortal Elder *Wuzhen* attained the Dao atop Qingcheng Mountain and refined the elixir by Pan Lake. His first transmission gave rise to Guangyi Zi, and his second to Wuming Zi. These are true heirs of the immortals, born of the auspicious energy of Zhongling, fulfilling the prophecy of immortality in Hongdu. Yet the *Wuzhen Pian* has been misinterpreted by many—how can one reverse the raging tide or dam the hundred rivers?

Wuming received the text in his later years and annotated it, each word like unrefined gold, each phrase like uncut jade, rendering great service to the flourishing of this teaching. One day, he showed it to me, and I composed this preface to summarize its essence.

**Preface by Chen Daling, the Purple Yang Elder of Wuling**

Kongxuanzi states: "He refined the elixir by Pan Lake." According to Bai Yuchan’s *Four Mountains’ Dharma Discourses*, Zhang Pingshu achieved success only after meeting Ma Duyun, and Dao Guang attained the elixir only after encountering Zhang Huanwei. The reference to refining the elixir at Ke Lake suggests cultivation under Ma Chuhou. After the Perfected One achieved the Dao, he entrusted *Wuzhen Pian* to Ma Chuhou in Hedong before departing, as detailed in Lu Yanfu’s records.

His first transmission gave rise to Guangyi Zi. Liu Yongnian, who styled himself Shunli, was known as Guangyi Zi. In the Renshen year of the Shaoxing era, he published *The True Meaning of the Cantong Qi, Divided by Chapters*. In his preface, he wrote: "*The Cantong Qi* fully expounds the essential mechanisms of the Golden Elixir. Those who fail to thoroughly comprehend this scripture merely chase after superficial allusions, fixating on minerals and metals, rigidly adhering to the minutiae of fire phases—such misinterpretations only lead them further from the true classic. In the Wuwu year of the Shaoxing era, I encountered a perfected one who personally transmitted oral instructions, saying, ‘Examine *The Cantong Qi*—my teachings align perfectly with it.’ I followed my teacher’s guidance and studied it closely; the principles became luminously clear, leaving no room for doubt. I then gathered over a thousand copies, meticulously collating and correcting them before printing, that those with discernment might grasp the true essence—how could this be a small achievement?"

When Qi Zong first encountered the printed edition, the imperial library’s version had not yet been released, and its text still contained errors and corruptions. In reading *The Cantong Qi*, one should regard Bao Zhongqi’s collated Secret Pavilion edition as authoritative. Yet even Bao’s collation contains minor discrepancies; thus, to grasp the true meaning, one must follow Peng Zhenyi’s corrected text. Qi Zong has annotated and collated these versions against the original.

Master Chen of Ziyang, an immortal from Mount Wu Yi, left behind recorded discourses—sixty-four teachings that distinguish the two schools of *xing* (nature) and *ming* (life), as well as the inner and outer elixirs. He also stated:
*Without reading the ancient* Longhu Shangjing*, one cannot fathom the subtleties of the two crescents of metal and water.*
*Without reading* The Cantong Qi*, one cannot comprehend the essence of the sun and moon’s one catty.*
*Without reading* The Wuzhen Pian*, one cannot perceive the divine workings of the two chapters of gold and jade.*

This Dao is the subtlest of the subtle, the most mysterious of the mysterious. One must gather the undivided *qi* of dragon and tiger, absorb the primordial essence of tortoise and snake. Within the three hundred hexagrams, some are civil, some martial. Among the sixty-four trigrams, there are *Zhun* and *Meng*. The elixir coalesces in an instant; the Way is perfected after nine years.

He further said:
*When the Dao arises from within, the furnace and tripod are established without.*
*When the Dao arises from without, true lead and true mercury reside within.*
*One catty within, one catty without—purple gold transforms into purple powder, purple powder transforms into the golden elixir.*

This distinction between the inner and outer medicines of the primordial—though these two emerge from the same source, they bear different names. The Dao of inner and outer is thus exhaustive, leaving nothing more to be added. Therefore, the outer medicine returns like the inner medicine, and inner communion must also extend outward. Viewed thus, Master Ziyang’s teachings align with *The Wuzhen Pian*.

My late father once told me: The immortal of Tiantai achieved the Dao and received his mandate from the Supreme Emperor, becoming the Perfected One of Purple Mystery. He silently observed the imperial capital, appearing and vanishing at will, walking shoulder to shoulder with the world, yet none recognized him. In his youth, he studied alongside my ancestor at the Imperial Academy, though he never passed the examinations. Endowed with innate spiritual roots, he delved into Buddhist scriptures until one day, struck by bamboo, he suddenly awakened to non-arising and directly transcended into the pure expanse of the nature-sea. In his later years, he encountered a scholar from Qingcheng in Chengdu and fully grasped the wondrous principles of the golden elixir, penetrating the mechanisms of yin-yang inversion and the cyclic patterns of heaven and earth’s generation and transformation. Thus, he cultivated truth to restore destiny, refining form to ascend beyond form, embracing oneness with an empty heart, unifying nature and life in quiescent emptiness. Thereby, form and spirit became wondrously attuned, merging with the Dao in truth, endlessly transforming, universally manifesting across the dharma-realm. Through these wondrous applications, he broadly delivered the deluded. During the Yuanfeng era, he and Liu Fengzhen’s disciples widely propagated Buddhist teachings, yet ultimately lingered in non-arising before entering quiescence. Liu’s disciples cremated his remains, obtaining hundreds of relics, some as large as flowers. Seven years later, Liu’s disciples traveled to Wangwu Mountain and again met the immortal as before—this further demonstrated his mastery of both form and spirit, the profound unity of nature and life.

The immortal’s nature was imbued with benevolence and magnanimity. Having thoroughly investigated principle, exhausted nature, and attained destiny, he unified the three schools without distinction, their wondrous applications undifferentiated. Yet he did not seek to cultivate himself alone; thus, he composed *The Wuzhen Pian* to instruct later learners. He began by enticing them with the Dao of immortality and life-cultivation, opening the work with verses on the golden elixir. He concluded by dispelling illusions with the true suchness of emptiness, ending the scroll with Chan songs and odes.

The essentials of the golden elixir lie in establishing the true yin and true yang substances—two eights—in the furnace and tripod, enticing the primordial *qi* to return within. This transforms into a single grain, as small as a millet seed, called the *Taiyi* true *qi*. Thus, he first arranged sixteen quatrains of seven-character verse to represent the numbers of true yin and true yang. Next, he composed a single quatrain of five-character verse to symbolize the singular oddity of *Taiyi*—the single grain of the golden elixir. Once this grain is ingested and returned to the cinnabar field, the fire is then circulated according to the sixty-four hexagrams, hence the sixty-four jueju verses corresponding to the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Zhouyi*. The fire’s work spans ten months, including bathing, totaling twelve months; thus, he appended twelve *Xijiangyue* lyrics to align with the celestial cycles of the year. After ten months, the embryo is complete, and the form transmutes into pure yang *qi*; hence, he composed eighty-one regulated verses, symbolizing the pure yang of nine nines. Once form has transformed into *qi*, one embraces oneness for nine years, refining *qi* into spirit, uniting spirit with the Dao. Thereby, form and spirit become wondrously attuned, ascending beyond form to merge with the Dao in unfathomable union. Thus, spirit, nature, form, and life all return to their ultimate source in quiescent emptiness. He concluded with thirty-six Chan verses on the nature-Dao to complete the scroll. All these follow the symbolic structure of the golden elixir’s great principles in this sequence.

As for the specifics of medicinal substances, fire phases, and oral instructions, their subtleties are all embedded within the verses—readers may discern and awaken through the text itself. Over time, the transmission expanded, and textual arrangements diverged, often introducing errors. Only the family copy preserved by Lu Sicheng, grandson of the Duke of Longtu, is authentic—this was the version personally transmitted by the immortal. Sicheng himself appended a detailed preface to the scroll’s end. While traveling through Dongting, I obtained this true edition, corrected its errors, and only then fully grasped the immortal’s intent: the sequence of chapters and verses all correspond to the symbolic methods of the golden elixir. Though the text is concise, its profound principles are comprehensive; though its allusions are subtle, their analogies are intimately precise.

Indeed, this is the true refuge for earnest seekers and the essential compendium of the foundational scriptures. Yet many of today’s scholars pursue heterodox paths, seeking verification through incongruous methods. Some recklessly conflate terms like "Celestial Court," "Supreme Treasure," "Jade Flask," "Jade Cinnabar," and "Primordial Embryo," distorting their meanings through forced interpretations—never grasping the core of rooting deeply and securing the foundation.

Then there is Ye Wenshu, who attempted to explicate and distinguish the numbers of the Great Ultimate and the Great Expansion, even crafting diagrams to append at the scroll’s end, titling it *The Outer Transmission of the Wuzhen Pian*. This is like mistaking the shadow of a curtain for the sun, or misidentifying a horse as *qian*—not only does it disorder the true scripture, but it leads earnest seekers into confusion and error. The immortal sage once said:

*"None will reflect upon their own mistakes,
Yet they teach others the wrong path.
Misleading them for lifetimes in delusion—
How can such deceit be borne?"*

Does this not describe Wenshu? He failed to understand that a single grain of golden elixir is none other than the primordial *qi* of the Great Ultimate. The sages borrowed the substances of the two eights to capture this *qi*, transmuting it into a single grain within a single moment. It does not exceed half a *chen*; ingested, it instantly elevates one to the realm of sages. Thus the immortal sage declared:

*"Within a single *chen*, the elixir is complete."*
And again:
*"Swallow a grain of numinous elixir,
And you will know your fate is not ruled by heaven."*

How could these be empty words? Wenshu, not comprehending this principle, insisted that "a single moment" did not mean *only* a single moment. If one argues that it does not require merely a single moment, then it must take three years or even nine—how could this align with the Way’s utmost simplicity and ease? Why would the immortal sage speak of "a mere moment’s effort yielding eternal bliss"? Further, he misconstrued "a single grain" as "a single day," positing the existence of a "daily elixir," and falsely cited Master Zhenyi’s words, "consume one grain per day," as evidence—yet he utterly misunderstood Zhenyi’s intent. If one were to follow this logic—consuming one grain per day, with each day yielding a new elixir—then over three or nine years, one would accumulate over three thousand grains. How could the immortal sage have deceived others by speaking of just *one* grain? These two examples alone suffice to show that Wenshu never grasped the art of the golden elixir. Thus his annotations are riddled with errors, and his misinterpretations are manifold.

What he failed to realize is that the numbers of the Great Ultimate and the Great Expansion are merely symbolic representations of the firing process—superficially plausible, yet fundamentally flawed. To seek the supreme Dao of the golden elixir through such symbols is like trying to summon rain by painting a dragon or sate hunger by drawing a cake—how could it not be difficult?

Though I am unworthy, I have followed in the footsteps of the immortal sage, inheriting his true transmission and never forgetting his profound teachings, even for a moment. How could I remain silent, watching the crimson and purple obscure the vermilion, without broadening the sage’s intent to dispel confusion for future seekers? Thus, undeterred by the fear of celestial retribution, I dare to reveal the celestial mechanism, elucidating the true text in accordance with the immortal’s secret instructions:

To refine the great medicine of the golden elixir, first clarify the primordial *qi* of the undifferentiated chaos before heaven and earth separated—this is established as the foundation of the elixir. Next, distinguish true yin and true yang, the emotionless substances of the same kind, each weighing eight ounces—these form the crucible and furnace. Using the true *qi* of this crucible and furnace, employ symbolic methods to circulate it through the celestial cycles, enticing the primordial *qi* of the beginning. In no more than half a *chen*, it coalesces into a single grain, adhering to the furnace, as large as a millet seed—this is the golden elixir.

Take this single grain of golden elixir and swallow it into the five viscera, where it seizes and subdues the essence and *qi* of the entire body, like a cat capturing a mouse or a sparrowhawk seizing a crow—rendering them unable to flee. Then, employing the true *qi* of yin and yang, known as yin talismans and yang fire, nurture the essence and *qi*, transmuting them into the substance of golden liquid. Suddenly, at the base of the spine, a presence is felt, surging upward through the double passes of the spine with a distinct sound, reversing its course to the muddy pellet, striking the upper palate. Droplet by droplet, it descends into the mouth, resembling sparrow eggs, fragrant and sweet—this is the golden liquid returning elixir.

Slowly swallow it into the cinnabar field, where it coalesces into the sacred embryo. After ten months, the embryo matures and the fire is complete; then, through the process of shedding the embryo and bathing, it transforms into a body of pure yang, free from hunger, thirst, cold, or heat, impervious to blades, tigers, or rhinoceroses—becoming an earthbound immortal. Only then does one retreat to a secluded place, sitting in stillness for nine years, emptying the heart—this is called "embracing the One." After nine years of practice, form and spirit naturally attain perfection, nature and life unite, merging with the Dao in truth, becoming unfathomably transformative—this is the nine-times-cycled great returning elixir of golden liquid.

Though the elixir is divided into three stages, the Dao remains one in principle. One must progress from the lesser to the middle, and from the middle to the greater—this is the sequential path of elixir refinement and Dao attainment. Thus, I have divided this work into three scrolls:

The **upper scroll** refines the golden elixir, serving as the defense of a mighty army and the strategy for victory in battle.
The **middle scroll** circulates the fire of the golden liquid elixir, serving as the method for enriching the nation and pacifying the people.
The **lower scroll** details the nine-cycled great returning elixir, serving as the Dao of the immortal’s embrace of the One.

Together, these constitute the three vehicles of the great method, aligning with the true meaning of the *Yinfu Jing*. This is the supreme, boundless, highest-grade celestial immortal’s first-rank, most authentic and wondrous Dao. The five ancestral masters transmitted this method orally, and it is the *only* true teaching.

Its essence is utterly simple and effortless, conveyed in but a few words. The sages, fearing the revelation of celestial secrets, employed terms like *qian* and *kun*, crucible and furnace, dragon and tiger, lead and mercury—along with countless other metaphors—to do nothing more than illustrate the symbolic methods of the golden elixir. Now, I have gathered and examined these diverse terms, pointing out their precise correspondences without daring to omit even the most minute detail.

Yet, fearing that seekers might not grasp the subtleties of their application, I have repeatedly observed and refined my explanations, composing *The Direct Pointers to the Wuzhen Pian*, *The Secret Essentials of the Three Vehicles*, and *The Secret Essentials of the Three Vehicles in Verse*, appending them to the scroll’s end. In these works, I have exhausted the profound and subtle, fully revealing the celestial mechanism and laying bare the immortal’s secret instructions.

May this be bequeathed to fellow aspirants, that they may readily delve into its essence, attaining luminous and direct insight—so that the true reality of *Wuzhen* may forever serve as the orthodox Dharma-seal, unconfused by the doctrines of heterodox schools and crooked sects.

Written in the mid-autumn of the *gui-si* year of the Qiandao reign of the Great Song, by Xiangchuan’s Wumingzi, Xi Baoguang, with reverence.

Kongxuanzi says: Wumingzi divided this work into three scrolls—upper, middle, and lower—entitled *The Three Vehicles of the Great Dao*, aligning with the true meaning of the *Yinfu Jing*.

This is based on the *Yinfu Jing* commentary by Master Jinhua. Jinhua’s exegesis states: “The strategy of strengthening the army to achieve victory” is none other than the process of refining the golden elixir to transmute the form. It is the accumulation of yang *hun* to dissolve yin *po*, deploying yang soldiers to battle yin bandits. Through the mutual conquest of the Five Phases and the mutual agitation of the Eight Trigrams, one returns to the root and restores life, whereupon the elixir blazes forth. Every cycle of the returned elixir depends upon the divine water of the Flowery Pond. Thus, born between heaven and earth, humans remain ignorant of heaven and earth’s principles, allowing yin and evil to plunder them. Their radiance and vitality swiftly pass, their spirit and essence dissipate, and so they decline and wither. The sages therefore devised symbolic methods to lure the true yang qi, congealing it into the divine elixir. This extends and preserves the form, uniting spirit with the Dao—like a nation beset by marauding bandits, which must deploy a strong army to subdue them. Only after securing its treasures and restoring the nation’s prosperity does one practice the immortal’s Way of embracing the One.

In praise:
The Flowery Pond’s divine water,
Jade mercury and golden lead.
Heaven and earth supply the resources,
Sun and moon the firing and refining.
*Zhun* and *Meng* ignite the fire,
Advancing and retreating with precision.
Drawing and adding, bathing,
Nine revolutions in a single year.
Kan and Li penetrate the head,
Thirty years of meritorious practice.
Hold fast without slackening,
Transmute the form and ascend as an immortal.

The method of enriching the nation and pacifying the people is the method of refining qi. The *Inner Classic of Laozi* states: The structure of the body mirrors the image of a nation. The sage takes the body as the nation, the heart as the ruler, and essence and qi as the people. When the people are at peace, the nation thrives; when the people scatter, the nation is enfeebled. If one cherishes essence and nurtures qi, one attains longevity. Just as a ruler cherishes the people like infants, constantly devising ways to nourish them so that the people are at peace and the nation prospers—this is the method of enriching the nation and pacifying the people. The human form is endowed with the father’s essence and mother’s blood, transformed from primordial qi. Master Zhonghuang says: Bones and flesh take essence and blood as their root, while spirit and consciousness take primordial qi as their foundation. Spirit and qi are the root of nature and life. Spirit is the child of qi, and qi is the mother of spirit—this is the mother and child within the form. When mother and child are never parted, qi abides serenely within the cinnabar terrace, naturally effecting transformations.

In praise:
The Gate of Heaven ever open,
The Door of Earth must be sealed.
Perpetually maintain continuity,
Never allowing even a moment’s lapse.
Inhaling to the root,
Exhaling to the stem.
The child is called spirit,
The mother is called qi.
Like a chick in the egg,
Like a fish in water.
Once the sacred embryo is formed,
Naturally one sloughs off like a cicada.

The Way of embracing the One is the method of refining spirit, for there is no natural Dao apart from this. Those who encounter the Dao must constantly embrace and guard the center, ensuring that spirit and qi do not scatter. Then they wander freely and at ease, becoming true persons.

In praise:
The Dao is the root of nature,
Nature is the source of the heart.
Heart and nature are of one body,
Responding and transforming without limit.
The common people in their daily use
Also call this natural.
If one can awaken to this,
Forms vanish and words are forgotten.
Empty the heart and fill the abdomen,
Embrace the One and return.
After nine revolutions of merit,
One attains immortality.

It is also said: Practicing the method of refining spirit leads to becoming a spirit immortal, where the form sinks while the spirit soars, attaining freedom. Practicing the method of refining qi leads to becoming a fetal immortal, where one refines the form, spirit and qi intermingle, mist and haze harmonize, and the embryo is nurtured to give birth to the infant—like a cicada’s molting. Practicing the method of refining the form reverses aging to regain youth, preserving the form to abide in the world.

With care, I have arranged these texts to reveal Wumingzi’s original intent in dividing the work into three scrolls.

Another edition gives Wumingzi the courtesy name Yuanming.

*Preface to the Wuzhen Pian*

Alas! The human body is hard to obtain, yet time swiftly passes. Unaware of life’s brevity, how can one escape karmic retribution? If one does not awaken in time, content to await the end, a single misguided thought at the final moment will plunge one into the three evil destinies. Then, for kalpas as numerous as dust motes, there will be no escape. At such a time, though one may regret, what use is it? Thus, the Daoist and Buddhist traditions, through the study of nature and life, open the gate of expedient means, teaching people to cultivate the seed of liberation and escape birth and death. Buddhism takes emptiness and quiescence as its宗, and if one suddenly awakens to perfect comprehension, one directly transcends to the other shore. But if habitual tendencies remain unexhausted, one still clings to existence. Daoism takes refinement and nurturance as its truth, and if one grasps its pivotal essence, one immediately ascends to sagehood. Yet if one has not awakened to the original nature, one remains entangled in the illusory form. Moreover, the *Book of Changes* contains teachings on exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and reaching life’s culmination; the *Analects of Lu* speaks of “no willfulness, no insistence, no obstinacy, no self-absorption”—these are Confucius’s ultimate insights into the mysteries of nature and life. Yet why are their words often brief and lacking in detail? It is because they wished to order human relationships and promote the teachings of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and music—active endeavors—so they did not explicitly expound the Way of non-action. Instead, they embedded the techniques of life in the images of the *Changes* and concealed the methods of nature within subtle words. As for *Zhuangzi*, who probed the fetters of things to reveal the nature of carefree wandering, and *Mencius*, who excelled in nurturing the flood-like qi—both came close to the crux. Then, in the Han dynasty, Wei Boyang drew upon the *Changes*’ principles of yin-yang intercourse to compose the *Cantong Qi*, elucidating the workings of the great elixir. In the Tang, the Venerable Zhong of Guoshi prefaced his recorded sayings with the words of Laozi and Zhuangzi, revealing the origin and end of the supreme Dao.

Thus, though the teachings diverge into three, the Dao converges as one. Yet how lamentable that later generations of the yellow-robed and black-clad each cling to their own sect, mutually disparaging, causing the essential doctrines of the three schools to stray onto misleading paths, unable to merge and return to unity.

Moreover, people today assume the Daoist gate values only the cultivation of life, unaware that the methods and principles of life-cultivation arise from two auspicious sources: some are easily encountered yet difficult to accomplish, while others are difficult to encounter yet easy to accomplish. Practices such as refining the qi of the Five Sprouts, ingesting the light of the Seven Luminaries, visualizing and massaging, inhaling the pure and exhaling the turbid, reciting scriptures and chanting spells, spraying water and shouting talismans, clicking teeth to gather spirits, abandoning wives and fasting, concentrating thoughts between the brows, replenishing the brain and returning essence, or practicing bedchamber arts—along with consuming and refining minerals, herbs, and plants—all belong to the easily encountered yet difficult to accomplish. The above methods, in the path of self-cultivation, are generally fragmented and flawed; though much effort is expended, no verifiable effects are attained. Even if one diligently applies the mind and suffers hardship, practicing day and night, the best outcome is merely warding off illness and avoiding untimely misfortune. A single day of neglect, and prior progress gradually dissipates. This drags on for years, making success nearly impossible, and one cannot hope to attain longevity, reverse aging, transform the body, or ascend in broad daylight. Deeply grievous indeed!

The fault lies with modern practitioners who stubbornly cling to delusions, failing to awaken to the truth of the wondrous method, and instead blame the immortals for deceit. Little do they know that those who attain the Dao all do so through refining the golden elixir, yet fearing the leakage of celestial secrets, they veil the truth under various pretexts. Among these practices, only breath-holding—if one can forget scheming and quiet the mind—resembles the seated meditation of the Two Vehicles. If diligently practiced, it may lead to entering samadhi and projecting spirit. Yet since spirit belongs to yin and its dwelling is hard to stabilize, one must constantly employ shifting methods. Without mastering the way of returning mercury and lead, how can one reverse yang, transform the bones, and ascend to heaven in broad daylight?

Refining the golden liquid and returning the elixir, however, is difficult to encounter yet easy to accomplish. It requires thorough comprehension of yin-yang and deep penetration of creation’s workings. Only then can one pursue the two qi along the Yellow Path, unite the three natures in the Primordial Palace, gather the Five Phases, harmonize the Four Images, where dragon chants and tiger roars, husband sings and wife follows, the jade crucible simmers, and the golden furnace blazes. Only then does the Mysterious Pearl take form, the Supreme One return to truth—all achieved in a brief moment, securing boundless ease and joy forever.

Yet one must guard against danger and contemplate risks, be cautious in applying the methods of withdrawal and addition, nurture correctness and maintain fullness, and hold fast to the feminine and embrace the One. Naturally, the qi of returning yang is generated, the form of slaying yin is stripped away. When the cyclical nodes are complete, one sheds the mortal coil through spiritual transformation, the name is inscribed in the immortal register, and the title of Perfected One is conferred—this is the moment when the great man’s work is accomplished and his name is established.

Nowadays, scholars take lead and mercury as the two qi, designate the viscera as the Five Phases, split heart and kidneys into Kan and Li, regard liver and lungs as dragon and tiger, use spirit and qi as mother and child, and grasp fluids as lead and mercury. They fail to distinguish floating from sinking, much less discern host from guest. How is this different from mistaking another’s wealth for one’s own or calling a child of another surname one’s own? They remain ignorant of the subtleties of metal and wood’s mutual restraint or the mysteries of yin-yang’s reciprocal use. Thus, sun and moon lose their way, lead and mercury occupy separate crucibles—how can one hope to congeal the returning elixir?

From youth, I was devoted to the Dao, traversing the scriptures of the Three Teachings, as well as studies in penal law, calligraphy, mathematics, medicine, divination, military strategy, astronomy, geography, and the arts of fortune, misfortune, life, and death—nothing escaped my careful inquiry. Yet of the golden elixir method alone, though I perused all the classics and the songs, poems, treatises, and concordances of various schools, all spoke of the sun’s essence and moon’s spirit, Metal Tiger and Wood Dragon, mercury and cinnabar, white gold and black tin, Kan male and Li female, capable of forming the golden liquid and returning elixir—but none revealed what true lead and true mercury truly are. Nor did they explain the methods of fire timing, the standards of nurturing, or the ultimate aim. Worse still, later generations of deluded disciples, indulging their whims, recklessly annotated the sacred teachings of the ancient sages, introducing myriad errors that not only disorder the immortal scriptures but also mislead later learners.

As I had not yet encountered a perfected being and the oral instructions were hard to come by, I became restless, unable to eat or sleep, my spirit exhausted. Though I sought counsel from mountains and seas, inquired of the worthy and the foolish alike, none could clarify the true essence or illuminate the depths of my heart. Later, in the year *jiyou* of the Xining era (1069), while accompanying Minister Lu of the Dragon Diagram to Chengdu, my long-held resolve unwavering and my initial sincerity ever more reverent, I was moved to receive from a Perfected One the oral instructions on the golden elixir, its ingredients, and the fire timing. The words were concise, the essentials uncluttered—truly a case of pointing to the stream to know the source, speaking one to awaken a hundred. Like mist dispersing to reveal the sun’s brilliance or dust settling to mirror clarity, when compared with the immortal scriptures, they matched perfectly.

I reflected that of the many who study immortality, eight or nine out of ten do so, yet scarcely one or two grasp its true essentials. Having encountered the true transmission, how could I dare remain silent? I poured forth all I had received into ninety-nine regulated poems, titled *Awakening to Reality*. Among them, sixteen heptasyllabic quatrains represent the number of two eights. Sixty-four jueju verses correspond to the hexagrams of the *Zhou Changes*. One pentasyllabic poem symbolizes the oddity of the Great One. Twelve additional *West River Moon* lyrics align with the twelve months of the year. Within these are fully contained the hierarchy of crucibles, the weight of ingredients, the advance and retreat of fire timing, the precedence of host and guest, the presence and absence of existence, and the auspices and regrets of fortune.

After completing the collection, I realized it spoke only of the arts of nurturing life and preserving form, leaving the original source of true awakening unexplored. Thus, I turned to Buddhist scriptures and the *Transmission of the Lamp*, where I found that even the patriarchs attained enlightenment through such means as striking bamboo. I expressed these insights in thirty-two songs, odes, poems, and miscellaneous verses, now appended to the end of the scroll. May this suffice to illuminate the path of returning to the root and clarifying the nature, bringing it to completion.

May those of like aspiration who peruse these words perceive the branch and awaken to the root, forsaking delusion to follow truth.

Written on the first day of the year *yimao* in the reign of Emperor Xining of the Great Song, by Zhang Boduan, styled Pingshu, of Tiantai.

*Commentary and Annotations on the "Awakening to Reality" of the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Scroll One*

Xiangchuan Wumingzi Weng Baoguang annotated
Wu Yi Chen Daling transmitted
Qingkongzi Dai Qizong collated

Seven-character quatrains, sixteen in all, to express the weight of one catty and the number two-eight:

Not seeking the Great Dao to escape delusion,
Even with worthy talent, how can one be a true man?
A hundred years of light pass like a spark from stone,
A lifetime’s existence floats like a bubble on water.
Only craving profit and rank, seeking glory and fame,
Unknowing, the form and countenance wither and dry.
Try asking: though gold be piled like mountains,
Can impermanence buy back what is not yet gone?

**Annotation:**
When asked what the world values most, the answer is wealth and nobility—both are what people desire. Thus, all under heaven exhaust their nature and life’s essence, expending their lifelong aspirations, striving with all their might to obtain them, finding joy in their attainment.

Yet observe the reason for this: it is nothing more than indulgence in profit, rank, fame, and sensual pleasures. Little do they know that profit, rank, fame, and sensual pleasures are in truth the spears and halberds that sever life and nature, the fetters that bind the body.

People of the world, not understanding the wonders of the Dao, virtue, nature, and life, only glut themselves on profit and rank, daily indulging in greed and anger, drowning in the river of love, adrift in the sea of desire. Right and wrong, self and others wage war within, while joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure within the breast mutually ravage the body, summoning the corpse-demons that shorten the breath and lifespan.

Cold and heat erode the radiance of the countenance, unknowing that in this lifetime, one’s existence is but a fleeting bubble on water. A hundred years of light and shadow pass in an instant like a spark from stone. Though gold be heaped as high as the Northern Dipper and jade amassed like the Southern Mountains, when impermanence arrives, can one buy back the body and prevent it from becoming a nest for ants and worms?

Alas! How grievous! Before life’s end is announced, the true spirit has already entered another shell.

The Master of Serene Emptiness said: "Unawakened in this life, after death one changes shells, entering another form, revolving endlessly without awareness."

Ah! Rather than unawakened entry into another species, why not abide in the Great Dao? When the Dao is accomplished and the work complete, the body ascends beyond the azure heavens, riding the clouds and qi, driving flying dragons, and roaming the boundless. Death and life no longer alter the self, and one is titled a Perfected One. This is the season of fulfillment for a true man, the day of utmost glory and fame.

Yet those entangled in mundane affairs, their hearts mired in worldly dust, falling into the snares of the world—though they possess the heroic talent of Ban and Ma, and the glory and fame of Su and Zhang—are but wandering souls upon the earth, shadowy ghosts of walking corpses. How can they be called true men?

Thus, the Immortal Elder first composed this verse, speaking to those of lofty and enlightened understanding, that they might awaken through a single word, swiftly seek the Great Dao to escape delusion, and engage in the work of non-doing. Only then is one a true man; all else is unworthy of regard.

**Disciple of the Study Zongyuan’s Reflection:**
Those who read the Immortal Elder’s poems and Wumingzi’s annotations without awakening are truly the most benighted. O those who have seen and heard, can you not hasten to practice?

**Alternative Annotation:**
Nothing is harder than encountering the right person; nothing is easier than attaining the Dao. Manifesting as an official or elder, forming bonds with like-minded friends on the path to the Dao, refining a single grain of millet in a fleeting moment, one may attain the Dao in an instant.

Yet draped in crimson and holding gold, with gates as deep as the sea, those of the Dao turn away in dismay—this is the difficulty of encountering the right person and the ease of attaining the Dao.

Nothing is easier than encountering the right person; nothing is harder than attaining the Dao. With a hundred coins hanging from a staff, one roams the four seas alone, planting the spiritual root, receiving the transmission of the supreme Dao.

Yet the patterns of dragon and tiger are easy to comprehend, while the locks of the elixir spoon are hard to open. Having obtained the medicine, one forgets words; refining lead, one has no method. This is the ease of encountering the right person and the difficulty of attaining the Dao.

How can one personally knock at the mysterious pass and achieve both?

The Immortal Elder wandered to Chengdu, where he met the Elder of Qingcheng and received the transmission of the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir. Moved by the difficulty of attaining the Dao, he composed this poem to gather fellow alchemists. The verse reads: *"Try asking: though gold be piled like mountains, / Can impermanence buy back what is not yet gone?"* The meaning is urgent and pressing.

Though one offer a double handful of jade before a team of four horses, it is not as good as sitting and advancing in this Dao.

The Immortal Elder is far beyond us—like high mountains and flowing waters, rare are those who know his music.

Ziye of Luzhu said: "The Dao does not betray man; man betrays the Dao. Though a human life may span a hundred years, longevity or early death, poverty or prosperity cannot be foreknown. Yesterday, one rode a horse through the streets; today, one lies as a corpse in a coffin. Wealth and wives are left behind, no longer yours; the karma of sins follows, impossible to deceive. If one does not seek the Great Medicine, how can one encounter it? To know it and not refine it is foolishness."

**Annotation:**
No one can foresee or predetermine longevity or early death, prosperity or poverty, wealth or lowliness. Yet all secretly harbor desires for what has not yet come to pass, though these are beyond the measure of ordinary people.

Thus, though a human lifespan may be a hundred years, reaching seventy is already rare. Now, with a fragile body easily destroyed, one spends each day in ceaseless pursuit of boundless and unpredictable affairs—is this not difficult?

When a single breath does not return, one suddenly collapses, not knowing where to go—can this not be called great sorrow? Thus, one who was riding a horse yesterday lies as a corpse today: the outgoing breath does not guarantee the incoming one.

At such a time, though one’s glory and rank reach the highest offices, with salaries of ten thousand bushels, a household rich in priceless treasures, a chamber filled with beauties who could topple a city—all are cast aside, no longer one’s own. The only thing that accompanies one, impossible to deceive, is the karma of sins committed in the past.

Thus, of all the myriad things, none will accompany one in the end—only the karma one carries remains.

For those who wish to escape the cycle of rebirth and avoid entanglement in the world’s snares, nothing surpasses the Great Elixir of Golden Cinnabar as the sacred ladder to ascension and the swiftest path to transcendence. Its Way is utterly simple and effortless; even the dullest and most ignorant may practice it and swiftly ascend to sagehood. Yet the highest sages guard it with utmost secrecy, forbidding its careless disclosure. Those who transmit it do so only through direct oral instruction, never committing it to writing—hence its rarity. Unless one seeks it with tireless devotion and sincerity that moves the highest heavens, one may scarcely hear even a whisper of it.

In ancient times, Xie Ziran, despairing of the Way’s elusiveness, sought a true master on Penglai. He exhausted his family’s wealth to prepare a boat, heedless of the perils of towering waves and raging tides, pressing onward without fear. Moved by his resolve, a divine being spoke to him: “Penglai lies beyond thirty thousand *li* of weak waters, where not even a mustard seed may float—where do you think you are going? On Mount Chicheng dwells Sima Ziwei; go and take him as your teacher.” Xie turned his boat and sought out Mount Chicheng, where he indeed found Ziwei and received the Way. Through unceasing cultivation, within a few years, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

Ah! When a person’s sincerity bursts forth from within and resonates with the divine, there is nowhere it will not be met. If one could but hold fast to such resolve, what worry is there that the Golden Elixir would not be attained? The Way does not fail people—people fail themselves.

As the *Cantong Qi* says: “The Great Way is not partial; it is transmitted only to the worthy.” If one does not pursue it with utmost sincerity and ardent longing, how can one hope to encounter it?

Truly, the secret essentials of the Golden Elixir are difficult to come by. Those who do encounter them are born with the bones of immortals, their ancestors’ accumulated hidden virtue deep and profound. Yet even then, one must possess the means: three fellow cultivators are required to achieve success. This principle is known only to the enlightened; it is too subtle to be fully expounded.

As Master Yin Zhenjun states in the *Six-Five Subtleties*: “To study this Way, one must have resources. Without resources, the Golden Elixir cannot be completed. Moreover, three people are needed for its refinement.” Thus, when Lord Chongxi met the immortal Liu Haichan and received the transmission of the Golden Elixir, lacking the means to begin, he journeyed to Luoyang to seek the wealthy Han Gong. Through Han’s assistance, he completed the Way and departed.

If one has both the understanding and the means yet delays cultivation, is this not the height of folly?

An immortal elder once addressed Master Liu in verse:
*“I hear you’ve known the medicine for many years—*
*Why not still your heart and refine mercury and lead?*
*Lest the candle be snuffed out by the wind,*
*Do not blame heaven for the six paths of rebirth.”*

Such is the meaning.

Another commentary notes: “Unicorns and phoenixes do not appear in the world; divine immortals are rarely seen. To empty the body of its dreamlike, illusory form, to escape the suffering of birth, aging, sickness, and death—this is a rarity among mortals. If one meets a master on the Way and receives their guidance, to begin practice swiftly is still too late. The immortal elder’s verse is no mere poetry; its closing lines declare:
*‘The Great Way is not sought in vain—*
*To know it yet not refine it is sheer folly.’*
Such earnest admonition is spoken thus.”

If one has not yet heard the Way, so be it—but having encountered a perfected one, how can one remain dull-witted? Rising in the still of night, one fulfills their long-cherished vow: gathering a grain of millet in half a morning, nurturing the sacred embryo for nine years, to conceal it within the Great Void, roaming the eight directions in spirit, revealing but half a face amid purple clouds, and answering the immortal prophecy at Hongdu—lest Jinyang alone should bear the mantle of Jin’s patronage.

A commentary states: The Perfected One Xie of Guozhou ascended at Gold Spring Mountain outside the western gate of the prefectural city. On the twelfth day of a certain month in the eleventh year of the Zhenyuan era, he rose lightly into broad daylight, witnessed by all the people of the prefecture. At the time, the prefect Li Jian reported the event to the throne and composed a record of it. The emperor issued an edict in praise, saying: “Within your jurisdiction, divine immortals have manifested their marvels, the mysterious wind flourishes ever more, and the supreme Way spreads ever wider.”

Han Changli’s poem reads:
In Nanchong County of Guozhou,
Cold as Xie Ziran.
The children knew nothing,
Only that there were immortals.
Light of life, they learned his art,
There at Gold Spring Mountain.
One morning, seated in empty space,
Mists arose between them—
As if the strains of pipes and reeds
Came from the dark heavens.
In an instant, he rose lightly,
Drifting like smoke in the clouds.
The village head reported the matter,
The prefect marveled and sighed.
He drove his carriage, leading officials,
The common folk vied to be first.
Entering the gate, they saw nothing—
Only a cap and shoes, shed like a cicada’s husk.
All said it was the work of immortals,
Surely true and fit to be passed down.

Wang Boxiu’s *Records of Learning in Adversity* records: Wang Quan, styled Banzhen, was a native of Yangping in Qixia. In the Yuanfeng era, he was granted the title “Recluse of Tranquil Dawn.”

Zhang Yunshi inscribed a stele on his meritorious deeds and conduct, noting his transcendent bearing, which matched that of Chen Tunan. Master Cheng Yi never composed poetry, save for a verse sent to Wang Zizhen:

*"I too possess the elixir—do you believe it?
When needed, it can still succor the people."*

When Master Cheng entered Mount Song, Zizhen awaited him beneath the pines. Asked how he knew of his coming, he replied: *"Word arrived last year."* For the Master had intended to visit the year prior but was detained by affairs.

The *Gaizhai Manlu* further records: Wang Quan, styled Zizhen, was a man of the Dao. Duke Fu of Zheng once lodged with him. In the Yuanfeng era, Emperor Shenzong bestowed upon him the title *"Recluse of Tranquil Dawn."* In the third year of Yuanfu, he journeyed to Mount Mao and received the *Shangqing Register.* Earlier, the stone cavern on the central peak of Mount Mao had suddenly opened—it was the side gate of the Huayang Grotto-Heaven, sealed since the departure of the immortal Zuo Yuanfang a thousand years prior. Now, it opened once more. Days beforehand, sweet dew descended continuously, and the Daoist Liu Hunkang remarked: *"This portends something extraordinary."* Soon after, the Master arrived. On the night he received the Register, celestial music resounded in the empty sky above the peaks. The mountain’s inscribed stone recorded the event.

*"Yin and yang of grasses and trees stand paired in balance—
Lack but one, and fragrance fades."*

At first, the green leaves emerge, with yang taking the lead;
Next, the red blossoms bloom, as yin follows behind.
The constant Dao lies herein for daily use—
Who knows the true source, when turned back to this?

I say to all you gentlemen who study the Dao:
Without understanding yin and yang, do not act recklessly.

**Annotation:**
Before grasses and trees come into being, they contain the purest essence. When their husks split open, they receive the one qi to sprout. Thus, a single stem rises to symbolize the one qi, then divides into two leaves to symbolize yin and yang. Between these two leaves, a bud emerges once more, corresponding to the Three Powers. Beyond this, they gradually branch out, their flowers and leaves flourishing. In spring, they grow and unfurl green leaves; in summer, they mature and bloom red flowers—this is the work of yang qi. In autumn, they wither and bear fruit; in winter, they decay and nourish their roots—this is the work of yin qi. When yin and yang stand paired in balance, transformation and generation never cease. If one is lacking, the myriad things cannot come to be. Thus, Master Zhenyi said: *"A solitary yin cannot give birth on its own; a lone yang cannot achieve completion."* Therefore, when heaven and earth intermingle in harmony, the myriad things are transformed into purity. When male and female unite in essence, the myriad things are born through transformation. The constant Dao lies herein for daily use. The true source, when reversed, holds the mechanism of yin and yang’s inversion and mutual employment. Those who can refine this may transcend life and death. Yet scholars who fail to comprehend this and turn against it are merely deluded.

If yin essence is wrapped within yang, its substance is not firm—
Do not mistake a solitary yin for possessing yang.
Cultivating but a single element only weakens the body further.
Exhausting the form through stretching and guiding is not the Dao;
Ingesting qi and consuming mist is sheer madness.

The world seeks in vain to subdue lead and mercury—
When will they ever witness the descent of tiger and dragon?
I urge you to thoroughly explore the place of your birth,
For returning to the root and restoring the origin is the King of Medicines.

**Annotation:**
The yin essence wrapped within yang is one’s true essence. Essence generates qi, and qi generates spirit. Nothing is more vital to the nourishment and defense of the body than these. When the oil is exhausted, the lamp goes out; when the marrow is depleted, the person perishes. This speaks of essence and qi as the very root of the body. Yet alas, this substance belongs to yin—its nature is not firm, and its tendency is to flee. Day by day, it is lost through urine, sweat, tears, and saliva, easily dissipated and difficult to capture, refusing to be refined and controlled. Thus, the sages called it *"the radiant light of the Great Yang,"* for its nature is fierce and violent. Without the True One of the Primordial Origin and the yang elixir to restrain it, combined with the yang fire within yin to nurture it, there is no way for it to congeal and transform. If one cultivates only this single element, the body will only grow weaker. Stretching and guiding the form, ingesting mist and consuming qi—all are false paths. Even if one were to swallow the essence of the sun and moon, illuminating the five viscera, or circulate the twin passes at the spine, replenishing the brain and returning essence, or achieve corpse liberation, rebirth, spirit departure, or deep meditation—through a thousand methods and ten thousand techniques, one would still be cultivating only the yin essence wrapped within yang. A solitary yin without yang is like a hen laying an egg, hoping to hatch a chick—how could it ever succeed?

Master Zhongli said:
*"Tears, saliva, essence, fluids, qi, blood, and marrow—
These seven substances are all yin.
If one takes these as the material for immortality,
How could the spirit ever soar to the Jade Capital?"*

From this, it is clear that within the body, not only is true essence a yin substance—even the five viscera and six bowels are yin, not yang. Can one truly divide the heart and kidneys into Kan and Li, or the liver and lungs into dragon and tiger? Can one use spirit and qi as mother and child, or cling to fluids as lead and mercury? If one relies on such methods to cultivate the body in pursuit of the state of pure yang, it is like removing ice by adding frost, or quenching fire with boiling water—like making a turtle or snake fly, only to see it grow more erratic.

*The Kinship of the Three* states:
*"Make two women live together—their complexions differ greatly.
Su Qin speaks eloquently, Zhang Yi arranges the match,
Their tongues sharp as swords, their words sweet as honey.
They feign sincerity to harmonize, pretending to be husband and wife,
Yet in the end, their hair rots and their teeth decay—
They never truly know one another."*

This metaphor speaks of marrying a woman to a woman, refining yin with yin—how could there be any path to generation and transformation? The true dragon and true tiger are the one and the eight. True lead and true mercury are the qi of the dragon and tiger’s two arcs. This Dao is utterly simple, not complex; utterly near, not distant. Yet scholars cling stubbornly to their biases, mistaking heterodox and unrelated medicines for lead and mercury, and dismissing the true formulas of the Great Dao as false. How deeply lamentable!

Thus, Master Zhongli said:
*"Those who seek immortality without knowing true lead and mercury
May pore over a thousand or ten thousand volumes of alchemical classics,
Yet if they fail to grasp the hidden meaning within,
They will slander the true teachings as empty words."*

Therefore, the Immortal Elder directly points to the source of lead and mercury, to the place from which the body is born and life is established. By returning to this root and restoring this origin, and by inverting the process of cultivation, the true dragon and true tiger will naturally descend, and true lead and true mercury will naturally be subdued. If not the King of Medicines, who else could achieve this?

In recent times, many have taken sixteen-year-old boys and girls, made them copulate, and collected the semen to form an embryo, calling it *"Embryonic Origin Elixir"* or *"Purple River Chariot,"* regarding it as the great medicine of the golden elixir. This is like trying to catch the moon by grasping at bamboo—does it not only grow more distant? All things born after heaven and earth, possessing form and substance, are not the supreme medicine. For that which is below form is not the Dao of the prior heaven.

Master Shangyang said:
*The Kinship* states:
*"This is not the method of circulating through the viscera;
Inward contemplation leads to distraction.
The yin path disdains the nine and the one,
Defiling and disturbing the primordial womb.
The branches are many, the methods countless—
A thousand paths, ten thousand techniques."*

Master Peng said:
*"The world does not comprehend the fundamental origin of the Great Dao
And instead pursues the crooked paths of heterodox methods.
These myriad practices are all left-handed ways,
Deviating from heavenly principle, violating the supreme truth.
They fail to grasp the writings of the Yellow Emperor
And completely miss the intent of the Old Master.
What was meant to bring eternal life
Only harms the body instead."*

I say: It is only because the world clings to self-cultivation that its thousand paths and ten thousand techniques are nothing but heterodox ways.

The Immortal Elder, in compassion, speaks plainly,
Tracing life to its very source—how could this not reveal the celestial mechanism?
This aligns precisely with what Lord Zhongli declared:
*"The gate that gives me life, the door that takes it away."*
How profound! The sagely teachings of the highest worth—
Yet among the lower ranks, none can bear their weight.

For worldly folk come from the realm of karmic consciousness,
And to the realm of karmic consciousness they return.
As the solitary yang flees through the form,
Even within the male body, all is yin.
If one clings to self-cultivation,
How can one restore the primordial and return to the root?
And by what means could one reverse yang and renew the bones?

Thus, the great practitioner
Seeks the precelestial true lead,
Tracing it back to the very origin where qi was first received and life began.
Only then can one obtain that precelestial true unified qi,
Restoring the primordial and returning to the root—
This is the Way for men to cultivate immortality.

For women, the path of practice centers on the breasts as the seat of generative qi,
And the method is simple and unadorned.
Thus, men cultivate immortality by refining qi,
While women cultivate immortality by refining form.

In the practice of the Kan woman,
One first accumulates qi in the breasts,
Then establishes the furnace and tripod,
And proceeds with the Great Yin method of refining form.
This Way is easily accomplished—truly, there is deep meaning here.

During the Xuanhe era, Lü Dongbin traveled to Wuxing,
Where he encountered a courtesan named Zhang Zhennu,
Whose beauty was radiant and whose nature was pure and unadorned.
Though fallen among the wind and dust,
Each night she bathed, changed her clothes, lit incense at the hearth, and prayed to Heaven,
Earnestly seeking liberation.

Dongbin, disguised as a scholar, visited her.
Zhennu, seeing his refined and extraordinary bearing,
Treated him with utmost respect and hospitality before he departed.
The next day, he returned, and this continued for over a month,
Yet he never once crossed the bounds of propriety.

Zhang Zhennu said:
*"You have honored me with your visits for so long,
Yet never stayed a single night to enjoy the pleasures of the pillow and mat.
Could it be that I am too coarse and unworthy to serve you, sir?"*

The scholar replied:
*"Not so. What matters most is the meeting of minds—
Why must it come to this?"*

And what, pray, do you seek each night in your prayers to Heaven?"
Zhennu replied: "Having lost myself to this life, what else could I do? Yet I reflect: since entering this gate, I have wantonly applied powder and rouge, passing false for true; sung lewd and seductive songs, turning sorrow into mirth. This body is but a sack of foul pus, dressed to deceive. How I regret it—foolish men, failing to honor their own worth, pass my door and see me as a mere flower, their hearts ensnared, their wills undone. They seek not only wealth but often ruin themselves. Though I feign joy in such exchanges, my burden only grows heavier. Thus, I pray day and night for early release."

The scholar said: "With such resolve, why not study the Dao?"
Zhennu answered: "Trapped in this place, where would I find a teacher?"
The scholar replied: "Might I be your teacher?"
Zhennu immediately bowed in reverence.
The scholar said: "Come again, and it may be so." Then he departed.

Zhennu waited day and night, but he did not return. Filled with remorse, she wrote:
*"For so long I met my teacher,
Yet never asked a single question.
How could we sit face to face again,
Lamenting time wasted in vain?
Only now do I turn to seek the source."*

Before she finished writing, the scholar suddenly appeared. Reading her verse, he composed a matching rhyme:
*"No clever tricks to impart,
You’ll soon see one true part.
Sit in stillness from midnight to noon,
Qi rises past the double passes, over Kunlun’s moon.
When urgency strikes, recall my art."*

Overjoyed, Zhennu received from him the method of *Taiyin Lianxing* (Refining Form through the Great Yin). From that moment, her spirit and qi flourished as if a great awakening had dawned. Though she received many secret teachings, she revealed none to others.

At their parting, he left her a verse in the *Chan Palace* style:
*"Kan and Li, Qian and Dui divide the Zi and Wu,
You must recognize your own ancestral root.
Earth’s thunder shakes, rain falls on the mountain’s crest,
To wash and nurture the yellow sprout from the soil’s breast.
Seize the golden essence, bind it firm and tight,
Distinguish Jia and Geng to birth dragon and tiger’s might.
When asked what lineage you transmit,
Say only: ‘My teacher bears the surname Lü.’"*

Only then did Zhennu realize he was Master Lü. She feigned madness, begged in the marketplace, and retreated to the wilderness to secretly cultivate the true method. After three years, she departed through *shijie* (liberation by corpse).

The path of cultivation knows no distinction of male or female; with courage and unwavering resolve, the Dao may be attained.

**Commentary:**
The *Taiyang Liuzhu* (Flowing Pearl of the Great Yang) in the *Cantong Qi* (Token for the Agreement of the Three) originally illustrates the difficulty of subduing *linggong* (spiritual mercury). Here, the anonymous author uses it to symbolize the mercury within the human body—a valid interpretation.

The *Taishang* (Most High) said: "All things bear yin and embrace yang, for they are formed through the interplay of yin and yang." Neither humans nor other beings lack yang, yet why is the human body deemed entirely yin? Because, born after Heaven and Earth, it possesses form and substance. Once form exists, it is constrained by yin, yang, and the Five Phases, becoming yin and thus incapable of transformation.

The *Cantong Qi* states: "Things without yin and yang defy Heaven and forsake the Origin." Master Peng said: "Solitary yin or solitary yang cannot generate life." The wonder of external elixirs is not the absence of yin. Why, then, is it called *chunyang* (pure yang)? Because its qi precedes Heaven and Earth, unburdened by form or substance, it can transform the tangible into the intangible. Thus, it transmutes postnatal qi into prenatal qi, becoming pure yang—hence, yang.

One might ask: "If yang is wrapped in yin’s essence, its quality is not firm—how can it be used? Yet you also say it must be nurtured with *yang fire within yin*—why?" This refers to the true fire within the great and small crucibles. The human body, being pure yin, possesses only a single spark of true fire in the *yuanhai* (primordial sea). If yang elixir is used to restrain it, it will no longer flee. Nurturing it further with *yang fire within yin* allows the *huandan* (returned elixir) to coalesce.

Thus, yin essence cannot be cultivated alone; it must be refined in tandem. Through breath and nurturance, the fires of the great and small crucibles are drawn into the body, naturally condensing the returned elixir to enable transformation. In the great and small crucibles, this is called *yang fire within yin*; within the human body, it is *yang essence wrapped in yin*.

The *Ziheche* (Purple River Carriage) in immortal formulas replenishes the ailing body, but it cannot compare to the transformation of form and spirit. *Ziyang Zhenren Wuzhen Pian Zhushu*, Scroll One
*Ziyang Zhenren Wuzhen Pian Zhushu*, Scroll Two

The Xiangchuan Wumingzi Weng Baoguang annotated *Wu Yi Chen Daling’s Collected Transmissions of Ji Qingkongxuanzi Dai Qizong*:

Not knowing the true Lead’s true ancestry,
All efforts are vainly expended.
Dismissing one’s wife severs yin and yang,
Fasting leaves the stomach and bowels empty.
Herbs, trees, gold, and silver are but dregs;
Clouds, mist, sun, and moon remain obscure.
Even with breath-work and visualization,
None compare to the work of the Golden Elixir.

Annotation: The essence of true Lead lies in the qi of the two eights as its origin; all else is not the supreme Dao, and efforts spent are wasted. The *Yimen Pomi Ge* states: "Solitude and widowhood are not the Way; yin and yang lose their fundamental principle." Master Wang Zhen said: "Disciples eager to forsake wives and concubines forget that non-action achieves all." Gao Xiangxian said: "Either yang alone with a widowed wife, or yin alone in solitary rest." These all speak of cultivating yin in isolation or yang in solitude, refining but a single element. Yet some, misunderstanding, cling to this notion and practice bedchamber arts of controlling women, slandering the immortal Dao—where lies the fault? They fail to grasp that the analogy of yang as husband and yin as wife refers not to mundane spouses.

The *Pomi Ge* says: "Fasting is not the Way; after death, one becomes a hungry ghost." All the aforementioned—postnatal substances born of heaven and earth, coarse dregs—are easily encountered yet difficult to perfect. How can they compare to the Golden Elixir’s great medicine?

Annotation: Practices like fasting, breath-work, and visualization are misguided paths followed by commoners and lay practitioners who misinterpret the phrase "forsaking one’s wife." Many mistake the arts of exploring yin for the Golden Elixir. Why not thoroughly study the *Pomi Ge* of the Great White Immortal?
*"Breath-work is not the Way;*
*Saliva is not divine water.*
*Visualization is not the Way;*
*Painting cakes cannot serve as food.*
*Exploring yin is not the Way;*
*Essence exhausted, life follows in death.*
*Abstaining from salt is not the Way;*
*Food loses its savor.*
*Grain avoidance is not the Way;*
*Hunger and weakness harm spleen and stomach.*
*Forsaking one’s wife is not the Way;*
*Yin and yang lose their proper place.*
*What then is truly the Way?*
*The Supreme Unity harbors true qi,*
*Qi intermingling yet not intermingling,*
*Ascending and descending in emulation of heaven and earth.*
*Two substances unite in harmony,*
*Arising from the primordial beginning.*
*Girl and boy, matched in pairing,*
*Complete the perfect balance.*
*These are true yin and yang,*
*Husband and wife sharing one principle.*
*Thus, no need to forsake;*
*How can solitary yang accomplish anything?*
*To emerge as a Golden Immortal,*
*The Golden Elixir is not easily attained.*
*Scholars do not speak of truth,*
*The Great Cavern conceals profound meaning.*
*The Five Phases do not move in sequence;*
*The tiger is born within water.*
*The Five Phases reverse their course;*
*The dragon emerges from fire.*
*These words are truly sublime,*
*Manifesting the power of the Supreme Unity."*

The immortal elder’s regulated verse fundamentally derives from this. The *Yimen Pomi Ge* states:
*"The Supreme Unity contains true qi,*
*The dragon is born within fire,*
*The tiger arises from water,*
*Yin and yang know inversion,*
*Originating from the primordial beginning.*
*The Five Phases do not move in sequence,*
*Yet harmonize with heaven and earth."*
Even the meaning of forsaking one’s wife is not as clearly expressed as in the *Taiyi Ge*. Since people do not understand the inversion of the Five Phases, how can they comprehend that true yin and yang require no forsaking? Those who study immortality, unable to fully grasp the titles of immortal texts, how can they thoroughly ponder and integrate their principles? Thus, the great Way of the Golden Elixir has faded with time, texts lost, nature dimmed, and the Dao obscured. The misinterpretation of "forsaking one’s wife to sever yin and yang" has been distorted into mundane spouses, leading to licentious practices. Alas!

When the Elixir is complete and qi is full, one naturally abstains from grain—not like consuming black beans or sesame seeds to survive famine. Some consume medicines to avoid grain, seeking to endure worldly hardship; how can this achieve the state of a pure yang immortal? Others rely solely on herbs and plants; though they may attain longevity, they do not embody pure yang.

[Right] Admonishing the world, clarifying the great Dao, and refuting heterodox paths. This is Kongxuanzi’s classification.

To study immortality, one must study Heavenly Immortals;
Only the Golden Elixir is most authentic and auspicious.
When the two substances meet, nature and temperament unite;
Where the Five Phases are complete, dragon and tiger coil.
Originally through wu and ji as matchmakers,
Husband and wife are eternally joyful.
Awaiting only the completion of merit to ascend the imperial court,
Amidst ninefold radiance, riding a soaring simurgh.

Annotation: Immortals have several ranks. Those who are spiritually numinous yet formless are Ghost Immortals. Those who live in the world free from illness and vexation, enjoying eternal longevity, are Human Immortals. Those who fly through the air, walk through mist, endure neither hunger nor thirst, resist cold and heat, roam the seas and islands, and live forever without dying are Earthly Immortals. Those whose form and spirit are both wondrous, merging with the Dao, casting no shadow when stepping into sunlight, passing through metal and stone unimpeded, unharmed by water or fire, transforming endlessly, appearing old or young, hidden or manifest, existing or vanishing, condensing into qi or resting into form—whose depths the tortoise and diviner cannot fathom, and whose mysteries ghosts and spirits cannot know—are Heavenly Immortals.

Master Yin Zhenjun said: "Those who can abstain from desire, cultivate embryonic breathing, move the spirit into the husk, enter samadhi, and cast off the corpse, relying on yin transformation without decay, may become lower-grade immortals. Those who receive the talismans of the Six Jia, the Orthodox Unity, the Alliance of Might, the Upper Clarity, the Great Cavern Scriptures, or practice sword arts and corpse liberation, attaining the Dao, are established as Southern Palace Immortals, concealed in grotto-heavens, and become middle-grade immortals. Those who refine the Golden Elixir’s great medicine and attain the Dao, ascending bodily into the heavens, become the highest-grade Heavenly Immortals of the Limitless Upper Realm." Thus, the immortal elder encourages cultivators of truth to set their aspirations boldly, be resolute and unwavering, not settling for middle or lower immortals, but striving directly for the supreme nine-grade Heavenly Immortal.

As for the five metals, eight minerals, cinnabar, mercury, black lead, white tin, red lead, realgar, orpiment, arsenic, sublimed arsenic, verdigris, chalcanthite, autumn stone, herbal frost, water dregs, and refined substances—even one’s own saliva, essence, qi, blood, and fluids—all these are postnatal.

Before Heaven and Earth divided, there existed the primordial True Unity’s qi—this is called "something born from nothing." The sage, through method, gathers and condenses it within a single hour, forming a grain as large as a millet seed, called the Golden Elixir, also known as True Lead, Yang Elixir, True Unity’s Essence, True Unity’s Water, True Water, Water Tiger, or the Supreme Unity’s Containing True Qi. Should one ingest a single grain, one immediately ascends to the sacred realm—this is the celestial examination’s highest rank, the great Dao of Heavenly Immortals, unknown to the world.

The True Unity’s qi arises before Heaven and Earth, blending within the void’s emptiness, faint and indistinct, invisible to sight, inaudible to hearing, untouchable by grasp. How then is it condensed into a millet seed? The sage shapes the real through the empty, manifests the existent through the nonexistent. The real and existent are True Yin and True Yang—emotionless things of the same kind. The empty and nonexistent are the qi of the first crescent of the second and eighth months—possessing qi yet lacking form. When these two take shape, one thing is born. That one thing is the True Unity’s qi, congealed into a millet-seed pearl.

As the scripture says: *"In the beginning, a precious pearl hung, large as a millet seed, within the empty mystery."* This is its proof. Fearing the leakage of Heaven and Earth’s mechanism, the sage uses True Yin and True Yang to illustrate the Azure Dragon and White Tiger, and the qi of the two crescents to illustrate True Lead and True Mercury.

Now, in the immortal elder’s poetic verses, the Azure Dragon’s single entity is further named the Crimson Dragon, Thunder Dragon, Celestial Soul, Qian Image, Qian Crucible, Jade Tripod, Jade Fluid, Fusang, Sea Dragon, Upper Crescent, Eastern Yang, Eldest Son, Cinnabar Mercury, Cinnabar, Cinnabar Tripod, Li Sun, and Crimson Phoenix—all these are but metaphors for the Azure Dragon’s single name. The White Tiger’s single entity is further named the Black Tiger, Dui Tiger, Earthly Soul, Kun Position, Kun Tripod, Metal Tripod, Metal Crucible, Hua Peak, Cliff Tiger, Lower Crescent, Western River, Youngest Daughter, Black Lead, Crescent Moon Crucible, Kan Moon, and Black Tortoise—all these are but metaphors for the White Tiger’s single name.

The Azure Dragon’s crescent qi is called True Mercury, Maiden of Wonder, Wood Fluid, Green Maiden, Mercury within Cinnabar, Mercury within Vermilion, Essence, Emotion, Yellow Sprout, Flowing Pearl, Green Robe, Maiden, Golden Crow, Li Maiden, Female Dragon, True Fire, Maiden of the Second and Eighth Months, Jade Fluid, and Jade Mushroom—yet in truth, it is one. The White Tiger’s crescent qi is called True Lead, Metal Duke, Metal Essence, Gold within Water, Silver within Water, Nature, White Snow, White Silk, Young Gentleman, Jade Hare, Kan Son, True Water, Ninth Third Gentleman, and Knife’s Edge—yet in truth, it is one.

This speaks of the union of the two things when emotion and nature harmonize—the two things being Dragon and Tiger. The Azure Dragon resides in the East; the East pertains to Wood, which generates Fire. The Dragon’s crescent qi is Fire, called Emotion, belonging to the South, known as the Vermilion Bird. The White Tiger resides in the West; the West pertains to Metal, which generates Water. The Tiger’s crescent qi is Water, called Nature, belonging to the North, known as the Dark Warrior.

Dragon-Wood, Tiger-Metal, Emotion-Water, Nature-Fire—these are the Four Symbols. When the Four Symbols converge at the Central Palace to form the Elixir, it is Earth. These are the true Five Phases. When Dragon and Tiger unite, emotion and nature harmonize. When Dragon and Tiger merge to form the Elixir, the Five Phases are complete. Thus it is said: *"When the two things meet, emotion and nature harmonize; where the Five Phases are complete, Dragon and Tiger coil."*

The Wood Dragon in the East and the Metal Tiger in the West are separated—who can make them a pair, husband and wife? Their union depends on the Yellow Dame alone. With the left hand seizing the Dragon and the right hand grasping the Tiger, she makes them merge. Wu and Ji pertain to Earth, hence she is called the Yellow Dame. Though Metal and Wood are separated, the Yellow Dame enables their union. If she can make them pair, is she not the matchmaker who brings joyful union as husband and wife?

When the two are distinct, the True Unity’s qi is concealed. When the two are one, the True Unity’s qi transforms. When the True Unity’s qi transforms, the True Person naturally appears—this is the outer medicine’s symbolic method. After ingesting the Golden Elixir, there follows ten months of refining form into qi. Then, nine years of embracing the One, transforming qi into spirit. Only then can form and spirit both attain perfection, merging with the Dao in truth, receiving records and charts, and ascending as a guest to Heaven.

When the Elixir ripens in the human realm, the Dao is accomplished in the celestial. Enveloped in ninefold rosy clouds, winds arise beneath both armpits, and one rides phoenix and simurgh, soaring through the azure vault. Without prior planting of spiritual roots or amassing of hidden merits, who could attain this?

Lu Ziye said: *"Without the Golden Elixir, the Heavenly Immortal’s Dao cannot be fulfilled."* What is the Golden Elixir? It is clearly one’s own family’s treasure, lodged within the Kun Palace—Kun is the human. What are the two things? Myself and the other. When the other and I meet, emotion and nature harmonize, and the Five Phases are complete. Dragon and Tiger are but emotion and nature. How then does this meeting occur? The meeting is the so-called *"useful within the useless, effort within effortlessness."* *"Dense bamboo does not hinder flowing water; high mountains do not obstruct drifting clouds."*

Wu and Ji are the Center. The Center is the proper position. Wu and Ji are the Earth of Intent. When the intent of the other and myself meet, the joy of husband and wife is attained. Thus Wu and Ji are the homeland of living things, for life depends on intent.

The True Earth has no position; the True Intent has no form—how wondrous, how wondrous!

The *Commentary* states: As the *Anthology of the Transmitted Dao* says, immortality is not singular. Those purely yin without yang are ghosts. Those purely yang without yin are immortals. Those with both yin and yang intermingled are humans. Only humans may become ghosts or immortals. Immortals are of five ranks:

**Ghost Immortals** transcend within yin, their spirit-images unclear, nameless at the Ghost Pass, unrecorded in the Three Mountains. Though they escape the wheel of rebirth, they struggle to return to Penglai and Yingzhou, finding no ultimate refuge, only the cycle of possessing bodies and seizing vessels. For their spirit-awareness turns inward, their single mind undispersed, and from their intent emerges a yin spirit—a luminous ghost, not a purely yang immortal. By their unwavering will, their yin spirit remains undissipated, hence they are called Ghost Immortals. The followers of Śramaṇa who cultivate to this point claim to have attained the Dao—how laughable!

**Human Immortals** cannot fully embody the Great Dao, mastering only a single method or branch. Their practice grants peace, joy, and extended years.

**Earth Immortals** emulate the ascending and descending principles of Heaven and Earth, harnessing the generative numbers of the Sun and Moon. Within the body, they employ years and months; within the day, they employ hours and moments. They recognize the Dragon and Tiger as the pairing of Kan and Li, invert the Five Phases, transmit qi between mother and child, circulate essence between husband and wife, reverse the Three Fields, and refine the elixir. This elixir, eternally lodged in the Lower Field, forges the body to dwell in the world, achieving undying life as a terrestrial immortal.

**Divine Immortals**, weary of dwelling in the dusty world, persist in their practice, refining form into image. The Five Qi ascend to the origin; the Three Yang gather at the crown. When merit is fulfilled and form forgotten, the Embryonic Immortal naturally transforms. Yin is exhausted, yang made pure; a body exists beyond the body. Shedding their form, they ascend as immortals, transcending the subtle to enter sagehood, bidding farewell to the mortal realm to return to the Three Mountains.

**Celestial Immortals**, disdaining the Three Isles, transmit the Dao to humanity. When their merit and conduct fulfill the Ten Realms, their form—a yang within Heaven—becomes formless, achieving the highest attainment in the alchemy of the Elixir. With merit in the world and virtue among people, they receive the Heavenly Scriptures and return to the Grotto-Heavens, ascending to the Eight and then to the Three Clarities. The numinous origin’s "being within non-being" arises from transforming the formed into the formless. At first, there is form; then, "non-being generates being." Taking and ingesting it, the formless becomes form. Once form arises, it can transform the formed into the formless, converting postcelestial qi into precelestial qi. For the formless is the True Unity’s qi, pure and unadulterated within the Tiger. One who knows its mechanism and steals it may entice the True Unity’s qi to ingest a single grain—is this not the effortless attainment of sagehood? Yet how many can achieve this through mere seated meditation, tending the fire and refining the medicine?

In essence, it is one thing. Within this thing, yin and yang intermingle to form the Four Images, which unite as one—Earth at their center, constituting the True Five Phases. When united, they return to their root; when ununited, each harbors the True Unity’s qi within. Since the things are the same, the True Unity’s qi intermingles. As the *Oral Instructions of Shangyan* states: "The two things—when the work is perfected, they appear fresh, lustrous, and white. With effort, the eyes perceive and the heart awakens; how can the formed be transformed and form and spirit both attain subtlety?"

The True Dragon and True Tiger’s qi congeals and generates, dividing into two things. The Four Images and Five Phases unite—only then do the two things become the Elixir. If the heart is steadfast and the mind serene, the numinous radiance shines like the moon—this is the empty chamber generating brightness. One must witness the solar orb’s crimson light surging forth; with continued refinement, the white light vanishes. When these two things are obtained, the foundation of the Elixir is laid.

This method is true within the true, wondrous beyond compare. Only I alone differ from others in knowing this. Who else recognizes the inversion of Li and Kan, the settling of floating and sinking to determine host and guest?

The Golden Crucible seeks to retain cinnabar-wrapped mercury;
The Jade Pool first receives silver within water.
The divine work of tending the fire is not a full day’s labor—
From the deep pool, a single solar orb emerges.

The *Annotation* states: This Dao is most sacred, most wondrous, most noble, most exalted, most simple, most easy—mysterious within the mysterious, wondrous within the wondrous. Rarely is it heard in the world. The Immortal Elder stands above his kind, excelling beyond his peers, uniquely grasping its profound purport. Thus, Master Chongxi said: "Of the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir, none among the world’s Daoists are worthy—only Pingshu alone." He is Mount Tai, the rivers and seas; how dare the hills and puddles aspire to compare?

Li, associated with fire, is yang and resides in the south. Yet it is reversed to become female, outwardly yang but inwardly yin—this is True Mercury. Kan, associated with water, is yin and resides in the north. Yet it is reversed to become male, outwardly yin but inwardly yang—this is True Lead. Thus, the Immortal Elder said:
*"The sun dwells in Li’s position yet becomes female;
Kan pairs with the Toad Palace yet is male.
If you fail to grasp this inversion,
Do not presume to discuss such lofty matters with shallow insight."*

This speaks of Kan’s male and Li’s female as a father’s essence and mother’s blood, the sun’s crow and moon’s hare, cinnabar’s mercury and lead’s silver, Heaven’s mystery and Earth’s yellow. All these point to the Dragon and Tiger’s initial and crescent qi.

Host and guest: yang is noble, high, and resides on the left—this is the host. Yin is lowly and resides on the right—this is the guest. Li is fire, which flames upward; fire’s nature is wood, both floating and yang—hence it is the host. Kan is water, which moistens downward; water’s nature is metal, both sinking and yin—hence it is the guest. This is the ordinary Dao.

Yet now, Li is reversed to become female, and Kan is reversed to become male—thus the host becomes the guest, and the guest becomes the host. Is this not inversion? Hence it is said: *"Only I know the inversion arises from Li and Kan; who recognizes the settling of floating and sinking to determine host and guest?"* Determining host and guest means that within the Dao, one takes the crescent qi and inverts host and guest, not adhering to the ordinary Dao’s host and guest. Thus, it is called "determining host and guest."

Every person possesses the elixir of immortality,
Yet fools, in their ignorance, cast it recklessly aside.
When sweet dew descends, heaven and earth unite;
Where the yellow sprout arises, Kan and Li converge.

The well-frog claims no dragon’s cave exists,
The hedge-sparrow disputes the phoenix’s nest.
The golden crucible: gold is a yin substance,
Yet within the crucible lies the qi of fire—
An image of yang within yin, the White Tiger.
The jade pool: jade is a yang substance,
Yet within the pool lies the qi of water—
An image of yin within yang, the Green Dragon.
Mercury within cinnabar is the crescent qi of the Dragon;
Silver within water is the crescent qi of the Tiger.

For those who refine the elixir,
If one wishes to entice the Tiger’s qi to linger with the Dragon,
First drive the Dragon to the Tiger,
Then let the two substances intermingle,
Their essences conjoined in mutual embrace.
Apply the firing process, and naturally,
The true essence of the One coalesces.
Fire is the crescent qi of the two.
"Dawn" marks the beginning of the day,
And *zi* is the origin of the six yang—
Thus, "daily one."

The sage moves the elixir fire with divine skill,
And in less than half an hour,
Attains the true essence of the One—
A grain like millet appearing in the Northern Sea,
Radiant light piercing through curtains,
Like the red sun emerging from a deep pool.
"Not the entire dawn" signifies the elixir’s completion within a single hour—
Such is the symbolic method of this medicine.

The commentary states:
Kan as male, Li as female;
The sun’s crow, the moon’s hare;
Heaven’s mystery, earth’s yellow.
The golden crucible of yin contains fire,
The jade pool of yang contains water.
Host becomes guest, guest becomes host—
All is the extraction of yang from yin,
The extraction of yin from yang.
Inverting the Five Phases to cultivate in reverse,
One reaches the Supreme Ultimate.
The Supreme Ultimate is the primordial, undifferentiated qi.

The coagulation of the golden elixir is yang,
Yet its fire is not the common flame of the world—
The crescent qi of the two is fire.
The two crescents: at their inception, they are qi without form;
At their source, they are utterly pure, without turbidity.
In the year, they are the balance of yin and yang in the second and eighth months;
In the month, they are the waxing and waning of metal and water at the half-moons.

Master Shangyang, Chen Zhengxu, said:
*"The word ‘wondrous’—who would believe it?"*
Different from others:
While the world is lost in the snares of desire,
I discern within desire itself.
What is this discernment?
The sage employs Li and Kan in inversion—
This is called "fire above, water below."
He employs Qian and Kun in inversion—
This is called "earth above, heaven below."
He employs husband and wife in inversion—
This is called "male below, female above."

Floating and sinking:
Fire flames upward, wood floats above—host;
Water descends, metal sinks below—guest.
This is the human Dao, the worldly method,
The alignment with the Five Phases.
Yet now, though fire and wood float,
They are made to descend and become guest.
Though metal and water should sink,
They are made to ascend and become host.
This is the immortal’s Dao, the otherworldly method,
The completion of water and fire,
The inversion of the Five Phases.

The golden crucible and jade pool,
The radiance of the Dao shines upon the mechanism of inversion—
To lose the meaning of "desiring to retain, first descending" is to err.
Ziye likened the golden crucible to mutuality,
Thereby aligning with Master Ziyang’s intent—how so?
For one’s own essence, qi, blood, and fluids—
This is the cinnabar-clad mercury,
Which must not be allowed to escape.
Thus, it is said: *"Desire to retain the essence of both."*

The numinous pool, elixir well, and cinnabar spring—
This is the silver within water,
The primordial, true qi of the One.
Thus, *"first descending, then desiring to retain"* means
Allowing it to stay without letting it depart,
Seeking to take from the other without losing one’s own.
"First descending" means awaiting the other’s arrival,
Mercury welcoming lead,
Li receiving when Kan moves.

The Dao of the golden elixir first requires grasping
The purport of these four words: *"desiring to retain, first descending."*
The firing process is not confined to dawn—
One must apply gentle warmth.
Thus, the *Cantong Qi* states:
*"The initial firing is gentle and mild,
Like the stirring of a hexagram."*
Master Pure Yang said:
*"In the deep of night, the clepsydra’s waters flow warm,
The lead crucible’s light pierces through curtains."*

For all things, at the inception of generation,
They receive the qi of yin and yang in but a fleeting moment.
How much more so for this Dao of supreme immortality—
The refinement of primordial qi is swift indeed.
Thus, the Buddha said:
*"Like dew, like lightning"*—
Speaking of its utmost subtlety and rapid efficacy,
For it cannot endure long.
Prolonged effort brings harm,
Diminishing the divine work.

If one obtains this primordial true lead
And returns it to the suspended womb chamber,
Is this not like the red sun appearing in a deep pool?

Every person possesses the elixir of immortality,
Yet fools, in their ignorance, cast it recklessly aside.
When sweet dew descends, heaven and earth unite;
Where the yellow sprout arises, Kan and Li converge.
The well-frog claims no dragon’s cave exists,
The hedge-sparrow disputes the phoenix’s nest.
When the elixir ripens, gold naturally fills the house—
Why seek herbs to burn as straw?

The annotation states:
Sweet dew and yellow sprout are alternate names for the golden elixir.
Heaven and earth, Kan and Li, are symbols of Dragon and Tiger.
When the qi of heaven and earth intermingle, sweet dew descends of itself.
When the qi of Kan and Li converge, the yellow sprout arises of itself.
When the Dao of Dragon and Tiger’s two crescents unite,
The true qi of the One coalesces of itself.
This supreme treasure exists in every household,
Yet because it is too near, it is slighted and discarded—
Little do they know it is the divine ladder to ascension.

Modern scholars cling to heterodox paths:
Lone yin, solitary yang,
Something born from something,
Methods easy to encounter yet hard to complete—
They delude themselves,
Unaware that this Dao is simple and easily achieved.
Like the frog at the bottom of the well,
The sparrow amid the hedge,
How could they know of the dragon’s cave or phoenix’s nest?
Once the millet-grain pearl is suspended,
The gold of heaven and earth may be scooped up.

In former times, Shao Gangzhong was deeply versed in the arts of the Yellow and White, and the world styled him the "Lesser King of Huainan." Later, he encountered the immortal elder Master Han Zitao by the waterside, and, facing north, became his disciple. He presented a hundred *yi* of cinnabar and gold to Tao as a pledge, but Tao merely laughed and paid no heed. Shao then cut his arm and swore a blood oath, whereupon Tao at last transmitted the Dao to him.

When the transmission was complete, Tao took a handful of mercury, rinsed his mouth with it, and spat it into a basin of water. The water surged and boiled, and when the bubbling subsided, it had transformed into a lump of purple gold. This demonstrated the wondrous efficacy of the Great Elixir of Internal Alchemy—how could those who toil year after year, tinkering with herbs and burning thatch, ever hope to witness such a thing? The scriptures do not speak in vain of "Earth’s Treasury laid bare, gold and jade revealed in their true form"—this is further proof.

The commentary states: Lü Chunyang turned tiles and stones into gold; the Lady Immortal Geng of Southern Tang molded snow into silver; Chen Niuwan dried mercury in his mouth in an instant. The *Transmission of the Dao Collection* says: "Mercury may be dried in the mouth"—all these are signs of mastery.

**External Medicine**

Tiger leaps, dragon soars—wind and waves surge in the hall,
At the central true position, the Mysterious Pearl is born.
Though the fruit ripens on the branch in its due season,
How is the child in the womb any different?

North and South trace their source to the trigrams’ turning,
Dawn and dusk’s fire-timing aligns with the Celestial Pivot.
Know that the great hermit dwells amid the dusty world—
Why seek seclusion in the deep mountains, guarding solitude alone?

The annotation says: This poem speaks of the symbolic method of the Internal Medicine. The essence of the True One, the work of creation, is called the Golden Elixir when external, and True Earth. When swallowed into one’s belly, it is named True Lead, or Yang Elixir.

Here, the tiger refers to the Golden Elixir. The dragon is one’s true *qi*. One’s true *qi* rises from the Sea of Qi, surging like waves, stirring like wind. The "central true position" is the Golden Womb’s divine chamber within the Cinnabar Field, where the elixir coalesces. The Mysterious Pearl is the true essence that, during the firing process, naturally circulates, ascending from the *weilu* through the spine to the Mud Pill Palace, then descending into the mouth in droplets like sparrow’s eggs, incomparably sweet and fragrant. Swallowed into the Cinnabar Field, it is called the Infant Boy, or the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir.

The millet-grain pearl of the elixir is the *qi* prior to Heaven and Earth, the essence of the True One coalesced. It is the Mother, the Sovereign, the Lead—hence the *Golden Key* calls it Black Lead, or the Water Tiger. One’s true *qi*, born after Heaven and Earth, is the Child, the Minister, the Mercury—hence the *Golden Key* calls it Red Lead, or the Fire Dragon.

The Golden Elixir comes from without; when swallowed into the belly, one’s true *qi* surges upward from the lower Sea of Qi like wind and waves. The elixir, like a minister to the sovereign or a child to its mother, naturally responds. Dragon and tiger unite in the divine chamber, the earthen crucible receives the fire tally, and the Sacred Embryo is nurtured and formed—like fruit ripening on the branch, like a child born in the womb. After ten months of work, the embryo is perfected, and the spirit transforms without limit.

"North and South" refer to the hours of *zi* and *wu*. "Source" refers to the beginning. "Dawn and dusk" are the starts of day and night. *Zi* is the first of the six yang hours, hence dawn employs the *Zhun* hexagram to govern the firing time. *Wu* is the origin of the six yin hours, hence dusk employs the *Meng* hexagram to govern the watering time. Each day, two hexagrams govern the work, and after thirty days, the cycle ends with *Jiji* and *Weiji*, then begins anew, revolving without cease—hence it is called "turning the trigrams’ image."

The *Cantong Qi* says: "At dawn, *Zhun* governs the work; by dusk, *Meng* takes its turn. Day and night, each hexagram is used in sequence. From the first to the last day of the month, the cycle ends and begins again." Each day, two hexagrams govern the work, along with the four hexagrams of *Qian* and *Kun*, totaling sixty-four hexagrams and 384 lines in a month—corresponding to the days of a year, including intercalary months.

*Qian*’s first nine begins with *Kun*’s initial six. *Qian*’s thirty-six lines total 216. *Kun*’s initial six begins with *Qian*’s first nine, and *Kun*’s twenty-four lines total 144. Together, they sum to 360, matching the number of the celestial circuit. The movements of the sun and moon—their conjunctions, ascents, and descents—all unfold within the hexagrams and lines.

The moon moves swiftly, completing one circuit in a month; the sun moves slowly, completing one in a year. The "Celestial Pivot" is the pole of the Northern Dipper. In a day and night, it completes one circuit, shifting once a month. For example, the first month is aligned with *yin*, the second with *mao*. In the first month, when the sun has not yet passed the palace division, *yin* is placed over *hai*, and *zi* is established at *you*—thus, in the first month, the Dipper’s handle points to *zi* at the *you* hour. If the sun has passed the palace division, *yin* is placed over *xu*, and *wu* is established at *yin*—thus, in the first month, the Dipper’s handle points to *wu* at the *yin* hour.

The superior adept, the perfected one, understands the rise and fall of yin and yang, the waxing and waning of the sun and moon. They practice the *zi-wu* fire tally, day and night, counting the months and aligning with the seasons. Only then do their timings accord with the celestial degrees, following the Dipper’s movement in every detail—hence it is called "aligning with the Celestial Pivot." The Celestial Pivot is the Dipper’s pole.

The *Yimen Song* says: "Within the twelve gates of Heaven, one acts as the monthly establishment shifts. The water clock follows the time, rotating in sequence—this is its meaning." The subtlety of the supreme Dao lies herein. The ascent and descent of *Kan* and *Li* give birth to the numinous medicine, coalescing the Yellow Sprout.

Another version states: For example, in the first month aligned with *yin*, at the *xu* hour of the *Lichun* solar term, the handle points to *gen*; at the *xu* hour of the *Yushui* solar term, it points to *yin*. Thus it is said: "Each month, constantly add *xu*; at every hour, observe the Breaking Army."

The Great Elixir of Golden Cinnabar is possessed by every household, unbound by marketplace or court. Yet how many recognize the Dragon when they see it, or the Tiger when they behold it? Those who cultivate it in reverse—how few they are! In but a fleeting moment, a single treasure coalesces, a pearl as large as a grain of millet.

An ancient poem says:
*Placed upon the palm, its rosy glow dazzles;
Swallowed into the belly, the palace halls renew.*

Another verse declares:
*The Great Dao hides within the court and market—
Do those in the mountains know or not?*

A commentary explains: The Golden Cinnabar forms from the *qi* of Primordial Heaven, yet through the *qi* of the postnatal body, it undergoes transformation. The surging of wind and waves describes the meeting of the body’s *qi* with the Golden Elixir. The birth of the Mysterious Pearl speaks of the intertwining of the body’s *qi* with the Golden Elixir.

The *zi* and *wu* of the sun follow its daily course; the *zi* and *wu* of the Dipper stem from its initial pointing. These *zi* and *wu* mark the cardinal directions of Earth. When fully mastered and applied, they move in harmony with the sun and Dipper—this is the true oral transmission of the master.

Where the sun converges, spirit gathers—commonly called the "monthly general." Where the Dipper points, *qi* stirs—commonly called the "monthly establishment." Aligning with celestial degrees, one employs the sun’s *zi* and *wu*, following the Dipper’s movement in its operation.

The Dipper’s *zi* and *wu* divide day and night by degrees: *zi* governs day, *wu* governs night. The moon responds to the timely addition of *xu* degrees: *zi* generates, *wu* wanes. "South and north" refer to *zi* and *wu*; "dawn and dusk" likewise refer to *zi* and *wu*. From *zi* to *si* is dawn; from *wu* to *hai* is dusk. This is the immortals’ dawn and dusk, not the worldly dawn and dusk of sunrise and sunset.

Another method of celestial presentation: at the solar terms, the monthly establishment is added to *hai*, and at the midpoints, it is added to *xu*, to determine the Dipper’s pointing for each time.

After Master Peng completed *The True Meaning of the "Cantong Qi" Divided into Chapters*, he read the four lines on the inversion of the Five Phases and their non-sequential movement, perceiving them as revealing the mechanism of Heaven and Earth’s mutual operation and the Dao of yin-yang’s cyclical return. Thus, he became enamored with the Black Lead and Water Tiger, expounding upon the Red Lead and Fire Dragon in a text titled *The Golden Flute Key to the Inner Image of Returned Cinnabar*, wherein he discussed the Tiger’s essence and the Dragon’s function—all concerning the creation and transformation of the Great Elixir. Now, the Nameless One borrows this to distinguish between the inner and outer elixirs, adopting only its title, not its text. Though this diverges from the original intent of the True One, its principles remain coherent.

**Inner Medicine**

In the *Commentary and Annotations on Master Ziyang’s "Awakening to Reality"*, Volume Two (the character *gu* [谷] is amended here according to the text’s meaning), Volume Three:

The Yellow Sprout and White Snow are not hard to find—
The adept must seek them through virtue and conduct.
The Four Images and Five Phases rely entirely on Earth;
The Three Origins and Eight Trigrams—how could they leave *ren*?

Refined into a numinous essence, few recognize it;
Dissolving all yin demons, no ghost may invade.
Wishing to leave this secret formula among men—
Yet not one soul has proven a true confidant.

A note explains: The Dragon’s latent *qi* is called the Yellow Sprout; the Tiger’s latent *qi* is called the White Snow. The root of the Great Medicine truly lies herein. The Dao is utterly simple; the practice is not difficult. Yet without great merit and noble deeds, one cannot encounter a true master to transmit its mysteries.

The Great Dao originates from the Void, giving birth to the One *Qi*; the One *Qi* generates yin and yang, called Dragon and Tiger. The Dragon (Wood) engenders Fire; the Tiger (Metal) engenders Water. Wood, Fire, Metal, and Water combine to form the Four Images; the Four Images unite to form the Elixir. The Elixir’s formation depends on Earth, which has no fixed position but is distributed across the four seasons. Without Earth in the four seasons, the four phases cannot proceed, and the myriad things cannot be born and completed. Thus, the Four Images and Five Phases rely entirely on Earth.

*Ren* is Water, the *qi* of the True One, also called the True One Water. It arises before Heaven and Earth, transforming into the yang Dragon and yin Tiger. The Dragon and Tiger unite to form the Elixir—Earth. The Dragon is Wood; the Tiger is Metal. These are the Three Natures, the Three Origins, inseparable from the transformations of the True One Water.

The Eight Trigrams arise from the *qi* of the True One: first, it transforms into Heaven, called *Qian*, the Father. Second, it transforms into Earth, called *Kun*, the Mother. *Qian*, with its yang *qi*, seeks *Kun*’s yin *qi*: at the first seeking, it generates the Eldest Son, *Zhen*; at the second seeking, the Middle Son, *Kan*; at the third seeking, the Youngest Son, *Gen*—these are the three yang sons born of *Qian*’s *qi* uniting with *Kun*’s *qi*. Then, *Kun*, with its yin *qi*, seeks *Qian*’s yang *qi*: at the first seeking, it generates the Eldest Daughter, *Xun*; at the second seeking, the Middle Daughter, *Li*; at the third seeking, the Youngest Daughter, *Dui*—these are the three yin daughters born of *Kun*’s *qi* uniting with *Qian*’s *qi*. Neither do they depart from the transformations of the True One Water. Thus, it is said: *The Three Origins and Eight Trigrams—how could they leave ren?*

Not only do the Three Origins and Eight Trigrams not depart from the essence of the True One, but since the beginning of creation, all things with form and name have arisen and transformed through it. The True One says: The essence of the True One is the Mother of Heaven and Earth, the Root of Yin and Yang, the Origin of Water and Fire, the Ancestor of Sun and Moon, the Source of the Three Powers, and the Progenitor of the Five Phases. The myriad things rely on it for birth and completion; the thousand spirits depend on it for flourishing or withering. Even the vastness of Heaven and Earth, the grottoes and sacred mountains, the celestial bodies and numinous officials, the immortals and sages, wind and rain, darkness and light, spring and summer, autumn and winter—before any sign appears, all arise from it. The *qi* of Lead emerges and undergoes transformation.

The cultivator of the Elixir who obtains the True One Water has accomplished everything. Swallowing the True One’s grain into the five viscera and refining it with fire for ten months, all residual yin is purged, transmuting into a pure yang immortal of the True One. Yin demons and corpse-ghosts flee with no escape. The immortal wishes to leave this secret among men, yet no one has proven a true confidant—so vast is the gulf, so distant from human sentiment.

For those whose virtuous roots are sown and whose numinous bones are forged, the attainment of immortality may be hoped for. The forging of numinous bones and the sowing of virtuous roots do not occur in one or two lifetimes, but over countless billions of lives, wherein all manner of good roots are planted. Only then, upon emerging, does one float free with the bearing of one who has transcended the dust. Alas! Those who are but walking bones and moving corpses, clutching a single alms bowl and begging bowl, yet aspire to ascend as immortals—such men are not easily found among the ranks of the transcendent. Why not examine one’s own heart and compare it to the heart of the common man: is there a difference, or is there none?

My own immortal work knows no bounds; I take vast transformation and adaptability as my duty, standing alone above the world, like a crane among chickens. Though others laugh at me as impractical and eccentric, I know I am no mere mortal. The crimson essence of the pine is my friend; Penglai and Fangzhang are my home. Naturally, I have encountered extraordinary individuals who have transmitted the supreme Dao, forming bonds with kindred spirits. With a single grain of elixir, the work is complete.

The immortal elder wishes to leave this untransmitted secret among men, yet one cannot blame him for rarely encountering a true confidant—how could such a person be found? The commentary states: "Earth" refers to the place where all things converge. "Ren" signifies the inception of all life. The True One Water is the *qi* before form takes shape; the True One’s grain is the *qi* after form has arisen. The Four Symbols each harbor true earth; one and four make five, two and three make five—thus the Four Symbols are all earth. *Ren* is water, born of Heaven’s One. *Ren* stands at the forefront of *zi*, the first of the yang. *Ren* at the forefront of *zi* refers to the transition from *hai* to *zi*. It is the origin of generative *qi*, the first of the Five Phases, and thus all things begin with *ren*.

Master True One says: The essence of the True One alone brings about transformation. This passage comes from *The Golden Key*. All lead and mercury arise from it—this is the True One Water, *ren*. Diligently seek the true lead; do not let time slip by in vain. Simply capture the earthly *po* to subdue the cinnabar mercury, and the celestial *hun* will naturally restrain the watery metal. This may be called: the Dao is lofty, and dragons and tigers submit; the virtue is weighty, and ghosts and spirits revere. Once you know your life will be as enduring as Heaven and Earth, no vexations will ever trouble your heart again.

The annotation states: True lead is the golden elixir. The earthly *po*, in external medicine, is the White Tiger; in internal medicine, it is the golden elixir. The celestial *hun*, in external medicine, is the Green Dragon; in internal medicine, it is one’s own body. Cinnabar mercury, in external alchemy, is the coiled *qi* of the dragon; internally, it is one’s own true *qi*. Watery metal, in external alchemy, is the coiled *qi* of the tiger; internally, it is the golden elixir. It is also called mercury enveloped in cinnabar, or silver within water. The above illustrates both internal and external processes.

The immortal elder urges those who cultivate the truth to swiftly refine the golden elixir and transcend life and death, lest they waste their days in vain. Simply capture the White Tiger to subdue the dragon, and the Green Dragon will naturally restrain the tiger. When these two *qi* intertwine and bind, the golden elixir is born. Once obtained, swallow this golden elixir into the abdomen to capture one’s own true *qi*. As the true *qi* clings to the golden elixir, the sacred embryo forms. When the inner true dragon descends, the external dragons and tigers of the world naturally submit. When the inner refinement of spirit, soul, ghosts, and *po* attains sanctity, the ghosts and spirits of the world naturally revere. If the Dao is not profound and virtue not abundant, how could dragons achieve this? With the body transformed into pure yang, life endures as long as Heaven and Earth. Roaming beyond the mundane, at ease among men, all thoughts dissolve—what vexations could remain?

Lu Ziye says: The earthly *po* is lead; the celestial *hun* is mercury. To restrain mercury with lead is a matter of self and other. Do not refine the Three Yellows or Four Spirits; if you seek among grasses, it will not be the truth. Only when yin and yang are of the same kind do they interact; when two and eight correspond, they naturally unite. When the sun at the bottom of the pool glows red, yin monsters vanish; when the moon atop the mountain shines white, the medicinal sprout is fresh. If men wish to know true lead and mercury, they must understand these are not ordinary cinnabar or quicksilver.

The annotation states: The Three Yellows and Four Spirits—minerals, metals, and plants—are all born of the postnatal world, impure substances. How could they transform the formed into the formless? Without internal and external alignment, the embryo cannot form; flowers cannot bear fruit. The *qi* of the True One arises before Heaven and Earth, profound and unfathomable, beyond measure. Only when two and eight, being of the same kind and correspondence, unite and bind, does interaction occur. Within this binding and interaction, a semblance arises—an emotion without emotion, a color without color—just as eight ounces of crow’s liver and half a catty of hare’s marrow. When these two corresponding elements of two and eight unite, the *qi* of the True One returns to the cavity of interaction, congealing into a grain of millet. Herein lies the marvel of the Dao.

The pool is yin; the sun is yang. The red sun at the bottom of the pool is yang within yin. Yang within yin is pure yang, devoid of yin *qi*—thus the yin monsters vanish. This is the coiled *qi* of the tiger, called red lead. The mountain is yang; the moon is yin. The white moon atop the mountain is yin within yang. This is the coiled *qi* of the dragon, the initial coiled *qi*—hence the medicinal sprout is fresh—called black lead. Lead becomes mercury. An ancient song says: Red lead and black mercury are the great heads of the elixir; to merge red into black is true cultivation. This is what it means.

The sage uses these two substances to, in a single moment, transform and create a grain of yang elixir. In the midst of the Northern Sea, it blazes like the sun, its light piercing through curtains. Immediately, it is plucked and swallowed into the abdomen, where it refines one’s yin mercury. All the yin and perverse *qi* of the body are thereby extinguished—just as when the dawn sun first rises from the Eastern Sea, blazing brilliantly, all yin monsters vanish. The yin mercury, descending from the lower cinnabar field to the peak of the summit, gradually congeals, newly sprouting and tender, thus the medicinal sprout is fresh.

Just as the moon at the first dawn of the new moon meets the sun and suddenly receives the *qi* of the Great Yang, when the sun sets, it emits a faint glow in the west, appearing like a crescent on the *geng* position, its light fresh and tender—like the medicinal sprout newly born.

This describes the symbolic forms of the inner and outer elixirs. The *Western Florescence Scripture* states: "The yin within yang is called the Maiden; the yang within yin is called the Metal Duke." These are the husband and wife within the crucible, the stairway to the Purple Palace. Those who awaken to this see immortals before their eyes; those who remain deluded are separated by endless sands.

The true lead and true mercury of the outer elixir are the initial *qi* of the Dragon and Tiger. The true lead and true mercury within are the Golden Elixir and one’s own true *qi*. If one seeks to recognize true lead and mercury, only these are genuine—all else is not the true Way. These two true substances can transform the tangible into the intangible, becoming perfected beings and immortals. How could mere cinnabar and mercury compare?

A commentary states: Most elixir scriptures transmitted in the world extract mercury from cinnabar and call it true mercury, or use cinnabar as the golden body. Refining them into an elixir wastes both wealth and years, with little success. Even if achieved, many who consume it lose their lives—all because they fail to recognize true lead and true mercury.

*"Not knowing the inversion within the mysterious,*
*How can one plant lotuses in fire?*
*Lead the White Tiger home to nurture,*
*And bear a luminous pearl like the full moon.*
*Guard the furnace and watch the fire’s timing,*
*But let spirit and breath follow nature.*
*When yin’s husk is stripped away, the elixir ripens,*
*Leaping from the cage to live ten thousand years."*

A note explains: By human standards, a man cannot conceive, nor can lotuses grow in fire. Yet the Dao of immortals is wondrous and inverted—it enables a man to conceive, just as lotuses grow in fire. Why? The sun (*li*) is male yet becomes female; the moon (*kan*) is female yet becomes male—this is the meaning of inversion. When these two are inverted, they generate the elixir. Using the elixir to refine one’s yin mercury and form the sacred embryo, nurturing the immortal infant, is like a man conceiving—just as planting lotuses in fire. Is this not inversion?

Thus, the immortal elder, expounding the *Triple Concordance*, said: *"The Five Phases move in reverse—*
*The elixir’s body remains ever-spiritual, ever-abiding."*
Water reverses into earth, earth into wood, wood into metal, metal into fire, fire into water—this is the profound meaning of inversion. The principle of inversion is now clear.

The Green Dragon and White Tiger are originally the essence of the True One, transformed into two substances, positioned east and west—truly the same in origin but different in name. The essence of the True One pertains to mercury; mercury is the Dragon, in the east, so the essence of the True One resides in the east. The White Tiger is the child of the True One’s essence, born in the west but with its home in the east. Thus, the immortal elder said: *"The Metal Duke is originally the son of the eastern house,*
*Sent to the western neighbor to be born.*
*Recognize and call him home to nurture,*
*Pair him with the Maiden to wed."*

The Metal Duke is lead; the Maiden is mercury. Using lead to refine one’s own mercury and form the sacred embryo is like leading the White Tiger home to nurture, pairing it with the Green Dragon as husband and wife, producing a luminous pearl like the full moon.

The "full moon" refers to the adept first gathering the half-moon from the upper west, obtaining eight ounces of yang metal. Next, they gather the half-moon from the lower east, obtaining half a catty of crescent water. Combining the *qi* of these two half-moons generates the elixir—thus, the single grain of Golden Elixir resembles the full moon. This aligns with Master Daoguang’s Chan saying: *"A single grain of numinous elixir weighs one catty,"* for two eight-ounce measures combine into one catty, echoing the immortal elder’s full-moon imagery. This metaphor describes the symbolic form of the outer elixir.

When this elixir is swallowed into the abdomen, the Golden Elixir becomes the White Tiger. Leading this White Tiger into one’s own body and pairing it with one’s mercury, then circulating the yin tally and yang fire through the sixty-four hexagrams, one refines it into the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir—a single grain also weighing one catty, like the full moon. This metaphor describes the symbolic form of the inner elixir.

The inner elixir resembles the full moon because the fire-circulating hexagrams each have six lines, and sixty-four hexagrams total 384 lines, corresponding to one catty and 384 *zhu*. The outer elixir resembles the full moon because one catty comprises the upper and lower crescents, the two eights of the half-moons. As the *Triple Concordance* states: *"The upper crescent *dui* is eight,*
*The lower crescent *gen* is eight.*
*When the two crescents merge their essence,*
*The body of *qian* and *kun* is complete.*
*Two eights make one catty—*
*The Dao of Change stands firm and true."*

Thus, Master True One said: The upper and lower crescents, one catty, divide into 384 *zhu*, used to circulate the fire tally and hexagram lines. The immortal elder’s full-moon imagery aims to make scholars thoroughly understand the workings of creation, distinguishing the inner and outer eights—one cannot generalize them.

Fire is not the fire of the human world but the primordial ancestral *qi*, the *qi* of yin and yang without form. There is no medicine to guard—such talk is mere idle chatter. Master Azure Radiance said:

*"The crucible is not a metal crucible,*
*The furnace is not a jade furnace.*
*Fire arises from below *li*,*
*Water accords with *kan*.*
*When the three natures unite,*
*The two substances naturally bind.*
*The embryo is sealed and not leaked—*
*Transformation occurs in an instant."*

Gao Xiangxian said:

*"Heaven and earth intermingle,*
*Male and female join in essence.*
*The four images and five phases follow like spokes to a hub,*
*Day and night, *zhun* and *meng*, follow nature—*
*Why laboriously watch the fire’s timing?"*

This speaks of the crucible and furnace of the human world—it is the fire within the natural crucible and furnace. Simply settle the spirit and regulate the breath, allowing it to follow nature. Harmonize the civil and martial, and the tally will align with the clepsydra without the slightest deviation. In less than half an hour, the elixir is immediately obtained. Thereafter, proceed with this method of advance and retreat, yin tally and yang fire, applying the techniques of withdrawal and addition, guarding against danger and anticipating peril. After ten months, the work is complete, all yin is stripped away, and the body transforms into pure yang, leaping from the cage of the mundane to attain ten thousand years of longevity. This method yields the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir, yet it has not yet entered the sublime. Only after embracing the One for nine years, allowing qi to return to spirit, does it become the Ninefold Transmutation of the Great Returned Golden Liquir. At this time, form and spirit are both wondrous, and one merges with the Dao in truth.

The *Shu* states: Mercury is the flowing pearl of the Great Yang. Obtaining the golden radiance, it congeals into the golden elixir, originally born from the flowing pearl of the Great Yang. The flowing pearl of the Great Yang is in turn born from the Azure Dragon of the East, thus it is the child of the East—this is Metal Lord. Metal Lord is the golden elixir. Originally the child of the Eastern household, the flowing pearl of the Great Yang lodges its body in the golden radiance of the West to be born. Zhang Suizhu’s commentary on the *Cantong Qi* says: "A month has thirty days, three hundred sixty hours, resembling the small crucible and furnace. A year has twelve months, with the hexagram qi’s seasonal measures and the fire’s advance and retreat, resembling the great crucible and furnace." Expounding upon this yields six hundred chapters—this is not the fire of the human world. The immortals sigh that mortals do not recognize the true fire, so they devise hexagrams and lines to symbolize it. The hexagrams are but the fish-trap and rabbit-snare of fire. Once the fire’s function is seen, the hexagrams and lines may be forgotten. The commentary of Master Wuming follows this principle.

One must know where the medicine’s river-source arises—only in the southwest is its homeland. When lead meets the birth of *gui*, hasten to gather it; when metal encounters the distant full moon, it is no longer fit to taste. Send it back to the earthen cauldron, seal it firmly, then enter the flowing pearls to pair and match. The medicine weighs one *jin* and requires two eights; harmonize the fire’s timing by entrusting it to yin and yang.

The *Zhu* states: The *Xihua Jing* says: "The medicine is born in the West and gathered into *wu* and *ji*." When the time is ripe, the day to apply effort arrives. The southwest is the land of *kun*, where the tiger is born. The *kun* direction is also where the moon is born, hence it is called the root of the moon. This is the essence of metal and water; when the upper and lower crescents unite in qi, the elixir is formed. Thus, the source of the golden elixir’s medicinal herbs and river-origin truly emerges from the land of *kun*. When lead encounters the birth of *gui*, the time approaches *chou*. When metal meets the distant full moon, the moon is about to wane.

The moon’s fullness lies in oral transmission,
The mystery of the *zi* hour rests in heart-to-heart teaching.
The *zhou*-heaven’s breath counts in subtle numbers,
The jade clepsydra’s cold drips match each measure.
This is the true esoteric secret passed mouth to mouth.

Lu Sicheng, in his *Postscript to the Wuzhen Pian*, states: Those who transmit these verses often misread *qian* (lead) as *ruo* (as if) and *jin* (metal) as *ru* (like), greatly distorting the Immortal Elder’s intent. Lead and metal are none other than the golden elixir. Master Lu exposed the error of mistaking characters for their homophones, guarding the source lest it be spread carelessly in texts. We who have received the master’s direct teaching should understand this. If not, in the vast emptiness, five *zhang* above the earth, the pearl the size of a millet grain is not easily obtained.

Alas, how many stray paths confuse cinnabar with lead and metal, seeking them at the *tian gui* hour—truly child’s play. There is also the theory of *kun* receiving *gui*, as in Ye Wenshu’s case, which deserves only a laugh. For the golden elixir, work begins at the *gui* day’s *zi* hour; one must not exceed the moment by even a breath. As the full moon recedes, the moon wanes and its *qi* weakens, making it unfit for gathering.

On the *gui* day, when the hidden *ren-zi* hour arrives, celestial *ren* and terrestrial *gui* meet in the north. Thus, Zhu Zhen’s *Yi Commentary* states: "At the dark moon’s dawn, the *kan* moon and *li* sun meet at *ren* and *gui*. The *kan* moon is *wu*; the *li* sun is *ji*." It also says: "On the third day, *zhen* rises at dusk, symbolizing the moon emerging at *geng*. On the eighth day, *dui* appears, symbolizing the moon revealing *ding*. On the fifteenth, *qian* is full, symbolizing the moon’s plenitude at *jia* and *ren*. On the sixteenth, the sun shifts to *xun*, symbolizing the moon’s retreat at *xin*. On the twenty-third, *gen* wanes, symbolizing the moon’s decline at *bing*. On the thirtieth, *kun* conceals it, symbolizing the moon’s disappearance, hiding *yi* and storing *gui*."

At the dark moon’s dawn, the moon’s *kan* water flows to *wu*, and the sun’s *li* fire converges on *ji*. This is the celestial mechanism’s essential secret—meant for oral transmission, difficult to convey in writing. Without a true master, one can only vainly guess and force interpretations.

Ingest the elixir into the *dan tian*’s earthen crucible, sealing the embryo to prevent leakage. Circulate the fiery-flowing pearl of mercury to pair with it, and the sacred embryo will congeal. Eight ounces of crow’s liver and half a *jin* of hare’s marrow combine into one *jin*—hence the saying, "The medicine weighs one *jin* and requires two eights." The fire is not truly fire; it merely borrows the *yin* and *yang* *qi*, adjusting and applying them.

**Commentary:**
People, at the time of *gui*’s birth, either seek *tian gui* or trace the *gui* hour, unaware of the *Wuzhen Pian*’s secret. "The time approaches *chou*" means the moment has passed; "the moon is about to wane" means the day has passed. Once day and hour have passed, the lead that was stirring will dissipate, and the metal that was full will wane. Seeking yields nothing; tasting brings no effect. The *Yi* says: "...water flows to the damp, fire moves to the dry." Flowing and converging are the natures of water and fire. *Wu* and *ji* are the earth within water and fire. Water flows and fire converges, both embracing *wu* and *ji* to generate and complete. *Ren* and *gui* are where the sun and moon conceal their functions; *wu* and *ji* are where they display their brilliance. *Ren* and *gui* encircle *zi*; *wu* and *ji* encircle *wu*. *Zi* and *wu*, new and full moons, the sun and moon’s ethereal and corporeal souls—these are the golden elixir’s wondrous workings. Details appear in the *xiao zhou tian* numbers of a single month.

*Yang* is fire, and *yin* is also fire. The fire is not truly fire; it is the essence-*qi* of heaven and earth, sun and moon, borrowed and applied. Though ten thousand volumes of immortal scriptures exist, the golden elixir’s root lies solely here. Following the *kun* position’s generative principle, plant it in the *qian* household’s chamber of union.

Do not blame the celestial mechanism for being fully revealed—only that scholars remain ignorant. If one grasps the poem’s meaning, one will immediately meet the Three Pure Ones and the Supreme Elder.

**Commentary:**
All ten thousand volumes of immortal scriptures ultimately converge: none but the *qi* of the dragon and tiger’s two eights’ initial crescent serve as the elixir’s substance. Following the *kun* mother’s generative principle in reverse cultivation, after obtaining the elixir, plant it in the *qian* father’s chamber of union to circulate the fire’s tally. The essentials of elixir refinement do not exceed the two words *lead* and *fire*—lead and fire are the great elixir’s foundation. The Immortal Elder revealed the celestial mechanism entirely, yet scholars, though white-haired, remain confused. Why not seek it within oneself to illuminate the supreme Way, congeal a single millet grain, and immediately ascend to heaven?

**Commentary:**
As Cui Gong’s *Ruyao Jing* says: "Born in *kun*, planted in *qian*." Born in *kun* is the external medicine of primordial *qi*; planted in *qian* is the internal medicine of later heaven’s *qi*. The *kun* mother’s generative principle: the *kun* position is the southwest, where the moon emerges at *geng*, where metal and water are generated, and the two crescents’ wondrous workings—this is "born in *kun*." The *qian* father’s chamber of union: the central palace’s northern sea, like *qian*’s position in the northwest. Ingesting the elixir within, lead and mercury unite and transform—this is "planted in *qian*."

Lead is the White Tiger. Fire is the Green Dragon. The White Tiger’s crescent-*qi* lead is also water; the Green Dragon’s crescent-*qi* fire is no ordinary fire. Lead is the moon’s essence, born of water, completed in metal, possessing substance and *qi*—the root of heaven and earth’s wondrous transformations. Fire is the sun’s essence, born of wood, overcoming metal, possessing *qi* but no substance—the origin of heaven and earth’s generation. Thus, the essentials of elixir refinement and the great elixir’s foundation do not exceed lead and fire.

Lu Ziye said: The earth is the *kun* position; I am the *qian* lineage. Borrowing the *qi* of creation from within *kun*, I plant the numinous root beneath my household to form the sacred embryo. The principles of ten thousand volumes and a thousand scriptures do not surpass this.

Three, five, and one—three words in all,
Rare indeed are those who understand them through the ages.
East’s three and south’s two together make five,
North’s one and west’s four complete them.

"Wu and Ji naturally return to the generative number five; the three families meet to form the sacred infant. Thus we know the Great One contains the true *qi*—after ten months, the embryo is complete, entering the foundation of sageliness."

**Annotation states:** The "three, five, and one" do not depart from dragon and tiger. The dragon pertains to wood, wood’s number is three, residing in the east. Wood can generate fire, thus the dragon’s crescent *qi* pertains to fire. Fire’s number is two, residing in the south. The two things share a single source, so three and two combine to form one five. The tiger pertains to metal, metal’s number is four, residing in the west. Metal can generate water, thus the tiger’s crescent *qi* pertains to water, water’s number is one, residing in the north. The two things share a single palace, so four and one combine to form a second five. The two fives of these two things converge within the central palace of Wu and Ji. The central palace pertains to earth, earth’s generative number is five—this is the three fives. When the three fives unite, they form the elixir; the elixir is one, hence it is called "three, five, one." These three words—from ancient times to the present, those who can unite the three, five, and one to form the elixir and comprehend the sacred infant are truly rare. The "one" is the golden elixir. The "infant" is the elixir itself. The elixir is one; one is the true *qi* of the Great One, the mother-*qi* of heaven and earth. One’s own true *qi* is the child-*qi* of heaven and earth. Drawing the mother-*qi* inward to subdue the child-*qi* is like a cat crouching over a mouse to prevent its escape. When mother and child *qi* long for each other, within the womb they coalesce into the sacred infant—hence, "the Great One contains the true *qi*." This speaks of containing the true *qi* of the Great One, like a person carrying a child for ten months until full term, then giving birth to the sacred embryo. Likewise, after ten months of practice, the work is complete, and one naturally becomes spiritually sagely—hence, "after ten months, the embryo is complete, entering the foundation of sageliness." Later generations take the kidneys as the sacred infant, but how could they achieve such efficacy?

**Commentary states:** One, two, three, four, five are generative numbers—generative, they have signs but no form, not the five phases of the mundane world with substance, but the *qi* of heaven and earth’s emptiness and nothingness, this is the prior heaven. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten are completion numbers—completion, they have form, not the prior heaven’s formless five phases, this is the posterior heaven. Heaven’s one and earth’s four make five, combined with the central five to complete ten. Heaven’s three and earth’s two make five, combined with the central five to complete ten. The two fives pair, also combining into the heavenly number twenty-five. The golden elixir is formed from the prior heaven’s five phases, thus it only takes the generative numbers of the five phases. The kidneys as the sacred infant and the heart as the young maiden arise from the inner and outer two visions. The methods of visualizing spirits and ghosts are all yin—thus they yield no efficacy.

**Internal Medicine Division.**
Five words, four rhymes, one verse to symbolize the singularity of the Great One:

A maiden wears blue robes,
A young lord dons white silk.
Seen, they cannot be used;
Used, they cannot be seen.
Within the dim and vague, they meet,
In the distant and obscure, transformation occurs.
*(One version reads: When husband and wife meet, their affection naturally deepens.)*
In an instant, flames fly—
The true person emerges of itself.

**Annotation states:** The "maiden" is the dragon’s crescent *qi*, yang within yin—hence called a maiden, also named "Wood Maiden." Born of the Azure Dragon, she wears blue robes. The "young lord" is the tiger’s crescent *qi*, yin within yang—hence called a young lord, also named "Metal Lad." Born of the White Tiger, he dons white silk. Those with substance that can be seen are the impure, material things of the posterior heaven—because they have substance, they can be seen but cannot be used. Those without form that cannot be beheld are the initial crescent *qi* of the dragon and tiger—because they have *qi* but no substance, they cannot be seen but can be used, truly the pivot of lead extraction. The dim and vague, distant and obscure are the primordial true *qi* of the undifferentiated origin, born before heaven and earth, beyond measure. Within the dim and vague lies a thing—the dragon’s crescent *qi*. Within the distant and obscure lies an essence—the tiger’s crescent *qi*. The *qi* of these two children resides within the dim and vague, the distant and obscure, where they meet in embrace, longing in profound affection. Thus the true *qi* of the Great One, spiritually numinous yet insubstantial, transforms into a grain of millet’s pearl—this is the wonder of nothing giving birth to being. The "true person" is the golden elixir. The sage condenses a year’s fire phases into a single hour, and within that hour divides them into six phases. First, within two phases, the fire is circulated to refine and forge, immediately obtaining the true *qi* of the Great One, coalescing into a single grain of pearl, appearing within the Northern Sea, large as a grain of millet. Is this not an instant of fire when the true person emerges of itself? This Way is most wondrous and mysterious—without encountering a true teacher to transmit the oral instructions, who could attain this? The immortal master chanted this chapter, thus five words and four rhymes in one verse, to represent the five phases and four images forming a single grain of millet pearl. Though the elixir is transformed from the true *qi* of the Great One, without the dragon and tiger’s two crescent *qi* uniting, it could not become the elixir. The dragon and tiger together with their two crescents are the four images; the four images converge within the central palace to form the elixir. The elixir is earth—it is the true five phases. Laozi said: "The five phases are the medicine; the four images cannot be lacking." Thus the five phases and four images unite to form the elixir—hence the immortal master said, "five words, four rhymes, one verse to symbolize the singularity of the Great One." Yangzi said: "These eight lines encompass the wondrous workings of an entire elixir scripture. The first line concerns Qian’s affair—Wood Mercury, belonging to oneself. The second line concerns Dui’s affair—lead, belonging to another. The third line generates beings. The fourth line can refine the elixir. The fifth line is entering the chamber to practice. The sixth line is guarding against danger and blocking peril. The seventh line is the elixir’s nine revolutions complete. The eighth line is the merit of three thousand deeds fulfilled."

The immortal master composed this poem solely to point out the primordial, undifferentiated, true Unity-qi—precisely the qi that abides in the Great One. How can scholars not seek a teacher?

**Sixty-Four Quatrains Corresponding to the Sixty-Four Hexagrams**

Bright and resplendent, the golden elixir forms in a single day—
The ancient immortals spoke truly; their words are worthy of heed.
If one speaks of nine years or three years,
It is merely procrastination, scheming by the calendar.

**Annotation:** The great medicine of the golden elixir, once the work begins, is obtained in less than half an hour and immediately ingested. This "single day" means the sage compresses a year’s qi-cycles into a month, a month’s qi-cycles into a day, and a day’s qi-cycles into an hour. Broadly speaking, it is called "attaining immortality in a single day." Thus the immortal master said: "Exchanging hours for days is the method of divine work." Once the golden elixir enters the mouth, one ascends to the sacred realm—its efficacy is swift and manifest. How could it require three years or nine years, dragging out time as if planning by the calendar?

The ancient immortal Zhang Guolao wrote:
Bright and resplendent, the golden elixir forms in a single day;
The yellow sprout never leaves the cinnabar pit.
Though the work may not yet complete three revolutions,
Opening the furnace, one already perceives radiant light.
This is the Way.

Master Shangyang said: The method of refining the elixir requires knowing the "living midnight" of the other household. Who but the supremely subtle could attain this?

Sun and moon meet once every thirty days—
Exchanging hours for days is the method of divine work.
Defending the city or waging wild battle, know fortune and misfortune;
The crucible fills with numinous cinnabar, glowing crimson.

**Annotation:** The Great Yang and Great Yin conjoin once a month. Those who understand this compress a month into a day, a day into an hour. Defending the city refers to the work after bathing; waging wild battle refers to the union of dragon and tiger. Divine work is the measure of advancing water. If yin and yang are disordered, sun and moon discordant, the external fire may move while the internal tally remains quiescent and unresponsive. The adept, advancing and retreating with water and fire, knows fortune and misfortune. When the Dipper and Winnowing Basket align with celestial degrees, the numinous embryo circulates in secret, and the divine crucible shines ever brighter.

**Commentary:** "Exchanging hours for days" means that within each hour, there is a midnight and noon; the beginning and end of yin and yang all align with the degrees of heaven, earth, sun, and moon. The coil of the Winnowing Basket and Dipper lies in the position of Gen and Yin. The yang fire resides in Zi; the fire of Chou and Wei is not yet flourishing. The northeast region of Gen is not far from Yin. The Great Yin’s lunar essence is also stored in the Gen region. The lodges of the Winnowing Basket and Dipper are also the positions where fire attains long life, all aligning with the same degrees. As the *Cantong Qi* states: "It begins in the northeast, the region of the Winnowing Basket and Dipper." Rotating rightward forms three days, and the moon is born in Zhen and Geng. Rotating leftward forms the first month, and fire is born in the Yin month, corresponding to the hexagram Tai.

The moon, barely half a wheel bright at the sky’s edge,
Already bears the dragon’s roar and tiger’s howl.
It is best to begin the work of refining the two eights—
Within a single hour, the elixir is assuredly complete.

**Annotation:** The moon’s half-wheel is the number eight. The immortal master refers to the dragon and tiger, each as the number eight, combining to form sixteen. At this time, the water’s source is utterly pure, possessing qi but no substance. In a year, there is only one such day; in a day, only one such hour; in an hour, divided into six periods. The work does not exceed two periods, and one immediately obtains a grain of golden elixir to ingest. The remaining four periods have other wondrous uses. These are all celestial secrets, not recorded on bamboo or silk, transmitted only orally and mind-to-mind. The immortal master dared not commit them to writing or reveal them outright, but embedded their meaning within the poem, vaguely stating: "...within a single hour, the elixir is assuredly complete." Ye Wenshu, not understanding this principle and failing to grasp this teaching, claimed that the medicine forms in an hour but is not refined in an hour alone. Bewildered, he knew not the true reference, idly speculating—truly laughable. If one says it does not require a single hour, then it becomes a matter of rotating through the calendar. How could it remain supremely simple and easy?

Profound! Wondrous! This Way is not something one can hear about in the world of men.

**Editor’s Note:** The fire of the great elixir is hidden at dusk. When the sage begins the initial work of crafting lead, they steal the qi of the primordial Unity’s great celestial cycle, seizing the correct tally of thirty-six thousand. Gathering it in the crucible of Qian and Kun, converging in the chamber of life and death, they seize the tally of heaven and earth, the tally of sun and moon, the tally of dragon and tiger, the tally of generation and completion, the tally of yin and yang, the tally of the five phases. Capturing it within a single hour, they forge a grain of golden elixir, as large as a millet seed, weighing one catty. Utterly numinous, supremely noble, most sacred and divine, supremely simple and easy, it is the essence of heaven and earth, the master of the body. One may call it the thief of heaven, the thief of earth, the thief of yin, the thief of yang. The cosmos is in one’s hands; the myriad transformations are within one’s body. Attaining the perfection of true immortality, one becomes a guest of the Supreme Emperor. Thus our immortal master said: "...within a single hour, the elixir is assuredly complete." How could this be empty words? This is the proof.

**Commentary:** The half-wheel is eight. The eight metals of the waxing moon are yang; the eight waters of the waning moon are yin. Combining the two eights in a single hour, one immediately obtains a grain of golden elixir. This is the celestial mystery personally transmitted by the immortals, not something worldly scholars can idly guess. Those in the world who speak of "a single hour" may refer to aligning with virtue, or aligning with Wu and Ji, or aligning with Gui, or following the lunar station, or using the general, or following the celestial indications, or taking the winter solstice, or taking the rise of yang, or taking the descent of Gui, or focusing the mind on the Central Palace, or gathering the seven luminaries, or assembling the five phases, or taking the five phases’ positions of generation, flourishing, and storage, or taking Jia, Geng, Bing, and Ren, or taking three days and four hours, or using the "living midnight," or using one’s birth hour, or reversing the sequence of generation, or using the exact center of sun and moon, or using the opposition of sun and moon, or using the conjunction of sun and moon, or using the union of heart and kidney, or taking the time between Hai and Zi, or taking the earth’s three origins, or taking the upper and lower crescents, or taking the Eastern Star forming the chamber, or the lunar lodge’s duty, or the seven origins’ established hours.

All speak of beginning at the moment of union, from which one applies effort. Yet among those who practice this, none have attained immortality—this is because they do not know that while the union governs the completion of the elixir, the elixir’s formation does not occur within that single moment, nor is it immediately ingested. Why then should one delay the schedule?

First, take Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel;
Then, gather the Crow and Hare as the medicine to refine.
Once the two are driven into the Yellow Path,
How could the golden elixir fail to take form?

**Annotation:** The sun and moon are the essence of Qian and Kun, so the sages use Qian and Kun as metaphors for the crucible and vessel, and the sun and moon as metaphors for the medicine. Qian and Kun are the true Dragon and Tiger, while the medicinal substances are the primal *qi* of the Dragon and Tiger’s initial tension. Master Wei said: *"A crucible is fundamentally no crucible; medicine is fundamentally no medicine."* The sages borrowed names and established images through such metaphors, but the essential point lies solely in the union and refinement of the true Dragon and Tiger’s initial *qi*, whereby the essence of the true One coalesces within the Central Palace of the Northern Sea. *"Once the two are driven into the Yellow Path, how could the golden elixir fail to take form?"* The Yellow Path is the Central Palace, the place where the golden elixir congeals and takes shape.

**Exegesis:** The immortal scriptures state that Qian and Kun serve as the crucible and vessel, while Kan and Li serve as the medicinal substances. Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li—crucible, vessel, and medicinal substances—are of one category, originally formless and nameless. They are merely the true Dragon and Tiger of the golden elixir, the external Dragon and Tiger. In Master Peng’s commentary on the *Cantong Qi*, *"Kan’s Wu is the moon’s essence, resembling metal born within water—a Tiger. Li’s Ji is the sun’s light, resembling wood born within fire—a Dragon."* These are the internal Dragon and Tiger of the golden elixir. Though their names differ, all are metaphors. If the two substances—like the Dragon returning to the Yellow Path—naturally unite to form the elixir, why forcibly distinguish which is the Dragon or Tiger’s fixed body? The key lies in not knowing how the Yellow Path serves as the mediator for their union.

If Kan and Li lack Wu and Ji,
Though they contain the Four Images, no elixir forms.
Only because each harbors true Earth,
Does the golden elixir gain its cycle of return.

**Annotation:** The *Cantong Qi* states: *"Li’s Ji is the sun’s light; Kan’s Wu is the moon’s essence."* Thus, Li’s Ji symbolizes the Dragon’s primal *qi*, and Kan’s Wu symbolizes the Tiger’s primal *qi*. Wu and Ji are one body of true Earth, yet they reside separately within the Dragon and Tiger’s two bodies—hence the phrase *"each harbors true Earth."* Without Earth, how could the Dragon and Tiger merge the Four Images to unite in Earth and form the elixir? It is precisely because each contains Earth’s *qi* that the two Earths combine to form the *daogui*. Thus, when the Dragon and Tiger unite, Wu and Ji merge. When Wu and Ji become one, the Four Images unite to form the elixir—this is why the golden elixir achieves its return. Master Lü said: *"When the two substances meet, the Dao’s root lies where the Five Phases are complete—this is what earns the elixir its name."*

**Exegesis:** Li is yang, and Ji is yin. Fire is born from Earth’s two, completed by Heaven’s seven, and contains the central Five Earths. Fire is dark within and bright without; the Li trigram is hollow at its core—all yang containing yin. Kan is yin, and Wu is yang. Water is born from Heaven’s one, completed by Earth’s six, and contains the central Five Earths. Water is dark without and bright within; the Kan trigram is solid at its core—all yin containing yang. Kan contains metal, and Li contains wood—these are the Four Images. Kan’s flowing Wu and Li’s congealing Ji each harbor true Earth. When the Four Images unite, the yin and yang Earths of Wu and Ji merge into one, completing the Five Phases. Returning to the root and reverting to the source, the seven returns and nine reversions—thus the golden elixir is formed.

The sun resides in Li’s position yet becomes the maiden;
Kan pairs with the Toad Palace yet becomes the youth.
If you do not grasp the reversal within,
Do not presume to discourse on such matters with limited insight.

**Annotation:** The Crow within the sun belongs to yin, hence it is the maiden of Li. The Hare within the moon belongs to yang, hence it is the youth of Kan. Without understanding the marvel of reversal, one’s lofty discourse is no different from gazing at the sky through a tube.

**Exegesis:** Reversal means not taking yin as yang—this is extracting yang from within yin. Not taking yang as yin—this is extracting yin from within yang. Yin as yin, yang as yang—this is the ordinary path of the world. Extracting yang from yin, extracting yin from yang—this is the thieving mechanism of immortals. The Five Phases reverse, yin and yang interchange—few in the world comprehend this, hence the saying: *"When the Five Phases reverse, the elixir’s body remains eternally numinous and enduring."* It is also said: *"All arise from the child giving birth to the mother"*—this is what it means. All hares under heaven are female, yet only the moon’s hare is male. The hare conceives by gazing at the moon, thus the moon’s hare belongs to yang.

The Zhen Dragon’s mercury emerges from Li’s homeland;
The Dui Tiger’s metal is born in the northern realm.
Both arise from the child giving birth to the mother;
The Five Phases must enter the center to be complete.

**Annotation:** Mercury is the Zhen Dragon, belonging to wood. Wood generates fire, wood is fire’s mother, and fire is wood’s child—this is the ordinary sequence of the common path. Yet cinnabar belongs to fire, fire is Li, and mercury emerges from within cinnabar. This is fire’s reversal to generate wood—hence the phrase *"the child giving birth to the mother."* The *Song of the Supreme White Realized One* states: *"When the Five Phases reverse, the Dragon emerges from within fire."* The immortal elder speaks of mercury being born in Li, not of mercury being born within cinnabar, because mercury within cinnabar is called true mercury, also known as *"mercury within fire."* Thus, he refers to true mercury, speaking of mercury without mentioning cinnabar.

Lead is the Dui Tiger, belonging to metal. Metal generates water, metal is water’s mother, and water is metal’s child—this is the ordinary sequence of the common path. Yet black lead belongs to water, water is Kan, and silver is born within lead. This is water’s reversal to generate metal—hence the phrase *"the child giving birth to the mother."* The *Song of the Supreme White Realized One* states: *"When the Five Phases do not proceed in order, the Tiger is born within water."*

The immortal elder speaks of lead being born in Kan, not of silver being born within it, because silver within lead is called true lead, also known as *"lead of water."* Thus, he refers to true lead, speaking of lead without mentioning silver.

These two substances mutually generate and produce the Four Images, converging at the center to form the Five Phases. When the Five Phases unite, the Golden Elixir coalesces—hence the saying, *"The Five Phases must all enter the center."* The center is the Central Palace, the Great Ultimate.

Later generations take the qi and fluids of the heart and kidneys as Dragon and Tiger, lead and mercury, claiming the Tiger is the qi of the kidneys, and since the kidneys belong to water, the Tiger is born within water; the Dragon is the fluid of the heart, and since the heart belongs to fire, the Dragon emerges from within fire. Such words are but child’s play—how could the Great Medicine be thus perverted?

A commentary states: Someone asked me, *"Those who cultivate life all take the heart and kidneys as Dragon and Tiger, the qi and fluids of lead and mercury as water and fire, hoping for their ascent and descent to unite and form the Sacred Embryo. Even Shi Jianwu’s* Zhong Lü’s Transmission of the Dao *says: ‘Within the kidneys, qi is born; within qi, the true unity of water. Within the heart, fluid is born; within fluid, the right yang of qi.’ The ingredients of the Internal Elixir arise from the heart and kidneys’ union and conception, daily gathering like a grain of millet to become the Great Medicine of the Golden Elixir. Yet the preface to the* Awakening to Reality *states: ‘To divide heart and kidneys as Kan and Li, hoping to congeal the Reverted Elixir—is this not far from the mark?’ The Unnamed Master, in his commentary on the poem about Kan and Li, says: ‘To take heart and kidneys as Kan and Li is to distance oneself from heaven and earth.’ This commentary further says: ‘To take the qi and fluids of heart and kidneys as Dragon and Tiger, lead and mercury, is but child’s play.’ If the qi and fluids of heart and kidneys are not the Great Medicine of the Golden Elixir, then what is?"* I replied: *"Zhengyang said: ‘Heart and kidneys are not water and fire—do you know what water and fire truly are?’ Shixinglin said: ‘Qi is not produced in the kidneys; spirit does not reside in the heart.’ Daoguang said: ‘In grasping firmness, do not push heart and kidneys.’ Chen Niewan said: ‘Heart and kidneys were never Kan and Li.’ Now,* Transmission of the Dao *takes the qi and fluids of heart and kidneys to transmit mother and child, enact husband and wife, and serve as lead and mercury, Dragon and Tiger, Kan and Li—this is merely borrowing the qi and fluids of the human body to metaphorically illustrate yin and yang and clarify their wondrous function. The unenlightened, failing to receive the true transmission, take it as literal speech, and the Great Dao becomes distant. Why not ponder the words in* Transmission of the Dao*: ‘Substance and function do not depart from yin and yang; creation arises from their union.’ How profound are these words!*

*‘Swallowing saliva and absorbing qi is what people do—only with the proper substance can the myriad things be born. If the crucible lacks the true seed, it is like boiling an empty cauldron with water and fire.’*

A commentary says: *"What the world calls ‘swallowing saliva and absorbing qi’ are all postnatal, earth-born, utmost yin substances—this is not true qi absorption. True qi absorption first subdues and then absorbs qi. As the classic says: ‘Subduing qi does not mean replenishing qi; not absorbing qi in sequence is true absorption. Absorbing qi does not grant longevity; longevity requires subduing qi.’ The true unity of qi blends into the boundless, indistinct void—difficult to seek, difficult to see. The sage subdues it with method, thus obtaining essence within the boundless and substance within the indistinct. Through transformation and refinement, the Elixir is formed, then ingested into the Cinnabar Field, where the myriad things are transformed and born. Hence the saying, ‘Only with the proper substance can the myriad things be born’—for it possesses the true seed. Without the true seed, all efforts are labor in vain; boiling an empty cauldron with water and fire—what can one hope to achieve? The true seed is true lead."*

A commentary states: *"Directing the Golden Fluid into the brain and then guiding it into the Cinnabar Field is also a form of swallowing saliva. Directing the true qi of external yin and yang is also a form of absorbing qi. This is not to say swallowing saliva and absorbing qi are wrong—only that without the true seed, efforts are futile. Without the true seed, what one swallows is pure yin essence, and what one absorbs is postnatal qi. Without the mother qi of the postnatal, the true qi of heaven and earth’s yin and yang will not unite and congeal with the child qi of one’s body.*

*‘To subdue’ is like a cat stalking a mouse—restraining and subduing it so it does not dare move. ‘To absorb’ is like a fish swallowing water—what enters immediately exits and cannot be retained. It is also said: ‘To subdue is to subdue the qi of heaven and earth, congealing it into the Elixir. To absorb the qi of heaven and earth, congealing it into the Elixir, then swallowing it into the Cinnabar Field—thereafter, yin tally and yang fire, heaven and earth all return to nurture the Golden Fluid Reverted Elixir, forming the Sacred Embryo.’*

*The male Tiger roars before Mount Hua’s cliffs,
The female Dragon hums beneath Fusang’s seas.
The Yellow Dame daily mediates their union,
Sending them as husband and wife to share one heart.*

A commentary says: *"Mount Hua is where the moon rises in the west, symbolizing the Tiger. The male Tiger is the Tiger’s latent qi—yin within yang, hence called the male Tiger. Fusang is where the sun rises in the east, symbolizing the Dragon. The female Dragon is the Dragon’s latent qi—yang within yin, hence called the female Dragon. The two are separated, one in the east, one in the west. The matchmaker, the Yellow Dame, causes their union, binding them as husband and wife to produce the Mysterious Pearl and Yellow Sprout."*

A commentary states: *"The* Cantong Qi *speaks of the Dragon’s exhalation and the Tiger’s inhalation, the Dragon as husband and the Tiger as wife—taking the two substances’ inherent opposition as male and female. The* Awakening to Reality *speaks of the male Tiger and female Dragon—taking the two substances’ yin-yang union as male and female. Thus, Dragon and Tiger alternately serve as male and female; this cannot be settled with a single word.*

*Harmonizing lead and mercury to form the Elixir,
Neither great nor small harms the two realms’ wholeness.
If you ask what true lead truly is—
The toad’s glow shines all day upon the Western River."*

A commentary states: Driving the Dragon causes the fiery mercury to soar; harnessing the Tiger makes the watery lead gleam and flash. Binding and refining Creation into a single grain of millet, the primordial qi coalesces—how could harm come to either? Thus it is said, "Neither great nor small harms the two realms’ wholeness."

The Dragon is great, the Tiger small—this reflects the principle of yang’s nobility and yin’s humility. The Golden Elixir arises from the fusion of the upper and lower crescent moons’ metallic and aqueous essences, called True Lead. The toad’s glow is the essence of metal and water, belonging to yin. The scripture says: "To illuminate" signifies the intent of the moon’s light intermingling with the sun’s, symbolizing the union of yin and yang. The west is the direction of metal; the river is water. On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, the sage conjoins the two qi of metal and water to congeal the essence of liquid gold. This is the essence of the moon’s radiance.

The moon’s upper crescent pertains to water, the lower crescent to metal. Thus the immortal elder takes the west as the direction of metal and the river as the body of water. Yet the moon never shines all day—only the lower crescent moon appears at sunrise, its golden light lingering at the southern *bing* position, vanishing in the western *geng* at noon. The upper crescent moon emerges at noon as a half-wheel on the western horizon, its aqueous light rising in the eastern *jia* and ascending to the southern *ding* by sunset. The two half-moons combine into the full orb of metal and water’s light, completing the day’s illumination. This is likened to the Dragon and Tiger uniting the two children’s qi to generate the Elixir. Hence it is said, "If you ask what true lead truly is—The toad’s glow shines all day upon the Western River."

A further commentary states: The upper and lower crescent moons illuminate the day alongside the sun, drawing forth the utmost clarity of metal and water. At the full moon, the moon faces the sun at night, drawing forth the utmost abundance of metal and water. Clarity possesses qi but no form; abundance possesses form yet no form. In clarity, the two eights alternately manifest as yin and yang; in abundance, the two eights merge into one body. Modeling this, the Golden Elixir is instantly achieved.

The preceding scripture says, "The upper crescent’s metal weighs half a catty," yet today it is said the upper crescent pertains to water. The preceding scripture says, "The lower crescent’s water weighs half a catty," yet today it is said the lower crescent pertains to metal. Thus the upper crescent’s half-catty of metal refers to the moon’s sunlit half, while the upper crescent’s water refers to its dark half. The white is metal, the black is water—hence the alternate phrasing reveals the two crescents’ metal and water each weighing half a catty, forming the marvel of the two eights. The lower crescent is likewise. Those who fail to grasp this marvel will doubt it.

"When bamboo splits, only bamboo can mend it;
When a chick is overturned, only an egg can right it.
Though myriad methods may seem clever,
None compare to true lead uniting with the sage’s mechanism."

A commentary states: If a bamboo vessel breaks, can it be mended with metal or wood? Only by using bamboo is the vessel made whole again. If a chick is overturned, can it be righted with earth or stone? Only by using an egg does the fledgling’s cry arise. Master Tao says: "When bamboo breaks, only bamboo can join it; when wood splits, only wood can mend it. When a roof is damaged, tiles must cover it; when a person declines, only their kind can revive them." If the cultivator of the Dao does not employ the same kind, their efforts are in vain. The *Cantong Qi* says: "Work is easily done with the same kind; skill is difficult with the unlike. If you wish to become an immortal through ingesting elixirs, you must use those of the same kind."

For humans receive life from the essence of Heaven and Earth’s radiance; True Lead is the mother-qi of Heaven and Earth, entrusting its kindred substance to conceive and nurture. Thus True Lead is the mother-qi, and my true qi is the child-qi—are these not the most wondrous of the same kind? Therefore, uniting with the profound mechanism of the utmost sage is the great Dao of spontaneity.

A further commentary states: Master Tao, styled Zhi, left behind three scrolls of *Secret Transmissions on the Supreme Medicines* for the world. In the first year of Baoli during the reign of Emperor Jingzong of Tang, on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, he ascended to immortality in broad daylight at the Plum Immortal’s Terrace on Great Plum Peak in Yin County, Mingzhou, in eastern Zhejiang. A stele recording this event stands below the terrace.

"Only when medicine meets its kindred qi does it take form;
The Dao resides in emptiness, uniting with spontaneity.
A single grain of numinous elixir swallowed into the belly—
Only then do you know your fate is not ruled by Heaven."

A commentary states: There is a thing formlessly formed, born before Heaven and Earth. The sage thus forcibly names it the Dao, forcibly names it the Primordial Chaos of the True Unity of qi. Invisible to sight, inaudible to hearing, intangible to grasp, the sage uses the kindred qi of the first crescent of the second and eighth months to resonate and thus communicate, descending the numinous image into the void of the Mysterious. A single grain like a millet seed, ingested into the belly, immediately transmutes mercury into pure Yang, transforming the body into one of pure Yang, co-eternal with Heaven and Earth.

Master Chaoyuan said: Life and death are entirely governed by the nature and destiny of Heaven and Earth—yet originally they belong to mercury and lead. Is this not "my destiny lies within me, not in Heaven"?

The White Tiger of the Western Mountain rages wildly,
The Azure Dragon of the Eastern Sea cannot be withstood.
Seize them with both hands and force them to battle—
They transform into a sheet of purple-gold frost.

A commentary states: This speaks of external imagery, explained in the earlier verse: *"Where the Five Agents are complete, Dragon and Tiger coil within."* Purple-gold frost is the Golden Elixir.

Master Haichan said:
With the left hand seize the Azure Dragon’s head,
With the right hand drag the White Tiger’s tail.
Bring them together and swallow in one gulp—
Reflecting, this thing is sweet and fine.
Yet reckon it is merely gold within water,
Mastering the mystery reveals the true principle.
This is its proof.

Some who have never heard of the Supreme Dao wildly guess at its meaning, interpreting "both hands" as "two beasts"—how laughable! They are far, far astray.

The method of setting the furnace and establishing the crucible follows Heaven and Earth,
Refining the essence to subdue the hun and po.
Gathering and dispersing, binding and weaving to enact transformation—
How dare one treat such profound mysteries as trivial discourse?

A commentary states: Accumulating all Yang qi forms Heaven, which remains above and does not moisten below. Accumulating all Yin qi forms Earth, which remains below and does not flame upward. This is Heaven and Earth not conjoining. If they do not conjoin, how can they create and transform to generate the myriad things? Though Heaven is the most Yang of things, it contains within it a single qi of Yin, and thus can descend to Earth. Though Earth is the most Yin of things, it contains within it a single qi of Yang, and thus can ascend to Heaven. When these two qi intertwine, the myriad things transform and mature—this is how their union enacts transformation. The Dao of the Golden Elixir, in setting the furnace and establishing the crucible, warming and refining the essence to subdue the hun and po, all take their model from the Heaven-Earth mother-child relationship.

A song says:
When essence conjoins, no medicine is needed;
When qi harmonizes, no words are spoken.
The Golden Elixir is formed by qi uniting with its kind—
Thus it is said: *"Only when medicine meets its kindred qi does it take form."*

It begins with nothing generating something,
Then returns to something generating nothing.
Formless yet able to transform—
Thus its transformations are inexhaustible. This is the Heavenly mechanism;
how dare one prattle on?

A commentary states: *"Beginning with nothing generating something"* refers to the external medicine, relying on the True Unity of qi in emptiness to generate form from the formless. It is not *"something generating something"*—using a thing with form to create it. *"Returning to something generating nothing"* refers to the internal medicine: once the external medicine takes form and is ingested into the five viscera, it transmutes the corporeal forms of the four limbs and hundred bones into qi. *"Formless yet able to transform"* refers to the completion of both internal and external, transmuting qi into spirit. Embracing the Origin for nine years, spirit becomes formless, its transformations unfathomable. If one can know the Supreme Dao within nothingness, one may gradually transform.

The common saying goes: *"If ordinary words align with the Supreme Dao, one should delve deeply into their meaning."* If one can seek within daily life’s inversions, the dust and sand of the great earth all become treasures.

A commentary states: True lead and true mercury are not found in daily inquiries. If one inverts and cultivates them, the dust and sand of the great earth all become treasures.

An ancient song says:
Day after day, it dwells only in your home,
Day after day, it follows you, yet you remain unaware.
Few know these different names arise from the same source—
Both are the profound mystery’s essential mechanism.
Preserving life and perfecting form clarifies gain and loss;
The Purple-Gold Elixir is most wondrous and rare.

A commentary states: The Most High said: *"The Nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth; the Named is the mother of the myriad things."* He also said: *"These two emerge together yet bear different names."* When it is in its formless state, the True Unity of qi is invisible—thus it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth. When it takes form, the True Unity of qi transforms into a millet grain, manifesting in the void of the Mysterious—thus it is the mother of the myriad things. In Heaven it is called *li* and is mercury; on Earth it is called *kan* and is lead. Their root is the same, though their manifestations differ. This sameness is called *"the mystery within the mystery."*

The practice of the True Work lies in grasping these two mysteries of yin and yang to clarify gain and loss, and to cultivate the body—thus may form be preserved and life be safeguarded.

What are these two? They are simply the two qi of yin and yang. What is meant by "loss"? It is the sequential flow of the Five Phases, the constant Dao of arising and perishing. Ah! The Pure Yang Elixir of Purple Gold stands as the beginning of Heaven and Earth, emerges as the mother of the myriad things. When it is said that *"the Purple-Gold Elixir is most wondrous and rare,"* one must recognize the profound intent in the Immortal Elder’s sigh, which knows no end.

A commentary states: In Heaven it is called *li* and is mercury, for fire flames upward as *li*. That which is of Heaven inclines upward; fire is born within wood as lead. Heaven is yang yet contains yin—solemn yin descends from Heaven. On Earth it is called *kan* and is silver, for water moistens downward as *kan*. That which is of Earth inclines downward; metal is born within water as lead. Earth is yin yet contains yang—radiant yang ascends from Earth. When Heaven and Earth are established in their positions and the sun and moon take form, all are transformations of the two qi: water-yin and fire-yang. Fire flames upward, light and pure, bright without yet dark within. Water moistens downward, heavy and turbid, bright within yet dark without. Once Heaven and Earth and the sun and moon have taken form, the Five Phases then each assume their forms between Heaven and Earth. When metal is struck, fire appears; when smelted, it becomes water. When wood is drilled, fire appears; when pressed, it yields water. Earth is born of fire and moistened by water to nurture metal. Wood is not the union of fire. Within metal, wood, and earth, the two qi of water and fire are omnipresent. Water and fire cannot spontaneously give life to or kill humans. As for metal, wood, and earth, they too cannot kill humans—only when employed by humans do they gain such power. The water and fire of the Five Phases are those that possess the fullness of qi. All things between Heaven and Earth do not transcend the Five Phases, and the Five Phases do not depart from yin and yang. Yin and yang both emerge from the Supreme Ultimate—this is emergence together yet bearing different names. Their root is the same: the Mysterious Female’s root, which together emerges from the True One’s Supreme Ultimate. Their emergence differs: the True One’s qi divides into the yin and yang of the Mysterious Female—this is sameness in root yet difference in emergence. These two, the Mysterious Female, both emerge from the undifferentiated qi of the Supreme Ultimate. Once they take form, if they receive their nature purely and reside in their proper places, then through inversion and refinement, the Purple-Gold Elixir may be accomplished. Within black there is white—this is the Elixir Mother. Within the male is concealed the female—this is the Sacred Embryo. The Supreme One abides in the furnace; guard it with care. The Three Fields’ treasures gather, corresponding to the Three Terraces.

A commentary states: Extracting silver from lead is called the Elixir Mother. Drawing mercury from cinnabar is called the Sacred Embryo. These two substances can attract and transform the True One’s qi, congealing it within the Supreme One’s furnace. It depends entirely on precisely regulating the firing times, calmly adhering to the model, and ensuring not the slightest deviation or confusion—only then may the three natures unite, the Elixir Treasure form, and the upper correspond to the Three Terraces. The Supreme One is the True One’s qi—thus it is said the Supreme One contains the True qi.

A commentary states: Extracting silver from lead and drawing mercury from cinnabar are both metaphors for external substances, illustrating the principle of yin and yang’s mutual employment. The world does not understand this, mistakenly engaging in alchemical refinement and ingestion, or composing deluded annotations—many are led astray. Master Wu Ming, in his verses on the Golden Crucible’s desire to retain cinnabar-wrapped mercury, and the Red Dragon and Black Tiger uniting East and West, all speak of the same as silver within lead and mercury within cinnabar. "Same" here means "for example." By studying these three poems deeply, one comes to know the marvel of these two substances—they truly can attract and transform the True One’s qi. How could mere lead or mercury achieve this?

Within the Crescent Moon Furnace, the Jade Medicine is born;
Within the Cinnabar Tripod, the mercury levels.
Only through the harmonizing power of the firing times
Is the Yellow Sprout planted, gradually growing to maturity.

A commentary states: The Crescent Moon Furnace is the yin furnace. Within it is the yang qi of the Jade Medicine—the bowstring qi of the Tiger. The Cinnabar Tripod is the yang tripod. Within it is the yin qi of mercury—the bowstring qi of the Dragon. The Golden Elixir arises solely from the harmonizing power of these two bowstring fires, planting the True One’s sprout to grow within the Yellow House and form the Millet Pearl.

Do not hide in the mountains before refining the Returning Elixir—
Within and without those mountains, all is not lead.
This supreme treasure exists in every household;
It is only that people of this age fail to recognize it fully.

A commentary states: The Dragon is not in the Eastern River; the Tiger is not in the Western Mountains. Every household possesses it—reverse the process and refine it, and the Returning Elixir may be attained. Though one may recognize cinnabar and black lead, without knowing the firing times, it is as if idle. It depends entirely on the power of cultivation—even a hair’s deviation will fail to produce the Elixir.

A commentary states: The creation of the Golden Elixir depends wholly on Master Ding. Even a hair’s deviation leads one astray by a thousand miles. Thus the sages transmitted the medicine but not the fire—one must discuss it in detail with an immortal.

A commentary states: Cinnabar and black lead are not material substances—they are the True Dragon and True Tiger. Recognizing them yet not knowing the firing times will still not produce the Elixir. The *Daoguang Ci* says: *"Three people of like mind must cautiously guard against peril; advance the fire with meticulous care."* Master Chen Nin Wan’s poem says: *"Without like-minded companions to seek and correct, one fears the furnace’s firing times may err."* Thus cultivation relies greatly on true companions. If even a hair’s breadth is amiss, the Elixir cannot form. Only upon encountering a true teacher is the Great Dao made clear. The transmission of the firing times is heart-to-heart, not recorded in writing. Profound and wondrous is this mystery—Heaven above observes it. When the wind arises with cause, know to swiftly cultivate.

When the Four Images unite, the Mysterious Body is complete;
When the Five Directions move, the Purple Light shines.
Once the embryo is shed and enters the mouth, it communicates with the divine and sacred—
Countless divine dragons all lose their awe.

A commentary states: When Dragon and Tiger intermingle, the Four Images unite and the Five Directions move. When the Four Images and Five Directions converge, the True One’s body congeals like a millet pearl, radiant with purple light.

At the moment of secret refinement, seize the opportunity to draw it into the mouth, communicating with the sacred and transcending the divine—countless divine dragons, who would not stand in awe and reverence? At first, in the stage of effortful practice, people vie to seek it; only when it reaches effortless attainment do the many begin to understand. Yet they see only that the Dao’s essence is effortless non-doing, unaware that effortful practice is its very foundation.

A commentary states: Those who study the Buddhist path of nature, clinging to the notion that all conditioned action is delusion, use such words to slander the Daoist path of life. These know only one side and not the other, having glimpsed the gate but never ascended the hall or entered the chamber. How could they know that the Dao of cultivating life begins with effortful practice, refining the Elixir to transform form; proceeds through conditioned action, refining form to transform qi; and culminates in effortless spontaneity? Facing the wall for nine years, embracing the One to empty the heart and perceive its nature—nature is spirit. Spirit and nature are one, manifesting without limit. After nine years of practice, qi naturally becomes spirit, and spirit naturally unites with the Dao. Thus, form and spirit together attain the wondrous and unfathomable; spirit and Dao merge, becoming formless. Since form is no longer confined, how can this be called conditioned action or delusory transformation? How can they claim nature is not life, or life is not nature? Forcibly dividing them into "nature" and "life" is to merge two into one—there was never any difference. Thus, from effortful practice to effortless action, from conditioned doing to non-doing, from form to formlessness. This Dao is so vast that those of middling or lesser capacity cannot comprehend it. Therefore, the Immortal Elder composed a poem to instruct later learners: do not see only effortless non-doing as the essential mystery, unaware that effortful practice is the foundation of effortless attainment.

Another commentary states: "At first, in the stage of effortful practice, people vie to seek it"—this refers to the moment when the yang revives at the solstice, when one gathers the qi of the two bowstrings (metal and water). Only those with awareness can perceive it, though even spirits and divination cannot fathom it. Once the Golden Elixir is accomplished and its transformations become boundless, the multitude cannot comprehend it. People see only that effortless non-doing is the essential mystery, yet how could they know that the gathering of yin and yang, the congealing of lead and mercury, truly begins with the foundational effort of establishing the root at the outset? A discourse states: Conditioned action and non-doing divide the two schools of nature and life. One must proceed in order, fulfilling each stage—from beginning to middle, from middle to end. The Elixir is formed in an instant, the embryo gestates for ten months, and the One is embraced for nine years. Only then can the two merge into the wondrous formlessness, only then can one attain the mystery where life is not nature and nature is not life. The world confuses the school of nature with the Golden Elixir of life; lacking true emptiness of self-realization, they rely on superficial learning, abandoning the conditioned to cling to the empty void, hoping to overcome birth and death. Many claim that original nature is the Golden Elixir, yet how can they fully master the great Dao of nature and life? Within the indistinct, seek the image; within the profound darkness, find the true essence. From this, being and non-being naturally interpenetrate—without such vision, how can one ever succeed?

A commentary states: Within the realm of the indistinct, the image that appears is the qi of the Dragon’s bowstring. Within the profound darkness, the essence that emerges is the qi of the Tiger’s bowstring. Both bowstrings possess qi yet lack substance. That which is faint and indistinct, dark and obscure—seen yet unseen, heard yet unheard—is the true One qi. The true One qi is supremely numinous yet formless.

Master True One says: The None is the Dragon; the Some is the Tiger. The None is the qi of mercury; the Some is the qi of lead. The None, stirred by the Some, takes on image; the Some, moved by the None, gains numinosity. Thus the millet pearl hangs in empty space, and the purple frost gleams in the sunlight. How lamentable are those who, dull and fixed, cling to the dust of deluded thought!

A subcommentary states: The *Cantong Qi* says, “None and Some restrain each other: when the upper barrier is closed, it is called Some; when the lower barrier is closed, it is called None.” Master Peng expounded twenty meanings, dividing them into two interpretations. Now the Nameless Master draws upon the meaning of None and Some restraining each other—this is the crucial secret of the Great Elixir, contained in the two words “lead” and “fire.” Examining this poem, the upper lines list the indistinct and the profound darkness, while the lower lines summarize None and Some; thus one should follow the meaning of the upper and lower barriers. Yet one must not be rigidly bound to the commentary.

None and Some restrain each other, as the *Scripture of Golden Radiance* states: “From the two Nones, the One Some arises.” Those who awaken to the Dao do not cling to the text; if they penetrate it fully, all applications align.

Ouye received the sword-casting method in person:
Gold and water blend, soft and hard unite.
Once refined, it knows the wielder’s intent—
A thousand miles to slay the wicked in a flash of lightning.

A commentary states: When Ouye cast his sword, Heaven often sent a divine maiden to transmit the furnace’s art. He tempered it with gold and water, matched it with soft and hard, and after forging the sacred blade, it could slay the wicked and cut down evil in a flash of lightning—so swift was its numinosity. The Sage’s creation of the Returned Elixir is likewise. Taking heaven and earth as the furnace, yin and yang as water and fire, matching them with the Five Phases, and tempering them with spirit and qi, once refined, it can bend or straighten, soften or harden, do good or evil, be round or square. When the mind conceives a thought and the intent turns toward a goal, it already knows the person’s will and flies forth to slay in a flash of lightning. This is the natural spirit-sword.

The cultivator of the Elixir, without this sword, is like one who seeks fish and rabbits without a net or snare. Immortal Huang invoked Ouye’s sword-casting to illustrate the elusive image of the Mysterious Pearl. This elusive image is the secret celestial mechanism. A subcommentary states: The forged sword is used as needed. The natural sword is the spirit of the Returned Elixir’s transformation of substance—just as Ouye’s cast sword possessed numinous power.

*Commentary and Subcommentary on the "Awakening to Reality" of the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Scroll Five*

Xiangchuan’s Anonymous Master Weng Baoguang’s *Annotations on the Collected Transmissions of Perfection from Wu Yi’s Chen Daling*, with *Subcommentary by Kongxuanzi Dai Qizong*

**Inner and Outer Medicines**

When deploying troops, one must divide the left and right armies;
Let the other be host while I remain guest.
I urge you, when facing battle, do not treat the foe lightly—
Lest you lose our priceless treasure of the household.

*Annotation:*
This verse clarifies the firing times and their application.
The *general* is fire.
The left is civil fire; the right, martial fire.
The sage condenses a year’s firing time into a single month,
and a month’s firing time into a single day.
Now, the firing process from *zi* to *si* spans six yang hours,
endowed with the virtue of spring and summer’s generation—
thus it is civil fire, stationed on the left and called *yang fire*.
From *wu* to *hai* span six yin hours,
endowed with the punitive force of autumn and winter’s austerity—
thus it is martial fire, stationed on the right and called *yin tally*.
“Let the other be host while I remain guest”:
the host is yang and male, fond of contention;
the guest is yin and female, fond of stillness.
This means guarding the female without striving to be male,
maintaining stillness without contention—
a caution against peril and vigilance against danger,
the height of reverence.
The *Art of War* states: “Rest to await the weary.”
It also says: “Draw the enemy to you; do not be drawn by them.”
This is the meaning here.

The application of the Dao lies in water and fire;
the application of water and fire lies in the person.
First, mark the clepsydra to divide *zi* and *wu*,
then connect yin and yang to establish the foundation of transformation.
Deploy the sixty-four hexagrams within the *yin tally*,
stoke the twenty-four qi with *yang fire*.
The celestial pivot rests in the hand,
the earthly axis turns by the heart.
Revolve the seventy-two seasonal nodes through their crucial passes,
drill them back into the crucible.
Seize the three thousand six hundred breaths of primordial qi,
concentrate them within the embryo.
In operation, there is method;
in withdrawal and addition, there is order.
When moving, guard against peril and contemplate danger—
not a hair’s breadth of error is permitted.
Externally, align with the tally of yin and yang;
internally, generate the true unity of the body.
Should the mind’s operation falter or the seasonal nodes diverge,
the maiden flees and the numinous embryo within the crucible fails to form—
thus the priceless treasure of the returned elixir is lost.
O adepts of elixir refinement, when facing the crucible,
can you fail to guard the female and dare to treat the enemy lightly?

Master Shangyang said: “The left is I, the right is the other;
let the other be host while I remain guest.
If the other occupies the superior position and I the inferior,
the other desires movement while I desire stillness.”
The commentary states: From *zi* to *si*, the left is *civil fire*;
from *wu* to *hai*, the right is *martial fire*.
The virtue of generation is civil,
the punitive force of austerity is martial.
The *Cantong Qi: Ode to the Crucible* says: “At the head and tail, martial; in the center, civil.”
Here, civil and martial are further determined by the waxing and waning of the fire’s timing.
Master Wuming said: The crucible is the marrow of the elixir,
thus the *Ode to the Crucible* is cited to distinguish civil and martial fire—
each has its proper use.
This verse clarifies the application of internal medicine’s fire timing,
not that of external medicine.
External medicine’s marvel lies in a single moment;
internal medicine’s marvel lies in a single day.
Though the fire timing of a moment and a day are the same,
their application differs.
From the deployment of the sixty-four hexagrams to the embryo’s formation
follows the preface of Master Zhenyi’s *Cantong Qi*.
The sixty-four hexagrams are not entirely *yin tally*,
nor are the twenty-four qi entirely *yang fire*—
they merely represent the fire’s annual reckoning to complete the text.

Do not cling to the elixir’s glory or waste effort;
to refine the medicine, seek the recumbent moon furnace.
Within it, the natural true fire nurtures—
what need is there for kindling or bellows?
The commentary states: Ye Wenshu identifies the space between the two kidneys as the recumbent moon furnace,
while others point to the two eyes.
Rather than reflect on their own errors,
they teach others their mistakes—how can this not be excessive?
The mouth of this furnace opens upward like the recumbent moon,
hence its name, the recumbent moon furnace—it is the Northern Sea.
The primordial qi of the Original Beginning resides there;
what need is there for kindling or bellows?
The commentary states: Within the recumbent moon furnace, the jade medicine is born.
That refers to the external medicine of the yin furnace;
this refers to the internal medicine of the Northern Sea.
All are metaphors for the ceaseless reversal—
people invert them, and if the master’s intent is unclear,
clinging to names leads to confusion,
failing to penetrate the thread of the mystery.
The natural true fire exists within the great and small crucibles,
seized and returned to the body
to produce the golden liquid returned elixir—
it is not the body’s yin.

The mysterious pearl takes form as yang arises;
when yang reaches its peak, yin arrives and gradually strips away its form.
After ten months of frost, the elixir ripens—
even spirits and ghosts must tremble at this time.
The commentary states: The golden liquid returned elixir takes form
because from the winter solstice, one yang fire is stationed,
and as yang gradually generates the golden liquid’s essence,
by the summer solstice, yin fire advances,
stripping away until the tenth month,
when the returned elixir ripens.
Shedding the embryo’s transformation into a pure yang immortal—
how could this not astonish spirits and ghosts into submission?

To know the method of refining, nurturing, and returning the elixir,
plant the seed within your own garden.
No bellows or force are needed—
naturally, the fruit ripens and the numinous embryo is freed.
The commentary states: This thing is of the same kind as what lies within your own home.
The Dao is very near, never far from people—
like planting a seed in your garden,
the thing grows of itself; its nearness is evident.
Planting a different kind yields no success;
planting the same kind is as easy as turning the palm.
The *Cantong Qi* says: “With the same kind, effort is easily applied;
with a different kind, effort is difficult.”
The commentary states: The earlier verse says:
*“Guard the medicine furnace and watch the fire’s timing,”*
and *“Within it, the natural true fire nurtures.”*
Now it says: *“No bellows or force are needed,”*
all referring to the application of internal medicine.
Elsewhere it says: *“Establish the furnace and set the crucible,
gather and refine the medicine,
the Great One resides in the furnace,”*
all referring to the application of external medicine.

This thing is the yang elixir.
The yang elixir is of the same kind as we are,
easily forming the embryo.
Master Nijiang said: “Within the body, one *mu* is the home garden.”
Without a master’s guidance, one may wildly guess—
I, fortunate to have received the transmission,
wish for all to easily understand and together ascend the immortal fruit.
Thus, where the commentary was unclear,
I have further elucidated its meaning,
and arranged the verses and lyrics by category.
Yet within what is easily known, there are also difficult points—
I dare not lightly disclose them on bamboo and silk.
O adepts of immortal study,
if you are destined for immortality and obtain this book,
with its commentary and exegesis,
the path will be clear and unerring.
If you can fully awaken,
you will one day attain the great Dao.
This text is a treasure of the immortal’s satchel,
guarded by spirits everywhere—
can you fail to cherish and deeply study it?

In the months of the hare and the rooster, when the time is right,
punitive and virtuous forces arrive at the gate—
the medicine’s image appears.
At this point, the golden elixir should be bathed;
if fire is added, it will surely topple into danger.
The commentary states: The second month is virtue, the eighth month is punishment—
both require bathing; adding fire leads to peril.
The commentary states: Here it says the second month is virtue, the eighth month is punishment,
while in the annotation on the exchange of *Pi* and *Tai* hexagrams,
it says the second month is punishment, the eighth month is virtue.

For the second month, amidst the virtue of generation, the counting rods fall—yet within virtue lies punishment. In the eighth month, amidst the punishment of withering decay, wheat sprouts arise—thus within punishment lies virtue. Hence the mutual reference to punishment and virtue. When *Pi* and *Tai* first exchange, the myriad things flourish; the *Zhun* and *Meng* hexagrams receive the mandate of generation and completion. Here, grasp the meaning and cease seeking images; if you exhaust yourself in divining lines, you will only weary the spirit.

The commentary states: The winter and summer solstices mark the inception of yin and yang; the *zi* and *wu* hours serve as the origin of day and night. The sage moves in accord with the tally of yin and the fire of yang, harmonizing with the Dao of Heaven and Earth’s ascent and descent, the principle of the sun and moon’s coming and going. Gathering the four seasons, eight nodes, twenty-four qi, and seventy-two seasonal markers, they array them within the crucible to generate the true unity of the body. This principle is most simple, its practice not cumbersome—nothing need be contrived. Thus it is entrusted to the hexagrams, distributed across the thirty days of a month to unfold the mystery and clarify the use of fire.

The lines and images are but the trap and snare. *Zhun* and *Meng* stand at the head of all hexagrams, symbolizing the inception of fire’s movement and the origin of creation’s mandate. Hence, *Zhun* governs the morning, *Meng* the evening. *Pi* and *Tai* represent yin ascending and yang descending amid the four seasons. When the second month’s *Chunfen* node arrives, yang qi rises to the center of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang stand in equal measure—neither cold nor hot, but temperate—thus forming the *Tai* hexagram, like the moon’s first quarter and its qi. At this time, yin and yang naturally converge, so the sage does not advance fire, calling it "bathing." When the eighth month’s *Qiufen* node arrives, yin qi descends to the center of Heaven and Earth, again with yin and yang in balance—neither hot nor cold, but cool—thus forming the *Pi* hexagram, like the moon’s last quarter and its qi. Here, yin and yang naturally converge, so the sage advances water, also calling it "bathing." Thus the immortal elder said: "In the months of the hare and the rooster, when the time is right, punitive and virtuous forces arrive at the gate—the medicine’s image appears." For the second month is punishment, the eighth month virtue.

If the cultivator of the elixir can grasp the meaning within these four hexagrams, why cling to the myriad lines and exhaust the mind in labored thought? The immortal elder, in his compassion, has directly pointed out this shortcut.

The commentary states: *Pi* and *Tai* correspond to the months of bathing. Of the twelve months in a year, ten are used to gestate the embryo, excluding the two months of bathing. *Zhun* and *Meng* are the hexagrams of the sun and moon. Together, their twelve lines symbolize the twelve hours of a day. Of the sixty-four hexagrams, excluding *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, *Li*, and the four hexagrams of the female and male, only sixty are used, corresponding to the thirty days of a month. The principle of Heaven and Earth’s ascent and descent over 84,000 *li* reaches the spring and autumn equinoxes, traversing exactly 24,000 *li* to the center of Heaven and Earth. Thus the *Pi* and *Tai* hexagrams, with yin and yang evenly balanced above and below, serve as metaphors. So too do the hours of day and night in the second and eighth months stand in balance, as do the moon’s first and last quarters, where metal and water each weigh half a *jin*.

If one discusses the hexagrams in relation to humans, the nodes of yin and yang’s advance and retreat place *Tai* in the first month and *Pi* in the seventh, not in the second month’s hexagram. The *Cantong Qi* states: "Observe the *Da Zhuang* hexagram at the *mao* gate; in mid-autumn, await the tally of rest." The second and eighth months thus belong to the *Da Zhuang* and *Guan* hexagrams. Master Peng’s commentary on *Tai* reads: "Yin and yang qi stand in balance; husband and wife unite." On *Pi*, it states: "Heaven and Earth both rest; yin and yang do not converge." For when they stand in balance, there is no convergence; when one is greater and the other lesser, they converge. When yang rises and yin descends, they do not converge; when yin descends and yang rises, they do. Such is the principle of things. Once this principle is understood, one need not cling to the lines of hexagrams and weary the spirit.

The methods set forth in the hexagrams are but models; grasp the image, forget the words, and the meaning will become clear. Yet the world’s deluded ones cling only to images, practicing hexagram qi in hopes of ascension.

The commentary states: The hexagrams are but the trap and snare of fire. The true man Wei Boyang, through studying the *Yi*, awakened to the workings of the golden elixir, seeing the Dao of the *Yi* as one. Thus he composed the *Cantong Qi*, expounding the hexagrams of the *Great Yi* to illuminate the elixir’s essence and guide later generations. He likened *Qian* and *Kun* to the crucible and vessel, symbolizing the divine embryo’s chamber within our elixir field. He compared *Kan* and *Li* to the medicinal substances, symbolizing lead and mercury within the divine embryo’s chamber. For *Qian* and *Kun* are the parents of all hexagrams, and *Kan* and *Li* are their true essence. Thus the four hexagrams reside in the central palace, like the divine embryo’s lead and mercury within the elixir field. Placed at the center to govern the exterior, these four hexagrams are not bound to the reckoning of fire’s movement. The remaining hexagrams are distributed across the month, circulating the tally and fire, beginning with *Zhun* and *Meng* and ending with *Jiji*. They cycle endlessly, like a wheel in ceaseless motion. Each day, two hexagrams govern affairs; in thirty days, sixty hexagrams are reckoned. Including *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* as the crucible, vessel, and medicinal substances, the sixty-four hexagrams total 384 lines, symbolizing the year’s 384 days, including intercalary days. They also symbolize the elixir’s weight of two times eight, one *jin*, with one *jin* equaling 384 *zhu*. All these are metaphors and images. By observing the hexagrams, the scholar may awaken to the workings of fire’s movement. Once the use of fire is understood, the hexagrams and their words may be forgotten as no longer needed.

Yet today’s scholars, failing to grasp this essence, cling instead to these images to practice hexagram qi, exhausting body and mind in hopes of ascension—is this not folly? "Having caught the fish, forget the trap; having caught the hare, forget the snare." Now they cling to the trap and snare as if they were the fish and hare, drifting ever farther from the Dao.

Master Zhongli said: "How could the great Dao be communicated through words? Boyang borrowed the *Yi* to compose the *Cantong Qi*."

Later generations, failing to recognize the immortals’ metaphors, mistakenly seize upon the trap and snare and set to work—this is the proof. The commentary states: The world transmits the *Hexagram Qi Diagram*, dividing sixty hexagrams, each line aligned with the breath-count to model water, fire, yin, and yang—thus they cling to the images and practice accordingly. How could they know that the great Way of the Golden Elixir employs hexagrams as mere trap and snare?

The sixty hexagrams all derive from the pure yin and yang of *Qian* and *Kun*, yet only *Kan* and *Li* obtain the central qi of *Qian* and *Kun* and stand upright. Thus, excluding these four hexagrams as the female and male, *Qian* and *Kun* serve as the body, *Kan* and *Li* as the function, the sixty-four hexagrams as the tally, divided into the cauldron, vessel, medicine, and ingredients—all governed by the fire phases of the celestial cycle. The Way of the Elixir aligns with heaven and earth, and the images of the *Yi* correspond to them; thus, the *Yi* is borrowed to illuminate the Dao.

Before refining the Returned Elixir, refine it with urgency; once refined, know when to stop and be content. If you persist with an insatiable heart, you will not escape one day meeting with misfortune and disgrace.

The annotation states: A man’s *tian gui* arrives at two times eight, and is exhausted by eight times eight. When it first arrives, it is full, pure *Qian*, weighing one *jin*. By the time he reaches twenty, one *liang* of mercury has fled. By thirty, four *liang* have fled. By sixty, the *Bo* hexagram’s pattern reaches the skin. When the eight-times-eight count ends, pure *Kun* transmits all. The crow flies, the hare runs—time waits for no one. Living mercury must be captured by lead; the Returned Elixir must be grasped without delay. Once refinement is complete, embrace the One and guard sincerity. If you know no contentment, persisting with an unceasing heart, you will instead meet with misfortune and disgrace.

Master Zhongli said: "Once the Elixir is ripe, there is no need to apply fire phases; applying them further will harm the Elixir. It is best to preserve and guard it without loss—drink when thirsty, eat when hungry, sleep when weary. If you can further clarify the mind and perceive the nature, facing the wall for nine years, this Dao will flourish even more."

The commentary states: Lü Chunyang met Zhengyang at sixty-four; Ge the Immortal met Master Zheng at sixty-four; Ma Ziran met Haichan at sixty-four—all had just begun cultivating the Way of the Golden Elixir and attained immortality. Once refinement is complete and contentment is known, after ten months the embryo is shed, and one should bathe; within a year, all is fulfilled, and there is no need to begin work at the winter solstice. The *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* says: "The winter solstice is not at *zi*; when it is time for bathing, *mao* wine is but an empty comparison." Shi Xinglin said: "The winter solstice is not at *zi*; bathing is not at *mao* or *you*." Daoguang said: "Shedding the embryo and bathing, nurturing and stabilizing—this is the celestial birth."

All three immortals cultivated the Dao at sixty-four—how did they succeed in their practice? May I hear a brief account?

I replied: All three immortals sought the Dao in their prime, upheld precepts, and accumulated merit. Only at sixty-four did they receive the true transmission of the Golden Elixir, thus attaining the Dao swiftly. As for worldly people, desires deplete essence, thoughts harm spirit, toil exhausts qi, and true yang is lost. Even if they hear the great Dao before sixty-four, they will struggle to succeed. If one cuts off desire in youth, seeks the Dao in the prime of life, preserves the physical body before it decays, and essence and qi before they are spent, meeting a teacher and receiving the teaching, one may swiftly begin cultivation. If one has not yet met a teacher, do not scatter your essence, do not weary your form; accumulate merit and deeds, awaiting the encounter—perhaps success may still be hoped for.

The Dao attained by the three immortals is recorded in texts, its auspicious threads visible. Did Zhengyang show Chunyang a few grains of the Elixir?

He said: This is not the five metals or eight stones of the world, but a wondrous treasure of the world compounded. Though it has substance, it has no form—like clouds, like fire, like light, like shadow—visible yet ungraspable. Consuming it, one’s soul and consciousness merge into one body, light and empty, utterly wondrous, not a tangible elixir.

Ge the Immortal’s *Song of the Flowing Pearl* says:
*Flowing pearl, flowing pearl,*
*You drive me to toil endlessly.*
*Wandering the four seas, traversing texts,*
*Vast and hurried, forgetting sleep and meals.*
*Seeking all wise friends, burning all cinnabar,*
*For twenty years, sighing daily.*
*Now at sixty, I must descend to the three paths.*
*By the teacher’s transmission, the primordial qi is emptiness.*
*First stabilize the golden tripod, then the jade furnace.*
*Li fire sparks, Kan water takes form.*
*Jade liquid moistens, the bridal chamber streams with tassels.*
*The true person’s teaching: only the great man*
*Keeps this ever in mind—remember, remember!*

Ma Ziran’s *Song of the Golden Elixir* says:
*At sixty-four, all say it is too late,*
*Yet I met Haichan’s true disciple.*
*At that time, he spoke a single phrase—*
*I saw all my past efforts were in vain.*
*It turned out this alone was the Returned Elixir,*
*Near at hand, yet unknown where.*
*In the year *gengzi*, the month *wuyin*,*
*I met the perfected one and received the oral teaching.*
*Like jade in stone, uncarved,*
*Once carved, white as snow.*
*Within it is the Elixir, two times eight in weight,*
*Born in the cinnabar field, the yellow sprout grows.*
*If this treasure guards the cinnabar field,*
*Lifespan is boundless, years uncounted.*

The Dao transmitted by these three immortals shares the same ultimate principle as the *Awakening to Reality*. The Perfected Zhang Zixuan lived ninety-six years. In the fifth year of Yuanfeng, on the fifth day of the third month, he achieved liberation in the flesh. From the second year of Xining, when he met his teacher in Chengdu and received the Dao, the Perfected was already eighty-two. His cultivation began after sixty-four, yet his daily preservation and nurturing were profoundly effective.

The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says:
*One hundred twenty years may still be restored;*
*Beyond this, guarding the Dao is most difficult.*
*Only await the ninefold transmutation, the eightfold jade elixir,*
*To recover essence and contemplate the seven origins.*

The above speaks of the inner medicine.

Take the true center within *Kan*,
Transform the yin within *Li*’s belly.
From this, become the vigorous body of *Qian*;
Hidden or soaring, all is governed by the mind.

The annotation states: The *Li* hexagram has yang without and yin within; the *Kan* hexagram has yin without and yang within.

With the inner yang refining the inner yin, it becomes *Qian* ☰—the One. This is like the Golden Elixir, the supreme yang qi, called the Yang Elixir, congealed within the Northern Sea. When it comes to refine one’s own yin mercury, it transforms into a body of pure *Qian*, wholly yang. Thereafter, the firing process—withdrawing and adding, advancing and retreating—is entirely governed by the mind’s operation.

Some mistakenly take the cinnabar pellet as the line within *Kan*, but this is a post-heavenly, earth-born impure substance, not the pre-heavenly, heaven-born qi. If one takes the heart and kidneys as *Kan* and *Li*, then heaven and earth are far indeed.

Ziye said: The yang within *Kan* is the yang of *Qian*. *Qian* moves and sinks into *Kun*, becoming *Kan*; *Qian* itself becomes *Li*. The method of cultivation lies in extracting that one yang from *Kan* and returning it to the *Li* position, thereby restoring the body of pure yang—this is the essential method of elixir-making, and the task is complete.

The annotation states: "Hidden or soaring" symbolizes the six lines of *Qian*, illustrating the swiftness of the firing process—withdrawing, adding, advancing, and retreating. As in the forty-seventh chapter of the *Cantong Qi*, the six lines of *Qian* are distributed among the six hexagrams, serving as the tally for the six cyclical phases.

As for the cinnabar pellet—whether absorbing the woman’s *gui* water, gathering the maiden’s blossom, or extracting the qi of boys and girls—these are all post-heavenly, earth-born impure substances. Though human qi may be refined, it remains of the yin kind; how can it refine a purely yin body into a purely yang immortal? Some claim that using humans to supplement humans is of the same kind, unaware that the commander of heaven and earth is our nature, the foundation of heaven and earth is our body. At the moment of birth, when we first received qi, did it reside between the two kidneys or in the birth gate? The numinous root of heaven and earth, the sacred mother of yin and yang—this is the foundation of the Returned Elixir, and this is the true "same kind."

Not recognizing yin and yang, nor distinguishing host and guest—how can one know which is distant and which is close? Those who practice chamber arts, forcibly sealing the *weilü* cavity, delude themselves into refining a yin elixir. Seeking to prolong life, they instead hasten death—like casting firewood into flame.

The *Yinfu Jing* says: Fire is born from wood, but calamity arises and surely strikes. How can one not be cautious?

The annotation states: When the guest reverses to become the host, and the distant reverses to become the close, this is the marvel of inversion. Those who seal the *weilü* believe they are reversing the flow of the Yellow River, yet many lose their lives thereby.

Use lead, but not common lead;
Having used true lead, discard it.
This is the true esoteric method of using lead—
"Use lead, do not use lead" is no empty phrase.

The annotation states: Common lead is a post-heavenly, earth-born impure substance. True lead is the qi of the True One. As a person’s original yang qi scatters daily with no means of coagulation to form the sacred embryo, the sage refines true lead to subdue and congeal it into golden sand. Daily, the firing process is applied: mercury is gradually added, mercury increases, lead qi gradually disperses, lead is withdrawn, and mercury is added—such is the subtlety. After ten months, the fire is complete, the sixty hexagrams conclude, lead qi floats away like dust in a sunlit window, scattering in fragments. After nine years of embracing the One, the original qi is exhausted, leaving only pure dry mercury. When lead is spent and mercury desiccated, it transforms into the Great Returned Elixir of golden liquid. The body becomes purely yang, its years equal to heaven’s.

Thus, it is said: "Having used true lead, discard it." Is the phrase "use lead, do not use lead" mere idle talk? Upon hearing this truth, one should pledge with the heart to heaven. The debt to one’s teacher is hard to repay—one must attain the Dao to requite the teacher’s grace. To betray the teacher’s words is to betray heaven and earth.

The Dao arises from emptiness and generates the One qi;
From the One qi, yin and yang are produced.
Yin and yang recombine to form the Three Bodies;
The Three Bodies give rise to the flourishing of the myriad things.

The annotation states: The Dao is originally empty, yet gives birth to the formed qi; qi is originally substantial, yet becomes the formless form. Form and formlessness restrain each other, and the One arises therefrom. Thus, the One generates the Two, the Two generates the Three, and the Three generates the myriad things. The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, harmonized by the qi of the center.

Before their formation, the harmonious qi of the center is invisible. Once formed, the light and clear qi belongs to yang, the heavy and turbid qi belongs to yin. The two qi intertwine, the two essences intermingle, and three things are born: heaven, earth, and humanity. Thus, the *Yi* says: "Heaven and earth intertwine, and the myriad things are transformed into purity. Male and female intermingle their essence, and the myriad things are transformed into life."

The perfected one delves into this mystery and knows its source. By inverting and smelting, reversing the workings of creation, they "plunder heaven and earth," exhausting their spirit to comprehend transformation. They steal the essence and qi of yin and yang to serve as fire, thereby returning to their root and restoring their source. By inverting and smelting, reversing the workings of creation, they plunder the mother qi of heaven and earth to make the elixir, steal the essence and qi of yin and yang to serve as fire. They refine the form to return to the One qi, refine the qi to revert to primordial emptiness. Thus, body and Dao unite, mysteriously formless, endlessly transforming, hidden and manifest beyond measure—this is called the Perfected One.

A commentary states: The elixir is the mother qi; fire is the essence qi. Mother qi is the undifferentiated essence qi, while essence qi is the already-differentiated mother qi. The fire and medicine are one. The true One’s mother qi is concealed within the spirit and essence of yin and yang, invisible to the eye. By stealing the essence of yin and yang to seek it, the true One’s qi may be obtained. Master Stone Apricot Grove says: The medicine is the primordial qi; the fire seeks the essence of the Great Yang. To know the medicine and take the fire is to surely witness the elixir’s completion. Master Wang the Daoist says: Fire is the father of the medicine; the mother medicine is the child and grandchild of fire.

On Snow Mountain, a fine brew ferments,
Poured into the eastern sun’s alchemical furnace.
Should one journey to Kunlun’s northwest,
Zhang Qian would first meet Ma Gu.

A note explains: Snow Mountain, white in color, symbolizes the west and the metal phase—this is the golden elixir. A single grain of the golden elixir, its flavor like fine wine, is taken and ingested into one’s own alchemical furnace of transformation. Kunlun Mountain lies amid the sea of water, and thus entering Kunlun is the true place of fire’s kindling. At the summit of Kunlun is a gate called the Mysterious Portal, which is the Gate of Heaven. The Gate of Heaven lies in the northwest, the position of *qian*, so the immortal elder says: "Plant it in the *qian* household’s chamber of union." Passing beyond the northwest, Zhang Qian would meet Ma Gu.

Zhang Qian is a man, symbolizing the *qian* hexagram, the yang fire, and also true mercury. Ma Gu is a woman, symbolizing the *kun* hexagram’s position, the yin tally, and also true lead. This means that if one passes Kunlun to kindle the fire and enters through the Mysterious Portal, then within the crucible, true mercury first meets true lead, and transformation begins. When true lead inwardly fuses with true fire and outwardly connects with the *kun* symbol to transform into the *qian* symbol, yang fire pursues the yin tally. The two fires advance in union, lead and mercury congeal, and the root of the immortal’s Way lies herein. Zhang Qian rides a raft across the Heavenly River, encountering the Woman constellation—this is but a metaphor for the meeting and union of yin and yang.

A commentary states: The outer fire is the true qi of heaven and earth; the inner fire is the ancestral qi of the primordial sea. When inner fusion and outer connection occur, the two fires intermingle, and only then do mercury and lead congeal, allowing the sacred embryo to form.

After the first crescent and before the last,
The medicine’s flavor is mild, its qi complete.
Gathered and returned to the furnace to refine,
Tempered and nurtured like simmering fresh fish.

A note explains: When the moon reaches its thirtieth day, the yang soul’s metal is wholly lost, and the yin spirit’s fire fills its disk—thus it is purely yin, its celestial light extinguished, resembling the *kun* hexagram, and so it is called "dark." At this time, it conjoins with the sun, moving as one body between the dark and new moon, rising and setting together. By the second day, it borrows the sun’s light and begins to conceive, gradually drawing apart. By the third day at sunset, the crescent appears in the west at *geng*, and within pure yin, one yang is born—spirit arises within the spiritless, resembling the *zhen* hexagram. At this time, the yang soul’s metal is newly born, the medicine’s sprout fresh. By the eighth day, two yangs are born, resembling the *dui* hexagram. At this time, the spirit within the spiritless reaches half its fullness, straight as a cord, and so it is called the "first quarter." Before this belongs to yin; after, to yang. Within yin, yang is half—eight ounces of metal within water are obtained, its flavor mild, its qi complete.

By the fifteenth day, three yangs are complete, resembling the *qian* hexagram. At this time, the yin spirit’s water is wholly consumed, and the yang soul’s metal fills the disk—thus it is perfectly round, purely yang without yin, and so it is called "full." Yet when yang reaches its extreme, yin arises. Thus, on the sixteenth day, within the purely yang disk, one yin is born—spiritless arises within spirit, resembling the *xun* hexagram. Gradually waning, by the twenty-third day, two yins are born, resembling the *gen* hexagram. At this time, the spiritless within spirit reaches half its fullness, straight as a cord, and so it is called the "last quarter." Before this belongs to yang; after, to yin. Within yang, yin is half—half a catty of water within metal is obtained, its flavor mild, its qi complete.

The sage gathers the essence of this two-eight metal and water, captures it within the furnace of transformation, refines the true One’s qi, transmutes it into millet-like grains, and swallows it into the five viscera. Then, circulating the fire to temper and nurture, simmering and refining, the golden liquid returning elixir is formed. It wholly relies on the yin tally and yang fire, advancing and retreating, withdrawing and adding—if even a hair’s breadth is amiss, no elixir will form. The immortal elder repeatedly exhorts in this chapter, urging self-refinement—truly, there is deep meaning here.

A commentary states: The two-eight takes its image from the moon’s metal and water; the six periods take their image from the moon’s waxing and waning. Metal is yang; water is yin. The qi of the two breaths is the fire of yin and yang. Five days make one period, completing the number of the five phases. "After the first crescent and before the last" refers to before the first quarter, where yin precedes yang, metal and water each half a catty—this is the two-eight. "Before the last quarter" refers to before the last quarter, where yang precedes yin, metal and water also each half a catty—this is the two-eight. Both the first and last quarters are two-eights. The sage takes the essence of the two-eight metal and water, gathering two-eights from both the first and last quarters. The medicine’s flavor is mild, its qi complete—thus the elixir may form. Many mistakenly believe this refers to the full moon. On the full moon, the moon is full, the *qian* hexagram’s *jiaxu* yang metal reaches a full catty—this two-eight’s subtlety is known only when one meets a true master.

Taking eight ounces of metal and water from both the first and last quarters is the true intent of the two-eight. Each quarter holds the two-eight’s mystery within its ladle. The maidens wander each in their own direction;
The forward journey must be short, the return long.
Returning, they enter the Yellow Matron’s abode,
Marrying a golden man to become an old husband.

A note explains: The maidens are mercury.

The term "mercury fire" (*gonghuo*) wanders with direction—its forward movement pertains to the external medicine’s function, while its return pertains to the internal medicine’s function. These two operations exist, hence it is said that "each wanders in its own direction." When the sage first begins the work of refining the golden elixir, the movement of mercury fire does not exceed half an hour, yet true unity’s essence is immediately obtained, refined into a millet grain and swallowed—thus it is said, "the forward journey must be short." After ingesting the elixir, one moves the mercury fire to undertake the work of ten months—thus it is said, "the return must be long."

The Yellow Matron within the inner image is the golden womb’s divine chamber; the Golden Elder is true lead; the Old Husband is the image of pure yang. Mercury, through the external movement of fire, flies into the divine chamber, uniting with true lead in mutual longing, transforming into a body of pure yang—hence it is said, "marrying a golden man to become an old husband." "Returning" signifies drawing it into the Central Palace.

A commentary states: The fire of the external medicine is called mercury; the fire within the fire is also called mercury. When fire precedes the medicine, it solidifies; when mercury fire congeals, true lead is born. In the internal medicine, it relies on one’s own mercury fire and also on the external mercury fire, uniting with true lead to give birth to the sacred embryo. Thus, it is collectively called "the maidens," each wandering in their own direction.

The root of this term is cinnabar, a single substance that circulates throughout the body—cinnabar is mercury fire. Lu Ziye said: The maiden is one’s own yin mercury. The forward movement is the outward flow; the retreat is the inward return. Flowing outward, in but a moment, it is lost to the other. Returning inward from below to above, it circulates through the entire body, settling in the Central Palace, where it unites with lead to form the sacred embryo.

Chen Shangyang said: The maiden is one’s own essence. That it "wanders with direction" refers to the refined method of essence’s movement. Ordinary people often deplete their essence; even a slight arousal stirs the bones and channels of the entire body, agitating the marrow of the whole being. As soon as desire stirs, the heart-monarch also becomes licentious; the Three Corpses urge from above, the Seven Po drive from below. Only then does essence ascend from the two channels, rising through the five viscera to the Mud Pill Palace, descending with the marrow, passing through the twin gates of the spine to the external kidneys and their impurities. This is the method of the Five Turbid World—this is what is meant by "wandering with direction," the ordinary flow of the inner common Dao.

The golden elixir is not so. It employs the method of inversion, adhering to the Dao of reversal. The great practitioner refines this to mastery: body and mind unmoved, hun and po restrained, desire untouched, essence and qi brimming like a wealthy household—where is there no gold and jade? When that first yang stirs, when primordial true yang is about to arrive, the essence and qi of one’s entire body do not disperse. Instead, at the lower kidney, in the nearest convenient place, one moves a single drop of true mercury to welcome it—this is what is meant by "the forward journey must be short." Once true lead has crossed the Magpie Bridge, mercury merges with it, then follows true lead’s ascent along the spine’s twin gates to the Mud Pill Palace, circulating through the nine palaces, infusing the eyes, descending the Golden Bridge, down the Double Towers, entering the divine palace for refinement. This is what is meant by "wandering with direction"—this is what is meant by "the return must be long." Then, returning to the Yellow Court’s divine chamber, it coalesces into the elixir—this is what is meant by "returning to enter the Yellow Matron’s abode and marry the Golden Elder." This is the inversion of the Five Phases and the reversal of cultivation.

On the fifteenth of the eighth month, the toad’s radiance shines—precisely when metal’s essence is at its peak. When the first yang begins its return, one must promptly advance the fire without delay.

A note states: The fifteenth of the eighth month is when the qi of metal and water is at its height; the *zi* hour is when the first yang returns. The external and internal elixirs advance their fire work together.

A commentary states: The fifteenth of the eighth month is the full moon, the mean. The fourteenth is excess; the sixteenth is deficiency. Only the full moon attains the mean—this is harmony. When the first yang stirs to make the elixir, the lead crucible glows warmly, its light filtering through the curtains. At the initial reception of qi, it is easily recognized; in the withdrawal and addition of fire, one must guard against danger.

A note states: The sage, through profound investigation, silently knows the time when metal’s essence is at its peak and the first yang stirs. Capturing the dragon and seizing the tiger, deploying civil and martial arts, he lures the Great One’s true qi into the Central Palace of the lead crucible’s union, where a millet pearl is warmly nurtured, its radiance shining through the curtains. In less than half an hour, the elixir is immediately obtained—this is what is meant by "at the initial reception of qi, it is easily attained." Yet after ingesting the elixir, one moves the yin tally and yang fire through the work of ten months, only then returning to the center of *kun*, awaiting the transformation of wind. *Zhun* and *meng* arise from dawn and dusk, not yet ending at the dark of night or the light of dawn. The work of withdrawal and addition cycles endlessly. At this time, one’s emotions are like earth and wood, or dead ashes, guarding against danger and fearing risk, never daring to act recklessly. Thus, externally, one harmonizes with the tally of yin and yang’s fire; internally, the substance of golden liquid is born. In ceaseless circulation, it reverses from the coccyx to the Mud Pill Palace, descends the Double Towers, and returns to the earthen crucible of the elixir field—this is the golden liquid returning elixir. Its divine verification is beyond description; thus, in the withdrawal and addition of fire, how could one not be cautious of danger and mindful of risk?

A commentary states: *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* says: "Receiving qi is auspicious; guarding the city is perilous." This contains the essential meaning. "Returning to *kun*" refers to the twelve months of the year, the beginning and end of yin’s waning and yang’s waxing. "Thunder and wind" refer to the moon’s birth in *zhen* and its waning in *xun*, the six phases of the month, the beginning and end of its waxing and waning. "*Zhun* and *meng* not yet" refers to the twelve hours of the day, the thirty days of the month, the beginning and end of hexagrams and lines—all correspond to the work of fire, aligning with the celestial degrees.

The Gate of the Mysterious Female is rarely known in the world; men merely take the mouth and nose and recklessly apply their efforts. Even if you practice breath regulation for a thousand years, how could you make the Golden Crow seize the Hare?

A note states: The Gate of the Mysterious Female is called the Root of Heaven and Earth—how wondrous is this saying! The world knows nothing of this; without a true master’s guidance, who could comprehend it? Some, like Ye Wenshu, point to the space between the two kidneys as the Primal One of the Undifferentiated Origin, but how could they fathom the celestial mechanism and presume to dismiss other teachings? The Mysterious and the Female are two things—how could they be spoken of as a single cavity? Since the beginning of creation, without these two, how could the myriad things exist? The inner and outer elixirs are established from this. The sages kept it secret, naming it the Reclining Moon Crucible and the Suspended Womb Cauldron.

The Golden Crow is the golden elixir; the Hare is one’s true qi. The golden elixir controls one’s native mercury, like a cat catching a rat or a hawk seizing a hare, allowing no escape. If one takes the mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female, even with a thousand years of breath regulation, one will only grow weaker—how could the Golden Crow relinquish the Hare to form the sacred embryo?

A commentary states: The Mysterious is yang; the Female is yin. The *Book of Changes* says: "Heaven is dark, and earth is yellow; the hexagram *Kun* benefits the steadfastness of the mare." Borrowing the Mysterious to represent yang and the Female to represent yin, it is called a "gate" because the myriad things are born and die through this gate, and the Mysterious Female enters and exits through it. As for the terms "crucible" and "cauldron," these too are borrowed names.

Master Bao’s *Song of the Mysterious Female* says: "Between the two kidneys, a single point of light." Thus, later generations point to the space between the two kidneys as the Cavity of the Undifferentiated Origin, not realizing that the two kidneys are but a metaphor drawn from their paired position in the human body to illustrate the mystery. The two emerge together yet bear different names; if they can unite, then that single point of millet-grain pearl may be obtained in an instant—this is the true Gate of the Mysterious Female. Those who fail to grasp the metaphor cling to the *Song of the Mysterious Female* as literal truth, taking the space between the two kidneys as the answer. To mistake the mouth and nose for the Mysterious Female is even more superficial.

Lu Ziye said: The previous chapter spoke only of the two words "Mysterious Female," while this chapter clarifies the word "gate"—its principle is profound and wondrous. The gate is the place of exit and entry, of coming and going, the site where yin and yang unite. Without the true transmission received mouth-to-heart, how could mere conjecture or guesswork ever grasp it?

*Commentary and Annotations on the "Awakening to Reality" of the Perfected Purple Yang, Scroll Six*

Xiangchuan Wumingzi Weng Baoguang’s Annotations on *The Collected Transmissions of Chen Daling of Wuyi*, with Commentaries by Kongxuanzi Dai Qizong of Jiqing:

---

The thunder roars in Kan, refining the golden-water elixir,
Fire instructs Kunlun—yin and yang unite.
When these two substances harmonize,
The cinnabar ripens naturally, and the body exudes fragrance.

*Annotation:*
This verse depicts the symbolic imagery of the inner and outer elixirs.
The "thunder in Kan" is the fire within water, called yin fire, the bowstring of the Tiger. In the Mysterious Gate, this refers to the Tiger using the fire within yin to refine the Qian Dragon. The Qian Dragon then stirs the fire of Kunlun in response. When the two fires safeguard each other, the essence of True Unity naturally coagulates. At that moment, if one ingests it, the hundred bones are all regulated, and the fragrance is exquisite.

*The Kinship of the Three* states:
When golden sand enters the five viscera,
Mist scatters like wind and rain.
Steaming and permeating the four limbs,
The complexion becomes radiant and lustrous.
White hair returns to black,
Fallen teeth regrow in their original place.
The old man reverts to youth,
The aged woman becomes a maiden again.
Is this not the true fragrance filling the body?

After ingesting the elixir, one continues to conjoin the yin-yang talismanic fire. The Tiger, with the fire within yin, smelts this Mysterious Gate, while the Dragon stirs the fire of Kunlun in response. When the two substances harmonize, the golden essence naturally circulates. From the Wei Lü, it ascends audibly through the spine, piercing the double gates of Jiaji, and rises straight to the Niwan Palace. Droplet by droplet, it descends the *chonglou*, its taste sweet and exquisite, its fragrance unparalleled, naturally illuminating the entire body.

*Commentary:*
The earlier phrase, "the Tiger with the fire within yin refines the Qian Dragon, and the Dragon stirs fire in response," summarizes the two fires of the outer medicine. The later phrase, "fire with the fire within yin," specifies the fire of the outer medicine. "The Dragon stirs fire in response" refers to the fire of the inner medicine. The inner and outer Dragon and Tiger fires differ in name and form. When the two fires merge, true essence coagulates. When the two medicines harmonize, golden essence circulates. True essence coagulates, and the outer golden elixir is achieved. Golden essence circulates, and the inner returning elixir is accomplished. Thus it is said: "Fire instructs Kunlun—yin and yang," referring to the Dragon’s fire, further distinguishing the inner and outer yin and yang. The poetic structure and reasoning here are not entirely lucid.

To attain the Valley Spirit’s eternal life,
One must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root.
Once true essence returns to the golden chamber,
A luminous pearl will never depart.

*Annotation:*
That which is unfathomable in yin and yang is called the Spirit. The Spirit is formless; it responds and communicates like an echo in a valley, hence the term "Valley Spirit." One establishes qi through qi, and generates essence through essence. Essence can generate qi, and qi can generate spirit. Thus, qi is the master of the body, and the body is the abode of spirit and qi. Without spirit and qi, form does not live; without form, spirit and qi are not authentic. These three depend on one another as if they were alive. To attain longevity, one must first establish the root in the Mysterious Female. Only then can longevity be achieved. All spirits are born from these two substances and die through them. They are truly the root of heaven and earth, the ancestor of the Five Phases, the stem of yin and yang, and the foundation of all transformations. The sage relies on them to complete the outer medicine and employs them to subtly transform the inner elixir. Thus, true essence moves ceaselessly, returning to the chamber of the golden crucible, transmuting into a luminous pearl of spirit, forever unscattered. Gradually, form transforms into qi, and qi into spirit. When both form and spirit attain subtlety, they become as elusive as hidden and manifest.

The eldest son first drinks the wine of the West,
The youngest daughter first blooms the flower of the North.
If the Green Maiden meets them afterward,
All are sealed together within the Yellow House.

*Annotation:*
Zhen is the eldest son, the Green Dragon. Wine is a yin substance, storing yin qi, called yin fire. Dui is the youngest daughter, the White Tiger. The flower is a yang substance, storing yang qi, called yang fire. The Green Maiden and the young woman refer to mercury fire. These all describe the adept in elixir refinement: driving the Dragon to approach the Tiger, the Tiger blooms the flower of the North to meet the Dragon, and the Dragon drinks the wine of the West to approach the Tiger. When Dragon and Tiger devour and embrace, forming an image, the adept then moves the mercury fire of the Green Maiden to meet the two fires of Dragon and Tiger. After their affectionate union, all are sealed within the Yellow House’s central palace, producing the essence of True Unity to form the golden liquid returning elixir. The Yellow House is the crucible and the Mysterious Barrier.

*Commentary:*
The first two lines refer to the outer medicine: the Green Dragon stores yin qi, and the White Tiger stores yang qi. The latter two lines refer to the inner medicine: the Green Maiden is one’s true qi. When she witnesses the affectionate union of the Dragon and Tiger’s two qi, they are sealed within the central palace. Another version’s annotation takes the Green Maiden as the bowstring qi of the Dragon, which would again refer to the outer. Since the first two lines already mention the eldest son, it should not be repeated, hence its omission. The Immortal Elder’s poem speaks of "matching the young woman in marital affection," which aligns with this. The young woman’s movements each have their direction, further clarifying the inner and outer. Each poem conveys different meanings; one must not cling to the names.

After drinking from the Flowery Pond, the moon’s radiance clears,
Riding a golden dragon, one visits the Purple Tenuity.
From then on, after meeting the host of immortals,
The seas and fields, hills and valleys, shift as they will.

*Annotation:*
The Flowery Pond is the elixir. After drinking and completing the work, one sheds the mortal form and transforms spiritually. The skin becomes like ice and snow, graceful as a maiden. Riding qi and mounting clouds, one roams the eight extremities, gazing upon the mortal world as the seas turn to mulberry fields, mulberry fields to seas, high valleys into shores, and deep valleys into hills.

The Metal Lord was originally the son of the East,
Sent to the Western neighbor to lodge and be born.
Once recognized and called back to be nurtured at home,
He is matched with the young woman in marital affection.

*Annotation:*
This meaning has already been explained in the regulated verse’s annotation on "leading the White Tiger home to be nurtured."

The great elixir of the Golden Dao possesses its own functions, and its symbolic manifestations include yang within yin, and further, yang within that yang. There is also yin within yang, and further, yin within that yin. Moreover, there are the yin-yang and water-fire of the inner elixir, and the yin-yang and water-fire of the outer elixir. There are the three inner natures and the three outer natures. There are the four inner images and five phases, and the four outer images and five phases. Furthermore, there is the mutual interaction of inner and outer yin-yang. The symbolic manifestations reverse and repeat endlessly, defying description. We, who have personally received the profound teachings, may silently comprehend them through intuitive insight. Without encountering a true master, none can thoroughly understand them. The immortal elder composed this poem to elucidate them deeply, yet by grasping the single yang, one may attain understanding on their own.

*Annotation:*
The ceaseless reversal of yin and yang—I have detailed this in the section on the symbolic manifestations of the Golden Dao’s methods.

The Red Dragon and Black Tiger unite east and west,
The four images intertwine within the central earth of wu-ji.
From this renewal, one can operate and employ,
Who says the Golden Elixir cannot be accomplished?

*Annotation:*
The east is the Azure Dragon of wood, which generates fire, so the dragon’s bowstring qi pertains to fire. Fire resides in the south and is red, hence it is called the Red Dragon. The west is the White Tiger of metal, which generates water, so the tiger’s bowstring qi pertains to water, residing in the north and thus black, hence named the Black Tiger. The Red Dragon is also called the Maiden, and the Black Tiger is also named the Metal Lord. These two are akin to mercury within cinnabar and silver within lead. The Red Dragon and Black Tiger unite the qi of the two bowstrings, merging south and north, east and west—this is the convergence of all four directions. The four substances intertwine within the true earth of wu-ji, coalescing into a single grain of true earth like a millet seed. When swallowed and returned to the five viscera, it steams and permeates the four limbs, entering Kunlun Mountain. Wherever water flows, all come to pay homage. Then, one advances the yang fire at the *Fu* hexagram and retreats the yin tally at the *Gou* line. Naturally, the operations of drawing and adding proceed without fail, each step aligning with the method of elixir formation. The supreme Dao may be accomplished in a matter of days.

*Annotation:*
The dragon’s bowstring qi is fire, and the tiger’s bowstring qi is water. It is also said that the metal tripod contains fire as the White Tiger, and the jade pond contains water as the Azure Dragon. This illustrates that yin-yang has no fixed position, and water-fire has no fixed substance—their mutual interaction and reversal yield boundless subtleties.

Heaven and earth have their times of fullness and emptiness;
Only by discerning their waxing and waning can one grasp the mechanism.
Since ancient times, the commands of geng and jia have been made clear,
Slaying the Three Worms to fulfill the Dao may then be expected.

*Annotation:*
"Heaven and earth have their times of fullness and emptiness": Heaven and earth are separated by eighty-four thousand *li*. On the day of the winter solstice, a single yang qi rises from within the earth, ascending four hundred sixty *li* and two hundred forty *bu* in one day. After five days, it forms one *hou*; three *hou* make one *qi*; two *qi* make one *jie*; and two *jie* make one season, which is the spring equinox. Over ninety days, the yang qi ascends a total of forty-two thousand *li*, reaching the midpoint between heaven and earth. At this time, yin contains half yang, forming the *Tai* hexagram. The qi transforms from cold to warm, and all things begin to sprout—this is spring. Thereafter, the yang qi continues to ascend into the yang position, gradually rising until the summer solstice. Counting from the winter solstice, one hundred eighty days have passed, and the yang qi has ascended a total of eighty-four thousand *li*, reaching heaven. At this time, yang contains further yang, forming the pure yang *Qian* hexagram. The qi transforms from warm to hot—this is summer, the time of flourishing for all things, hence it is called "fullness."

When heat reaches its extreme, yin is born. Thus, on the day of the summer solstice, a single yin descends from heaven, also descending four hundred sixty *li* and two hundred forty *bu* in one day. After five days, it forms one *hou*; three *hou* make one *qi*; two *qi* make one *jie*; and two *jie* make one season, which is the autumn equinox. Over ninety days, the yin qi descends a total of forty-two thousand *li*, reaching the midpoint of the great earth. At this time, yang contains half yin, forming the *Pi* hexagram. The qi transforms from hot to cool, and all things bear fruit—this is autumn. Thereafter, the yin qi continues to descend into the yin position, gradually descending until the winter solstice. Counting from the summer solstice, one hundred eighty days have passed, and the yin qi has descended a total of eighty-four thousand *li*, reaching the earth. At this time, yin contains further yin, forming the pure yin *Kun* hexagram. The qi transforms from cool to cold—this is winter, the time of storage for all things, hence it is called "emptiness."

The sage discerns the waxing and waning of heaven and earth through the moon’s phases. The moon begins to form on the first day, taking shape as *Zhen* (geng) on the third day and completing as *Dui* (ding) on the eighth day. On the fifteenth day, it reaches fullness as *Qian* (jia), the time of heaven and earth’s fullness. On the sixteenth day, it begins to wane as *Xun* (xin); on the twenty-third day, it reaches the last quarter as *Gen* (bing); and on the thirtieth day, it vanishes as *Kun* (yi), the time of heaven and earth’s emptiness. The sage, able to discern the mechanism of heaven and earth’s waxing and waning, condenses a year’s climate into a single month. The first day, with the birth of a single yang, is taken as the winter solstice. Dividing two and a half days into sixty hours corresponds to thirty days, representing one month’s climate. On the first quarter day, yin contains half yang, corresponding to the spring equinox. By the fifteenth day, four months’ seasonal qi have accumulated, forming pure yang—thus the moon is full, and the yang qi is at its peak, hence "fullness." On the sixteenth day, yin is born, corresponding to the summer solstice. On the last quarter day, yang contains half yin, corresponding to the autumn equinox. By the thirtieth day, ten months’ seasonal qi have accumulated, forming pure yin—the yin qi is at its peak, hence "emptiness." This cycle repeats endlessly.

The sage operates the yang fire and retreats the yin tally in accordance with the waxing and waning, ascent and descent of heaven and earth, cycling through the sixty-four hexagrams and the principles of waxing and waning from geng to jia. This is akin to a sovereign issuing commands to slay all yin demons, thereby fulfilling the Dao as expected.

*Annotation:*
There is the fullness and emptiness of heaven and earth, and the fullness and emptiness of the sun and moon.

The sage models their practice upon the fullness and emptiness of heaven and earth, sun and moon. Geng and jia mark the degrees of advancing fire, serving as the measure for the moon. When the moon begins to wax at *Zhen*-geng, the yin tally retreats and the yang fire advances. When the moon waxes to *Qian*-jia, it begins to wane, the yang fire retreats, and the yin tally advances—this is the principle of fullness and emptiness. Moreover, jia-wood is the Dragon, and geng-metal is the Tiger, embodying the imagery of Dragon and Tiger.

The meaning of "empty the heart and fill the abdomen" runs deep, yet it is only to empty the heart that one must first recognize the heart. Better to first refine lead to fill the abdomen, then guard the hall filled with gold.

*Annotation:*
Mercury is essence. Guarding mercury to fill the abdomen brings a hall filled with gold and jade. The One is the elixir. Embracing the One to empty the heart leaves no room for even the finest dust. When the heart is empty, the form cannot long endure—one must refine lead to restrain it. When the abdomen is full, the heart must not cling—one must embrace the One to empty it. To fill the abdomen, first refine lead to restrain mercury. Once mercury dries and the form transforms, then embrace the One to empty the heart. With the heart empty and the form refined, one merges with the Dao, becoming formless. Both principles are wondrous, following different paths to the same destination—only a great sage can comprehend this. The "hall filled with gold" is the essence and qi of the entire body. Those who cultivate the truth must refine lead to fill the abdomen, but in refining lead, one must not disturb their essence, for if essence is diminished, the returning elixir cannot be completed.

*Annotation:*
When the heart is empty, it refers to those who have attained *xing* (nature) but cannot stabilize the form without refining lead to restrain it. When the abdomen is full, it refers to those who have attained *ming* (life-destiny) but cannot empty the heart without embracing the One. Cultivating *xing* and *ming* in proper sequence, when both are attained, they merge, uniting with the Dao in truth. This is not the same as conflating *xing* and *ming* into one, nor can it be achieved through superficial Chan teachings, heterodox practices, or rigid adherence to conventional views.

*(Right: The Two Schools of Xing and Ming.)*

The *Precious Writ of the Yin Tally* exceeds three hundred characters; the *Sacred Text of Dao and Virtue* numbers five thousand. Countless immortals and sages of past and present have all, through these works, grasped the true essence.

*(Right: Citing the* Yin Tally *and* Dao and Virtue *Scriptures.)*

First observe heaven to understand the Five Thieves, then examine earth to pacify the people. Only when the people are at peace and the nation prosperous can war be waged; only after war is won can the sage be revealed.

*Annotation:*
The Five Thieves appear in heaven as the five planets, on earth as the five sacred peaks, and in humans as the five constants. I say: in the five directions, they manifest in humans as the five viscera, and in qi as the five natures. The five constants in things appear as the five tones, five phases, five colors, five metals, five grains, five fruits, and five flavors. The *Yin Tally Scripture* states: "Heaven has five thieves; those who perceive them prosper." If one can see this and cultivate it in reverse, the cosmos lies in their hands, and the myriad transformations arise within their body. Examining earth’s advantages lies in pacifying the people—people are the foundation of the state, and when the foundation is secure, the state is at peace. Thus, the sage treats the body as the state, the elixir as the ruler, fire as the minister, and essence and qi as the people. Those who refine the elixir, if they can observe heaven, capture the Five Thieves, and cultivate in reverse, stealing yin and yang to return to transformation, can seize the true unity of essence, and their own yin mercury will immediately congeal. With essence firm and qi secure, seeking battle ensures victory. Thus, with flawless fire operation, after ten months the work is complete, and one sheds the mortal coil to become a perfected immortal—only after victory in battle can the sage be seen.

But take the "door of death" as the "door of life"; do not cling to the "gate of life" as the "gate of death." Only when you grasp the mechanism of killing and understand its reversals will you know that harm conceals grace.

*Annotation:*
Yin and yang, the five phases—following them brings life, reversing them brings death: this is the ordinary path. How could the ignorant know of the "life that is not life," where life becomes eternal? The "non-sequential" that is truly sequential, where sequence becomes ultimate. If you can understand this mechanism of reversal, then harm conceals grace, and a man may conceive. The "killing mechanism" is the mechanism of theft. Lu Ziye said: "This door has given birth to countless millions, and killed countless millions. If you follow the path of life, you die. If you reverse the path of death, you live." This is what it means to grasp the mechanism of killing and understand its reversals, where harm conceals grace. Ah! As the saying goes: "A dead shop is run by a living man."

*Annotation:*
What gives me life is yin and yang, the five phases. What brings me death is also yin and yang, the five phases. Taking the "door of death" as the "door of life" is the ability to reverse the killing mechanism. To lightly follow life and adhere to the ordinary path is to let what gives me life bring me death. Ordinary people die by following yin and yang, the five phases; the perfected reverse yin and yang to live. Immortals steal this mechanism. Shedding their illusory body, others see them as dead—this is the "non-life." The pure yang true body soars and transforms, enduring as long as heaven and earth—thus the "non-life" that is life becomes eternal. Inverting the five phases, reversing the workings of creation—this is the "non-sequential." Seizing the essence of heaven and earth, returning to the Ultimate Void—this is the "sequential." Thus, the "non-sequential" that is truly sequential becomes the ultimate sequence.

Fire is born from wood, and disaster erupts—do not forcefully attack if you fail to comprehend drilling and refining. Calamity will surely harm you; you must seek the Metal Lord to subdue it.

*Annotation:*
Fire is born from wood, and disaster erupts when it is not controlled. Essence is born from the body, and when emotions stir, it dissipates.

Should one fail to comprehend the art of drilling and refining, calamity will surely harm the self. To subdue it, one must seek the aid of the Metal Lord.

Lord Lü says: When fire erupts from the seven apertures, guard the gates tightly—lest it burn and rupture the River Chariot’s body.

A commentary states: Fire is born from wood, and excessive drilling reduces it to ashes. Here, wood symbolizes the body, and fire symbolizes the primordial qi. The true qi is naturally stored to nourish the body; to squander it lightly is to forfeit one’s life. If one wishes to subdue the body’s child-qi, one must obtain the mother—Heaven and Earth’s Metal Lord—to restrain it. Only then can the root be cultivated, the sacred embryo congealed, and longevity attained.

The Three Powers plunder one another in their time—this is the mechanism of immortals’ virtue and power. When the myriad transformations settle and all cares cease, the hundred bones align, and non-action is realized.

A commentary states: Heaven and Earth plunder the myriad things through the four seasons, thus there is flourishing and withering, yet no perpetual bloom. The myriad things plunder humans through the five flavors, thus there is life and death, yet no perpetual life. Humans plunder the myriad things through the five phases, thus there is formation and decay, yet no perpetual existence. When the three plunderings are harmonized, the Three Powers find peace. Hence, there is birth and death, prosperity and decline, flourishing and fading, day and night, coming and going, life and killing, rise and fall, self and other, right and wrong—all arise in profusion, cycling endlessly without pattern, unfathomable in their natural course. If one can merge these three plunderings into one, reverse their mechanism, and act in accord with their time, then the hundred bones will align, and the myriad transformations will settle of themselves. When the myriad transformations settle, all cares naturally cease. When all cares cease, the Way of non-action is spontaneously realized.

The above quotes the *Yinfu Jing* to elucidate the two medicines.

The teeming myriad things each return to their root; returning to the root and reviving the mandate is to abide forever. Few grasp that knowing the constant and returning to the root is the way—reckless action invites misfortune, as all have heard.

A commentary states: The teeming myriad things each return to their root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called reviving the mandate; reviving the mandate is called the constant. Knowing the constant is called enlightenment—these are the Supreme One’s ultimate words. Before a person is born, they dwell in oblivion, merged with the utmost simplicity. At birth, they receive yin and yang from their parents. The sage reverses this process, seizing the primal qi of pre-heaven to form the elixir’s mother. They plunder the true qi of yin and yang to serve as the foundation for transformation, refining the form to reenter formlessness. Refining qi returns it to utmost simplicity; refining spirit unites it with the Dao in truth. Thus, returning to the root and reviving the mandate is to abide forever. Those who know the constant Way and return to the root are sages—hence they attain longevity. Those who do not know the constant Way and act recklessly are the multitude—hence they invite misfortune.

The above clarifies the *Daode Jing* to elucidate the two medicines.

The songs and discourses of the *Cantong Qi* expound the utmost truth, yet they do not commit the fire-phasing to writing. To grasp the oral instructions that penetrate the mysteries, one must discuss them carefully with an immortal.

A commentary states: The fire-phasing spans six hundred chapters, each resembling the others. Their ebb and flow interweave, aligning with Heaven’s measure. What Heaven conceals, the sages do not transmit in writing. Should one encounter a true master, one must not act rashly.

A commentary states: The six hundred chapters of fire-phasing correspond to sixty hexagrams used in one month, yielding sixty chapters, and ten months complete the six hundred. That each chapter resembles the others means each day is the same. Though one may read ten thousand copies of the *Cantong Qi*, one may still wager on its meaning.

The above cites the *Cantong Qi* and other texts to elucidate fire-phasing.

In a dream, I ascended to the Nine Heavens and met the Western Flower, where the Perfected One bestowed upon me the *Zhixuan Pian*. His questions were simple, his words few—he taught only the refinement of mercury and lead.

A note says: Gao Xiangxian suddenly found his soul ascending to Jade Capital, where the Celestial Emperor took pity on him and commanded the Perfected One of Western Flower to instruct him in the elixir’s secrets. The text briefly states: “Shutong followed his calling, and Wei Boyang led the way, laughing as they entered the realm of non-action. Following the *Lian Shan*, they composed the *Cantong Qi*, leaving it as the eternal sovereign of all elixirs. First, Qian and Kun, the gates of the *Yi*. The Way of Qian becomes the male; the Way of Kun becomes the female. Yet people do not recognize true yin and yang, blindly seeking dragon and tiger across the vast earth.” Though its words are many, it teaches only the discernment of true dragon and true tiger, the refinement of lead and mercury.

Shutong’s surname was Chunyu.

The above cites the *Zhixuan Pian* to elucidate lead and mercury.

A commentary states: The *Zhixuan Pian* is written in elegant and ancient language, devoted entirely to lead and mercury. The passage cited here is a song composed by Gao Xiangxian. Extracting its essence, one may perceive the Way of the *Wuzhen Pian*—it aligns with the *Zhixuan Pian* and its accompanying song. The song says:

The Yellow Emperor sought the Dao in Kongtong’s chamber,
Yet grasped only the rudiments of the Mysterious Outline.
Turning back, he journeyed to Shu to visit Mount Emei,
Where the Celestial Sovereign revealed the True One.
Better first to knock at the gate of Wu and Ji,
For within Wu and Ji lies metal and water.
Metal and water are the root of the Yellow Sprout,
And the Yellow Sprout is the mother of all things.
When the mother obtains the child, it becomes the crucible and cauldron.
At the time when the essences of sun and moon intertwine,
One floats, one sinks, and the pearl takes flight.
The Mysterious Pearl flies to Kunlun’s summit,
Should you seek it, rely on the formless.
The formless obtains it and returns to the Crimson Palace,
Where the Crimson Palace steams it into crimson flesh.
Crimson flesh, raven hair,
By this, the Northern Dipper strikes one’s name from the ledger of death.
Great indeed! Ninety days complete the work,
Leaving traces on Kunfu Bridge at Mount Hair.
Have you not seen:
Shutong followed his calling, and Wei Boyang led the way,
Laughing as they entered the realm of non-action?
Following the *Lian Shan*, they composed the *Cantong Qi*,
Leaving it as the eternal sovereign of all elixirs.
First, it says: Qian and Kun are the gates of the *Yi*.
The Way of Qian is male; the Way of Kun is female.
Yet people do not recognize true yin and yang,
Blindly seeking dragon and tiger across the vast earth.
The sun is Li; the moon is Kan.
Sun and moon, yin and yang, devour each other.
The golden crow dies; the jade hare is born.
All things arise from the resonance of Heaven and Earth.
The two qi bind and entwine, male and female unite,
The four images and five phases harmonize in grand concert.
Day and night, layering and sprouting, follow nature’s law—
Why trouble oneself endlessly with fire-phasing?
There is a time for seeking, a day for gathering—
Seek and gather with utmost care.

The above cites the *Zhixuan Pian* to elucidate mercury and lead.

The Buddhist teachings guide one to cultivate the Land of Ultimate Bliss,
Yet the Land of Ultimate Bliss is but the direction of metal.
For the most part, form and appearance are but this reality—
The other two are not true, merely vague measures.

A note says: The Land of Ultimate Bliss, a cool land, lies in the West—the direction of metal. There, only a single grain of golden elixir, like a millet seed, is produced, weighing one catty. The Buddhists ingest it, hence their sixteen-foot golden bodies. Their wondrous form and appearance arise from this golden elixir’s transformation. The sixteen-foot measure follows the number of two eights, and the West is metal. People cannot fathom this, but the ancient immortals made it clear in a song:

I ask: Who is Gautama?
Dwelling in the Land of Ultimate Bliss in the West.
There, two eights produce the essence of metal,
From which the sixteen-foot golden body is attained.
If one transcends this illusory transformed body,
And receives the true method from a sacred master,
In an instant, after swallowing a millet pearl,
One transforms into a vajra body in a moment.
These words exhaust the matter—
Beyond this, all else is mere conjecture, guarding your measure.

The above explains the supreme vehicle of the Buddhist teachings, borrowing the metaphor of the golden elixir.

The method of inspecting form, closing breath, and contemplating spirit
Is arduous at first, but later becomes a smooth path.
Though one may swiftly traverse ten thousand lands,
Alas, the house is broken, and one must move residence.

A note says: The method of inspecting form, closing breath, and contemplating spirit belongs to the lesser vehicle of the yin path. At first, it is exceedingly difficult, but with practice and mastery, it becomes effortless. In an instant, one may traverse ten thousand lands. Such is the marvel of its numinous clarity—yet alas, the form is yin, the bodily shell fragile and prone to decay. Inevitably, one must seize a womb or usurp a vessel, like moving residence.

Chen Shangyang said: Closing breath to nurture qi is but a yin practice. Though one may endure for ten thousand kalpas, one ultimately falls into emptiness and annihilation. This, too, is a Way.

*The Transmission of Lü Dongbin* records:

One day, Master Dongbin, disguised as a Daoist traveler, visited Kaiguang Temple on Mount Lu. There, he saw the monk Fazhen seated in meditation, having observed strict precepts for twenty years. The Daoist asked: "Can sitting alone attain the Way?"

Fazhen replied: "Yes."

The Daoist said: "The Buddha’s precepts most severely condemn delusion. When you sit, you claim this mind does not exist—but when you encounter things, you cannot forget them even for a moment. Should attachment arise, the four afflictions surge uncontrollably. If you wish to sit in true stillness, first refine the heart. Once the heart is refined, subdue the true qi. When qi is subdued, the Way abides even in sleep; how could it depend solely on sitting?"

Fazhen had yet to awaken. The Daoist then led him through the cloud hall, where they saw a monk in deep slumber. The Daoist asked: "What does this man usually do?"

Fazhen answered: "He sits in meditation, accumulating merit to become a Buddha."

The Daoist said: "Let us sit here awhile and observe him."

After sitting for some time, Fazhen saw a small venomous snake, over three inches long and green in hue, emerge from the sleeping monk’s crown. It slithered down his left foot to the floor, roaming freely before encountering the monk’s spittle and drinking it. Then it climbed into the chamber pot, drank again, and exited. Outside, it crossed a small ditch, circled a flower as if admiring it, then attempted to cross the ditch again—only to retreat when the water overflowed. The Daoist, anticipating its path, dug the earth with a small knife to block it. The snake recoiled, found another route, and climbed up the monk’s right foot, reentering through his crown.

The sleeping monk suddenly awoke and said to the Daoist and Fazhen: "I just had a dream. Let me tell you both: First, I dreamed of exiting through the left gate, where I came upon a feast with exquisite offerings and ate my fill. Then I encountered fine wine and drank deeply. Later, I gathered my robes to cross a small river outside the gate, where I met dozens of beautiful women..."

It sought once more to cross the small river, but the waters had suddenly risen, making passage impossible—so it turned back. There it encountered a bandit who sought to slay it, and in flight it took a shortcut, reentering through the right gate, whereupon the monk awoke.

The Daoist and Fazhen burst into laughter and departed, the Daoist saying to Fazhen: "The monk’s right foot became his gate, his nasal mucus a feast, his urine fine wine, the ditch a river, the flowers and trees beautiful women, and the blade a bandit. Such are the illusory deceptions of human dreams—can one truly seek the Dao and attain Buddhahood through mere sitting?"

Fazhen asked: "What of the snake?"
The Daoist replied: "This monk is often gluttonous, his qi and spirit tainted and transformed—he has already taken on the form of a snake. One day, when he closes his eyes in death, he will be reborn as one. Should he not be terrified?"

Master Wu Lü said: "He saw your sincerity and thus came to instruct you."
Fazhen followed him, and their end was unknown.

Let those who sit in meditation to cultivate Buddhahood reflect on this—should they not tremble with fear?

The *Commentary* states:
To "observe the form" is to hang a mirror in the chamber and store the spirit within, then let it depart.
To "close the breath" is to seal the qi of the entire body, as if one were unborn, still in the womb. Place a goose feather upon the nose—if it does not stir, twelve breaths mark the Lesser Way; one hundred and twenty breaths, the Greater Way. To reach a thousand is to be not far from immortality. As in Bodhidharma’s *Treatise on Embryonic Breathing*.

The wise cultivate the inhalation and exhalation, following the sitting meditation methods of the Two Vehicles, emerging through dhyāna and samādhi.
To "concentrate the spirit" is to store it in one place—whether between the brows at the top of the head, within the thirty-nine chambers of the Great Cavern, or in the inner and outer qi of the Yellow Court, or by practicing the Sixteen Contemplations to depart.

All these methods lack the transmutation of the Golden Elixir; they are but yin spirits. Those who seize wombs, usurp bodies, or transfer dwellings—along with the "old dwellers"—are called the "Four Fruits" disciples. If they could subdue dragons and tigers, how long would their golden houses last?

The *Annotation* says: If true gold builds the house, how could it ever wither?
The *Scripture of Salvation* states: "Even withered bones revive and rise as men—how much more those who have swallowed the millet-grain pearl!"

Seizing wombs and usurping bodies are the ways of the Four Fruits disciples—mere yin spirits and ghosts.
Master Daoguang said: "Seizing wombs and usurping bodies are the paths of those clinging to emptiness. Subduing dragons and tigers is the marvel of the Returned Elixir."

The *Commentary* states:
Yin spirits generate consciousness and enter the mother’s womb to be reborn.
To "usurp a body" is to seize one already entered by another’s consciousness for one’s own rebirth.
To "transfer dwelling" is to borrow the living form of a transformed being and invest one’s consciousness within.
The "old dweller" preserves the nature of the yin spirit to sustain the body, preventing it from entering extinction.

The Four Fruits lack the transmutation of the Golden Elixir; all are yin spirits.
(Here ends the teachings of the Daoist and Buddhist Lesser Vehicles.)

The Great Dao’s cultivation may be easy or difficult—know that it depends on both oneself and Heaven. Without accumulating deeds and bestowing hidden virtue, demonic obstructions will arise at every turn.

The *Annotation* says: Demonic obstructions lie in Heaven, but cultivation rests with oneself. Without bestowing hidden virtue, obstacles arise at every step.

The *Commentary* states: The previous verse said—
*"Swallow a speck of the numinous elixir, and you will know it depends on me, not Heaven."*
It extols the wondrous power of the Golden Elixir.
This verse says—
*"Know that it depends on both me and Heaven."*
It exhorts the learner: upon hearing the Great Dao, one must also accumulate deeds and bestow virtue to seek Heaven’s aid. One must not rely solely on the elixir’s numinosity, for demonic obstructions will surely arise.

Though your wisdom surpasses Yan [Hui] and Min [Sun], without a teacher’s transmission, do not force guesses. For the alchemical classics lack oral instructions—where then can you conceive the numinous embryo?

The *Annotation* says: A thousand scriptures and ten thousand treatises merely spread branches and leaves. The Supreme Dao is not complex—only the mind-seal is transmitted. Without a true teacher, one labors in vain with words and ears.

This Dao, without the true teacher’s oral instructions, cannot be forcibly guessed, even with the wisdom of Yan and Min.

Cultivate while mingling with the world, harmonizing your light. Be round when round, square when square. Whether manifest or hidden, yielding or resisting—none can fathom your conduct. How then can others discern your path?

The *Annotation* says: Clad in coarse cloth yet holding jade, one harmonizes light and blends with the dust. Mending broken fences, one transcends self and others. Whether in seclusion or prominence, compliance or defiance—how can others measure such a one?

(Here ends the admonitions for the world.)

*Master Purple Yang’s Commentary and Subcommentary on the* Awakening to Reality*, Scroll Six—Concluded*
*Master Purple Yang’s Commentary and Subcommentary on the* Awakening to Reality*, Scroll Seven*

Twelve *Moon Over the West River* verses, arranged by the twelve months of the year.
The Immortal Elder’s self-annotation says: "West is the direction of Metal. River is the body of Water. Moon is the function of the medicine."
The Nameless Master’s annotation says: "The Immortal Boatman composed these verses to the twelve-month cycle, revealing the Great Dao."

The outer medicine resembles the inner; outer communication requires inner flow as well. The elixir heads merge and harmonize, their cultivation differing in two aspects.

Within lies the celestial true fire, the furnace glowing crimson. The outer furnace demands diligent effort—nothing surpasses the wondrous true seed.

The *Annotation* says: The *Breaking Delusion Song of the Gate of Simplicity* states:
*"The Dao lies within—establish the furnace. The cauldron is set without—yet the path is external. From without comes Kan and Li, lead and mercury—yet they reside within."*
This clarifies the inner and outer elixirs.

The outer medicine is the Golden Elixir, wrought in the crucible of the two eights, completed in less than half an hour. The inner medicine is the Golden Fluid Returned Elixir, wrought within one’s own belly, requiring ten full months before the embryo can be delivered and the spirit transformed.

Observe how these two medicines merge, how the elixir heads function—though roughly similar, their fire-tending methods differ greatly. When cultivating the elixir, at the outset of inner medicine refinement, if the elixir head’s alignment errs by even a hair’s breadth, the great medicine will not form. Be reverent! Be reverent!

Though the inner medicine possesses true fire, blazing crimson within the earthen cauldron, it still relies on the outer furnace’s work—augmenting, calling forth, withdrawing, and replenishing—to ensure no deviation, lest peril ensue.

Yet the endless transformations of inner and outer true fire depend entirely on the marvel of true lead. This substance alone can seize mercury, preventing its flight. Ye Wenshu, failing to grasp this principle, claimed that inner medicine is refined by true fire, while outer medicine requires mundane fire to augment and call forth. Such a view, peering at heaven through a tube, merits but a laugh. Little does he know that though inner and outer medicines differ, they are in truth one and the same Way.

What is meant by inner and outer medicines? Observe how within a single body, the essence of heaven and earth is gathered to give life, and through the molding of yin and yang, form is achieved. Thus, within this form, essence, qi, and spirit reign supreme. Spirit arises from qi, and qi from essence. These three, born after heaven and earth, are the most yin of substances.

If a cultivator clings to refining only their own body, they do no more than temper these three—essence, qi, and spirit. Yet how can these three, all born after heaven and earth, purely yin and devoid of yang, transform form into pure yang and transcend the bounds of heaven and earth? As the Immortal Elder said: *"Refining but one substance yields only frailty."* Zhongli Quan declared: *"Tears, saliva, essence, fluids, qi, blood—these seven are all yin."* And again: *"Refining but one substance is solitary yin."* Zhen Yizi said: *"Solitary yin cannot generate itself; solitary yang cannot complete itself."* The *Cantong Qi* states: *"A hen hatching at dawn will not produce a chick."*

The sages knew that the true qi of one’s own body, born after heaven and earth, is inherently yin-yang, difficult to seize and easy to lose. Thus, they sought the primordial qi, true yin and true yang—the substances of the two eights, kindred in nature—seizing them in a single hour to refine a pellet of utmost yang, called true lead. This transformation occurs without, hence it is called the outer medicine. With this yang elixir, one tempers their own yin mercury, like a cat seizing a mouse. The yang elixir is the mother qi of heaven and earth; one’s own mercury is the child qi. When mother qi subdues child qi, are they not of the same kind? This transformation occurs within, hence it is called the inner medicine.

Thus, the Immortal Elder said: *"The medicine meets its kindred qi and takes form; the Way resides in emptiness, merging with nature."* Zhen Yizi said: *"Before heaven and earth existed in chaos, true lead, attaining the One, was born first, gradually giving rise to heaven and earth, yin and yang, the five phases, and the myriad things."* The *Cantong Qi* states: *"Born before heaven and earth, majestic and exalted."* All these attest to the primordial One qi.

With the primordial yang elixir, one tempers their own yin mercury, transmuting it into pure yang. Then, employing the fire of yin-yang symbols, one applies the methods of withdrawal and replenishment. After ten months of work, form is transformed into qi, qi into spirit, and spirit merges with the Dao, becoming formless. Its transformations are unfathomable, enabling one to transcend heaven and earth, stand beyond creation, grasp and command heaven and earth, mold yin and yang—yet remain unmolded by them. This is the doing of the One qi born before heaven and earth. Such is its marvel, hence it is called *"the peerless true seed."*

How could the qi of utmost yin, born after heaven and earth, serve as the inner medicine? How could mundane cinnabar, common mercury, or mundane fire—impure substances of a different kind—serve as the outer medicine? Scholars of the Dao must delve into the origins, rejecting false doctrines, lest they forever sink into the three realms and invite the wheel of rebirth.

The commentary states: *"A deviation by a hair’s breadth prevents the great medicine from forming"*—this aligns with the verse: *"A hair’s difference, and the elixir fails."* The two eights are not a furnace; the term is but a metaphor. The furnace is not a literal furnace.

The outer medicine coalesces into the Golden Elixir through the fire of yin-yang ascent and descent; the inner medicine likewise coalesces into the Golden Fluid Returned Elixir through the same fire. The outer is nurtured through symbolic methods; the inner is nurtured through symbolic methods. Thus, though inner and outer differ, they are in truth one and the same Way.

How apt are the words of Tang Immortal Jian Daling: *"People know longevity lies in returning essence to replenish qi, yet the cinnabar is within—how could it be external?"* This is but vulgar talk, ignorant of the true realm. I ask: Can essence be returned? Can qi be replenished? Regulating breath, setting the mechanism—between exhalation and inhalation, purity is retained and turbidity expelled. Is this truly an outward release and inward absorption? Where does the nature that returns go, and from whence does it come?

Some mistake exhalation and inhalation for the essence’s bloom—yet what of the harm to the waist’s vitality? Others take exhalation and inhalation for essence and qi—yet what of the labor that injures the skin? In the prime of life, the body is already a vessel of decline. Once the essence’s bloom is lost, spirit and soul scatter—what then can be returned? Those who preserve their true qi from youth and prolong life through exercise may at best become lower-grade earthbound immortals, yet they cannot ascend the void.

Only by externally refining the fire dragon and internally circulating the golden fluid can one truly ascend as a high immortal. Judging by the words of high immortals, refining but one substance cannot lead to immortality.

Now, the distinction between inner and outer medicines is made plain, yet people remain ignorant. Alas, how utterly devoid of affinity they are!

Chen Shangyangzi said: *"Cultivators must first thoroughly understand the true workings of the two yin-yang forces, inner and outer. Then, entering the chamber to begin work, success comes with ease. The inner medicine is one’s own innate possession; the outer medicine arises from the body’s manifestations. The inner medicine never leaves one’s own body; the outer medicine never departs the realm of form. The inner medicine completes nature; the outer medicine completes both nature and life. The inner medicine is essence; the outer medicine is qi. Essence and qi are inseparable—hence, they are the true seed."*

To achieve celestial immortality, one must cultivate both nature and life. If you wish to retain true lead and contain mercury, the household minister must never depart from the sovereign’s presence.

Wood and metal, though separated, cannot meet without cause—one must employ a matchmaker to bring them together. Wood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness; metal’s disposition cherishes wood’s benevolence. They devour and yet embrace each other, and only then does the male conceive.

*Annotation:* This speaks of inner imagery. The "household minister" is one’s own true qi. One’s true qi coalesces through the golden elixir, while the golden elixir gains its numinous efficacy from one’s own mercury. The two substances depend on each other, their affections intertwined, enabling transformation and spiritual communion. Hence it is said: *"If you wish to retain true lead and contain mercury, the household minister must never depart from the sovereign’s presence."*

The elixir pertains to metal and resides without; one’s own mercury pertains to wood and dwells within. Though these two are separated, the Yellow Dame forges them into an elixir, which is then swallowed into the belly to unite with one’s own mercury. It is also by the Yellow Dame’s mediation that the two are drawn together, harmonized, and conjoined in the coupling of yin and yang through the firing process. Wood’s nature yearns for metal; metal’s disposition clings to wood. They devour and yet embrace, forming a union like husband and wife, nurturing the infant immortal within the belly—only then does the male conceive.

This Dao is most profound and wondrous. Without benevolence and compassion for all things, without the accumulation of hidden virtue, how could one in this lifetime partake of it?

The White Tiger’s first meridian is the supreme treasure, the divine water of the Flowery Pond—true gold. Thus we know the wellspring of supreme goodness runs deep, unlike ordinary medicinal substances.

If you wish to refine the nine revolutions, you must first temper the self and hold fast to the heart-mind. Gather in due season to determine ascent and descent; advance the fire with utmost caution against peril.

*Annotation:* "First" refers to the beginning. The "first meridian" is the qi of the initial crescent, not the celestial waters of women. One must not defile the sacred Dao with the twenty-four postures of the Three Peaks—such defilement is impossible, just as one cannot ascend to heaven by steps.

The true unity of qi in heaven is called the true unity of water; in the tiger, it is the qi of the initial crescent, warmed and refined within the Flowery Pond. This divine water is the supreme treasure—true gold—all of which does not depart from the essence of true unity. Flowing through various regions, it assumes many names yet retains its creative power.

As the scripture says: *"Supreme goodness is like water."* For the water of true unity arises before heaven and earth, hence its wellspring of goodness is deep and far-reaching. It is not comparable to the turbid substances of ordinary postnatal medicinal ingredients.

The "nine revolutions" refer to nine years. After the ten-month gestation when the embryo is complete and the fetal body is shed, Bodhidharma faced the wall for nine years before returning west with a single sandal—there is indeed a reason for this.

To refine the nine revolutions, one must first circulate the fire for ten months, gathering in due season to determine ascent and descent, distinguishing host from guest. Abide in femininity without masculinity to avoid danger, naturally transforming form into qi, qi into spirit. Embracing the origin and guarding the One, after nine years of accomplishment, both form and spirit attain perfection, merging with the Dao. The sages forcibly named this the *"Nine-Revolutions Golden Liquor of the Great Return."*

Whose maiden is the two-eights? Where dwells the nine-threes’ gentleman? They call themselves wood-fluid and metal-essence, meeting earth to form the three natures.

Then, borrowing Ding Gong’s forging, husband and wife begin their joyful union. The river chariot dares not pause even briefly, conveying them to the summit of Kunlun Peak.

*Annotation:* The two-eights are a yin number. The maiden is one’s own true qi. Also said: the nine-threes are a yang number. The gentleman is one’s own yang elixir. When these two substances meet in the earthen cauldron of the cinnabar field, they form the three natures.

Ding Gong is fire. Husband and wife—lead and mercury—reside in the earthen cauldron of the cinnabar field, daily conjoining in the joyful fire of marital union. This fire is carried into the earthen cauldron to refine lead and mercury, receiving this symbolic confirmation to generate the substance of golden liquor.

Then, ascending from the Tail Gate in reverse to the summit of Mud Pill Peak, it descends into the mouth and is slowly swallowed back into the earthen cauldron of the cinnabar field. Continuously circulating thus without cease, like the river chariot’s unending flow, it transforms into the golden liquor of the returned elixir.

Master Zhongli said: *"From the Tail Gate straight up to the Mud Nine Peak, the river chariot traverses hundreds of times."* Master Haichan said: *"If yellow sprouts fill the blood-brain, though a thousand years pass, the body shall not die."* This is the proof.

*Another version:* Ding Gong is fire.

The river chariot is water, which is the union of the *yin* tally and *yang* fire. Day and night, it circulates without cease, embodying the meaning of the river chariot’s unending flow.

A commentary states: The *Cantong Qi* says, *"Three things form one household, all returning to wu and ji."* It takes metal, wood, and fire as the three things. It also says, *"When the three natures unite, they share a common origin."* Here, it takes metal, water, and fire as the three natures, all referring to the symbolic forms of the external medicine. Now, when speaking of the three natures, wood essence serves as the internal medicine, metal essence as the external medicine, and their meeting above completes the three natures, collectively symbolizing the internal and external methods. Thus, the three natures adapt to their respective uses. Those who mistakenly take *xing* (nature) as a surname commit an error upon error. For *xing* is the nature of things, the nature of humans, the nature of the elixir, the nature of the Five Phases—how could it be a surname?

A quatrain says:
*Fire arises on Kunlun, yin and yang conjoined,*
*Speaking of both inner and outer Kunlun.*
It also says:
*If it meets Kunlun’s northwest path,*
*It refers solely to the inner Kunlun, where the Qian trigram of the North Sea and the image of xiang exchange.*

Now, when it speaks of Kunlun, it specifically alludes to Mud Pill Peak. Thus, it repeatedly draws analogies to the three natures. Kunlun, as a metaphor throughout the text, must not be rigidly interpreted.

The Cowherd and Weaver Girl follow the Dao’s original path,
The tortoise and snake naturally embody heaven’s decree.
The toad and crow meet at the new moon, uniting in beauty,
The two qi mutually support and circulate.
All is the wondrous workings of Qian and Kun—
Who grasps this true essence?
When yin and yang are blocked and divided, faults arise;
How can heaven endure and earth last long?

A note says: The Cowherd recognizes the Weaver Girl—once a year, they join the Great Yin and Great Yang; once a month, the tortoise and snake unite. These pairings, like coiled embrace, are all brought about by the two qi of yin and yang. Truly, this is the root of the Dao, and the workings of the great elixir of golden cinnabar follow the same pattern. For the true One qi, though formless and invisible, cannot manifest as a grain of millet without the union of the initial *yin* and *yang* qi of the second and eighth phases. After obtaining the elixir, without the binding and refining of tally fire, how could the golden liquor of the returned elixir be transformed?

The *Cantong Qi* says:
*Mandarin ducks call to each other,*
*On the river’s isle.*
*The fair maiden,*
*The noble man’s good mate.*
*The male does not dwell alone,*
*The female does not live in solitude.*
*The Dark Warrior—tortoise and snake—*
*Coil together in embrace.*
This clarifies that the female and male inherently require each other—such is the principle; what doubt remains? Reverse the cultivation, and the cosmos lies within your grasp.

True One Master said: *"Solitary yin cannot generate, nor can solitary yang complete itself. Only through the union of female and male qi can the Dao of generation and transformation arise."* That heaven and earth endure long is due to the natural Dao of yin-yang union. If heaven did not descend and earth did not rise, if the four seasons did not follow their order, the myriad things would not be born. Thus, the immortal elder repeatedly emphasizes this chapter, and those who deeply understand this meaning may grasp it intuitively.

**The Internal and External Medicines**

Seven returns: cinnabar returns to its root.
Nine reversions: golden liquor returns to truth.
Do not fixate on the *yin* and *zi* counts of *kun* and *shen*;
Only observe the Five Phases as the standard.

It is but a single taste of mercury,
Circulating through all the celestial stems.
When the yin-yang count is complete, it naturally attains the numinous,
Entering and exiting without leaving the Mysterious Female.

A note says: The nine reversions and seven returns do not depart from the generative and completion numbers of heaven, earth, and the Five Phases. Heaven’s one generates water, and earth’s six completes it. Dwelling in the north, it accumulates the *yin* qi of Kan to become true water—thus the *Cantong Qi* says, *"Six dwells."* Earth’s two generates fire, and heaven’s seven completes it. Returning south, it nurtures the qi of Li to produce cinnabar—hence the seven returns of cinnabar, returning to its root. Heaven’s three generates wood, and earth’s eight completes it. Dwelling in the east, it occupies the Zhen position to become mercury—thus the *Cantong Qi* says, *"Eight returns."* Earth’s four generates metal, and heaven’s nine completes it. Metal returns west, governing the Dui position to become metal—hence the nine reversions of metal, returning to truth. Heaven’s five generates earth, and earth’s ten completes it. The two earths unite and dwell in the center, meeting the four images to form the elixir. Thus, the golden elixir is completed without departing from the Five Phases—hence, *"Only observe the Five Phases as the standard."* How can the counts of *yin* to *shen* and *zi* to *kun* be taken as the seven returns and nine reversions?

Mercury is lead, and lead is the true One qi. When the true One qi coagulates into essence, it is called the essence of the true One. Essence is lead. The true One qi first transforms into water in the north, then into cinnabar in the south, then into mercury in the east, then into metal in the west, and finally into earth in the center. Thus, the golden elixir is not born without heaven and earth, not produced without the sun and moon, not perfected without the four seasons, not completed without the Five Phases, and not achieved without the total count. Therefore, as it traverses all the celestial stems and the yin-yang count is fulfilled, it naturally attains the numinous and undergoes transformation. Yet its wondrous workings of creation and transformation never depart from the gate of the Mysterious Female—this is called the root of heaven and earth. The principle of the Mysterious Female has already been explained in the section on the Mysterious Female, a note rarely understood in the world.

A commentary says: The common view that *yin* to *shen* constitutes the seven returns and *zi* to *kun* the nine reversions is incorrect. Zhang Sui’s commentary on the *Cantong Qi* states: Water, fire, metal, wood, and earth are the Five Phases; water and fire are the sun and moon; metal and wood are the dragon and tiger; earth corresponds to heaven and earth. When refined, they form the golden elixir. Thus, heaven’s water, with six, dwells in the north, accumulating Kan as water. Heaven’s wood, with eight, dwells in the east, occupying Zhen as cinnabar. Heaven’s fire, with seven, returns south, belonging to Li as mercury. Heaven’s metal, with nine, returns west, transforming Dui into metal. Heaven’s five returns to the center to form the elixir. Thus, qi first transforms into water, then into cinnabar, then into mercury, then into metal, and finally into the elixir.

Thus, the elixir is born not without heaven and earth, completed not without the sun and moon, perfected not without the four seasons, and achieved not without the Five Phases. By refining the body of pure yang and transforming the form of the true scripture, the meaning of the six dwelling, seven returning, eight reverting, and nine reversing becomes clearly evident. This is why the Yellow Emperor, Laozi, the immortals, and the sages held it in such high regard.

Master Wuming’s annotations state that these celestial stems correspond to the positions of the seventy-two stems, embodying the principle of the seven returns and nine reversions. This medicine is most divine and sacred; alas, the shallow virtue of the ruler may prove difficult to bear. Harmonizing lead and mercury takes less than a morning, and the early signs of the mysterious pearl soon appear. If a determined practitioner can refine and subdue them, why should one not dwell in the marketplace or court? The work is easy, the medicine not distant—yet to reveal it would make others burst into laughter.

The annotation states: When the golden elixir enters the mouth, one immediately ascends to the rank of a sage—is this not most divine and sacred? Refining it takes no more than half an hour, and the form of the golden elixir appears at once—is this not most simple and easy? It is found in every household, unrestricted by marketplace or court—is this not most near? Precisely because it is most divine, most sacred, most simple, most easy, and most near, revealing it would make others laugh unawares. Those who attain it need only fear that their hidden virtue is too shallow to bear the Way—scholars, take heed.

The commentary states: The true one’s intent is that the refinement of the golden elixir may be practiced anywhere, whether in the marketplace or the imperial court. The work is very easy, the ingredients very near. One need only find a secluded and serene place to begin. The earlier poem’s meaning—*"Do not hide in the mountains before refining the returning elixir, for in vain do you guard solitude in the deep mountains"*—arises because worldly scholars, failing to grasp the true essence, vie for profit in the marketplace and fame at court, believing both can be pursued simultaneously. This is like the old saying: *"With a hundred thousand strings of cash at one’s waist, one rides a crane to Yangzhou."* Alas! One must utterly sever attachment to fame and profit, forever renounce desires, and enter seclusion for ten months before one may approach the truth.

Within the yang of the male lies the essence of the female; true yin embraces the essence of yang. When these two harmonize, the medicine is complete, transmuting the soul, spirit, and essence into sageliness. Trust in a single grain of the golden elixir: a serpent that swallows it immediately transforms into a dragon; a chicken that consumes it becomes a phoenix. All enter the sacred realm of empty yang.

The annotation states: The yang within the male is the latent *qi* of the dragon, which is mercury. The yin embracing yang is the latent *qi* of the tiger, which is lead. When these two substances unite, the numinous elixir arises spontaneously. Swallowed into the abdomen, it transmutes the yang soul to dissolve the yin spirit. A single grain, no larger than a millet seed—whether a chicken swallows it or a serpent devours it—transforms into a dragon or phoenix, soaring into the sacred realm of true yang. Such is the divine and sacred power of this medicine.

**External Medicine Concludes.**

Heaven and earth alternate between closure and openness; morning and evening must recognize the cycles of *tun* and *meng*. Like wheels converging at the hub or waters flowing east, the marvel lies in the art of withdrawal and addition. Attain the One, and all things are complete—cease to distinguish east, west, south, or north. Reduce and reduce again, guarding past efforts; the treasure of life must not be trifled with.

The annotation states: The method of firing the elixir begins with *tun* and *meng* and concludes with *pi* and *tai*. Day and night, one circulates the fire in accord with the tally, returning it to the crucible—like the spokes of a wheel converging at the hub, or the hundred rivers flowing into the sea. Such is the wondrous transformation of withdrawal and addition.

The Most High said: *"When you attain the One, all things are complete."* How profound these words! The One is the essence of true unity. The *qi* of true unity generates yin and yang; yin and yang generate the Four Images; the Four Images generate the Five Phases; the Five Phases generate the myriad things—all arising from the transformations of the *qi* of true unity. Thus, the essence of true unity is the mother of heaven and earth, the origin of yin and yang, the ancestor of the Four Images, the root of the Five Phases, and the foundation of the myriad things. Attain this One, and all things are complete—east, west, south, and north may be forgotten. Reduce and reduce again to guard past efforts, and only then can one fully grasp the marvel of the One.

For the One has form: it is shaped by the firing of yin and yang. Once a single grain is swallowed into the five viscera, as before, one must circulate the tally of yin and yang fire with care, guarding past efforts to fully realize the marvel of the One. Be vigilant against danger, cautious of peril, and do not act lightly, lest the mysterious pearl of life’s treasure be lost. Thus, one must guard past efforts.

The commentary states: The work begins with *tun* and *meng*, employing the sixty-four hexagrams over a month. It concludes with *pi* and *tai*, with bathing occurring in the second and eighth months of the year. This is the symbolic method of the internal medicine. Attaining the One is the symbolic method of the external medicine. As the Lüxian song says: *"The Three Mao True Lords are called the One."* The Most High spoke of the Dao as *"reduction"*—now, during the ten months of practice, one must reduce affairs and extinguish thoughts, guard against danger and peril, and not allow the slightest distraction, lest the treasure of life be lost. Like an infant in the womb, utterly oblivious and unknowing, one’s body rests within the crucible of heaven and earth. By maintaining constant purity, heaven and earth are wholly subsumed. Thus, the true one repeatedly admonishes to reduce and reduce again, guarding past efforts.

At the winter solstice, the first yang returns; every thirty days, a yang line is added. At the new moon, the *fu* hexagram appears at dawn; at the full moon, the *qian* hexagram marks the beginning and end. The sun further divides into cold and heat: when yang is born, it rises again at midnight. At noon, the *gou* hexagram brings the first yin—one must know the times of dusk and dawn to refine the medicine.

The annotation states: At the winter solstice, the first yang is born, forming the *fu* hexagram. After thirty days, a yang line is added, producing the *lin* hexagram, then the *tai* hexagram, the *dazhuang* hexagram, the *guai* hexagram, and finally the *qian* hexagram—this is the season of yang fire. When yang reaches its extreme, yin is born. Thus, at the summer solstice, the first yin appears, forming the *gou* hexagram. Every thirty days, a yin line is added, producing the *dun* hexagram, the *pi* hexagram, the *guan* hexagram, the *bo* hexagram, and finally the *kun* hexagram—this is the season of yin tally. When yin reaches its extreme, yang is reborn, cycling endlessly. Such are the great numbers of the waxing and waning of *qi* over the year.

The sage transposes this yearly cycle of *qi* into a single month, taking the new moon’s dawn as *fu*, reaching pure yang at the full moon—two and a half days corresponding to thirty days, thus forming one month. At the full moon, it is pure *qian*; from the sixteenth day, *gou*’s first yin is born, hence the saying: “At the full moon’s end, *qian* concludes and *gou* begins.” As yin first stirs, it is called the *omen*. This is the great reckoning of *qi*’s cyclical passage through the heavens in a single month.

The sage further transposes the monthly cycle into a single day, dividing it into the *qi* of cold, heat, warmth, and coolness—the four seasons. Thus, at midnight’s *zi* hour, the first yang is born as the *fu* hexagram; after noon, the first yin is born as the *gou* hexagram. Applying the tally of fire and the interplay of yin and yang—ascending and descending, withdrawing and adding, advancing and retreating—each aligns with heaven and earth’s four seasons and the waxing and waning of yin and yang, without the slightest deviation. Hence the saying: “To refine the medicine, one must know dusk and dawn.” Dusk and dawn are the origins of yin and yang. This is the great reckoning of *qi*’s cyclical passage through the heavens in a single day.

The commentary states: The great celestial cycle of a year represents the ascent and descent of heaven and earth. Heaven and earth are separated by eighty-four thousand *li*, divided into six nodes. Earth’s yin conceals yang; from the summer solstice at the celestial center, yin *qi* descends through six nodes to earth, completing one cycle of yin-yang transformation in a year. The sage models this with the twelve hexagrams’ doubled six lines. Yang fire from *zi* to *si* grows as yin wanes, so external yang adheres to internal, and internal yin adheres to external, each following what is abundant. Yin *qi* is internal, yang vigor external—not the inner and outer of the hexagram’s structure. Thus, *fu* and *tai* are called the lesser parents, rooted in *qian* and *kun*, to clarify the waxing and waning of the fire tally.

The lesser celestial cycle of a month represents the conjunction of sun and moon. The moon receives the sun’s light, manifesting its waxing and waning; though the sun is not mentioned, it is implicit. A month is divided into five days per phase, six phases per month—just as yin and yang are divided into nodes. The moon’s waxing and waning complete one cycle in a month. The sage models this with the eight trigrams of the Earlier Heaven, excluding *kan* and *li* as the sun and moon’s bodies, their waxing and waning also comprising six phases. The six trigrams’ pure three lines mirror this. The celestial tally is invisible but revealed through the sun and moon. Yang lines symbolize the birth of the *hun*; yin lines, the birth of the *po*. The *hun* grows to fullness at the full moon, forming *qian*; the *po* grows to completion at the dark moon, forming *kun*. Five days make one phase, each phase advancing one line. The first half of the month advances yang lines; the second half, yin lines, corresponding to the moon’s waxing and waning. *Jia*, *yi*, *bing*, *ding*, *geng*, and *xin* align with the directions of the moon’s dusk and dawn, hence the six hexagrams’ received *jia*. The six voids of *ren* and *gui*: *yang ren* is *li* within *qian*; *yin gui* is *kan* within *kun*. *Yang ren* and *yin gui* belong to the northern darkness, where sun and moon conceal their function, shrouded in obscurity. *Kan*’s *wu* and *li*’s *ji* are the bodies of sun and moon. The region of *wu* and *ji* faces the light, where sun and moon display their benevolence and radiance, visibly manifest. Together with the six voids, the ten celestial stems are complete; with the ten stems, the five phases are fully arrayed. This is the undivided Great Ultimate.

Before the new moon, at the *zi* hour, the sun is at *zi*, the moon at *gui*. After the new moon’s conjunction, at the *zi* hour, the moon is at *ren*, the sun at *zi*—concealed in *ren* and *gui*. Before the new moon, at the *wu* hour, the sun is at *wu*, the moon at *ji*, which receives *ding*. After the new moon’s conjunction, at the *wu* hour, the sun is at *wu*, the moon at *wu*, which receives *bing*—displaying benevolence in *wu* and *ji*. At the new and dark moons, they unite at *zi* and *wu*.

If the year’s twelve hexagrams are divided into six phases, each phase comprises two hexagrams. At the month’s beginning, growth starts from *kun*, reaching *tai* at the dark moon—this is the first quarter, *kun*’s *jiji*. At the month’s beginning, waning starts from *kun*, reaching *pi* at the full moon—this is the last quarter, the *weiji* of *qian* and *kun*. *Qian* and *kun* alternate, corresponding to yin and yang, advance and retreat, *pi* and *tai*, ascent and descent, each half of yin and yang. Hence the saying: “At the first quarter, metal is half a *jin*; at the last quarter, water is half a *jin*.”

The sun rises at *jia-mao* and sets at *geng-you*. The moon’s fullness begins at *zhen-geng* and wanes at *qian-jia*. At the winter solstice’s *zi*, the days gradually lengthen; at the summer solstice’s *wu*, the days gradually shorten. The moon’s yang retreats from the new moon’s *zi* and advances from the full moon’s *wu*. At the center of heaven and earth, the celestial bodies display their radiance—none greater than the sun and moon. The sun and moon are *qi*: they have form but no substance, thus they harmonize without obstruction. Yang embracing yin forms the sun; yin embracing yang forms the moon. Therefore, a moment’s mystery and half a year’s duration both draw their patterns from this.

Metal and water each half—this is the *qi* of the first quarter. The *qi* of the first quarter is supremely clear, untainted, possessing *qi* but no form. Measuring the year by the moon: one month of thirty days corresponds to three hundred sixty hours in a year, each hour representing one day; two and a half days and thirty hours correspond to one month. The short month lacks twelve hours, which are adjusted within the fifteen days—this is the method of supplementing days within the month. Thus, *qian* and *kun* are the great parents, while the moon’s *kan* and *li* clarify the advance and retreat of the fire tally.

The daily celestial cycle, the moon’s waxing and waning in a month, and the ascent and descent of yin and yang in a year—great and lesser celestial cycles—all share the same transformative pattern. Measuring a year by an hour: a month is evenly divided into two *qi*, so *zi* corresponds to the eleventh month, *ren* to *Great Snow*, and *zi* to the winter solstice—this is rooted in *qian* and *kun*, taking the day as the year. Measuring a month by an hour: one hour governs two and a half days; two hours make one phase; six hours make one *qi*, or half a month. Measuring the day by the hour: *mao* corresponds to the eighth day’s first quarter, *you* to the twenty-third day’s last quarter.

The *hai*’s darkening, the *zi*’s new moon, the *si*’s fullness, the *wu*’s waning—these are applied to *kan* and *li*, taking the day as the month, to clarify the fire tally’s seasons, growth and decline, advance and retreat, uniting the three celestial cycles of year, month, and day as one. Modeling them with the sixty hexagrams, all transformations share the same pattern. Excluding the four *yin-yang* hexagrams, heaven and earth, sun and moon envelop the myriad things yet remain unused, combining the sixty-four hexagrams’ three hundred eighty-four lines into the weight of one *jin*, calculating the two *pian*’s tally while the four hexagrams’ function lies within.

The great celestial cycle is rooted in *qian* and *kun*, modeled by Fu Xi’s hexagram diagram. The lesser celestial cycle’s lunar waxing and waning, the *kan* and *li* tally’s correspondence, also align. The lesser celestial cycle is applied to *kan* and *li*, modeled by King Wen’s hexagram diagram, while the great celestial cycle’s celestial and terrestrial ascent and descent, the flowing of *qian* and *kun*, likewise converge.

Thus, the year’s *fu* is the month’s *zhen*; the year’s pregnancy is the month’s *xun*; the day’s *fu* is the hour’s *zi*; the day’s pregnancy is the hour’s *wu*. It is further evident that *qian*, *kun*, *kan*, and *li* are employed everywhere without exception, and the great and lesser parents are present in all without fail. Rooted in *qian* and *kun*, *qian* and *kun* become the whole body of *kan* and *li*. Applied to *kan* and *li*, *kan* and *li* become the central *qi* of *qian* and *kun*. Heaven is the sun, and the sun is heaven; earth is the moon, and the moon is earth. Heaven conceals the yin sun, yang contains yin; earth conceals the yang moon, yin contains yang. Though the forms of heaven, earth, sun, and moon differ in size, and the functions of year, month, day, and hour vary in duration, considered together, all are the undivided perfection of the Great Ultimate. Once divided, from *zhun* and *meng* to *ji* and *wei*, the sixty hexagrams are employed—two hexagrams per day to correspond to one day, sixty hexagrams in full to correspond to one month, six hundred *pian* to correspond to one year. To speak of the small: within one hour, it also encompasses three hundred sixty. One hour is one *miao*; twelve *miao* make one *fen*; thirty *fen* total three hundred sixty *miao*, forming the count of one hour—this is the subtle function of an hour. The immortal’s art of seizing the mechanism is not something worldly people can comprehend.

Thus, the vastness of a year, the smallness of a month, the *miao* of a day, the mystery of an hour—employing heaven’s Dao, the flourishing of the myriad things. The images of heaven, earth, sun, and moon, their ascent and descent, waxing and waning, all do not depart from this. Great indeed is the *Yi*! This is its ultimate.

**Right: Clarifying the Fire Tally**

Without discerning the five phases and four images,
How can one distinguish cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver?
Before ever hearing of the fire tally in elixir refinement,
One prematurely styles oneself a great hermit.
Unwilling to reflect on one’s own errors,
One further teaches others the wrong path.
Leading them astray, forever lost in the sea of delusion—
Such hasty deceit, how can one bear it?

**Annotation:**
The myriad volumes of elixir classics find their wonder in the *Cantong qi*’s three characters. The *Song of the Cauldron*’s single chapter is the marrow of elixir classics. Yet those who study this Dao in the world cannot comprehend it—why do they not reflect? How extreme! Taking this song to verify my own attainment, if it remains unclear, then my own attainment is not yet perfected. Why be misled by heterodox schools and improper methods?

Today’s scholars, unaware of the expedient method of exhaling the old and inhaling the new, indulge in fantasies of soaring clouds and racing mists, self-aggrandizing and self-important, setting examples for others. Unaware of their own faults, they mislead others into drowning in delusion, some beyond salvation for life, dying without achievement—such deceitful cruelty is truly unbearable.

**Commentary:**
Wu Mingzi took the *Cantong qi*’s *Song of the Cauldron* as the marrow of elixir classics, yet many overlook it, unable to fathom its depths—how then can they grasp the great Dao of the *Wuzhen*’s golden elixir? From what I have encountered in perfected beings, I have attained the essence of these two books: the five phases, four images, cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver—using true yin and true yang to lure the primordial undifferentiated *qi*, without resorting to heterodox methods or postnatal, material things. Their transformative patterns and images all align with the fire tally’s seasonal and temporal cycles. The inner and outer elixirs’ successful effects differ. Through three lifetimes of karmic affinity, I have heard the great Dao, daring to defy heavenly censure by revealing its mechanism in writing. Having annotated the *Wuzhen pian*, I now provide notes for the *Cantong qi*. The orthodox lineage of immortal learning, dispelling confusion for later students—one to clarify the causes of the immortal Dao, one to refute the errors of heterodox schools. May those who study immortality, through my words, avoid delusion, recognize the trustworthiness of immortal texts, not stray into heterodox paths, not err in self-cultivation, nor teach others mistakenly.

If you encounter a true teacher whose words align with mine and with the Dao of the *Cantong qi* and *Wuzhen pian*, begin practice swiftly to together accomplish the great Dao. I do not dare seek novelty to impress the vulgar, but only to clarify the orthodox lineage of the immortal Dao.

The Perfected One, reading the *Cantong qi*, said: "Do not cling to images or adhere to words"—this is spoken for those who have already received transmission from a true teacher. Images are set up as metaphors, words are used to convey meaning, so both are like fishing baskets and rabbit snares—not to be rigidly grasped. If, having met a true teacher but not yet received true transmission, one strays into heterodox paths, self-assured yet ignorant of the great Dao, how can one arbitrarily conclude that the Perfected One’s words about not clinging to images are an excuse to avoid rigid adherence, without seeking profound comprehension and integration? One would spend a lifetime without ever hearing the great Dao.

Chen Niujiu said:
*If you have not yet met a teacher, study the poems—*
*The poems conceal the secrets for proper cultivation.*
He also said:
*If words do not align, they are not of the same lineage—*
*Examine each character thoroughly, linking front and back.*
All that I have learned aligns without exception. I dare not cite heterodox or improper methods as evidence. With prolonged sincerity, the numinous will naturally come to inform you, and the mind’s spirit will spontaneously attain enlightenment.

Wei Boyang said: *"After ten thousand repetitions, one may stake all on the outcome."* The Perfected One also said: *"To seek meaning through texts—what need is there for a servant? In my humble way, I transmit this orally."* Those who devote themselves long to the study of immortal scriptures gain ever more from them. Thus, let us mutually encourage one another.

When virtue and conduct surpass eight hundred, and hidden merits accumulate to three thousand; when self and others, kin and foe are equalized—only then does one fulfill the original vow of the divine immortals. Tigers and rhinoceroses, blades and weapons cannot harm them; the impermanent burning house of existence cannot bind them. Once the treasure talisman descends, they ascend to the heavens, steadily riding the jade carriage and phoenix palanquin.

**Annotation:** After embracing the One for nine years, merit is perfected and the Dao complete—self and other both forgotten, how could blades or tigers and rhinoceroses bring harm? When the celestial treasure talisman descends, the body soars to the azure vault, the day the true great man emerges into the world. This speaks of the Golden Elixir of Returned Cinnabar, which also depends entirely on virtue, conduct, and hidden merits—once the hundred and three thousand are fulfilled, one is safeguarded from demonic obstacles. Following the method to completion, one ascends in a sudden leap, mounting the jade carriage and phoenix palanquin to become a perfected immortal and guest of the Supreme Emperor.

**A warning to the world:**
The flowers of the four seasons bloom in the Fourfold Illumination Pavilion,
The wind carries their fragrance, rich and sweet.
I urge you to gather them in their proper season—
Do not let the tender crimson scatter and fade.

Lu Ziye said: *"The flowers of the four seasons bloom—when is the medicine not present? The Fourfold Illumination Pavilion symbolizes the flowers finding their rightful place; one should cherish them. If the moment passes unseized, the flowers wither and fade, and the beauty of tender crimson is seen no more."*

The many hues of flowers—yet why single out "tender crimson" as the metaphor? Truly, there is profound significance here. Thus, the alchemical classics say: *"The matter of subduing the Yang Elixir is entirely distinct—one must seek the crimson blood within the Kan trigram."* The word "tender" is no mere accident.

Master Kangjie has a poem:
*"Fine wine should be drunk when slightly tipsy,
Lovely flowers best admired when half-open."*
Its meaning is the same.

**Reading the "Zhouyi Cantong Qi"**

The wondrous workings of the Great Elixir rely on Qian and Kun;
When Qian and Kun move, the Five Phases divide.
The Five Phases divide—thus the constant Dao has birth and death;
The Five Phases reverse—thus the Elixir’s body remains ever numinous, ever abiding.

From the first stirrings of form in the Void,
The Two Modes emerge, rooted in the One.
The Four Images do not depart from the Two Bodies,
The Eight Trigrams mutually beget and descend as ancestors and grandchildren.

All things arise through change and movement,
Fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse—here they diverge.
The common folk use this daily yet remain unaware;
The sage alone fathoms the root and source.

Thus, the marvelous Dao of the *Yi* exhausts the principles of Qian and Kun,
And so it lodges its images within this text.
When Pi and Tai intersect, Yin and Yang ascend or descend;
When Zhun and Meng arise, movement and stillness occur at dawn or dusk.

Kan and Li are male and female, water and fire;
Zhen and Dui are dragon and tiger, hun and po.
Abiding in the center brings the yellow skirts’ supreme fortune;
Encountering Kang leads to positionless ignominy.

Having not yet discerned the beginning and end of the myriad things,
One must still illuminate the convergence and flight of the Two Qi.
The moon’s waxing and waning correspond to the spirit’s ebb and flow;
The sun’s rising and setting align with the constructive and defensive qi’s cold and warmth.

Words are established to clarify images,
Yet once images are grasped, words are forgotten.
Just as images are set forth to point to meaning,
Once true meaning is realized, images are cast aside.

The enlightened find it ever simple, ever easy;
The deluded grow ever more confused, ever more entangled.
Thus, those who cultivate the Real and read the *Cantong Qi*
Must not cling to images or fixate on words.

**Annotation:**
Qian and Kun are father and mother.
When Qian and Kun move the Yin and Yang qi,
They transform the Five Phases and give birth to the myriad things.
Thus, when humans are molded by the Yin-Yang and Five Phases, they become human.

The human body is half Yin, half Yang,
For Yin and Yang possess form.
Being half Yin and half Yang,
They are thus subject to birth and death.

Yang governs life, Yin governs death—
One life, one death; one departure, one return.
This is the natural sequence of the constant Dao,
The inherent principle of nature.

The sage follows this,
Reversing Yin and Yang, inverting the workings of creation.
Establishing Qian and Kun as the crucible,
They steal the primordial qi to forge the Elixir,
Refining form into formlessness,
Merging with the Dao in darkness.

The Dao arises from the Limitless—
How could immortality have an end?
Thus it is said:
Following the constant Dao brings birth and death;
Reversing the Elixir’s body brings everlasting numinosity and abiding presence.

The Void is the Dao’s essence.
The Dao generates the One qi, which divides into Yin and Yang—
Thus, Yang Heaven and Yin Earth are the Two Modes.
Heaven One generates Water, dwelling in the North as Winter;
Earth Two generates Fire, dwelling in the South as Summer;
Heaven Three generates Wood, dwelling in the East as Spring;
Earth Four generates Metal, dwelling in the West as Autumn—
Thus forming the Four Seasons, called the Four Images.

Heaven as Qian dwells in Xu and Hai;
Earth as Kun dwells in Wei and Shen.
Kun seeks from Qian and bears three sons:
The eldest, Zhen, dwells in Mao;
The middle, Kan, dwells in Zi;
The youngest, Gen, dwells in Yin and Chou.

Qian seeks from Kun and bears three daughters:
The eldest, Xun, dwells in Chen and Si;
The middle, Li, dwells in Wu;
The youngest, Dui, dwells in You.
Together they form the Eight Trigrams, called the Eight Directions.

Thus, from Zi to Si lies the Yang realm;
From Wu to Hai lies the Yin realm.
As Yin and Yang revolve,
The qi of the Four Seasons cycle through the Eight Directions,
Endlessly succeeding one another—
Hence they are said to mutually beget and descend as ancestors and grandchildren.

In Spring and Summer, the Yang qi engenders and nurtures the myriad things as virtue;
When the myriad things receive it, they flourish.
In Autumn and Winter, the Yin qi withers and slays the myriad things as punishment;
When the myriad things receive it, they wither.
One flourishing, one withering;
One fortune, one misfortune—
Thus all things arise through change and movement,
And fortune, misfortune, regret, and remorse here diverge.

Tracing the origins of fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse,
The ten thousand images and Eight Trigrams,
Even the Yin-Yang of the Four Seasons—
None depart from the One qi,
Nor stray from the Great Dao.

Thus, the Dao is the One qi;
Yin-Yang, the Four Seasons, the Five Phases, the Eight Trigrams, the ten thousand images,
Fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse—
None are beyond it.
None are beyond it—
Thus, in seeing and hearing, speech and action,
Sleep and taste, movement and stillness,
Encountering cold or clamor,
Or the strange and uncanny—
The vermin’s liver, the rat’s arm,
Ladders and straw, tiles and pebbles—
There is nowhere the Dao is not.

Nowhere the Dao is not—
Yet the Dao resides within humans, and they remain unaware;
Humans dwell within the Dao, yet the Dao is never diminished.
Thus, the common folk use it daily yet do not know it.

From the Void to daily use and unawareness—
This speaks of the Dao.
The sage delves into the obscure, exhausts principle, fulfills nature, and attains destiny.
Thus, they composed the *Yi* to embody the Dao’s wondrous workings,
Establishing Qian and Kun as the *Yi*’s gateways.

Once Qian and Kun are established,
The Dao of the *Yi* operates within them.
Thus, Qian and Kun seek from each other to form the Eight Trigrams;
The Eight Trigrams interact to produce the sixty-four hexagrams through eightfold change.

The six yang lines are odd;
The six yin lines are even.
Thus, one yang line, multiplied by four and nine, yields thirty-six counting rods;
Six yang lines together yield two hundred sixteen rods—
This is the line-count of the Qian hexagram.

One yin line, multiplied by four and six, yields twenty-four counting rods;
Six yin lines together yield one hundred forty-four rods—
This is the line-count of the Kun hexagram.

Adding the thirty-two numbers of the Qian and Kun hexagrams,
Three hundred sixty rods combine to form the eleven thousand five hundred twenty rods—
This is the Great Expansion number of the Supreme Ultimate,
Encompassing the Three Powers and embracing the ten thousand images.

Thus, the mechanisms of fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse,
The omens of life and death, blessing and calamity—
None escape beyond this number.
Thus, it is said: The wondrous Dao of the *Yi* exhausts the essence and function of creation.

From the sage’s rectification of creation’s essence and function,
Wei Boyang, the Perfected One, discerned that the Dao of the *Yi* accords with the Golden Elixir.
Thus, he borrowed the *Yi*’s trigrams to compose the *Cantong Qi*,
Illuminating the Great Elixir’s purport—
Nothing more than borrowed images and veiled words.
This speaks of the *Cantong Qi*.

The essentials of elixir refinement lie solely in the two words: metal and fire.
The sage first takes the two substances, true yin and true yang, as the crucible and furnace,
Then entices the qi of the Supreme Ultimate to become the elixir.
The qi of the Supreme Ultimate resides within emptiness and nothingness, beyond seeking or fathoming.
If not lured by true yin and true yang, it cannot descend in numinous manifestation.
Thus, the *Cantong Qi* establishes the two trigrams Qian and Kun as crucible and furnace,
Divides the two trigrams Kan and Li as lead and mercury.
The four trigrams occupy the Central Palace, while the remaining trigrams are distributed throughout the lunar month to move the fire in accord with the symbols.
Thus, Qian and Kun are dragon and tiger, Zhen and Dui,
Husband and wife, hun and po.
Kan and Li are lead and mercury, water and fire,
Male and female, emotion and nature.
Extending this pattern indefinitely, the permutations are inexhaustible.
Yet, to speak most precisely, nothing surpasses the metaphor of the two substances: true yin and true yang.
By uniting these two with qi in the Yellow Court of the Central Palace, the elixir is formed—
Hence it is said: "Abiding in the center, the yellow robe is supremely auspicious," referring to the outer medicine.
Once the elixir is ingested, without true fire, the sacred embryo cannot be nurtured.
The primordial yang true qi is employed as fire,
Fire has no fixed position but circulates through the Six Voids—
Thus, when at its zenith, it has no fixed place yet is revered, speaking of the inner medicine.
Now, Heaven’s One generates water, which in man is called essence.
Earth’s Two generates fire, which in man is called spirit.

The human spirit and essence night and day nourish and protect the body,
Ever circulating in harmony with the yin and yang qi of Heaven and Earth without cease.
Thus, on the winter solstice, within the earth a single yang qi ascends to form the *Fu* hexagram.
Man’s primordial qi follows the same pattern—hence the advancement of yang fire.
By the first month, yin and yang qi are evenly balanced,
Naturally uniting to form the *Tai* hexagram.
Man’s primordial qi does likewise—thus the cessation of fire is called "bathing."
On the summer solstice, within Heaven a single yin qi descends to form the *Gou* hexagram,
Hence the advancement of yin tally.
By the seventh month, yin and yang qi are evenly balanced,
Naturally uniting to form the *Pi* hexagram.
Man’s primordial qi does likewise—thus the pause and waiting are also called "bathing."
Therefore it is said: when *Pi* and *Tai* alternate, yin and yang either ascend or descend.

The sage transposes this yearly cycle of qi into the span of a single month of thirty days,
Using two and a half days and thirty celestial stems to correspond to one month’s thirty days.
From the new moon onward, the first glimmer of lunar light appears as the *Fu* hexagram.
By the waxing half-moon, metal and water are evenly divided as the *Tai* hexagram.
By the sixteenth day, the moon begins to wane as the *Gou* hexagram.
By the last quarter, the moon is half-diminished, metal and water evenly divided as the *Pi* hexagram.
Thus the waxing and waning of the moon correspond to the flourishing and decline of spirit and essence—this speaks of the moon.

Again, the sage transposes this monthly cycle into the twelve hours of a single day.
At the *zi* hour, a single yang is born.
Thus within man’s kidneys, a pure yang essence qi ascends to form the *Fu* hexagram, advancing yang fire.
At the *wu* hour, a single yin is born.
Thus within man’s heart, a supreme yin spirit qi descends to form the *Shen* hexagram, advancing yin tally.
Therefore the *Fu* and *Gou* hexagrams reveal the convergence and flight of the two qi.

The sun’s rising marks day, its setting marks night.
The sage moves tally and fire within the span of a single day and night,
Dividing and harmonizing the qi of warmth, coolness, cold, and heat,
Externally aligning with Heaven’s tally, internally matching the ebb and flow of nourishment and defense throughout the body.
Drawing and adding, circulating and employing, warming and nurturing the sacred embryo—
Thus the sun’s rising and setting correspond to the cold and warmth of nourishment and defense—this speaks of the sun.

*Zi* is the chief of the six yang, hence at dawn yang fire is advanced, with the *Zhun* hexagram governing the affair.
*Wu* is the origin of the six yin, hence at dusk yin tally is advanced, with the *Meng* hexagram governing the affair.
Thus when *Zhun* and *Meng* act, movement and stillness occur at dawn and dusk.
In one day and night, two hexagrams govern the affair.
*Zhun* and *Meng* are the beginning of the sixty hexagrams, *Ji Ji* is their end.
Ending and beginning anew, beginning and ending again—
Thus it is said: "*Ji Ji* cautiously governs the end and beginning of the myriad things"—this speaks of time.

All the above is Master Wei’s elucidation of the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir as most simple and most easy.
There is no esoteric secret to expound, so he borrows the imagery of the *Yijing* to convey his meaning through allegory,
That practitioners may observe these images and grasp their essential purport.
If one attains the wondrous mystery of the Golden Elixir,
Then Qian and Kun, Kan and Li, dragon and tiger, hun and po, lead and mercury, water and fire—all may be spoken of loosely, for there is no external imagery to rely upon.
If one grasps the true mechanism of circulating fire,
Then *Zhun* and *Meng*, *Ji Ji*, *Fu* and *Shen*, *Pi* and *Tai*, hexagrams and lines—all may be discarded, for this speaks of the internal imagery.

This immortal feared that practitioners reading the *Cantong Qi* might fail to comprehend Master Wei’s profound intent,
Clinging only to images and fixating on words, unaware of how to discard imagery and speak freely.
Thus he composed this piece to enlighten those of like mind—such was his benevolence.

A song by the Qingcheng scholar says:
"Gratitude to the ancient sages, the secret formulas are true.
Where the net and fish-trap serve their purpose, all else vanishes.
A few lines suffice to reveal its utmost simplicity—
Without a true master, one cannot easily fathom even a fraction of its profound depths."

The commentary states:
From the daily use of Emptiness and Nothingness—this speaks of the Dao.
From the sage’s creation and transformation of embodied forms—this speaks of the *Yijing*.
From Wei Boyang’s use of allegory—this speaks of the *Cantong Qi*.
From the essential auspiciousness of cultivating the elixir—this speaks of the outer medicine.
From the ingestion of the elixir without fixed position yet revered—this speaks of the inner medicine.
From Heaven’s One generating water, or ascending and descending—this speaks of the year.
From the sage transposing this yearly cycle of flourishing and decline—this speaks of the month.
From further transposing this cold and warmth—this speaks of the day.
From *zi* as the beginning and end of the six yang—this speaks of time.
From the wondrous mystery of the Golden Elixir onward—this speaks of borrowed imagery.
From the true mechanism of circulating fire onward—this speaks of the internal borrowed imagery.

The thirty-two counting rods of Qian and Kun total nearly three hundred and sixty.
Multiplying thirty-two by two hundred and sixteen yields six thousand nine hundred and twelve—this is the count of the thirty-two yang hexagrams.
Multiplying thirty-two by one hundred and forty-four yields four thousand six hundred and eight—this is the count of the thirty-two yin hexagrams.
Combining the counts of both yields eleven thousand five hundred and twenty.

Now, taking the first and seventh months as *Pi* and *Tai* corresponds to bathing.
Yet when *Pi* and *Tai* first intersect, the myriad things flourish—thus some also take the *Pi* and *Tai* hexagrams to correspond to the spring and autumn equinoxes for bathing, though the months differ.
The purport of the *Wuzhen* has its own wondrous application.
Thus the immortal elder in the *Four Hundred Characters* says:
"When it is time for bathing, *mao* and *you* are also empty comparisons."
Shi Xinglin says: "Bathing does not occur at *mao* and *you*."
Thus some name only the *Pi* and *Tai* hexagrams, where yin and yang are evenly balanced.
Others take the second and eighth months of spring and autumn, or the first and seventh months, or the waxing and waning half-moons—
Without grasping the essential purport, one becomes confused.

**Song for Daoist Liu of White Dragon Cave**
Jade flows, gold flies—both luminaries hasten,
First hearing blossoms bloom, then autumn frost.

Vainly boast of wealth and life spanning a thousand years—
Yet it flickers like lightning in the clouds.
A flash of lightning—how swift it is!
A hundred years amount to but thirty thousand days.
Within them, cold and heat torment and scorch,
Unseen, the youthful face fades away.
Though children and grandchildren stand before your eyes,
Affection and attachment only bind you tighter.
When essence is exhausted and the body withers to dust,
Who can grant you even a moment’s stay?
A moment’s stay—yet no means exists,
Inevitably the body returns to flowing waters.
Look upon the sages and worthies of old:
How many have mastered remaining in this world?

Kongxuanzi says: The sun and moon are like a shuttle, time like an arrow.
Life rarely reaches seventy.
Cold and heat press upon man, children and grandchildren tug at the heart—
Until old age and death, generation after generation, all the same.
Who turns back to resolutely seek the Dao?
To preserve form in this world?

A deep sigh for the difficulty of human life, the rarity of encountering the supreme Dao.
Though the body is in the world, there is a method—
Only because men of this age lack measure.
They race into the mountains to seek herbs and plants,
Subdue lead and refine mercury to congeal cinnabar.
Worldly men, seeking the Dao, know not the true path.
Fiercely fond of external furnaces, they hunt rare herbs and plants,
Smelt lead and mercury, hoping to transmute cinnabar,
To exchange bones and become treasure.
The immortal elder has a poem:
*"Cease refining the Three Yellows and Four Spirits;
If you seek among the grasses, it is not the true Way."*
This warns men not to fix their hearts on external furnaces as treasure.
When the elixir ripens, gold will naturally fill the house—
Why waste fire and squander wealth?

Transmuting cinnabar is a matter apart:
One must seek crimson blood within *Kan*.
Seize it and restrain the yin essence in *Li*,
Blend and harmonize them in due season.
When the season is right, employ the matchmaker:
The Metal Duke and the Old Woman wed in kinship.
The Metal Duke delights in riding the White Tiger,
The Old Woman ever mounts the Crimson Dragon.
The Tiger comes to stillness within autumn mountains,
The Dragon stirs its body in the depths of the pool.
The two beasts meet and battle fiercely,
Waves surging and churning like a boiling cauldron.
The Yellow Dame and Elder Ding lend their might,
Shaking heaven and earth, startling gods and ghosts.
They subdue lead and mercury with fire,
Transmute crimson blood, exchange bones to form—
Yet all for the sake of coveting wealth,
Wasting resources in vain,
Ignoring the cultivation of virtue,
Only increasing sin—
What benefit for the great matter of life and death?

Transmuting the Golden Elixir, transforming bones into a pure yang immortal,
Is a matter entirely distinct.
Seeking crimson blood within *Kan*:
From the White Tiger, seek the qi of the waxing and waning crescents—
Extracting the essence of black lead.
Restraining yin essence in *Li*:
From the Green Dragon, seek the qi of the waxing and waning crescents—
Extracting the marrow of red lead.
Within black *Kan*, seek the crimson;
Within yang *Li*, restrain the yin.
When the two substances unite in congress,
Their gathering has its day, their taking its season.
When the season is right, employ the Yellow Dame as matchmaker,
Naturally the Metal Duke rides the Tiger, the Old Woman the Dragon,
Paired as husband and wife, their passions entwined,
The two substances merge in union.
The Yellow Dame acts as go-between, the Metal Duke lends his might.
Seizing heaven and earth, shaking them;
Commanding gods and ghosts, setting them in motion.
An ancient song says:
*"Subtly inverting the essence of heaven and earth,
Gathering yin and yang, startling gods and ghosts."*
This is not what the world calls gold, stone, herbs, or plants.
The above speaks of the external medicine.

In an instant, the battle ends, clouds and rain disperse,
A mysterious pearl is planted in the muddy depths.
From this, the root and sprout gradually grow,
Nurtured in season with true essence.
After ten months, the embryo is shed—swallowed into the mouth,
Unnoticed, the mortal body already possesses spirit.
When the two battles conclude,
The Golden Elixir is obtained and swallowed into the five viscera.
Planting this mysterious pearl in the earthen crucible’s depths,
Following the fire talismans in advance and retreat,
Refining with true fire,
From this, the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir’s root and sprout grow day by day.
Nurtured in season, it flourishes.
By the tenth month, the sacred embryo is complete,
Refining form into qi, naturally possessing manifold spiritual energies.
Refining qi into spirit, naturally uniting with the Dao.
The above speaks of the internal medicine.

This matter is rare in the world,
Not something ordinary men may know.
If in past lives you lacked the bone of immortality,
How could you easily encounter it?
Having encountered it, you should refine it at once—
For the light of time flies swift as an arrow.
When you wish to catch the fish, you must cast the net;
Do not merely stand by the river, sighing in vain.
I hear you have known the medicine for many years—
Why not collect your mind and refine mercury and lead?
Lest the candle be blown out by the wind,
And the six paths of rebirth leave you no cause to blame heaven.

The great Dao of the Golden Elixir is seldom transmitted in the world.
Planted with the bone of immortality, meeting a true teacher,
To begin cultivation swiftly—even this is already too late.
The years wait for no man; do not die in vain.
Since you know the medicine, refine lead and mercury at once—
Not the substantial things of this world,
Nor the lead and mercury subdued and transmuted to congeal cinnabar.
This urges men to cultivate early.

Of late, men in the world are full of deceit,
All donning Daoist robes to call themselves practitioners.
Ask them what Metal and Wood are—
They fall silent, mute as if afflicted.
Yet they speak of "subduing qi" and "fasting,"
Claiming other schools and paths are long.
Have you not seen the *Song of Breaking Delusion*?
The method of Taiyi Complete Truth is most excellent.
Do not fault my words for their bluntness—
Only because men of this age are hard to discern.
Only when your heart aligns with mine
Dare I pour out my thoughts to you.

Vulgar men take cultivation of the Dao as their duty,
Yet know not what Metal and Wood are,
Idly practicing qi-subduing, fasting, and minor arts—
How would they know the *Song of Breaking Delusion* says:
*"How then is it the Dao?
Taiyi contains true qi.
The Five Phases do not follow their course,
The Tiger is born in water.
Kan and Li are inverted to guard,
The Dragon emerges from fire."*
Is this not what it means?
The above deeply warns men of the world.

Some may interpret this song as swallowing the embryo in the tenth month, speaking of the divine transformations of the sacred embryo’s exit and entry—this is correct. Others claim that swallowing a single spirit-elixir into the abdomen, as the *Cantong Qi* says, *"Golden sand enters the five viscera,"* leads later generations to mistake this for external alchemy. Such an interpretation is misguided, for they have not received the true transmission of the *Wuzhen Pian*. Misunderstanding its essential meaning, they assert that true lead is the primordial qi born in the kidneys, while divine mercury is the true nature emerging from the heart. The qi within qi conceals true water, and the true within nature harbors true fire. Why not delve deeply into the *Wuzhen Pian*’s admonition: *"Scholars today take lead and mercury as the two qi, dividing heart and kidneys into Kan and Li. All these are like the sun and moon losing their path, lead and mercury placed in separate furnaces—how can they hope to congeal the returning elixir? Such is the mockery of the* Wuzhen Pian." *Yet now they take this as its essential teaching. From this, it is clear they have not grasped the true transmission of the* Wuzhen Pian. *If you encounter a true master, you will know my words are not false. I do not dare to condemn them but seek to clarify the Dao.*

**Song of the Stone Bridge**
My home lies north of the Stone Bridge,
Where mountains lock and gates stand tall, ancient trees dense.
Beneath the bridge, the ravine’s waters flow to Kunlun,
Below the mountain, the spring’s fragrance is rich and lush.
My dwelling within these mountains is truly boastworthy,
Narrow land evenly planted with unfading flowers.
North of the mountain, a cave hides a tiger,
Emerging to roar, stirring winds and rosy clouds.
South of the mountain, a pool conceals a dragon,
Rising in clouds, descending rain, veiling the peaks in mist.
The two beasts hidden, locked in battle—
The dark pearl concealed is the true omen.
The scene is enviable, I secretly rejoice,
Pouring my own wine, drunk and merry.
Drunk, I pluck a stringless zither,
Its notes teaching attentiveness.
Silent in drunkenness, none know,
Dazed and mute, as if foolish.
Gazing up, I see the marvel of Creation’s work:
The sun returns west, the moon rises east.
Heaven is earth, earth is heaven,
Inverted yin and yang harmonize with nature.
Recognize where the Five Phases reverse,
And soon you’ll ascend in rosy clouds to the grotto-heaven.
A golden house, jade eaves,
Jade maidens and golden lads attend daily.
The Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper clearly arrayed,
Myriad phenomena manifest boundlessly.
No day or night, only ceaseless continuity,
Gathering and dispersing, refining the fire’s timing.
If you ask where the golden elixir’s auspicious truth lies,
Seek a master to point out the lead within water.
Wood engenders fire, metal engenders water,
Water and fire must distinguish their order.
Discern floating and sinking, know host and guest,
Then lead, silver, cinnabar, and mercury will meet.
There is hardness and softness—do not grow complacent,
Know contentment, ever content, return to your root.
All spirits harmonize in an age of great peace,
Swiftly the nation prospers, the people rejoice.
This matter is worth pondering,
Only those of the same path understand its meaning.
Later generations who study cultivation
Speak only of preserving and nurturing qi.
Before their eyes, it seems easy,
Yet those who attain it are peerlessly wondrous.
First, it banishes illness and extends years,
Refining with fire, transforming the yang body.
Students of the Dao, set aside your own thoughts,
Do not ask of minor arts and peripheral methods.
They only know how to startle others,
Unaware of their own hidden withering.
I urge later learners: be resolute,
Do not abandon your home to wander distant lands.
The wondrous Dao is not apart from your own body—
How could it lie in a thousand mountains or ten thousand streams?
Do not procrastinate, nor indulge in baseness,
Hasten to seek a master and grasp the dark pointer.
If in this life you do not study cultivation,
Who knows what womb you’ll inhabit in the next?
If you have the heart, persist to the end—
Life and death are humanity’s greatest matters.
If Heaven betrays those with Daoist hearts,
I would be consigned to the three lower realms as a ghost.

**Kongxuanzi says:** This song is a comprehensive praise of the golden elixir’s wonders, refuting the errors of peripheral paths. Its mention of dragon and tiger, lead and silver, cinnabar and mercury, floating and sinking, host and guest—these are the truths of yin and yang’s two substances. Its references to the sun setting west, the moon rising east, heaven as earth, earth as heaven—these illustrate the union of yin and yang, the inversion of the Five Phases. Water’s lead, wood engendering fire, metal engendering water—these illustrate what yin and yang produce. The dark pearl symbolizes the golden elixir’s formation. Day and night’s refinement clarify the ten months of practice. Preserving and nurturing qi refutes minor peripheral arts. Its praise of the golden elixir’s power and exhortations to cultivate the Dao are evident in the words—no need for redundant explanation.

**Quatrain**
Do not apply cunning deception as effort,
Recognize the other household’s deathless method.
In the flask, swiftly add the wine of life,
In the crucible, gather the returning soul’s nectar.

**Annotation:** Many who cultivate the true often cling to dissimilar, deceptive methods in their practice, unwilling to inquire into the other household’s innate, deathless method—able to extract the returning yang elixir from the crucible and swiftly replenish the mercury-fire within the abdomen. These two substances are the supreme treasures of true self-cultivation. The *Cantong Qi* says, *"Like kinds easily apply effort; unlike kinds are difficult to craft."* This is the proof. The so-called "other household" refers to the white tiger’s bowstring qi. Later learners often mistake their own bodily essence and qi for true lead. If this were so, would the immortals have deceived others with talk of "another household"?

**Commentary:** The previous poem says, *"Plant the seeds in your own garden."* Wumingzi explains: *"Unwilling to inquire into the other household’s innate deathless method."* The earlier poem speaks for myself, hence "one’s own." This poem instructs others, hence "another household." Their likeness is one and the same. This "likeness" does not mean humans are alike but refers to the primordial qi’s undivided unity.

To replenish primordial qi with primordial qi is to use boundless qi to restore finite qi—thus is the ease of attaining immortality. The *Cantong Qi* states: *"Primordial essence flows and spreads, borne by qi at the outset."* This is the likeness of kind. If one were to replenish a person with another person, the human body would remain entirely yin. To replenish yin with yin is like a hen laying eggs on her own—her form incomplete, how could she achieve the marvel of yin-yang union? How could she coagulate the primordial qi into the elixir? How could she transform a body of pure yang into an immortal of pure yang?

Strike the bamboo to summon the tortoise and swallow the jade mushroom;
Pluck the zither to beckon the phoenix and drink the knife-point.
Of late, golden light suffuses the body—
This rule is not spoken of to ordinary folk.

**Annotation:** This describes the work of firing the elixir. Bamboo is a hollow-hearted, emotionless thing. "Striking" signifies the meeting of two substances. "Plucking the zither" signifies the harmony of husband and wife. The tortoise is lead; the phoenix is mercury. The *knife-point* is the vessel of the yin tally. The *jade mushroom* is the qi of yang fire. The dragon’s bowstring qi is called the jade mushroom; the tiger’s bowstring qi is called the knife-point. This speaks of dragon and tiger striking each other to form a union like the harmony of zither notes. The phoenix is the Vermilion Bird of the south; the tortoise is the Dark Warrior of the north. They are also the images of Kan and Li, north and south, refined and conjoined to form the golden elixir. At that moment, it is gathered and ingested into the earthen cauldron of the cinnabar field, to subdue one’s own yin mercury. Then, with an empty heart and harmonious marital sentiment, yin and yang are joined to circulate the tally fire. The tally fire follows the hexagrams and lines, aligning with breath. Breath employs spirit and qi; spirit and qi command water and fire; water and fire refine the fetal breath. As the fetal breath roams and chants, Kan and Li interact within the central palace’s earthen cauldron, nourishing lead and mercury. Day and night, lead and mercury drink the qi of the tally fire, generating the substance of golden liquid—this is the golden liquid returning elixir.

**Jin’s Note:** The *Yizhen Lun* states: *"When firing the elixir, one may feel something at the tailgate, surging straight through the double passes of the spine, ascending with a distinct sound to the muddy pellet. Then, from the muddy pellet, it descends in droplets into the mouth, like sparrow’s eggs, tasting like frozen cream, sweet and fragrant beyond compare. When this occurs, it is the golden liquid returning elixir. Slowly swallow it into the cinnabar field, and if this continues unceasingly, the five viscera become clear and empty. Closing the eyes to inwardly observe the organs, they appear as if illuminated by a candle. Gradually, myriad golden rays burst forth, dazzling and suffusing the body like a wheel of fire or swirling clouds, coiling around the entire form. Step by step, sacred signs manifest in succession, verifying the transcendence into sagehood. This is no metaphor—it is the true vision. The immortal elder silently marveled at this wonder, daring not speak of it to others, for it is not a matter seen or heard in the mortal world."*

**On the Inner and Outer Two Medicines:**
Chen Shangyangzi said: *"Bamboo is a thing hollow within and straight without. If it is not straight, strike it to make it respond to things. The zither embodies the harmony of subtle strings. If it is not harmonious, tune it to accomplish the task at hand. The jade mushroom is the Qian dragon; the knife-point is a Kun thing. Summoning the tortoise pertains to oneself; beckoning the phoenix requires the other. Without great harmony, how could the other beckon my phoenix? For those who cultivate the Dao, once the hexagram qi has passed, if the bamboo does not respond to things, can it not be struck? Striking is the same as knocking. If the zither is not harmonious, can it not be tuned? Tuning is the same as plucking. Thus, whether seventy, eighty, or one hundred twenty years old, one may still refine the returning elixir—such is this Dao. How could it be spoken of to mediocre scholars or common folk? To teach fools is to invite delusion—how could they ever comprehend this?"*

Only true immortal sages and divine masters, sworn before Heaven and transmitting the teachings orally—who else could know these mysteries?

Formerly, my master Ziqiong transmitted them to the Great Mystery Perfected. Once, a debater came to visit and said: *"Striking bamboo, summoning lightning, swallowing jade mushrooms—dare I ask, Master, what is ‘blowing the tortoise’?"*

The Supreme Void replied: *"Summoning the tortoise, I shall teach you—first tell me, what is ‘striking the bamboo’?"*

The debater said: *"The highest of the highest pivot-points."*

The Supreme Void said: *"I do not ask about the highest pivot-points—tell me, what is ‘striking the bamboo’?"*

The debater said: *"The profound, secret mechanism."*

The Supreme Void said: *"These words of yours are learned from long, idle chatter on a shared bed. Take them and debate the world with them—this place is not where you blow the tortoise."* The man did not awaken.

Later, Ziqiong explained it and was asked: *"Do you know ‘striking the bamboo’?"*

He replied: *"Still and unmoving, yet responding and thus penetrating."*

*"Do you know ‘blowing the tortoise’?"*

He replied: *"Offering deference to others, for there is something sought."*

*"Why did the debater earlier not awaken?"*

Ziqiong said: *"He had not yet returned to the source; though he guessed, he could not grasp it."* The Supreme Void further admonished:

*"To know is not difficult—only to practice is difficult.
Though you awaken to the true suchness of your nature,
You cannot escape casting off this body only to re-enter another.
If you understand and can refine the great elixir,
You will swiftly transcend the leakless and become a true person."*

**Annotation:** When one suddenly awakens to the true mind, one directly transcends into the true emptiness and pure stillness of the Tathāgata’s nature-ocean. Yet ultimately, there remains this body of this life and the next, exiting one form only to enter another. How much better to cultivate the golden elixir as well, refining form into the formless, transforming into the unfathomable, and attaining the responsiveness of a thousand hands and a thousand eyes! Thus, in the Dao of form and spirit, nature and life, one accomplishes that which is utterly transcendent and leakless, possessing the true golden countenance of compassion—majestic and towering, becoming the teacher of heaven and humans, and realizing the supreme, most true.

Before the great function manifests and the great Dharma is fully illuminated, even the slightest leakage means casting off this body only to re-enter another. If one achieves perfect clarity, treasures the refined golden elixir, and completes the ten ultimate stages of the Dao, one is called a *true person*.

Later deluded ones take minor arts like massage, breath regulation, and peripheral methods, aligning the self with Heaven, and call it the golden elixir. The golden elixir arises naturally; peripheral arts arise from contrivance. The golden elixir takes the moon as its root, emerging from the direction of *geng* metal and converging with the origin of *kan* water. Metal and water unite, forming the work of creation—hence it is called the golden elixir.

**On Nature and Life:** Cultivating both nature and life is called the Dao of the single yang within the one yin and one yang. If one awakens to nature but cannot complete life, one falls into the illness of partial yin or partial yang, suffering the affliction of casting off this body only to re-enter another.

Fortune and misfortune arise mutually, interdependent,
Like echoes and shadows following one another.
If you can reverse this mechanism of life and death,
In the space of a hand’s turn, disaster transforms into blessing.

**Annotation:** Yang governs life and fortune; yin governs death and misfortune. When yin wanes, yang waxes; when yang reaches its peak, yin arises. They mutually depend and conceal one another, like echoes and shadows following—this is the natural principle of the constant Dao. If one can reverse this mechanism of life and death and cultivate accordingly, then in the space of a hand’s turn, one transforms disaster into blessing, harm into grace, and even enables childbirth—this is no longer mere verification.

**Citing the *Yin Fu Jing* to clarify the Dao.**

When the mind-monkey is thoroughly tamed and the square-inch mechanism stilled,
Three thousand merits and deeds align with Heaven.
Naturally, there is a tripod to simmer dragon and tiger—
Yet how can one bear the burden of family, clinging to wife and children?

**Annotation:** This poem warns those of the present age who do not know how to return. The *square-inch mechanism* refers to the fact that before refining the returning elixir, the cultivator of truth must have a mind-ground that is thoroughly clear, not swayed by the mind-monkey or the intent-horse. An ancient song says:

*"Human life is originally a monkey,
A myriad tendencies all arise from outward wandering.
If you can restrain and gather them in,
The six essences congeal into a night-shining pearl."*

Master Lü said: *"Before refining the returning elixir, first refine the mind."* The *Record of Mount Xishan* states: *"True immortals and supreme sages teach people to cultivate the Dao—this is cultivating the mind. To teach people to cultivate the mind is to cultivate the Dao."* It also says: *"Restrain it, and it is upright; release it, and it is wild. Clarity and coolness give birth to the Dao; turbidity and dullness cause the spirit to forget."* This is its essential meaning.

**On Practice:** Yin and yang. The Immortal Elder said: *"Refining the great elixir may be easy or difficult—know that it depends on oneself and on Heaven. Without accumulating merit and practicing virtue, demonic obstacles will arise at every turn."*

Master Zhongli said: *"Merit without conduct is like having no feet; conduct without merit is like having eyes that cannot see ahead. Only with both merit and conduct complete, feet and eyes intact—who says one cannot become an immortal with no merit?"*

Master Lü said: *"The path to Penglai relies on three thousand merits; only then can one stride through the clouds and return."* When hidden merits are accumulated, one is certain to encounter a perfected being. Hence it is said: *"Naturally, there is a tripod to simmer dragon and tiger."*

As for clinging to children and loving one’s wife, the Immortal Elder’s intent is to warn again that learners may lose the Dao and enter deviant paths. Loving wife and clinging to children will forever sink one into the bitter sea. Scholars must preserve aspirations beyond the mundane world.

**A Warning to the World.**

*Xijiangyue*

The Elixir is the supreme treasure of the colored body,
Refined, it transforms endlessly.
Further, delve into the nature to fathom the true source,
And master the wondrous workings of life and death.

No need to await another body in future lives—
Here and now, one attains the Buddha’s divine powers.
Ever since the Dragon Girl applied this practice,
Who since has been able to follow in her footsteps?

*Annotation:* The Golden Elixir can transmute the formed into the formless, thus enabling boundless transformations, hidden or manifest, beyond measure. If one can also recognize the mind and see the nature, dispelling illusions and delusions to expand divine powers, then the Way of both nature and life becomes complete, form and spirit both perfected—this is how the Dao is most profoundly realized. Far surpassing the leakless, it forges an indestructible vajra body, the supreme Great Way.

Thus the Immortal Elder said: *"If with a body of true gold and wondrous hue, one realizes the true golden compassionate form—majestic and dignified, a teacher of gods and humans—manifesting divine powers, universally appearing throughout the Dharma realms, wielding boundless compassion, equal and luminous wisdom, adorning Buddha-lands, broadly proclaiming the wondrous Dharma, universally liberating sentient beings—then one must also recognize the mind and see the nature to fully propagate this Way."* In the past, the Dragon Girl suddenly awakened to the mind-jewel and transcended to Buddha-nature—this is that very Way.

Yet if practitioners, weary of this illusory form, cannot refine the Golden Elixir but instead seek to directly transcend to the Tathāgata, to the true emptiness ever still and quiescent—this is the ultimate Nirvāṇa samādhi—then such words and such bodily forms are not to be grasped.

**On Nature and Life.**

*Ziye* said: *"The Elixir is the supreme treasure of the colored body"—this single phrase already exhausts the essence of the Great Elixir. What need is there for more?*

*Daoguang* said: This Way is precisely the intent behind Patriarch Bodhidharma’s coming from the West; it is the transmission passed down through successive patriarchs. Thus the Sixth Patriarch spoke of the *"Cao Han lineage,"* and Mazu pointed to *"the waters of the West River"*—all referring to this very meaning. Yet later generations, lacking true intent, merely discuss the Buddha and patriarchs with their mouths, resorting to staffs, blows, shouts, and a hundred metaphors, guiding those of superior roots to practice the Way, those of middling capacity to awaken to their nature, and those of lesser roots to remember the words, adapting to each person’s disposition. The aim is for the world to first preserve their nature, then cultivate life—preserving nature is the work of refining the jade liquid and tempering the self, while cultivating life is the Way of the golden liquid returning as the Elixir. Those who encounter this may claim it as their teaching, asserting that with a single word from the Chan school, one instantly awakens to Buddhahood. This is deception, deluding the foolish—how could such a principle exist?

Know this: the Golden Elixir is the wondrous vehicle of the supreme teaching.

I have privately considered that in human birth, all cling to delusive passions and thus possess a body. Possessing a body, one possesses its afflictions—were there no body, whence would afflictions arise? Those who wish to be free of affliction cannot do better than to embody the supreme Dao. To embody the supreme Dao, nothing surpasses illuminating the original mind. Thus the mind is the essence of the Dao, and the essence of the Dao is the function of the mind. If one can examine the mind and observe the nature, the luminous and perfect essence will naturally appear, and the effortless essence will naturally be achieved. Without resorting to artificial effort, one instantly transcends to the other shore. If not for the mind-mirror gleaming bright and the spirit-pearl resplendent in clarity, how could one reflect the thusness of the undefinable dharma, causing all phenomena to instantly dissolve, the finest dust to be utterly unstained, the mind-source to be free, and the bedrock of non-arising to be firmly established?

Yet those who illuminate the mind and embody the Dao are not burdened by the body, nor is their truth disturbed by circumstances. Thus blades and weapons cannot harm them, tigers and rhinoceroses cannot injure them, and great conflagrations or floods are no cause for concern. The enlightened person’s mind is like a bright mirror: it reflects but does not retain, responds to conditions yet does not initiate, and thus can overcome things without being harmed. This is what is called the supreme, most true, and wondrously awakened Dao.

Originally, the Dao had no name—sages forcibly named it. The Dao had no words—sages borrowed words to express it. Yet if names and words were silenced, the common folk would have no means to recognize its essence and return to their true nature. Therefore, sages established teachings and set forth words to reveal the Dao. Thus, through words the Dao is revealed, but through the Dao words are forgotten.

Alas, this Dao is most wondrous and subtle, yet the world’s people, their roots dull and their natures deluded, cling to the possession of a body, abhorring death and delighting in life, and thus ultimately find it difficult to awaken. The Yellow Emperor and Laozi, pitying their attachments, employed the arts of cultivating life to follow their desires and gradually guide them. The essence of cultivating life lies in the Golden Elixir, and the essence of the Golden Elixir lies in the divine water and the flowering pond. Thus the teachings of the *Dao De Jing* and the *Yin Fu Jing* flourished in the world, for people delight in preserving life. Yet their words are veiled and their principles profound; though scholars recite their texts, none comprehend their meaning. Without encountering a perfected one to transmit the oral instructions, even if one were to conjecture a hundred ways, one would never grasp its efficacy and accomplish its work. Is this not why scholars are as numerous as ox hairs, while those who attain it are as rare as qilin horns?

In the year *jiyou* of my life, I met a master in Chengdu who transmitted to me the method of the Elixir. That very year, my lord and patron passed away. Thereafter, three times I transmitted it to unworthy recipients, and three times I suffered calamities, each within twenty days. Only recently have I recalled my master’s warning: *"One day, if there be one who can untie your bonds and cast off your shackles, transmit it directly to them—no others are permitted."* Later, wishing to dissolve my name from the register, I feared that people would not believe in this Dao. Thus I composed this *Awakening to Reality*, which expounds the origins and ends of the Elixir and its ingredients.

Once completed, seekers gathered in throngs. Observing their earnestness, I could not bear to refuse them, and so I explained and transmitted it. Yet those to whom I transmitted it were none of great power or strength, none capable of rescuing the imperiled or saving the drowning, none magnanimous and outstanding, none benevolent and enlightened in the Dao. At first, I suffered calamities once or twice and remained unaware; by the third time, I awakened to my past errors. Thus I know that the method of the Great Elixir is most simple and most easy—even the foolish and lowly who practice it immediately ascend to the realm of sages. This is Heaven’s intent to guard its secrets, not permitting careless transmission to the unworthy. Yet I, disregarding my master’s words, repeatedly divulged Heaven’s mysteries, and because I possessed a body, I each time incurred punishment and affliction. Heaven’s admonitions are so divine and swift—how dare I not fear and reproach myself?

From this day forward, I shall seal my lips and bind my tongue. Even if a cauldron and tripod stand before me, or blades press upon my neck, I shall never again dare to speak of it. Within this *Awakening to Reality*, the subtle principles of the Great Elixir, its ingredients, and the firing times are all exhaustively set forth. If there be diligent seekers with innate immortal bones, upon reading it, their wisdom and discernment will naturally clarify, enabling them to follow the text and comprehend its meaning—what need have they for my humble transmission? This is Heaven’s gift, not my reckless dissemination.

As for the songs and hymns at the end of the text, they discuss the method of seeing the nature, which is the wondrously awakened Dao mentioned above. The effortless Dao takes aiding others as its heart; though it reveals secret essentials, it ultimately incurs no fault. Alas, ordinary people’s karmic conditions vary in depth, and their natures differ in acuity. Though they hear a single sound, their interpretations diverge. Thus the dharma treasures expounded by Śākyamuni and Mañjuśrī are none other than the One Vehicle, yet listeners comprehend them according to their capacities, naturally forming the distinctions of the Three Vehicles.

Hereafter, if there be those of fierce and resolute nature who encounter this text, they will know that I have attained the wondrous essence of the supreme teaching of Bodhidharma and the Sixth Patriarch, and that through a single word they may awaken to the myriad dharmas. If their habitual tendencies remain dull, they may revert to middling or lesser views—this is not my fault.

Written on the day *wuyin* of the month *wuyin* in the first year of the *Yuanfeng* reign, the year *wuwu*, by Zhang Yongcheng, styled Pingshu.
