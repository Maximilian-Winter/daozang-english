---

A single instruction reveals the principles of Heaven and Earth,
Sweeping away heterodox paths without a trace.
In primordial chaos, the spirit congeals—this is the Dao of immortals,
Heaven and Earth are void, above and below empty.

This instruction is not held in the mouth nor chanted,
But when the heart awakens, understanding breaks free from the mortal cage.
Piercing the barrier between Wood and Metal without inquiry,
True Lead and True Mercury are the essences of Heaven and Earth.
Who knows this principle of immortality?
To awaken to this instruction is to succeed.

Neither Kan nor Li, nor Dragon nor Tiger,
Neither Crow nor Hare, neither West nor East.
Not the liver, not the lungs, not the heart nor kidneys,
How could it involve the spleen, stomach, gallbladder, or essence?

Neither thought nor action—acting without acting,
Not congealing true darkness nor vainly straining the spirit.
It does not emerge from the Three Fields, above or below,
How could it depend on the spine reaching to Kunlun?

It is not essence, fluids, black blood, or marrow,
Nor the radiant spirits of the five viscera.
This thing does not arise from the human body,
Nor in spring, summer, autumn, or winter.
Who recognizes the precelestial and preterrestrial?
The two qi merge, each weighing a catty.

New moon and full moon, dark and crescent, align with the fundamental number,
Circling day and night without cease.
Follow the time to gather a tender fragment,
Harvest it at the center, aligning with Jia and Geng.

Emerging in the southwest as the birthplace of the medicine,
Gently harmonize it and enter the Gen Palace.
Lightly stir the celestial mechanism,
And the true qi will gather in the Great Void at all times.

Awakening to Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel,
The cosmos inverts, following the root’s trace.
The Southern Aster moves into the Northern Aster’s position,
The Golden Crow flies into the Jade Toad’s palace.

Within the Great Yang, the Jade Hare is concealed,
The Great Yin naturally harmonizes and unites.
After the first quarter, seek the medicine,
Before the last quarter, the qi settles evenly.

Between the two quarters is the time for gathering,
Before and after determine the life and death of the ancestral lineage.
Who is the king, and who am I?
When I float, you sink.

Harmonize floating and sinking into one,
Bathing and concealment are all empty.
Kan and Li were never truly North and South,
How could Zhen and Dui be fixed to West and East?

The tender fragment enters the crucible without barrier,
Seizing the Northern Dipper’s celestial wheel.
Stirring yin and yang into the palm,
In an instant, creation arises in the center.

These methods of Golden Liquor and Returned Elixir—
Without encountering an immortal master, do not forcefully pursue them.
If you truly gather the precelestial qi,
The sun and moon are captured in your hands.

Day and night, they clash into one mass,
Naturally, the roars of Dragon and Tiger resound.
At first, wind howls above and below,
As the wind gradually congeals, purple clouds form.
Living clouds overflow, obscuring the sun and moon—
At this moment, a storm like primordial chaos arises.

Silently, the mists and clouds stir,
Within stillness, the crash of thunder is heard.
Simurgh and phoenix, tortoise and serpent intertwine,
Golden Crow and Jade Hare contend of their own accord.

Tiger retreats, Dragon coils, seeking the supreme treasure,
Metal Lord and Maiden unite in marriage.
This time, mother and child reunite,
Spirit and qi return to the root, merging with original truth.

A single point—the primordial true seed—
Refined into the cinnabar field, eternal spring.
The precelestial and preterrestrial return to one,
Before the separation of chaos, how could there be roots?

Generation naturally accords with sacred principle,
Green leaves and red blossoms—all renewed in one hue.
Water and fire, above and below, ceaselessly irrigate,
The two qi congeal to birth the fetal infant.

Naturally, the ancestral spirit is born in broad daylight,
Transcending the mortal to enter the sacred, escaping life and death.
After a hundred days of cultivation, no deficiency remains,
Blood transforms into congealed cream, the body like silver.
True qi steams without cold or heat,
Only then is one a lofty person of the Dao in the world.

Refining with Qian Yang for three hundred days,
Sudden rain and whirlwind fill the Great Void.
Lightning flashes without number,
Thunder shakes the celestial pass, startling gods and ghosts.

The cosmos overturns, white snow flies,
Yin and yang invert—no night, no spring.
The bones are exchanged, yang restored, the body becomes indestructible,
Nine returns and seven reversions crystallize the true form.

Refining with wisdom-fire for three hundred days,
Inner and outer brilliance reveals the true within.
Gathering forms it, scattering returns it to qi,
Returning to the origin, merging with the Great Void.

Transformations come and go, beyond human reckoning,
Passed down mouth to mouth from ancient times to today.
Within it lies the principle of Heaven and Earth,
The immortals’ oral instructions are no empty discourse.

Moreover, preserve it for three to five years,
Through countless kalpas without end.
Mastering the method of Golden Liquor and Returned Elixir,
Riding simurghs and phoenixes, soaring freely.
Refining the profound without obstruction,
Roaming the three islands of Penglai at will.

Even after a hundred million myriad kalpas,
The seas may dry, mountains may crumble, yet the countenance remains true.
Alas for those in the world who cultivate the truth—
All differ from the Dao of Heavenly Immortals.
Three thousand six hundred heterodox methods,
Cannot be exhaustively distinguished and expounded.

The Great Dao lies before one’s eyes, yet people do not recognize it,
Scattered among the myriad things and the human body.
The enlightened gather the precelestial qi,
Thunder roars through the night without pause.

Lightning flashes without number,
The two qi merge—how could they have form?
Shattering the celestial pass beyond compare,
Wind, rain, thunder, and lightning arise together.
Yin and yang invert, exchanging positions,
Boundless celestial qi contend in glory.

Tiger retreats from the medicine furnace, vying for creation,
Dragon coils in the golden tripod, seeking ascent.
The Four Symbols and Five Phases return to Wu and Ji,
Refining and forging the primordial essence.

Auspicious qi blazes, the stars dim,
Crimson light blazes, the sun darkens.
Yin and yang naturally advance and retreat,
Before and after the quarters, the truth is determined.

Recognize the age of the Golden Elixir,
Drawing and adding, a moment’s work.
Know the timing of the fetal fire,
Each moment naturally ascends.

True fire’s flames scorch the cosmos,
Heaven and Earth above and below glow red.
One water, one fire—dividing the lines of the hexagram,
One ascent, one descent—settling floating and sinking.
One coming, one going—distinguishing guest and host,
One before, one after—establishing ruler and minister.
One yin, one yang—forming Heaven and Earth,
One firm, one yielding—naturally balanced.

Winter and summer’s two qi mark the seasons,
Spring and autumn’s two qi determine cold and warmth.
Coming and going, ascending and descending—without form,
Circling day and night, each with its appointed time.

Driving back the Dipper’s handle governs the Mystery Pass,
Revolving the Celestial Pivot unites the myriad forms.
In a fleeting moment, dragon and tiger battle fiercely,
The two substances unite in an instant’s exchange.
Bearing clarity, they return to the Valley Cavity,
In primal chaos, distinction naturally emerges.

This is the method of wood and metal’s union,
True lead, true mercury—the essence of Heaven and Earth.
This alone is the fire-tending secret of the Golden Elixir,
Wholly dependent on their union at the Cinnabar Spirit.
A single chaos, the thousand-year medicine,
Eternal through ten thousand kalpas, an unending spring.

Within three thousand days, the living image congeals,
In a hundred days, the work divides the numinous transformations.
After ten months, the pure yang body is refined,
Naturally immune to cold and heat’s intrusion.

When merit is complete and conduct perfected, the spirit-fetus forms,
Drawing out the fetus, exchanging bones—returning to longevity.
Auspicious qi and colored clouds veil the jade body,
Green luan and white cranes lead the way.
Jade maidens and golden lads hold the purple decree,
The heavenly immortals of all heavens welcome from left and right.

Golden light shrouds the body, unseen by mortals,
The celestial music of the nine heavens resounds as one.
Riding clouds and mist, they journey toward the Origin,
Soaring upward to the Ninefold Empyrean.
