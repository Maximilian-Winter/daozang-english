*The Supreme Jade Writ of the Luminous Silk Text for Determining Immortal Registers*
**Transmitted by the Queen Mother of the Golden Citadel of the Western Realm**

On the first day of a certain month and year, marked by the cyclical signs *jiazi*, the adept [Name], styled [Honorific], having been blessed in a former life and now favored in this one, previously received from the Dharma Master [Name] of [Sacred Peak] the inner instructions of the *Luminous Silk Text*, the scriptures of the host of sages, and the Way of ascending as an immortal—thereby determining one’s immortal rank. The chapters were sealed with golden tokens, and the oath was sworn in blood before the White Phoenix, binding for an eon until a worthy successor might receive the transmission.

Now, a fellow aspirant, having begun the study of the *jia-yi* (first stages of Daoist practice) and already received the great covenant of the supreme sacred statutes, governs the myriad spirits, summons demonic and numinous beings, commands dragons and summons perfected ones, seals and oversees the Five Peaks, and supervises the rivers and springs. Having engraved the original text of the oath, it ascends to the mysterious void; having cut blood for the pact, the talismanic ranks of the myriad perfected are established. The seven ancestral generations stand witness to the covenant—this teaching is not lightly transmitted.

Should the secret graphs and texts of the *Luminous Silk* be divulged, the transgressor’s corpse shall be severed in the dark springs, their seven generations of parents shall suffer interrogation by the Three Officials, and they shall be judged according to the statutes of the Four Poles.

**The secret name of the Heavenly Sovereign Lord is *He*.**
**[Four graphs.]**

The Earthly Sovereign Lord’s secret name is *Zha*. **[Seven graphs.]**

The Human Sovereign Lord’s secret name is *Chang*. **[Five graphs.]**

With the eye aligned to the bright star within the Celestial Heart, the minor luminaries and lesser astral bodies, the Qian and Kun earthly deities, the Dipper’s reception, the forest’s tremor, the mao earthly gate, the xun cyclical branch, the wu noon, the human portal at yong, the dui western gate, the qian celestial gate, the si ghost gate, the gen cyclical branch, the head’s wu, the jia, yi, bing, ding, geng, xin, ren—none may ride the rigid stalwart or approach the human realm. Yang’s lament, benevolence’s longevity, prosperity’s nine heavens, nine heavens’ nine lands, nine humans’ destinies, nine perfected ones, nine Ways, nine transmissions, nine births, nine subtleties, nine mysteries, nine essentials, nine completions—with these, transcend the heavens. Zhang the Valiant, thirty prohibitions, the dragon’s mandate, the nine constructions of morning and night, the nine establishments of removal and fullness, the stabilization of the celestial chambers, the ascent of luminous deities—these are the vital flexions of fate’s phrases. Assist the radiant fire’s three humans, the nine heavens’ scorching flame, the nine celestial reckonings of the spirit’s great emergence. The azure soul’s distant decree commands the earth to bow thrice. Nine stones, nine jade maidens emerge from the young luminaries’ triad. The three qian prohibitions, nine pellets, nine celestial transformations, nine oxen, two humans, the fish of the sun—none may equal thirty days. The nine unities of left and right, the four stone mountains’ deities issue forth destiny’s prosperity. Between the maidens’ intervals, the Ding of Prosperity emerges, entering and exiting within the Five Emperors. The Five Emperors confer upon the Three Sovereigns’ primal heads—once enlightened, the August Right’s excellence enters the Grand Clarity’s fiery Horn, Neck, House, Heart, Tail, Winnowing Basket, Dipper, Ox, Maiden, Emptiness, Rooftop, Chamber, Straddler, Harvester, Stomach, Punishment, Net, Turtle Beak, Triad—destiny seeks immortality. The five unite with the eternal heights, the nine heavens’ Great One, the Northern Army, the Five Peaks, the Four Readings, the Three Rivers, the Six Lords, the Eastern Sea’s thirty-six thousand dark luminaries, the stars and constellations, the ancient ghosts and spirits, the hidden origins, the myriad convergences—those who revere shall preserve; those who lose shall perish. Should one emerge as a true person, they shall not be led astray. Prosperity attends the heavens, awaiting the imperial command. Should the path curve, the nine dukes and marquises’ true persons shall serve the river, augment the Dipper, govern the five hearts, and follow the celestial mandate from youth to age—the immortal artisans.

**[The Heavenly Sovereign’s section comprises 314 graphs.]**

The eight directions’ cyclic completion does not decree life’s seclusion. The shen sea’s fiery king, the dragon’s jade wall, the great stone’s celestial shen enters the azure sea’s firm canopy. The six ding’s rivers must follow the stars’ flow, investigating antiquity. The Han’s ancestral lineage, the Yin’s five generations’ radiant illumination, the divine Tang’s essence—what celestial chart does the summoned pavilion of the mountain’s separation derive from? The Ming Emperor, having established Ye, harmonized with the divine. The young northern star, Li’s nine gen, the drum’s thunder lord—only when internally bound to the Dipper does it not divide the sun’s governance. Paired with the Ox, they form herds, coming like swallows, departing like rats and insects. The myriad dark destinies lie in wait, with the streaming stars and the twenty cyclical branches. Cherishing the root, the nine heavens’ mountains, stones, and waters—clarity severs sorrow. The assistant studies jade essence, the martial world’s urgent merit, privately embracing the one. The ten above and below, the three eights’ domains, the qian and gen’s nine, the two and four’s xun issue forth destiny. The Yi’s absence from the rivers, seas, and great pools’ depths—within the sorrowful, the divine’s qi communicates. With qian entering kun, the two extremes’ convergence—doubt ceases, the right assists the branches’ beginning. The universal urgency of ghosts, the urgency of sins, the premature doom of blessings—transcend the mountains’ woods, the mounds’ peril. The August Dragon pairs with yin’s extremes. The seven divisions of sun and moon, the Dipper’s entry into the celestial father—nine mysteries encircle the heavens, aiding the celestial maidens’ jade luster. The vermilion eyes’ fiery decree must extinguish the heavens’ center, the waters’ center, the sheep, each celestial arrow. The human and the sun and moon’s great brilliance.

**[The Earthly Sovereign’s section comprises 233 graphs.]**

In the worldly dragon’s celestial tusk, the great heavens’ Zhang Mingye, the four nines’ mountains flow weakly, emerging from the left eight hundred’s midst. The Zi Celestial Gate collects ghosts, uniting with the nine heavens’ entry into the nine mountains’ urgency. Revering the Horn’s non-Peng, the jia and yi’s celestial grandson, the three heavens’ luminous white—ghosts are thus commanded by the August Heaven’s decree. The six ding comply as the statutes command. The hundred ghosts, not the stars, depart urgently. The three heavens’ mandate—above, it becomes the forest’s ghosts. The young’s sincerity decides the sun’s division into places of emergence and departure. Joy accompanies the azure tiger. The Three Sovereigns’ northern edict—also named the Twenty-Eight Constellations—advances the mandate. The Great One emerges from the vast heavens’ nine tracks, suddenly possessing the statutes’ enclosure. Movement and pacing comply with the almanac’s records. The three urgent commands of the luminous lord differ—thus, the nine rivers’ avoidance texts appear. The Thunder Duke differs—thus, the nine rivers blaze, governing the myriad emergences. The Dipper and Ox extend life without end. The celestial minister’s mutual assistance does not terminate the statutory text.

**[The Human Sovereign’s section comprises 158 graphs.]**

The nine heavens command the Upper Heaven’s lesser Northern Army, the Eastern Sea’s Azure Lad, the Dark General, the Divine King Father, the responsive jade stars’ positions, the jade maidens, the mysterious deities, the Great Emperor, the Thunder Duke’s arrayed positions, the yang ding, the Three Sovereigns, the Five Lords, the Six Dukes. The exalted names reach the celestial chambers, entering all rivers and peaks.

The urgent memorial commands compliance. The exalted summons the High Heaven’s Western Chamber Lady, entering all rivers and peaks’ forty-eight seated positions. The celestial and earthly various maidens’ talismans arrive as summoned. The Jade Maiden, Plain Maiden, Charming Maiden, Purple Radiance, Mysterious Essence, River Wondrous One, the Five Peaks’ Azure Forest, the Nine Heavens’ parents, the Wind Earl—send names urgently as commanded. The Celestial Chancellor, the Swift Censor, the Fire Lord, the Divine Lady—once the memorial arrives, hasten as the statutes command. The three urgent commands of the luminous lord—Bao Hu’s sudden departure, the Three Ladies, the Old Woman, Peng’s son—inquire urgently to assume positions without delay. The Celestial Day’s Patrol stabs the treacherous and investigates affairs in the Nine Heavens.

**Eastern Direction (120 graphs):**
The Nine Qi’s Primordial Sovereign of the Azure Heaven, the Green Radiance, and the Towering Guardians—within them dwells an Elder who oversees the celestial registers and commands qi to summon immortals. The Year Star assists the liver; Horn, Neck, and the Four Quarters’ revolving scenes are governed by Winnowing Basket, master of the Seven Luminaries. The Dipper’s bright wheel receives qi, seizing the false and sweeping away calamities. The Eastern Mountain’s divine incantation summons the Nine Heavens’ Red Script talismans to bind Fengdu, restrain demons, and dispatch ghosts—none dare evade execution. All are sent to the Wood Palace. Should any delay, the Eastern River and the Vast Sea’s water spirits shall be constrained: great kalpas of floods, dragons bearing disasters, and the Water Palace’s paths—hundreds and thousands of passages—shall be opened by the Supreme Emperor’s Red Writ amid the primordial wind and fire.

The Great White Star inspects the lungs; Straddler and Harvester guard the soul; Stomach, Mane, and Net assist. The Seven Passes are mastered by the Three Stars; the Dipper’s handle receives talismans. The Northern Culmen’s Red Writ and jade graphs, the Nine Heavens’ true script, summon the myriad qi to return universally to the Emperor Lord. The Western Mountain’s divine incantation, the Eight Might’s Seven Transmissions, summons dragons from waters and clouds from mountains, all converging at the Emperor’s gate to assist and guard the perfected.
