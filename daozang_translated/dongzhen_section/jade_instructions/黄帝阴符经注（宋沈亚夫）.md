*The Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing* Commentary*
Title: *Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing***
Authored by Shěn Yàfū, likely from the Northern Song dynasty.
Recorded in *The Comprehensive Records of the Arts and Literature* (《通志□艺文略》).
One scroll.

The original text: *The Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era* (《正统道藏》), under the *Tongzhen* (洞真) section, *Jade Precepts* (玉诀类).

The *Yin Fu Jing*’s three hundred words converge upon a singular principle.
Most people fail to grasp its profound mysteries, discussing Dao, military strategy, and human affairs instead—this is not its intent.

*The Tai Xuan* (《太玄》) states:
*"The Yang ascends the Five Blessings by their kindred affinity.*
Longevity, wealth, ease, and good fortune come to those who cherish virtue and fulfill their destiny.
*The Yin descends the Six Calamities by their kindred affinity.*
Shortened life, misfortune, illness, and sorrow come to those burdened by poverty, malice, or weakness."*

The Sage expounds upon the One Dao of Heaven, the Two of Earth, and the Three of Life (三生).
All ten thousand things derive from the One *Qi* (炁) and are born from it.
Thus, one cultivates the mind to harmonize with nature (*xìng* 性),
cultivates nature to harmonize with *Qi*,
*Qi* merges with the Void (*xūwú* 虚无),
and the Void integrates with the Essence (*tǐ* 体).

Then, one embodies the Dao’s movement in Heaven,
observes celestial omens to model speech,
deciphers the profound patterns of the Three Essentials (三要),
refines the true *Qi* of the Five Phases (五行),
molds the essence of Sun and Moon,
conceals and directs the *Kàn* (坎) and *Lí* (离) energies,
discerns the interplay of Yin and Yang in creation,
and penetrates the principles of Heaven and Earth’s generation.

The text says:
*"The Sun and Moon follow their appointed cycles,
great and small have fixed measures—
from this, the Sage’s work arises,
and divine insight emerges.
Ah, how profound!"*

To delve deeply into its subtle meaning,
to perceive its true source,
gaining it grants eternal life,
losing it risks a premature end.

Here we see the three terms—*performing the Dao* (演道), *performing the Law* (演法), *performing the Art* (演术)—
ancient sages kept them hidden, preserving them.
This is the hidden mechanism of Heaven,
not to be carelessly divulged.

Now, I briefly annotate its meaning,
to guide the essence toward clarity.
The unadorned truth is most precious,
easy to grasp, profound in intent.

**Highest:** The Immortals embrace the One in *performing the Dao*.
*Performing the Dao* refers to the *Huan Dan* (还丹) school’s embrace of the One,
where the primal *Qi* (元炁) circulates toward the brain,
ascending to the Celestial Orb (朝天).
Like the *Qi*-orb revolving,
it ascends to the Celestial Court (朝天).

*The Daoist Scriptures* say:
*"Eternal life without aging—
return the essence to replenish the brain."*

*The Tai Qing Jade Precepts* (《太清玉诀》) say:
*"If you reach the River Vehicle’s realm,
golden treasures fill your home."*

**Middle:** The ruler enriches the nation and secures the people by *performing the Law*.
*Performing the Law* means purifying the heart of defilement,
ascending to the *Chun Kan* (淳坎) waters of purity,
becoming the Law itself.

This heart is the Emperor’s—
serene and undivided, he establishes just governance,
thus enriching the nation and securing the people.

*The Tai Qing Jade Precepts* say:
*"If you reach the Brown River’s ford,
forging white essence,
concealing the truth."*

**Lowest:** The warrior strengthens his forces and conquers by *performing the Art*.
*Performing the Art* means:
*Fire* (木) generates *Fire* (火),
the hollow center of *Lí* (离) is *Water*,
the solid center of *Kàn* (坎) is *Fire*—
thus, the true *Water* and true *Fire* are concealed within the heart,
forming the Art itself.

*The Tai Qing Jade Precepts* say:
*"If you reach the Violet Elixir,
life is neither death nor difficulty."*

**Commentary on the *Yellow Emperor’s Yin Fu Jing***
By the *Censor-in-Chief* Shěn Yàfū.

**Chapter One: Performing the Dao**

Observe the Dao of Heaven, grasp its movement—
thus it is complete.

The virtuous one gazes upward at Heaven’s Dao,
its ceaseless motion, conforming to Law and following its course—
thus his nature and life are preserved and nurtured,
and Heaven’s order is fulfilled.

Heaven has five *thieves*—
those who perceive them flourish.

Heaven’s five *thieves* are the Five Phases.
The sun is *Fire*.
*Fire* is born of *Wood*, which overcomes *Earth*.
The moon is *Water*.
*Water* is born of *Metal*, which overcomes *Wood*.
When the Five Phases prey upon or give birth to one another,
this is the origin of cold and heat.

Thus it is said:
*"I gaze upward at Heaven’s thieves—
the Five Phases in order or disorder.
When their sequence is right,
Heaven’s command flourishes and extends,
becoming the great foundation of longevity."*

The five *thieves* dwell within the heart,
yet their actions manifest in Heaven.

Heaven has five stars,
the human body has five viscera,
corresponding to eye, ear, nose, tongue, and heart.
The heart is the chief of the five *thieves*—
thus, by observing the five stars,
one weaves through myriad symbols,
inner and outer forces harmonizing,
and grasps Heaven’s Dao in action.

The cosmos lies within the hands,
ten thousand transformations arise from the body.

The virtuous one comprehends the true source—
as if Heaven and Earth were in the hands,
creation born from the heart,
knowing all things draw from the One *qi* to form their bodies.

Heaven’s nature is humanity.
Humanity is the heart.
The heart is the mechanism.
Establishing Heaven’s Dao to steady humanity.

What is called *Heaven’s command* is *nature*—
humanity.
The human heart is a shifting mechanism,
measuring the workings of creation to fix,
and acting in accordance with Heaven’s Dao without error.

When Heaven unleashes its killing intent,
dragons and serpents rise from the land.
In the months of the three *Yangs*,
when *Yin* and *Yang* harmonize,
and *Water* and *Fire* prey upon each other—
this is when Heaven unleashes its killing intent,
with thunder, wind, and rain shaking the world,
dragons and serpents emerging from their lairs,
and ten thousand things bursting forth—
thus the authority of life and death is fully revealed.

When humanity unleashes its killing intent,
Heaven and Earth are overturned.
For if the human heart is stirred,
then fortune and misfortune, regret and blame arise.

Heaven and Earth are not overturned.
Heaven is the Sage,
Earth is the path of the subject.
Overturning refers to order and disorder.
When the six orders and six reversals are not constant,
this is called overturning.

The Sage stirs not his heart,
thus he follows Heaven’s command;
the petty man acts against the mechanism,
thus he does not exhaust Heaven’s order.

When Heaven and humanity act in concert,
all transformations are fixed by the mechanism.
The Sage aligns with Heaven’s Dao,
balancing the mechanism without deviation,
thus fixing his heart’s intent—
hence, he guards the One.

Nature has skill and clumsiness,
which can be concealed.
For humanity’s skill or clumsiness in nature
mirrors the symbols of *Kàn* and *Lí*—
skill means *Jiè* (completion),
clumsiness means *Wèi Jiè* (incompletion),
thus it is concealed within the *Dan Tian*.

The *Dan Tian* is the origin of essence and *qi*.
The nine orifices’ evils lie in the three *Yào* points,
which can be moved or stilled.
The nine orifices of the human body—
if the heart is upright, the nine evils cannot enter.
The three *Yào* are the proper count of *Yang*.
Three threes make nine—
when *Yang qi* is sufficient, movement and stillness admit no deceit or evil.

*Fire* is born of *Wood*—
when calamity arises, it must overcome.
Deceit arises in the realm—
when it acts, it must collapse.
Knowing this and refining it
is the mark of the Sage.

*Fire* is born of *Wood*.
When *Yang qi* is at its peak,
guard against it in the *Dòu* (constellation) and in desire,
lest deceitful thieves arise.

The virtuous one refines his body and conduct,
then governs the realm and secures the people—
such is the Sage and the worthy.

**Chapter Two: Performing the Law**

Heaven and Earth are thieves of all things;
all things are thieves of humanity;
humanity is the thief of all things.
When the three thieves are complete,
the Three Powers are at peace.

Thus it is said:
*"Eat in season, and the hundred bones are in order.
Stir the mechanism, and all transformations are at peace."*

The Three *Generations* produce ten thousand things,
containing the pure *Yang qi*.
If the One *qi* is stolen,
it returns after seven days of *Lái Fù* (reversal),
thus the Three Powers are complete in unity.

Humanity, having stolen the beginning of all things,
uses them unknowingly—
but those who know this attain longevity,
their form unchanging, all transformations at peace.

Humanity knows its spirit,
but does not know how its non-spirit makes it spirit.

Humanity has thirty-six thousand spirit-lights—
thus, when desires multiply, the spirit is exhausted,
and it is no longer spirit.

The *Yì* says:
*"The unfathomable *Yin* and *Yang* are spirit—
embracing the One and preserving the spirit is how one becomes spirit."*

The sun and moon have their numbers,
the great and small have their limits.
From this, the Sage’s work arises,
and divine clarity emerges.

The sun is the essence of *Fire*,
moving one degree per day and night;
the moon is the essence of *Water*,
moving twelve and a half degrees per day and night.

Thus the virtuous one steals the numbers of *Water* and *Fire*,
their great and small movements,
and attains extraordinary Sagehood—
from this, divine light emerges.

As for stealing the mechanism,
none under Heaven can see or know it.
The virtuous one who obtains it preserves his life;
the petty man who obtains it risks his life.
Thus, to steal Heaven’s mechanism,
the workings of creation—
the foolish cannot see or know it.

The virtuous one attains it and returns to the true;
the petty man acts against it and perishes.

**Chapter Three: Performing the Art**

The blind excel in hearing,
the deaf excel in seeing.
Cutting off the source of gain,
one’s use of a teacher is tenfold;
the blind and deaf excel in hearing and seeing,
thus the root of gain is severed.

If humanity can focus the heart
without abandoning the middle path,
the tenfold use of a teacher cannot compare.

Three returns of day and night,
one’s use of a teacher is ten thousandfold.
The virtuous one focuses the heart,
repeating day and night in the three *Yang* periods,
his actions unbroken—
thus his use of a teacher surpasses ten thousandfold.

The heart is born of things,
dies in things,
its mechanism lies in the eyes.
When the heart is extinguished and the eyes do not gaze outward,
life and death are forgotten—
thus the mechanism is forgotten.

Heaven, though without kindness, gives rise to great kindness.
Heaven, though silent, is without partiality in sun and moon.
If humanity can steal the bait of essence,
attaining the art of immortality—
this is when kindness knows no end, and great kindness arises.

Swift lightning and fierce winds—
none remain unmoved.
When the will is singular and sincere,
thus unmoved and still.

Supreme joy overflows from nature,
supreme stillness brings purity.
When nature is harmonious, it embraces the boundless with ease;
when the heart is clear, all transformations are pure and balanced.

The utmost privacy of Heaven yields its application in the utmost fairness. Heaven displays its symbols—when humanity seizes and imitates them, this is Heaven’s utmost privacy; Heaven’s creative transformations are without bias or favoritism, thus the utmost fairness.

The regulation of beasts lies in **qi**[*1].
The living are the root of the dead;
the dead are the root of the living.
Humans live by **qi**, die by **qi**;
all things live by the Earth, die by the Earth.
If humans can grasp and regulate **qi**,
attaining Heaven and Earth’s true **qi**—
this is the root of eternal life and immortality.
**Qi** is the art of grasping and releasing[*2].
Virtue arises from harm, harm from virtue.
Spring’s birth and summer’s growth—virtue;
autumn’s killing and winter’s concealment—harm.
Humans are born through women—virtue;
they die through women—harm.

The fool takes Heaven and Earth’s patterns and principles as sacred;
I take the changes of time and things as profound wisdom.
Heaven’s patterns and Earth’s principles—these are the **Dao** of Heaven and Earth;
Heaven’s timing and Earth’s advantages—these are the **Dao** of time and circumstances.
Those who embody Heaven’s patterns and Earth’s regulations are sacred;
those who adapt to time’s shifts and movements are profound.
The fool cannot discern Heaven’s timing and human affairs;
if one can align with Heaven and Earth’s nurturing transformations,
and set teachings according to the times—
this is the conduct of the Sage and the Wise.

The **Dao** is the foundation of stillness,
stillness is Heaven’s mechanism.
Movement reveals its changes,
changes reveal its symbols.
Thus, creative transformations move and still,
**yin** and **yang** propel each other—
this is why it harmonizes with Heaven’s flow,
and calculations never stray.

The *Tài Xuān*[*3] says:
By night, measure **yin**;
by day, measure **yang**.
This is the Sage’s grasp of profound principles,
who naturally sustains life,
conceals the mechanism without slaughtering it,
and whose discourse is boundless.

How distant are those who merely discuss military strategy and human affairs!

The *Yellow Emperor’s Yīn Fú Jīng*[*4] concludes.
