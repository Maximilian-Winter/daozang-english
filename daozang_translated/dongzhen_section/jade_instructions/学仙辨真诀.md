**The Instructions on Discerning the True in Learning Immortality**

Those who seek to return to the root and restore simplicity, to revert the hun-soul and restore the primordial, and to attain longevity by securing the foundation—none surpass the art of the Golden Elixir. Those who obtain this art flourish; those who lose it perish. Thus, it is the utmost mystery of the perfected, not something the common or hasty can glimpse. Without accumulated cultivation and sincere practice, one cannot attain it. Its essentials lie within the *Jinbi* and *Cantong*, yet without the oral transmission of its secrets from a master, one remains as one adrift on a dark sea without a vessel.

Master Zuo once encountered an adept who imparted its hidden essentials, revealing that the supreme Dao is utterly simple, and its words most vital. This is the celestial mechanism, not to be lightly disclosed. Here, I briefly set forth what I have obtained as the *Five Instructions on Discerning the True*, to clarify the reality of right and wrong.

**Discerning the True**

Of old, the Yellow Emperor ascended Mount Emei and inquired of the White Jade Perfected regarding the Dao of the True One. The Perfected said: "For attaining longevity and ascending as an immortal, only the Golden Elixir suffices; for preserving form and averting death, the True One will do. Thus, the ancients kept it secret."

The True One is lead. Externally black, it embodies the north, belongs to *Kan* (☵), and *Kan* is water, its number one. Internally white, the white pertains to the west and *Dui* (☱), *Dui* is metal, its number four. If one cultivates it according to principle, yin is exhausted and yang arises—this is the transformation of the essence of metal into the One, where the Azure Dragon receives the tally.

The position of the Azure Dragon is the east and *Zhen* (☳), *Zhen* pertains to wood, its number three. Thus, it may be called the Dao of the Three and the One. Therefore, the *Cantong Qi* states:

> *"At the initial rectification, cultivation begins,
> Yet the dry cannot be grasped too soon.
> The One is concealed,
> The vulgar cannot know it."*

The *Golden Elixir* clarifies this: the method of the elixir first requires the initial rectification. The initial rectification is the true and unchanging One, and by attaining its principle, one succeeds.

**Discerning the Treasure**

Gold is the True One, and through transformation, one obtains its true essence. Within the True One lies *qing* (emotion) and *xing* (nature), which are the lead and the white. Through transmutation, they may be called cinnabar and mercury.

Carefully considering: gold is the mother of water, the mother conceals the child in the womb, and water is the child of gold, the child nestles in the mother’s belly. This speaks of gold and water containing each other, rolling within the mother’s womb. Through transformation, lead is born, and in accordance with the qi and seasons, it arises.

**Discerning Mercury**

Mercury is not what is extracted from cinnabar today. It is refined from the white lead within the Water Palace, also called lead-mercury.

According to Master Tao’s *Huánjīn Shù* (*Art of Returning Gold*): "The black is mercury, not the mercury of the world." Moreover, those who claim mercury can be made into the Golden Elixir are deluded; those who say cinnabar can prolong years are utterly ignorant of the Dao. Misled by ignorance and the words of the deluded, one drifts ever farther from the true.

---

**Discerning Mercury (Continued)**

Mercury is another name for the Alchemical Maiden, and cinnabar is the supreme treasure within lead. The so-called "cinnabar-mercury" in the scriptures is this true instruction.

The text below states: "Lead contains cinnabar-mercury, just as humans possess *qing* and *xing*. *Qing* and *xing* in humans are not external things; cinnabar-mercury in lead is not a foreign substance." If one introduces external things as *qing*, then *xing* cannot unite; if one substitutes mercury for cinnabar-mercury, then lead cannot be embraced.

It further states: "The red marrow flows as mercury, and mercury is the radiant essence of the firmament." This clarifies that mercury does not enter from without. From the union of heaven and earth, it receives qi and is born. Thus, the scripture says:

> *"The sage is not born in vain,
> Gazing above, he beholds the celestial tally."*

The celestial tally is trust: when heavenly qi descends, earthly qi responds. This is the union of yin and yang, the flowing pearl descending. The flowing pearl is also called mercury!

It further states:

> *"Cinnabar flows as the father of mercury,
> Wu and Ji are the mother of yellow gold."*

Thus, the mercury within cinnabar cannot be called mercury. The red marrow of the learner is the essence within lead. The perfected refer to mercury as "quicksilver" merely as a metaphorical name. Later generations, not understanding, mistakenly call the mercury within cinnabar "mercury"—a grave error!

From this, it is clear that lead-mercury is the Alchemical Maiden. The "Maiden of the River’s Edge" refers to common mercury, not that derived from cinnabar.

**Comprehensive Discernment**

Master Tao said: "The ancients borrowed the images of the *Yijing* to compose their scriptures because the supreme Dao aligns with heaven and earth. Just as the Most High first divided the One Qi into the Two Modes, and after the Two Modes were distinguished, the Three Powers emerged—whereby *Qian* and *Kun* operate and the myriad beings are upright, *Kan* and *Li* function and metal and water unite—this is the pivot of the Dao.

Male and female differ, yet yin and yang unite; qi intermingles and forms harmonize, responding to change endlessly—this is the function of the Dao. The sun and moon move! The cold and heat follow their seasons! Moisture and nourishment flow, transformation and circulation proceed—this is the verification of the Dao. Yin extends and yang contracts, yang acts and yin conceals; going and coming, they push *qing* to unite with *xing*—this is the return of the Dao.

This clarifies the division of the One Qi, modeling heaven and emulating earth, naturally uniting the active with the inactive. How could it rely on other things to achieve this? Thus, one thing transforms into yin and yang, into metal and water, into earth and wood, into *qing* and *xing*, into dragon and tiger. Though they share a single origin, their names differ. They must unite with their kind; if there is deviation, they cannot interact.

Therefore, the *Cantong Qi* states:

> *"Plant millet with millet,
> Tame the sparrowhawk with its young."*

This illustrates that lead and mercury cannot be used interchangeably. Moreover, *qing* divides from *xing*, yet *xing* is bound to *qing*; *qing* and *xing* depend on each other, returning to the principle of nature. This is called transformation arising from the true, where beginning and end follow one another."

Know then that true mercury is the *qing* and *xing* of lead, and primordial *qi* is the root of the human being. The Dao of the Three-in-One refines *qing* to unite with *xing*, thereby returning to the root and restoring simplicity.

The art of golden liquid nurtures mercury with gold, enabling the soul to return to its origin. Thus, the two matters of dragon and tiger share a single source. Mercury does not occupy the proper position among the Five Phases, and cinnabar is not the counterpart of dragon and tiger. Hence it is said:

> *"Mixed kinds are not of the same seed,
> How can they dwell together in one body?"*

This clearly distinguishes it from common cinnabar and mercury.

It is further said: Some claim to use lead, others mercury. The text below asks: If mercury is taken as the primary agent, how can Heaven and Earth be established? How can hardness and softness be divided?

If lead is not incorporated, how can metal and water arise? How can the return and reversal proceed? How then can transformation arise from the true? Should millet be planted with anything but millet?

Since ancient times, songs and verses have praised only the efficacy of lead and never extolled the marvels of mercury. How then could common cinnabar and mercury be used? If mercury is made the primary agent, merely borrowing the *qi* of lead to achieve completion, how can the root be abandoned for the branch? How can one fail to refine the treasure within gold?

From this, it is sufficiently clear that the mercury and gold here are not common mercury and ordinary gold. This mercury is not the mercury of the common world. Its purport is profound, its calculations abstruse, extending to the principles of the Five Phases generating and overcoming one another—matters beyond the comprehension of contemporary scholars.

The *Jinbi* and *Cantong Qi* draw upon the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Zhouyi*, the lunar phases and degrees, the dark and bright moons, the two crescents, the twelve earthly branches, the pitch-pipes and calendars, the stars, the directions of east, west, south, and north, and the principles of the sun and moon, each assigned its correspondence as a standard. Their meaning is recondite and difficult to fathom; without oral transmission from a master, their profound principles cannot be fully grasped.

The uses of the yang and yin crucibles, the names of cinnabar sand and golden sand—these teachings are widely disseminated yet ultimately difficult to exhaust. Thus, the *Cantong Qi* states:

> *"The Three, the Five, and the One—
> The essence of Heaven and Earth.
> They may be transmitted orally,
> But cannot be conveyed in writing."*

Heaven is spontaneity; when spontaneity is attained, it becomes Heaven and Earth. Externally, one should act with tranquility and non-action; internally, one should cultivate with effort and action.

**Song of the Mother and Child**
One mother bears two children—
The Dao gives birth to yin and yang.
One boy and one girl—
The boy is the ancestor of yin,
For when yin reaches its extreme, yang is born.
The girl is the master of yang,
For when yang reaches its extreme, yin is born.
Yin comes and yang returns,
Never losing their ancestral origin.
The two *qi* secretly unite and reciprocate,
Never departing from the original source.
The spleen grinds and food digests itself—
Together they return to the earth behind.
The *qi* of the central palace stirs, and food is digested.
Scholars are as numerous as hemp,
Yet the deluded span all ages.
They see the dragon but do not recognize it,
Meet the tiger but do not know it.
The dragon is not in the eastern river,
The tiger is not among the western barbarians.
The enlightened see it before their eyes,
The deluded seek it a thousand miles away.
If you seek it in the one source,
You will clearly know the viscera.
If you seek it in east and west,
You will be as blind as one with two sightless eyes.
Yin resides in the womb of yang,
Yang dwells in the belly of yin.
The male is white, the female red—
Naturally they become husband and wife.
The male’s white is the essence of yin, forming bones and marrow;
The female’s red is the essence of yang, forming blood and flesh—
Such is the natural principle, the female of *li* and the male of *kan*.
Plant hemp and you reap hemp,
Plant millet and you reap millet.
If you do not recognize lead for what it is,
Your hands will labor in vain.
The magpie does not hatch a phoenix,
The fox and hare do not nurse a horse.
If you use other substances to refine the returning elixir,
You will never succeed.

Dimly, dimly—yet how hard is it to see the two things?
Obscurely, obscurely—yet the three natures naturally harmonize.
The *Hunyuan* says:
> *"Vague, yet within it there is something;
> Obscure, yet within it there is essence.
> That essence is most true,
> Within it there is sincerity."*

The three natures are metal, water, and earth. These three form a single family, beginning and ending with the same source.

*Qing* unites without the need for many medicines, nor does it employ the eight stones or the five metals and mixed kinds. *Qi* harmonizes without words; when *qi* is the same, it naturally unites, not to be sought through sacrificial rites.

If you can restrain lead as a cat pounces on a mouse, knowing lead and mercury, water and silver, keeping the Dao unadulterated—it is as easy as a cat seizing a mouse.

The *True Instructions for Discerning Immortality* concludes here.
