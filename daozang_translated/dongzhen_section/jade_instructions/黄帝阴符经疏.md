**Preface to the Commentary on the Obscure Symbols Classic of the Yellow Emperor:**
The **Master of Perception from Shaoshi Mountain** (Shaoshi Shan Daguanzi), **Li Quán** (Li Quán), was devoted to the **Dao of the Immortals** (Shenxian zhi Dao), often traversing sacred peaks and gathering esoteric techniques (fangshu).
Upon reaching **Song Mountain’s Tiger Mouth Cliff** (Songshan Hukou Yan), within the stone-walled grotto, he discovered the **Obscure Symbols Classic** (Yin Fu Jing) inscribed on silk with vermilion lacquer seals (zhuqi zhou), bound in crimson silk (jianguan).
The inscription read: *"In the second year of Wei Zhenjun’s reign (July 7th), the High Purity Daoist Ke Qianzhi (Wei Zhenjun Ke Qianzhi) concealed this within the sacred mountains, to be transmitted to those of like mind (tonghao)."*
The text was worn and faded, as if reduced to ashes and obliteration.
Li Quán made a brief transcription, though he recited it aloud, he ultimately failed to grasp its profound principles (yili).

Li Quán then entered Qin, reaching the foot of **Lishan Mountain**, where he encountered an old woman—her hair piled atop her head, the rest hanging loose—leaning on a staff in ragged robes beside the road. She saw a fire burning a tree and muttered to herself: *"Fire arises from wood; disaster strikes when it spreads."* Li Quán, startled, asked her, *"This is the opening passage of the *Yellow Emperor’s Yin Fu Classic*—how do you know it?"*

The woman replied, *"I have received this symbol for three cycles of sixty years, through the six heavenly stems and ten celestial branches, completing the full reckoning."*

Li Quán respectfully inquired, *"According to the *Taiyi Dunjia Classic*, one cycle of sixty years completes one *jiazi* reckoning; three cycles make one hundred eighty years, three *jiazi* cycles form one full rotation, and six rotations total one thousand eight hundred years. How could one so young know this?"*

Li Quán bowed twice and recounted where he had found the text. The woman smiled and said, *"Your cheeks glow at the life-gate, your fate-wheel aligns with the moon’s horn—your blood and vitality remain unspent, your spirit unclouded. You are virtuous yet drawn to the Dao, bold yet eager for wisdom. You are my disciple.*

*"Yet in fifty-six years, you shall face great calamity."* She then produced a crimson talisman, affixed it to his hat and staff, and pricked his tongue, commanding him to kneel and swallow it. *"The heavens and earth preserve each other,"* she declared, before seating herself beneath a tree to expound on the *Yin Fu’s* profound mysteries.

When she finished, she warned him: *"The *Yellow Emperor’s Yin Fu* consists of three hundred words—one hundred elucidating the Dao, one hundred the law, one hundred the technique. Together, they merge into an indivisible whole.

*"The sage learns it and grasps the Dao; the virtuous learn it and master the law; the wise learn it and wield the technique. The petty, however, invite ruin by their ignorance. Each attains only what their nature permits.

*"Its principles arise from celestial mechanics yet harmonize with human affairs—like the morning tide embracing all rivers, or still water reflecting myriad forms. When its mechanism unfurls, it encompasses the cosmos, binding the Nine Barbarians—yet this is but its grandeur. When it contracts, it conceals the finest dust, containing the mustard seed—yet this is but its subtlety.

*"Its precision surpasses the *Huangting*’s eight vistas; its essence transcends the classics and histories. Its ingenuity outstrips Sunzi, Wu Qi, Han Fei, and Bai Qi. Thus, the natures of growth and decay, the patterns of success and failure, the logic of life and death—all stem from this mechanism.

*"Its alternate name is *The Yellow Emperor’s Tianji Classic*. Those lacking limbs, senses, or clarity—those consumed by greed, stupidity, wind-illness, or madness—shall not hear it.

*"If passed to those of like mind, the recipient must first observe three days of purity. Age or station does not matter—only the worthy may teach it. Never let wealth elevate one above the law or poverty degrade another. To violate this, twenty *ji* of one’s lifespan shall be forfeited.

*"The *River Diagram* and *Luo Book* record the Yellow Emperor’s words: ‘When a sage is born, the Celestial Sovereign grants them thirty-six thousand seven hundred twenty *ji* of fate, one for each year. If they err, the Record-Keeper seizes them. When the *ji* are exhausted, the *ji* are gone, and life ends. But if they cultivate virtue, the Record-Keeper grants them more. When the *ji* accumulate, the *ji* endure, and immortality follows.’

*"Each year on the seventh day of the seventh month, one scroll must be copied and hidden in the sacred mountains’ cliffs—each copy granting a thousand two hundred years of vitality. To recite it seven times daily sharpens the mind, strengthens the will, repels malevolence, dispels calamities, expels the Three Corpses, and subdues the Nine Worms. Thus, the sages concealed it in the Golden Treasury, transmitting it only to the worthy."*

As the sun dipped toward evening, she said, *"I have barley rice to share as sustenance."* From her sleeve, she produced a gourd and bade Li Quán fetch water.

**Commentary on the *Huangdi Yinfu Jing* (卷上) by Li Quán of Shaoshi Mountain**
*Explanation of the Title:*
Yin—darkness.
Fu—harmony.
The hidden harmony of the Dao/Way aligns with the workings of cosmic principle, hence the title *Yinfu*.

**Chapter: The Sage Embracing Unity to Manifest the Dao/Way**
To observe the Dao/Way of Heaven and follow Heaven’s operations—this is complete.

But if one observes only the Dao/Way of Heaven in principle and follows Heaven’s Dao/Way, then the proper interplay of yin and yang, motion and stillness, is fully realized.

**Commentary:**
Heaven refers to the collective name for yin and yang.
The refined *qi* of yang is light and clear, ascending to form Heaven;
The refined *qi* of yin is heavy and turbid, descending to form Earth.
They are connected yet never separate, hence Zhuangzi’s *Liezi* dialogue with the man of Qi, who said to the people of Ruo: *"Heaven is but accumulated *qi*, Earth but accumulated mass—from Earth upward, all is Heaven."* You walk through Heaven all day—why fear its collapse?

Thus, knowing Heaven and Earth reveals that within yin and yang’s *qi* lie the Five Phases.
The Five Phases are the functional expressions of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang, from which all things arise; all things are the offspring of the Five Phases.
If one observes the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang, and follows the Five *qi* of Heaven, then the rise and fall of all things may be known, and life and death discerned. Beyond this, there is nothing further to observe or follow—thus it is said to be complete.

Heaven possesses Five Thieves; those who perceive them thrive.
The Five Thieves reside in the heart, manifesting in Heaven’s operations.
The cosmos lies within the palm; all things spring from the body.
Heaven generates the Five Phases—these are the Five Thieves.
If one attends with mind to observe and follow, aligning with Heaven’s operations, then the cosmos rests in the palm, and all things arise from the body.

**Commentary:**
The Five Thieves are the *qi* of the Five Phases—namely, Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth.
The *Taigong* commentary states: The Sage establishes them as Five Thieves; the world follows them as Five Virtues.
Though humans consume the Five Flavors and die, none abandon them—this is the meaning of the Five Thieves.
The term "Thief" refers to harm.
If one acts contrary to their nature, they bring harm to life—hence "Thief."

This speaks of how yin and yang encompass the Five *qi*, hence: *Heaven has Five Thieves.*
The Five Thieves manifest as:
In Heaven, the Five Stars;
On Earth, the Five Sacred Peaks;
In governance, the Five Directions;
In things, the Five Colors;
In sound, the Five Tones;
In sustenance, the Five Flavors;
In the body, the Five Viscera;
In the Dao/Way, the Five Virtues.
If misused, they become Thieves.
Moreover, the Five Thieves—through the mutual subjugation of the Five Phases, their cyclical generation and destruction without cease—can also steal life and death, the success and failure of all things; hence they are called Thieves.

Why does it say, *"Those who perceive them thrive"*?
If one merely understands the subjugating Dao/Way of the Five Phases and discerns the sources of yin and yang’s rise and fall, then following them is called perception.
If one perceives the Five Thieves and clearly understands them, it brings fortune—virtue flourishes.
Again, if one knows the Five Thieves, why hide them?
They reside in the heart, hence *"the Five Thieves are in the heart."*
Once the heart knows them, one must use the mind to observe and follow the Five *qi*, discerning顺 (harmony) and逆 (contrariness) without error, aligning with Heaven’s intent without loss—then the cosmos lies in the palm, and all things arise from the body.
Thus, all undertakings prosper, and one moves in harmony with the Dao/Way—how could this not bring thriving?

In governance, if one upholds *rén* (benevolence), *yì* (righteousness), *lǐ* (propriety), *zhì* (wisdom), and *xìn* (faithfulness), then wealth, honor, and glory follow—how could this not bring thriving?
In military affairs, if one understands the顺 and逆 of the Five Phases, then victory in battle is assured—how could this not bring thriving?
Thus it is said: *"Those who perceive them thrive."*

If one uses the Five Phases in their generative aspect, this aligns with virtue and the yang.
If one uses their subjugating aspect, this aligns with harm and the yin.
Thus the great masters of the Three Teachings all govern the world through principle; the scriptures they established speak only of cultivating goodness and calling it virtue/power, never of cultivating evil and calling it harm.
Thus, those who diligently cultivate virtue/power are aligned with the Dao/Way—they are the masters of yang.
Those who indulge in yin’s evil and harm are demons—they are the essence of yin.
Beyond this, myriad scriptures are but empty and vast in words.
Hence Confucius said: *"In one word: ‘Think not evil.’"*
And again: *"Choose the good and follow it; choose the ungood and change it."*
This is the supreme Dao/Way—why speak at length of cultivation?

The essence of the Dao/Way does not exceed this gate.
Those who know the origins of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang’s success and failure are fully revealed in the first chapter of the *Yinfu*.
The world sees few words and simple language, yet does not grasp its profundity—why seek it in the vast expanse of the Three Teachings’ scriptures?
Hence the Mother of Mount Li said:
*"To observe its refined principles, the Eight Scenes of the *Huangting* are insufficient for study;
To discern its utmost essence, the Classics and Histories are insufficient for exposition;
To employ its cunning intelligence, the strategies of Sunzi, Wu Qi, Han Fei, and Bai Qi are insufficient for ingenuity."*

**Heaven’s nature is humanity.**
The human heart is the mechanism.
Establishing Heaven’s Dao/Way to govern humanity rests in the Five Thieves.

**Commentary:**
The human heart is the seat of the spirit-soul (*hun*), the body the dwelling of the spirit (*shen*).
Those who would wield the Five Thieves must first master the heart—thus those whose hearts align with the Dao/Way can plot and it will harmonize with Heaven’s operations.
Though the cosmos may be vast, observation lies within the palm;
Though myriad things exist, their life and death are governed by technique.
Hence it is said: *"A rectified heart can repel evil."*

When Heaven’s killing intent arises, dragons and serpents emerge on land.
When humanity’s killing intent arises, Heaven and Earth reverse.
When Heaven and humanity’s killing intents converge, the foundation of all transformations is set.
Heaven’s killing intent is just retribution;

「Humanity’s killing intent is private passion. Dragons and serpents heed public justice and tremble;
Private passions in chaos, Heaven and Earth reverse.

When Heaven and humanity unite in public justice, then myriad transformations and changes,
all are fixed in their proper order.

**Commentary:**
Heaven contains the Five *qi* (vital energies), cyclically giving rise to life and death—
this is natural. Heaven’s Dao of life and death all conform to their proper occasions,
never acting arbitrarily. As yin and yang shift, eras pass, old gives way to new—
this too is Heaven’s killing intent, all of it just.

Riding Heaven’s killing intent—whether as dragon or serpent—
the hidden and obscure all rise upon the heights and valleys.
Following Heaven’s will and the times, acting freely in accordance,
this is to ride Heaven’s killing intent without losing its proper occasion.

As for humanity’s killing intent causing Heaven and Earth to reverse—
humans are children of the Five Phases, so they must conform to the Five *qi*’s life and death,
submit to yin and yang’s nurturing influence. How can they presume to stir life and death on their own?

Even in the world’s laws, those who kill are put to death,
those who kill living beings are punished—why? Because they act against Heaven’s ordained killing intent.
How can such people kill at will? It is said that humans must not act arbitrarily in killing intent.

As for traitorous ministers who rebel against proper order,
defy Heaven’s Dao, betray their sovereign and kin,
indulge in cruelty and wickedness,
harm the world, and recklessly slaughter—
their chaos is like turning Heaven into Earth or Earth into Heaven.
Such great disorder is treason; Heaven’s greatest calamity—
this is called *Heaven and Earth reverse*.

Here, the people’s resentment and the gods’ wrath converge,
Heaven prepares to punish them, and the people join in killing them—
all unite in their killing intent—
this is called *Heaven and humanity’s killing intents converge*,
the foundation of all transformations set.

Punishing rebels and quelling traitors,
following Heaven’s will in execution—
all align with Heaven’s proper killing intent.
When one adheres to the just Dao,
all things submit, none dare act recklessly—
this is called *fixed foundation*.

The Dao of ruler and subject is valued for its impartiality and rectitude.
If one can move and act in harmony with Heaven’s occasions,
respond to the times in accordance with Heaven’s Dao,
then humanity rests in peace, things find their proper place,
the Five Phases maintain their order, mountains and rivers preserve their spirits;
Above, moral virtue and power (*Dao* and *De*) are applied,
below, benevolence and righteousness are practiced—
disasters do not arise, calamities do not occur,
Heaven and humanity remain tranquil—
this is called *fixed foundation*.

Nature has its cleverness and clumsiness, which can be concealed.
Human cleverness and clumsiness must not be revealed;
Cultivate prudence in choosing what is good,
lest misfortune arise.

**Commentary:**
Humans possess innate cleverness, clumsiness, and wisdom—
both the wise and foolish share these traits.
Yet why do those with slight cleverness and eloquence
rush to display them, reckless of gain or loss,
and openly invite calamity? Because they cannot conceal themselves,
do not restrain their hearts with caution,
thus leading to their downfall.

Hence the *Dao De Jing* says:
*"Great eloquence seems taciturn, great cleverness seems clumsy."*
This speaks of concealment.
The *Yijing* says:
*"The ruler not concealed loses his subjects,
the subject not concealed loses his life,
matters not concealed invite harm."*
This is the same meaning.

Those who can conceal—
even if the sage and virtuous have cleverness, wisdom, eloquence,
and vast learning—
if their actions and stillness conform to proper occasions,
they need not be called clever. They can always conceal and hide,
both great and small, lest they be envied or slandered,
and thus invite blame.

Much less the foolish and clumsy,
who act impulsively, stirring without restraint,
do not conceal themselves—
they immediately invite disaster.
The sage cultivates the Dao and nurtures virtue,
so cleverness and clumsiness are concealed within body and mind.
Then inwardly, they observe their true nature,
outwardly, they avoid evil and licentiousness—
what is good, they practice; what is not good, they abandon,
refining their bodies and actions to become a *sage*,
so outsiders cannot know my innate cleverness or clumsiness.
All attribute my virtue to natural sageliness,
not knowing it is achieved through cultivation—
thus it is called *concealment*.

The nine orifices’ evils reside in the three essentials,
which can be stilled or stirred.
It is said that when a person’s nine orifices are all evil,
they can all give rise to illness—
but the most urgent evils of calamity and fortune lie in the three essentials:
ears, eyes, and mouth. Thus, one must guard them carefully,
lest disaster strike.

**Commentary:**
The *Nanhua* (Zhuangzi) says:
*"Humans have a hundred limbs, nine orifices, five viscera—
body them and preserve them. Humans receive the Five *qi* and take form,
with heads round and feet square, four limbs and five viscera,
three *hun* (spirits) and seven *po* (ethereal souls),
alternately giving rise to evil and rectitude,
mutually serving as sovereign and subject within the body.
The movement of the nine orifices—
evil and rectitude, calamity and fortune—
are most urgent in the three essentials:
ears, eyes, and mouth.
Thus the *Dao De Jing* says:
*"Five colors blind the eyes, five sounds deaf the ears,
five flavors dull the mouth."*
The virtuous do not let their eyes see evil colors,
their ears hear evil sounds,
or their mouths speak of evil matters—
thus when proper matters arise, they see, hear, and speak accordingly—
this is called *stirring*.
When encountering evil and falsehood,
they do not let their hearts see, hear, or speak—
this is called *stillness*.
Master Kong (Confucius) said:
*"Choose what is good and follow it—this is called stirring;
choose what is not good and abandon it—this is called stillness."*
The *Xiaojing* (Classic of Filial Piety) says:
*"In speech, fill the world without excess—
in conduct, fill the world without resentment or evil—
this is because the body and mind are stilled and rectified, without evil,
thus attaining this state."*
But when encountering good, one stirs;
when encountering evil, one stills—
thus the body remains free of calamity,
all through guarding the ears, eyes, and mouth with caution.
Hence it is said:
*"Resides in the three essentials—
can be stilled, can be stirred."*

Fire arises from wood, calamity strikes and it is subdued.
Evil arises in the realm, and when it stirs, it collapses.
Knowing this and refining oneself—
this is called a *sage*.
The metaphor of *delinquent fire* refers to human nature,
*wood-realm* refers to the human body.
This teaches one to govern the realm and preserve the body,
so that delinquent fire does not arise—
then refine the body and actions to become a *sage.*」

The *Commentary* states:

This passage elaborates on the Sage’s intent in employing these metaphors. To reinforce the nine evils and three essentials of stirring and stillness from the preceding text, it urges constant vigilance, lest one fail to exhaustively grasp principle and refine nature. Thus, it invokes the metaphors of fire within wood and treacherous ministers within the realm to earnestly exhort cultivation toward sainthood.

Wood containing fire symbolizes the human heart harboring evil nature—five poisons’ flames. The *Grand Duke’s Commentary* states: Guangchengzi held that accumulated fire consumes the five poisons, thus knowing fire as the fierce *qi* of flame. The *Book of Documents* says: *"Fire blazes upon Kun Mountain, reducing jade and stone to ash."* Wood concealing fire must not be pierced—once ignited, the wood burns. Likewise, if one neglects the evil poisons within the body and indulges them, all virtues perish, and the self collapses.

When treachery arises in a realm, it inevitably crumbles when stirred. For any nation, there exist treacherous ministers and traitors, harboring malevolent designs to usurp power, seeking wealth and honor—such schemes abound, concealed within the state, unknown to the ruler. Yet if the sovereign embodies virtue and ministers remain loyal, the land thrives in harmony, and the world knows peace. Treacherous men, though harboring such intentions, dare not act without opportunity. But when the ruler’s Dao falters, ministerial loyalty decays; wars, floods, droughts, and locusts ravage the land; taxes grow oppressive; the people’s hearts turn rebellious, resenting their sovereign. In such times, all things harbor disorder—how much more so those already harboring treachery? When chaos reigns, all deceits erupt, and how could the realm not collapse?

This metaphor extends to the nine orifices and three essentials—skillful or clumsy, stirring or still. It teaches that if one possesses virtue and wisdom, hidden within body and mind, no evil or impurity can arise. But if evil erupts unchecked, the self dissolves. Thus, the metaphor of treacherous fire concealed in wood/realm illustrates the duality of evil and rectitude within body and mind.

Only the wise and sagely comprehend this text, penetrating its depths, awakening to the Dao’s essence, purging vice and preserving virtue—this is the knowing and refining that yields sainthood.

Hence it is said:
*"Above, there exists the Dao of the Immortal Embracing Unity—
Yellow Emperor attained it to ascend to the Cloudy Heights,
Tang and Wu obtained it to rule the world."*

The *Nüwa of Mount Li* states:
*"The Sage studies the Dao and attains its Way,
harmonizing with Heaven’s timing,
nurturing virtue within,
trusting the worthy without—
knowing and refining to become a Sage,
thus ascending to the Cloudy Heights, as Yellow Emperor did."*

The *Adept* studies the Dao and grasps its method,
aligning with the five phases’ rectitude,
neither defying Heaven’s timing nor Earth’s order,
sparing neither wealth nor life,
enriching the realm and securing the people—
thus attaining the method, the virtuous ruler, as Yao and Shun did.*

The *Wise* studies the Dao and masters its technique,
employing Heaven’s Way and Earth’s resources,
disciplining the body and moderating desires to honor parents,
upholding *ren*, *yi*, *li*, *zhi*, *xin*,
loyalty, filial piety, and reverence for kin,
remaining steadfast in integrity and modesty,
preserving one’s rank and blessings—
thus attaining the technique, as the virtuous ministers Qiu and Yi did.*

The *Petty* studies the Dao and reaps its calamity,
perverting Heaven’s *qi* and failing to cultivate virtue,
exploiting cunning, eloquence, and deceit,
engaging in ceaseless night-and-day rebellion,
waging wanton wars,
concocting plots to slaughter and harm,
pursuing fleeting luxury and plunder,
though briefly wealthy and honored,
they heed not the impending ruin,
inviting their own and their descendants’ destruction—
this is reaping the calamity, as Lu Shan and Shi Ming did.*

The *Sage-Mother* further declares:
*"This text is profound, vast as the morning tide of the great sea,
encompassing myriad phenomena, its mysteries divine.
This is the chapter of the Immortal Embracing Unity,
one hundred and five words,
illuminating the Dao of yin and yang,
discerning the logic of rise and fall,
activating its mechanisms with precision—
thus refining body and conduct to become a Sage."*

Hence it is said:
*"Above, there exists the Dao of the Immortal Embracing Unity."*

The *Praise* reads:
*"Heaven’s Dao responds to the times,
yin and yang, most divine.
Discern its essentials,
life and death rest in the self.
The enlightened act rightly,
the deluded stray from truth.
Knowing and refining—
this is called a Sage."*

**Rich Nation, Peaceful People: The Doctrine of Theft**

Heaven and Earth, the thieves of all things.
Heaven covers, Earth bears—all things grow in secret,
Qi surging unseen—thus they are called thieves.

*Commentary:* Heaven and Earth are yin and yang.
Yin and yang, extending to the Five Phases,
Together form the Seven Qi—
Beyond this, how could there be greater confusion?
For all things—whether born from egg, womb, or dampness—
Grains, grasses, and trees all draw upon these Seven Qi to grow,
From formless to formed, nurtured unseen until their bodies take shape—
Like thieves in the night, unaware and unknowing.

Heaven and Earth secretly respond with their Qi in endless interplay,
While all things silently accept their nurture, each finding its place of ease.
Thus it is said: *Heaven and Earth, the thieves of all things.*

All things are thieves of humanity;
All things steal from Heaven to sustain life,
While humanity steals from all things to nourish itself.
If one knows the proper balance of giving and taking,
This too is the natural order.

*Commentary:* Humanity and beasts, grasses, and trees all draw from yin and yang to live,
But humanity is the most refined—
Dwelling in the central palace of the cosmos,
With wisdom and discernment to reflect upon its nature,
To fathom origins and understand the fundamental Qi of yin, yang, and the Five Phases,
Then to model its actions accordingly.
Thus the *Zhou Yi*’s sixty-four hexagrams and sixty jia-zi cycles.

Therefore, the earlier text says: *To see this is to flourish.*
Within the Seven Qi, all things that form and grow,
Humanity secretly takes to sustain itself—
Thus, theft refers to fields, silkworms, and grains.
The *Liezi* says:
*A certain Guoshi of Qi was wealthy and declared,*
*"I excel at theft! Heaven has its seasons, Earth its advantages—
I steal the timely bounty of Heaven and Earth.
When rains moisten the earth, I steal from beasts on land,
From fish and turtles in water.
I began as a thief—
In one year, I was self-sufficient;
In two, I had abundance;
In three, I could bestow upon the realm.
Since then, my wealth extended to the common folk.
I stole from Heaven and Earth without misfortune.
But if a man steals gold and silk from another—
How can he be blameless?"*

All things steal from Heaven and Earth to grow,
Guoshi stole from all things to sustain himself—
Yet if one knows the proper balance,
This too is the natural order.
Thus, the theft of all things and humanity.

Humanity, the thief of all things.
When the three thefts align in harmony,
The Three Powers flourish in peace.
*Ji* means "exhausted"—
When the three thefts exhaust their proper balance,
The Three Powers exhaust their duties in harmony.

*Commentary:* It is said that humanity steals from all things to fill its wealth and rank,
Yet it does not realize that all things, in turn, steal from humanity to bring misfortune.
The three mutual thefts spoken of earlier—
This too is the natural order.
All such theft must follow the Dao;
If in accord, it brings fortune;
If contrary, it brings calamity.
Thus the *Liezi* asks: *Is there a Dao of theft?*
Why should it be without principle?
To see hidden treasures—*this is sageliness;*
To know what is permissible—*this is wisdom;*
To enter first—*this is courage;*
To depart last—*this is righteousness;*
To divide fairly—*this is benevolence.*
No thief without these five virtues exists.
This is the Dao within theft.

In the three thefts, each must follow its principle,
So that the Three Powers act without error,
Their duties fulfilled without exceeding their nature,
Lest misfortune arise.
Thus it is said:
*Eat in season, and the body remains unharmed.*
*Stir the mechanisms, and all transformations are at peace.*
If humanity’s nourishment is timely,
The body knows no fault;
If actions align with their proper function,
All things find their ease.

*Commentary:* Those who govern life and fate
Must first attend to flavors and nourishment.
Thus the *Zuozhuan* says:
*"Flavor and the Dao’s Qi—
Qi fills the will, nourishes the form, and moistens the spirit—
All must return to food and drink."*
The Yellow Emperor said:
*"When humanity consumes food and drink,
It must first balance the five flavors, five meats, five vegetables, five fruits,
All adjusted to the seasons and taken in proper measure.
Cooked, they benefit the body;
Raw, they harm the organs—
This is the meaning of eating in season.*
Thus, if food is consumed at the proper time,
If flavors do not exceed their due,
If one remains within the middle path,
Neither transgressing nor harming nature,
Then the four limbs move freely,
The five organs remain in harmony,
Free of illness, preserving life to its end—
Is this not the body’s ease?"

Thus the *Kangzangzi* says:
*"Eat abundantly in winter, and the body stays warm;
Eat abundantly in summer, and the body stays cool.
If warmth and coolness align with the seasons,
Then humanity knows no sickness or plague,
And lives out its natural span.*
Thus it is said:
*Grains are humanity’s Heaven—
The reason kings prioritize agriculture;
If a king neglects agriculture, he abandons his people.
If the people are abandoned, what kingdom remains?"*

Yet when the three thefts align in harmony,
And the Three Powers fulfill their duties in peace,
This too is the natural order.
Then, a wise ruler and virtuous ministers must govern the world,
Riding the moment when harmony and peace prevail—
With just laws, employing the capable,
Extending benevolence to insects,
Transforming even grasses and trees,
So that every action conforms to Heaven’s mechanisms,
And yin and yang follow their course,
Bringing universal tranquility,
Ensuring all people find their ease.
This is to *stir the mechanisms and bring all transformations to peace*—
Thus it is said: *Within lies the law of enriching the nation and pacifying the people.*

Humanity knows its spirit as spirit,
Yet does not know that the unknowable is what makes it spirit.
Yin and yang generate all things—humanity calls this spirit;
Yet it does not know that the Ultimate Dao,
Silent and still, is what generates them—
Yin and yang are the true spirit.

*Commentary:* Spirit is subtle and unfathomable.
The *Yi* says: *Yin and yang, when unfathomable, are called spirit.*
Humanity sees all things born from yin, yang, and the sun and moon,
And calls this spirit—
Yet it does not realize that yin, yang, sun, and moon
Themselves arise from the unmanifest.

What is this "not-spirit"?
It is the Ultimate Dao.
The Ultimate Dao is empty and tranquil,
Silent and still, yet not-spirit—
Within this "not-spirit" arise sun and moon,
Yin and yang, the Three Sovereigns, and all things,
Nurturing growth and securing ease and comfort,
All emerging from the Ultimate Dao’s empty tranquility—
This is the "not-spirit" yet containing spirit,
The principle now made clear.

The sun and moon have their appointed cycles,
The great and small have their fixed measures.
From this arises the sacred function,
And from this emerges the divine luminosity.
When the sun and moon revolve without deviation in their cycles,
And the great and small maintain their fixed measures,
Then the sacred function’s power is revealed,
And the divine luminosity’s work manifests.

*Commentary:* The sun and moon are the essence of yin and yang.
Within the Six Extremes, they are the Ultimate Dao.
The cycles of the sun and moon,
The fixed measures of the great and small in calendars and regulations,
All have their appointed divisions,
Revolving without deviation—
Thus it is said: *"The sun and moon have their appointed cycles, the great and small have their fixed measures."*
The sacred function arises within the Six Extremes,
Relying on the sun and moon’s illumination,
And the interplay of yin and yang,
To generate all things—
Plants and animals, each with their movements,
Their power subtly profound, reaching even to the sacred.
Thus it is said: *"The sacred function arises from this."*
The divine luminosity emerges from this:
Yin and yang, unfathomable, are called spirit;
The sun and moon, clear and luminous, are called luminosity—
Thus it is said: *"The divine luminosity."*
All things in the world,
Great and small, arise from the sacred function and divine luminosity—
From non-being to being, their functions and uses clearly manifest—
Thus it is said: *"The divine luminosity emerges from this."*
Moreover, all things in the world,
Great and small, receive this sacred function and thus exist.
The great does not covet the small,
The small does not slight the great—
Thus *Zhuangzi* says: *"The great and small each find ease in their own way, without envy or reproach,"*
This is the meaning of *"the great and small have their fixed measures."*
From the highest nobles to the lowest commoners,
Each has their appointed fate,
Without mutual encroachment or usurpation—
Above and below in harmony,
Years of abundant harvests and prosperous seasons,
This is called the Great Peace.
Thus it is said: *"Within lies the law of enriching the nation and pacifying the people."*

As for *stealing the mechanisms*,
No one in the world can see them,
No one can know them.
The virtuous who obtain them secure their bodies,
The petty who obtain them risk their lives.
Stealing the mechanisms is profound and subtle,
Easy to see yet difficult to know.
The virtuous understand the mechanisms of accumulating virtue,
Thus securing their bodies;
The petty grasp the mechanisms of honor and disgrace,
Thus risking their lives.

*Commentary:* Stealing the mechanisms refers again to the three thieves from earlier.
If a kingdom or family steals from Heaven to gain wealth,
All see the mechanisms of sowing and reaping,
Yet none know the profound principles behind their gains.
Why is it called *stealing the mechanisms*?
Because they take from where there was none before,
And exploit where there was abundance before—
In secret they contrive schemes,
Moving the mechanisms without awareness,
Unknowingly plundering what is to come,
To enrich themselves—
This is called *stealing the mechanisms*.
It is said that all under Heaven see this stealing,
Yet none can know its profound principles.
Among the wise, the petty, and the virtuous,
Their perceptions differ—
The virtuous know the mechanisms of securing their bodies,
The petty know the mechanisms of risking their lives.
The mechanisms of securing the body:
The virtuous know that within the Ultimate Dao lies all virtue,
And whatever they seek will surely be attained—
Like echoes answering calls.
They merely set forth their virtuous schemes,
Silently cultivate their practices,
Activating the habit of virtue,
In harmony with the Dao—
Thus they achieve *guard-one and ponder*,
Concentrating their essence and refining their nature,
Stealing the profound mysteries to nourish their lives,
Or stealing *spirit-water, flower-pools, jade-essence, golden elixirs*
To attain immortality.
The worthy and virtuous, knowing these subtle mechanisms,
Cultivate and refine to become sages.
Thus it is said: *"The virtuous who obtain them secure their bodies."*

The petty who obtain them risk their lives:
They only seek to amass gold and silk,
Spurning no labor.
Or they cultivate talents, skills, and martial arts,
Without regard for exhaustion,
Adorning their cleverness and cunning to seize the mechanisms of worldly glory;
Or they revel in honor and favor,
Or in military defeat and ruin,
Their greed harming themselves;
Or they indulge in wealth and lust,
Though they gain fleeting glory,
They inevitably incur calamity and blame.
It is because they do not know the subtle mechanisms of the Dao,
And instead rely on these.
Thus it is said: *"The petty who obtain them risk their lives."*

Within this chapter on *enacting the laws of enriching the nation and pacifying the people*,
All ninety-two words instruct people in taking and discarding according to their mechanisms,
In discerning the divine luminosity of the Dao,
And in securing their bodies and nurturing their lives through its profound principles.
Thus it is said: *"Within lies the law of enriching the nation and pacifying the people."*

*Praise:*
Heaven and Earth, all things,
Yin and yang, the four seasons.
Mutually stealing from each other,
Precious in aligning with Heaven’s mechanisms.
The sacred function and divine luminosity,
Only the worthy can know.
Securing the body or risking the life—
Carefully examine their suitability.

*Conclusion of the Second Scroll of the Yellow Emperor’s Yinshu Commentary*
*Beginning of the Third Scroll of the Yellow Emperor’s Yinshu Commentary*

「Li Qin’s Commentary on *Yinshu* from Shaoshan:
**Chapter on the Dao of Military Strength and Victory**

The blind excel in hearing, the deaf excel in sight.
Cut off one source of profit, and the use of troops becomes tenfold advantageous;
Threefold reflection day and night, and the use of troops becomes ten thousandfold advantageous.

*Cutting off profit* means:
Seal the ears to see clearly, close the eyes to hear keenly,
Strive to keep body and mind unperturbed, and focus the mind on affairs with precision.

The commentary says:
When a man’s eyes are greedy for color, his ears fail to hear the true sound;
When his ears indulge in lewd music, his eyes cannot behold the proper hue—
For sight and hearing are both governed by the mind.

The virtuous Daoist’s mind is free from deceit,
Though his ears and eyes perceive myriad sounds and hues,
His mind remains steadfast and pure,
Unshaken by love, desire, or avarice—
Equal to one without ears or eyes,
Why must he be blind or deaf?

Only when the mind harbors rectitude,
Do ears and eyes remain untainted;
When ears and eyes are untainted,
Do body and mind remain unperturbed;
When body and mind are unperturbed,
Do all actions, thoughts, and strategies align with Heaven’s Dao.

Compared to the common man, this yields tenfold advantage.
All undertakings succeed—
Why must one rely solely on military strength?

Others follow this principle likewise.
Threefold reflection day and night makes military strength ten thousandfold advantageous,
For the virtuous Daoist’s body and mind are steadfast,
His ears and eyes are sharp,
His actions and strategies tenfold more effective than the ordinary.
Within this, if he further practices threefold deliberation,
Day and night with unwavering focus,
His actions and strategies become ten thousandfold more potent—
Why must he rely solely on military strength?

*The Analects* states:
“Think thrice before acting; twice, and it may be acceptable.”
This urges the mind to be meticulous and discerning—
Such is its meaning.

What is meant by *troops* is *arms*.
*Arms* are instruments of slaughter,
*War* is a perilous affair.
When stationed in lands of conflict or amid crises of life and death,
One must reflect threefold and deliberate deeply,
Plan with foresight and strategy—
If he is negligent in counsel, reckless in advance or retreat,
He will surely meet defeat.

Thus, this teaching of sealing the ears and eyes,
And of threefold reflection,
Is likened to military strength
To compel one to refine his body through cultivation,
Not to truly wield troops.

The virtuous Daoist detests evil as a sworn enemy,
Understanding the source of *cutting off profit*
And the principle of *threefold reflection*,
He remains profound, cautious, and unyielding,
His nature aligned with rectitude, his dwelling steadfast,
Rooting out the wicked and the sycophant—
Thus securing his own life for long.
In time, this becomes the Dao,
As when the Yellow Emperor subdued *Chiyou*.

Even great generals of past and present—
Sunzi, Wuqi, Han Xin, Bai Qi, Zhuge Liang, and Wei Gong—
All excelled in military strategy,
Mastering threefold reflection day and night,
Achieving success and establishing their names with honor.
Yet they still considered military strength and victory
As means to *lighten the burden of life*,
Forcing one to risk his fate—
As the Yellow Emperor did when ascending to the Cloudy Heights,
And *Fuyue* did when dwelling in the *Xuanxiao* abyss.

Hence the earlier text says:
“The noble attains security in his person; the petty man risks his life.”

The mind arises from things, perishes from things; the key lies in the eyes.
When the mind is greedy for things, it shortens one’s lifespan;
When the eyes gaze without restraint, the will becomes dissipated.
But if one guards the eyes and restrains the mind,
There will be no calamity or ruin.

The commentary says:
The virtuous Daoist’s mind does not give rise to falsehood,
His faculties do not move erratically,
Yet he attends to all things.
But those who indulge in excess,
Taking all things to nourish their bodies and sustain their lives,
Also follow nature’s way—
Yet they must not overstep their bounds or act contrary to propriety,
Or they will harm their own nature.

Hence *Gang Cangzi* says:
“If ten thousand men each draw a bow,
And shoot at a single target,
No arrow will miss.”
The target is a *mound*—
Or it is said: the target is the *arrowman*.
All things are clearly visible,
Yet they harm but one life—
A life that will surely be injured,
For the sake of nourishing its nature and sustaining its vitality.

In this age, the deluded take nature to nourish things,
Unknowing how to rest and preserve themselves.
This speaks of how the mind, once greedy,
Is stolen by things,
Bringing ruin and disaster to man.

*The Family Sayings* states:
“Those who indulge without restraint,
Who seek without end,
Shall be punished with death.”

*The Laozi* says:
“Knowing contentment brings no disgrace,
Knowing when to stop brings no peril.
This is the way to endure.”

Thus, the precious lesson is *knowing contentment*.
Moderation in all things,
Not straining the mind with avarice for external gain,
Or harming one’s true nature—
This is the path that does not injure.

Hence *Liuzi* says:
“The meaning of nurturing birds in a firewood grove,
And fish in a warm spring—
Is to live by things, yet perish by things.”

*Key lies in the eyes* means:
When one’s movements give rise to falsehood,
When the mind is drawn to things—
All originate from self-perception.
Thus it is said: *Key lies in the eyes*—
Command one to be vigilant in guarding them,
Not to gaze upon lewd or licentious hues,
So that the mind does not generate false movements toward things,
And thus his nature remains unharmed,
Securing his lifespan and preserving his person.

Heaven’s nature is without favor yet great favor is born;
Heaven and Earth give birth yet do not possess,
They act yet do not claim,
Nourishing all things without seeking repayment—
Yet all things, moved by their shelter and sustenance,
Generate favor in return.

*End of the Third Scroll of Li Qin’s Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s Yinshu*」

「The *Commentary* states: Heaven and Earth, along with all ten thousand things, are naturally possessed. These are all nurtured by the supreme **Dao/Way**, which does not seek favor or repayment from all things. Instead, all things, receiving Heaven’s shelter and sustenance, naturally harbor gratitude toward Heaven. Hence, *Laozi* says: *"Give birth yet do not possess; act yet do not claim; nourish yet do not slaughter."* When thunder crashes and winds rage, all tremble in fear. Thunder and wind arise from the movement of yin and yang; people naturally feel dread, and thus they tremble and are startled.

The *Commentary* states: **Thunder** is the sound of yin and yang clashing violently; **wind** is what *Zhuangzi* calls: *"The Great Mass exhales **qi**—its name is wind."* All such winds and thunders are inherent to yin and yang, originally not meant to threaten humans, yet humans fear them, trembling and moving in response, filled with awe.

This describes the **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** of the sage-ruler, who nurtures all living beings, mirroring Heaven and Earth’s lack of partiality. Thus, the land, the people, birds and beasts, plants and trees all spontaneously return their gratitude to the ruler, revering him as Heaven itself, each abiding by their station and prospering in their endeavors, all in perfect ease.

A wise ruler merely implements just decrees, establishing the national order. When the people witness his authority, like the crashing thunder and raging winds, they tremble and are filled with fear, each self-alert and cautious in their conduct. Thus, in governing armies, generals become bold and soldiers strong, with the ruler inspiring fear below and commanding awe above, ensuring the suppression of tyranny and the pacification of chaos. Hence it is said: *"There lies below the means to forge strong armies and conquer foes."*

**Extreme joy** is a surplus of nature’s ease; **extreme stillness** brings forth **virtue/power**. When one upholds the utmost **virtue/power** of stillness and joy, the heart knows no fear or dread; when one’s emotions embrace delight and ease, there is boundless **adventure** and freedom.

The *Commentary* states: **Extreme joy** is not the frivolous music and revelry of strings and pipes. If one sought such pleasures, there would be no surplus. Hence, *The Family Sayings* say: *"Extreme joy is silent, yet all under Heaven find peace."* *The Three Strategies* say: *"A **Dao/Way**-governed ruler governs through joy."* This means that the virtuous sage, with a tranquil mind and rectified nature, does not deceive the world nor yield to temporal trends, ruling the state and securing the home without wanton punishments or excessive penalties, never transgressing the national order. The sage’s person remains unblemished, with no cause for fear or dread, and thus the heart naturally overflows with delight, emotions serene and at ease, with **adventure** and freedom in abundance. How could such **extreme joy** be compared to the fleeting pleasures of strings and pipes?

As for the ancients, they played the zither while gathering fallen grains, sang as they walked while awaiting their fate—hence it is said: *"**Extreme joy** is a surplus of nature’s ease."* In **extreme stillness**, one who upholds **virtue/power** does not indulge in the vulgarities of the petty man, nor in the licentious pleasures of strings and pipes. Instead, they preserve their own fearless and carefree delight. Thus, they are not swayed by sounds and colors, maintaining a still nature, serene emotions, a steadfast spirit, and resolute **virtue/power**.

Gāng Cāngzǐ says: *"Nobility brings harmony in speech; wealth brings harmony in the body; poverty brings harmony in thought; stillness brings harmony in the spirit."* These four harmonies stem from a single principle, hence they are called **extreme joy** and **extreme stillness**. When a person attains **extreme stillness**, they can achieve harmony of the spirit, which is why it is said: *"**Extreme stillness** brings forth **virtue/power**."*

The nature of a military commander must uphold **virtue/power** and stillness, suppressing clamor and disorder. Rewards and punishments must be precise and just; father and son serve as one in the army, their hearts filled with joy, their spirits overflowing with vigor. Yet they can crush the wicked and vanquish enemies, their achievements certain to flourish. Hence it is said: *"There lies below the means to forge strong armies and conquer foes."*

For the commander who dwells in the balance of spirit and stillness—what is called *guarding the center*—the six passions are untainted, and the two **qi** currents remain constant. Heaven’s utmost **privacy** manifests in its utmost **publicity**. The **Dao/Way** of Heaven is profound and elusive, beyond measure or scrutiny—this is its **privacy**. Yet all things are born and formed, their sacred functions evident and clear—this is its **publicity**.

The *Commentary* states: Heaven is the supreme **Dao/Way**. The supreme **Dao/Way** encompasses all classes of existence, its depths unfathomable and formless, beyond scrutiny—this is called **privacy**. Privacy refers to that which is hidden and concealed. Within the boundless void, it applies itself infinitely, giving birth to all things, each with their own form and name as they arise. This is the utmost **publicity**. Publicity means clarity and evident function, observable by all.

This describes the **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** of the sage-ruler: their wisdom and foresight are vast, encompassing all affairs. Their strategies are both subtle and direct, their judgments both cunning and straightforward, all concealed within their profound mind, beyond human perception—this is **privacy**. Yet when they act, observing good and evil, discerning right and wrong, issuing decrees, and meting rewards and punishments, their actions are clear and evident, serving as a model for all under Heaven—this is **publicity**. Hence it is said: *"Heaven’s utmost **privacy** manifests in its utmost **publicity**."*

The nature of a military commander, when they apply this principle with secrecy and cunning, making their schemes difficult to discern, and their rewards and punishments evident like thunder and wind, ensures that the leader remains pure while the soldiers are upright. Generals become bold and soldiers strong, crushing enemies and vanquishing the wicked, their achievements grand and flourishing. Hence it is said: *"There lies below the means to forge strong armies and conquer foes."*

The method of birds lies in their **qi**. The **peng** bird soars to nine heavens, gathering **qi** to ascend; the **tiáo** and **jiū** birds flap their wings and rise swiftly. All can control their **qi**, moving forward and backward with freedom.

The *Commentary* states: Birds are the feathered and transformed creatures of the ten thousand things. **Qi** is the vital **qi** of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang. Human movement relies on hands and feet for advancement and retreat; birds rely on wings and feathers to agitate their **qi**. When the mind moves, the wings beat, and there is no place they cannot reach—ascending and descending as they will. How much more so for humans, the most refined of beings, who cannot even properly harness the **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** of Heaven’s **qi**? They should instead cultivate their bodies and nourish their lives to achieve longevity and eternal vision.

If humans could master the **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** of **moral qi**, they would wander effortlessly through the boundless **Great Void (Tàixū)**, surpassing even birds. For a military commander who skillfully employs the **qi** of the Five Phases in their cycles of flourishing and decline, and understands the sources of yin and yang’s control and subjugation, crushing the wicked and vanquishing enemies would be no challenge at all. Hence it is said: *"There lies below the means to forge strong armies and conquer foes."*

**Life** is the root of **death**;」

「**Death** is the root of **Life**#1; the foolish cling to things and covet **Life**, thus hastening their own **death** by defying its natural principles. The virtuous sacrifice themselves to seek the **Dao/Way**, and those who grasp its subtlest **virtue/power** preserve their bodies without perishing. The *Cūshu* explains: This speaks of how mortals in this world, greedy for **Life** and loathing **Death**, indulge their own bodies excessively, fearing annihilation.

To nurture **Life** and body, one must depend on food, drink, clothing, and shelter—these too are the natural principles of Heaven. Hence *Zhuangzi* says: *"Till the soil and eat; weave and wear."* Their **virtue/power** does not stray. To weave and wear, to till and eat—this is called **harmony of virtue/power**.

Thus it is known that **Life** must rely on the nourishment of clothing and food. Yet moderation and frugality bring fortune, while excess and indulgence invite calamity and harm **Life** itself. Even the ancients, dwelling in nests and caves, with simple and pure natures, knew nothing of longevity or brevity, following only the natural course and wandering at ease, their years long and enduring.

In later generations, the true **Dao/Way** was lost, superficiality arose, and palaces were grandly built with ornate dwellings, silken garments, and rich delicacies. They overindulged in luxuries, fearing their bodies might not thrive, yet they failed to realize that over-nurturing exhausts the mind, harms the thoughts, and in truth invites disaster—the very foundation of hastening **Death**. Hence it is said: **"Life** is the root of **Death**, and **Death** is the root of **Life**."

Yet the **Dao/Way**-virtuous cultivate **Life** by self-sacrifice and ceasing toil, seeking the art of longevity. Some may dine on mist and wear **qi**, abstaining from grains and food, their hearts like cold ashes, their bodies withered as dry wood. To the world, they appear as symbols of **Death**, yet they truly grasp the foundation of **Life**. Hence it is said: **"Death** is the root of **Life**."

For a military commander who understands that **Life** is but **Death** in waiting, and that **Death** can bring forth **Life**, they can safeguard their troops and preserve the multitude, becoming a great general. Hence the military arts say: *"Drive the army to the brink of **Death** and bring it back to **Life**."* This is the method of strong armies and victory in battle.

*Zhuangzi* says: *"Life and death are simultaneous; death and life are simultaneous."* **Grace** arises from **harm**; **harm** arises from **grace**. The **Dao/Way**-virtuous strive for good and feel **grace**, thus **grace** arises from **harm**; the petty betray **grace** and invite **harm**, thus **harm** arises from **grace**. The *Cūshu* explains: This speaks of how human hearts incline or turn away, with **grace** and **harm** mutually generated.

In truth, there is neither **harm** nor **grace** inherently. When one rescues from **harm**, **grace** emerges—thus **grace** arises from **harm**. Even when the **Dao/Way**-virtuous face minor misfortunes, and others save them, they hold **grace** in their hearts and feel gratitude, never forgetting it in their lifetimes—this is **grace** arising from **harm**.

Yet when the petty receive the **grace** of the **Dao/Way**-virtuous and enjoy honor and wealth, failing to guard it with caution from beginning to end, they rely on favor but lose their standing, fall into legal ruin, and unaware of their own faults, breed resentment and **harm**—this is called **harm** arising from **grace**.

The **Dao/Way**-virtuous, moved by Heaven and Earth’s nurturing **grace**, do not betray the **virtue/power** of the **Dao/Way**’s creation. They cultivate goodness and rectify their conduct, returning to simplicity and the origin, thus no **harm** can arise from **grace**, nor can **grace** emerge from **harm**. They do not let **grace** and **harm** disrupt their nature, but uphold stillness and silence to generate purity and harmony.

As for those who let **grace** and **harm** cycle endlessly, and whose favor and disgrace alternate ceaselessly, these are the petty’s ways.

For a military commander, they bear no debt to the imperial **grace**, do not grow arrogant from honor or favor, and guard their virtue with the same care from beginning to end. They preserve the **grace** of their virtue, exhaust all efforts in loyalty, achieve success and establish deeds—thus **grace** cannot arise from **harm**, nor can **harm** emerge from **grace**. When they govern with **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**, they march with purpose but do not wage war—how splendid!

Hence it is said: *"There lies below the means of strong armies and victory in battle."* The foolish take Heaven and Earth’s patterns and principles as divine omens, while I see the patterns and principles of the times and things as profound wisdom. The foolish, seeing stars falling or solar halos, winds and rains, thunder and lightning, floods and droughts, locust plagues, grow anxious and fearful, yet they fail to recognize that the **virtue/power** of ruler and subject is harmonious, and the governance pure and balanced.

They pacify the common folk, turning calamity into fortune, and through this wisdom of the times and things, only the **Dao/Way**-virtuous and I know it. Hence Heaven and Earth hang the sun and moon to illuminate good and evil, and array the constellations to show auspicious and inauspicious signs—all are the natural principles of **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**.

The foolish gaze upward at the three luminaries, observe the changes in celestial patterns, witness the wrath of thunder and lightning, or note the irregularity of cold and heat, or floods and droughts, or insect plagues, fearing disaster may strike them, and thus harbor endless dread. The foolish mistake these for Heaven and Earth’s patterns and principles.

The patterns and principles of the times and things are only this: when the ruler maintains purity and stillness, and the ministers exhibit loyalty and integrity, the magpies do not caw in discord, the frontier beacons are not falsely lit, the common folk live in peace, and the world is tranquil. Even if Heaven and Earth display omens of calamity, they cannot prevail.

The **Dao/Way**-virtuous and I know this as the patterns and principles of the times and things. Hence *Jiāyǔ* says: *"In the time of Shang’s King Tàiwù, the **Dao/Way** was lost and governance corrupt, so the disaster of the wild mulberry appeared in the court—it grew seven days into a great arch. The diviner said: ‘The wild mulberry is a forest tree; it should grow in the suburbs. Now it grows in the court, the state will perish.’ King Tàiwù, fearful, turned to cultivating **virtue/power**, pondering the governance of ruler and subject, clarifying the way to nurture people. Three years later, distant lands admired his righteousness, and sixteen states came bearing tribute. Thus the wild mulberry could not bring disaster."*

The Master said: *"The fate of survival or ruin, of fortune or misfortune, all lies within oneself. Heaven’s calamities and Earth’s portents cannot impose upon it."* Thus, portents of disaster cannot overcome virtuous governance, and strange dreams cannot overcome righteous conduct.

Even when Yao faced the great flood for nine years, and Tang endured a great drought for seven years, the common folk lived in peace and none suffered hunger—why? Because the rulers followed the **Dao/Way**, their governance was balanced and harmonious, their word trusted and their ministers loyal, and the people revered them above. Though there were floods and droughts, they could not bring disaster.

Floods and droughts are Heaven and Earth. Patterns and principles are the times and things. If one understands the principles of the times and things, they can all turn calamity into fortune and transform **Death** into **Life**.»

Thus it is said: *"I understand the patterns and principles of the times and things."*

For the essence of a military strategist lies in omens such as the five-colored sun, stars flowing in the four cardinal directions, monstrous beasts charging the encampment, and wild birds entering dwellings—these are Heaven and Earth’s patterns and principles revealing disaster or blessing. Yet if one refines governance, devises strategies, and attends to the welfare of the troops, turning calamity into fortune, what enemy could dare resist? This is the mastery of the times and things’ patterns and principles.

Thus it is said: *"Below, there are the arts of strong arms and victory in battle."*

The following hundred and thirteen words all urge deep contemplation and quiet reflection, so that harm and benefit do not arise, and one discerns survival and ruin. They reveal public and private, hidden and manifest, opening the way to affairs and observing Heaven’s signs and the times.

Thus it is said: *"Below, there are the arts of strong arms and victory in battle."*

The praise reads:
*"Cutting off the source of profit, pondering three times over.
Following the mechanisms of things, life and death are before one’s eyes.
Joy arises from tranquility, while kindness breeds cruelty.
Heaven and Earth’s disasters and blessings are the principles of the times for fortune.
The Dao/Way of Nature is still, hence Heaven and Earth and all things are born.
The Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth is gradual, hence yin and yang prevail.
The Sage says: The Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth is subtle and gradual, yet only the victorious understand it.
Yin and yang push against each other, and their transformations proceed in harmony.
The Sage says: When yin and yang push each other, their激至於自化—does this lie in the eyes?
Thus, the Sage knows that Nature cannot be forced, yet one must govern it accordingly.
The Sage says: Profound! Excellent! The common folk see it as Nature, the heroes as governance, and the foolish as transformation.

The Dao/Way of utter stillness cannot be measured by calendars or astronomical laws—
Even birds and beasts embody this.
The Sage says: The stillness of birds and beasts cannot be calculated by calendars.
From this arise wondrous instruments, giving birth to all phenomena.
The Eight Trigrams and the Heavenly Stems-Earthly Branches—
This is the One resolving the Ten Thousand.
The divine pivot hides its mysteries.
The Six *Ji* [癸]—these are the *Xuan Nü* [玄女] talismans.
The arts of yin and yang’s mutual conquest are clearly revealed in the symbols.
These seventy words exhaust the principles without omission."*

The *Yellow Emperor’s I Ching* *Yinfu Jing* concludes here.
