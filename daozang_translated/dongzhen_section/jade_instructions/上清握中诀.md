**Scroll One of The Upper Clarity Hand-Clasping Formula**
*(Text missing at beginning)* #1

Above the Mysterious, in the Great Subtlety,
beneath the Purple Canopy of the North Pole,
dwells the Supreme Perfected,
soaring beyond the Nine Exteriors.
Her emerald skirts take flight,
her sash is of golden bells and azure silk.
At her waist hangs a luminous jade,
while dark clouds gather in misty splendor.
She bestows upon me the Hidden Script,
ascending through the Seven Qi,
mounting the mist of Clarity in play.
The Perfected gather in union—
I beseech the Flying Immortals,
inscribing my name in the Cinnabar Realm.
Wherever I turn, wherever I wish,
no calamity, no harm shall befall.
Should any bear me ill,
let them meet with ruin and defeat.

**Next: Riding the Void, Treading the Radiance**
From the North Pole, ascend together to the Celestial Pass.
Press the right hand to the heart,
point the left hand toward the Celestial Pass.
Hold the breath for three cycles,
knock the teeth three times,
swallow the saliva thrice.
Softly intone the prayer:

O Supreme Seven Poles,
Purple Tenuity beyond the stars,
Precious Mysterious Golden Chamber—
beyond it lies the Jade Gate.
Revolving through the Nine Palaces,
harmonizing the Celestial Pass,
within dwells the Venerable Spirit,
styled the Purple Sovereign.
She confers upon me the Hidden Script,
bearing me aloft on a dragon’s back,
soaring through the Nine Heavens,
flying down to the Primordial Earth.
A cinnabar chariot of luminous clouds,
a robe of dark splendor and emerald hue,
a dragon’s tally at my waist,
a tiger’s pattern upon my headscarf.
She embraces the myriad beings,
instructing the Flying Immortals.
She severs my name from death,
that I may endure with Heaven and Earth.
Riding the dragon, pacing the Dipper,
wherever I turn, grace shall be granted.
Should any bear me ill,
let wind-blades and fire consume them.

**Wandering the Three Destinies**
From the Celestial Pass, ascend together to the Auxiliary Star.
Hold the breath for one cycle,
knock the teeth three times,
swallow the saliva once.
Softly intone the prayer:

O Supreme Ultimate Auxiliary Star,
its essence abides in the Purple Pass.
Nurturing life, fostering destiny,
treasuring and guarding the spirit-soul.
The Golden Chamber opens anew—
I am granted audience with the Auxiliary Lord.
She bestows upon me the Hidden Script,
enabling my wandering and circling.
My name is enrolled among the Sage Emperors,
a Flying Immortal of the Nine Heavens.
A golden kerchief, a girdle of truth—
I enter and exit the Grotto Gate.

**Lingering in the Three Yang**
From the Auxiliary Star, ascend together to the Aligning Star.
Hold the breath for one cycle,
knock the teeth three times,
swallow the saliva once.
Softly intone the prayer:

O Supreme Void of the Mud-Pill Palace,
Purple Palace Heavenly Honored One,
Mysterious Void, True Pivot,
foremost of the Thearch’s attendants.
Essence enters the Hall of Light,
strengthening the embryo, augmenting the soul.
The Vermilion Mountain opens again—
I am received by the Numinous Primordial.
Left, I embrace the radiance of the sun;
right, I grasp the root of the moon.
A torrent of fire ten thousand fathoms long,
a skirt of golden net and azure silk.
A tiger tally at my waist,
a floral crown upon my head.
She bestows upon me the Hidden Script,
that I may traverse the Celestial Pass.
I beseech the Flying Immortals,
commanding the myriad spirits.
Wherever I turn, all shall converge,
my blessings and virtue like mountains.

**Audience at the Four Poles**
In spring, pace the Net’s End,
align the body and enter the Dipper’s Maw.
Face east to behold the Jupiter’s image within the liver.
Bow twice, kneel, and pray:

O Spirit of the Great Year,
Wood Duke of the Nine Yang,
Primordial Flower of the Mysterious Origin—
come forth in full to enter my body.

Knock the teeth nine times.
When finished, ascend to the heavens and depart in spirals.

In summer, pace the Net’s End,
align the body and enter the Dipper’s Maw.
Face south to behold the Fire Star’s image within the heart.
Bow twice, kneel, and pray:

O Spirit of the Southern Upper Origin,
Fire Yang of the Fourfold Radiance and Double Li’s Cinnabar Flame—
come forth in full to enter my Cinnabar Chamber.

Knock the teeth nine times.
When finished, ascend to the heavens and depart in spirals.

In autumn, pace the Net’s End,
align the body and enter the Dipper’s Maw.
Face west to behold the Venus Star’s image within the lungs.
Bow twice, kneel, and pray:

O Western Supreme Mystery,
Golden Essence of the Sevenfold Dao and Jade Prime of the Two Emperors—
let the qi return to the fetal brain.

Knock the teeth nine times.
When finished, ascend to the heavens and depart in spirals.

In winter, pace the Net’s End,
align the body and enter the Dipper’s Maw.
Face north to behold the Mercury Star’s image within the kidneys.
Bow twice, kneel, and pray:

O Northern Dark Purple Dawn,
Golden Chariot of the Water Origin and Dragon Womb’s Transformed Spirit—
come forth in full to enter my whole body.

Knock the teeth nine times.
When finished, ascend to the heavens and depart in spirals.

On the day of *jiǎzǐ* or the Eight Nodal Days, pace the Net’s End,
align the body and enter the Dipper’s Maw behind the Star of Balance.
Face the Perfected One and visualize the Saturn Star’s image within the spleen.
Bow twice, kneel, and pray:

O Supreme Ultimate of the Nine Perfected,
Flowing Peace of the Yin Root and Flying Canopy of the One Flower—
come forth in full to enter the Muddy Pellet.

Knock the teeth nine times.
When finished, ascend to the heavens and depart in spirals.

The Rite of Pacing the Net to Shed Death’s Name and Ascend the Jade Register follows the same form, with only minor variations. On the six *jiǎ*-days, after pacing forth, turn left and face downward toward the terrace. Hold the breath, follow the Net’s threads with Yu’s step, and tread upon the stars upward to the Metal Star. First place the left foot forward and the right foot drawn back, ascending one star together. Upon reaching Metal, reverse the feet so the right leads, then tread the stars back. After nine full cycles, halt upon the Metal Star, knock the teeth three times, and release the breath. Pray thus:

Upper Terrace of Void Essence,
Middle Terrace of Sixfold Purity,
Lower Terrace of Curved Life—
if seeking gold and jade, invoke the Upper Terrace;
if seeking rank and emolument, invoke the Middle Terrace;
if seeking fields and land, invoke the Lower Terrace.
Let the three matters follow the petitioner’s desire.

Then descend along the Net’s threads in a free pace, returning to ascend the Five Stars.

Next, pace the Five Stars.
First face the Net’s mouth, close the eyes, hold the breath, knock the teeth five times, and swallow saliva five times. Visualize the essence of each of the Five Stars residing within the five viscera. The stars’ forms and their rays of light, along with the inner radiance of the viscera, shine through brightly. Whisper the prayer:

The Five Stars array their light,
illuminating the five directions.
The Water Star averts calamity,
the Wood Star brings prosperity,
the Fiery Star dissolves misfortune,
the White Star repels weapons,
the Earth Star secures the four quarters—
may I gain profit and uprightness.
My name is inscribed on the Jade Tablet,
recorded in the Emperor’s chamber.
Riding the whirlwind and fanning the light,
I soar through the Great Void,
entering and exiting the Dark Origin,
roaming and feasting in the ten directions.
Five clouds float as my canopy,
summoning spirits and seizing the wind,
commanding the myriad numina,
to guard and serve the Transcendent Lords above.

Then silently invoke the names of the Five Star Sovereigns and their Consorts, following the method of the Eightfold Invocation. Release the breath, hold it again, and step over the Net to tread upon the stars. Place the left foot upon Metal, advance the right foot to join it, and face the corresponding direction. With the left hand touching the heart, declare, “I ascend as a flying transcendent.” Next, ascend Earth, turning the feet toward Fire. Ascend Fire, then Wood, then Water, then reverse back to Wood. In all reverse movements, the right foot leads first. Thus proceed back and forth three times. Then, according to the diagram, ascend Metal, then Fire, then Earth, turning the feet toward Wood. Ascend Wood, then Water, then reverse back to Wood. Thus proceed back and forth fifteen times in total. Descend, and if fearing distraction, count on the fingers. Turn left, face the Net’s mouth, and silently pray. Each time you reach a star, join the feet, place the left hand upon the heart, invoke the name of the star’s Sovereign and his Consort, and silently declare, “I ascend as a flying transcendent.” When all is complete, kneel, roll up the diagram, and depart. Burn incense and bow twice.

If encountering malevolent ghosts or wicked persons, visualize the Dipper’s stars covering your head, point the Dipper’s handle forward, hold the breath, and silently pray:

I am the Heavenly Eye,
pursuing Heaven’s course.
My essence is like thunder and lightning,
illuminating the eight realms,
penetrating all within and without,
subduing all without exception.
Pacing the flying step,
in one year I avert misfortune,
in two years I avert weapons,
in three years I avert death,
in four years I become an Earth Transcendent.
Practicing this for fourteen years,
I become a Perfected One of the Highest Clarity.

The Oral Instructions for Recording Practices and Affairs

On the night of the month’s last day at midnight, face east and write the Solar Qi Talisman in cinnabar on blue paper, and the Lunar Essence Talisman in yellow on blue paper. First hold the Solar Talisman in the left hand, hold the breath, and silently pray:

The Vermilion Script of the Great Culmen,
named “Opening Brightness,”
summons the sun’s upper soul
to transform my form.
At dawn’s strict adornment,
departing from the round courtyard,
flying blossom of the water mother,
golden essence of the solar root—
purple radiance streaming light,
called the Five Numinous Ones.

Then ingest it. Next, hold the Lunar Talisman in the right hand, hold the breath, and silently pray:

The Yellow Script of the Purple Culmen,
named “Great Mystery,”
summons the moon’s radiant water
to nourish the po and harmonize the hun.
At the square’s strict observance,
departing from the Dark Pass,
hiding the sky and concealing the moon,
the Five Numinous Ladies—
flying light of nine paths,
illuminating the Muddy Pellet.

Then ingest it.

The Method of Ingesting Solar Qi
At dawn, await the sun’s first rising. Face the sun, sit or stand as you wish, knock the teeth nine times, and silently invoke:

Solar soul, Pearl Radiance,
Illuminating Sheath, Green Reflection,
Returning Rosy Clouds, Crimson Youth,
Dark Flame, Whirlwind Image.

Still the eyes, clench the fists, and visualize the sun’s five-colored streaming radiance all coming to embrace the body, descending to the two feet and ascending to the crown of the head. Then see within the radiance a purple qi like an eye’s pupil, layered in dozens of folds, coming with the five colors into the mouth. Swallow it in forty-five breaths, then swallow saliva nine times, knock the teeth nine times, and whisper the prayer:

Crimson furnace of cinnabar qi,
round heaven nurturing essence,
hardness receiving softness,
flaming water’s yin flower—
solar origin’s radiant scene,
called Great Brightness.
Nine yangs transform together,
two smokes arise as one.
Congealing the hun and harmonizing the po,
essence of the five qi,
within arise the Five Emperors.
Riding the light and guiding the form,
plucking the flying from the void,
grasping the root to gain fullness—
crown draped in dragon canopy,
robed in vermilion and girded in blue,
reins of the crow flowing dark,
rosy clouds illuminating Highest Clarity.
Bestowed the Jade Tablet’s script,
name carved in the Golden Chamber.
Ingesting the dawn’s blossom,
uniting with the Perfected in numinosity,
flying transcendent of the Great Culmen,
ascending to the Purple Court.

Bow twice.

The Method of Ingesting Lunar Essence
Await the moon’s first rising. Face the moon, sit or stand as you wish, knock the teeth ten times, and silently invoke:

Lunar po, Warm Mist,
Fragrant Bloom, Veiled Loneliness,
Graceful Void, Orchid’s Luxuriance,
Flowering Knot, Pure Gold’s Luminous Jade,
Genuine Countenance, Terrace’s Standard.

Still the eyes, clench the fists, and visualize the moon’s five-colored streaming essence all coming to embrace the body, descending to the two feet and ascending to the crown of the head. Then see within the radiance a yellow qi like an eye’s pupil, layered in dozens of folds, coming with the five colors into the mouth. Swallow it in fifty breaths, then swallow saliva ten times, knock the teeth ten times, and whisper the prayer:

Yellow-green, dark radiance,
primal yin’s upper qi,
scattering the luxuriant cold whirlwind,
gathering the numinous and restraining the stomach—
numinous waves, orchid’s sharpness,
upright and washed, halting the vessel.
Lunar essence, night’s scene,
supreme treasure of the Dark Palace.
Five Sovereigns and Ladies,
each guarding their maternal position.
The Red Child flies in,
the Infant arrives in accomplishment.
Revolving yin’s triple union,
light and mystery pervading the ten thousand directions.
Harmonizing the hun and restraining the po,
the five wombs flowing freely.
Riding the rosy clouds and flying essence,
soaring in emptiness to the east—
crown knotted in numinous clouds,
rosy blossoms summoning the wind.
Left girded with the Dragon Talisman,
right cinched with the Tiger Seal,
vermilion cloak of phoenix plumes,
jade pendants and golden earrings.
The soaring tree knotted in the heights,
called the Wood King—
spirit’s luxuriance controlling the root,
now waning, now full.
Bright essence inwardly radiant,
dark water spouting the beam.
Bestowed the Jade Tablet’s script,
name carved in the Numinous Chamber.
Ingesting the moon’s blossom,
uniting with the Perfected in harmony,
flying transcendent of the Purple Culmen,
ascending to pay court to the Great Sovereign.

Prostrate twice. If the sky is overcast, this may be practiced within the bedchamber. Perform this at dawn and dusk in mountain forests without fail.

**Method for Restraining the Three Hun**
At dusk, lie down without a pillow, stretch the feet upward, cross the hands over the heart, close the eyes, and hold the breath for three cycles. Strike the teeth three times, and visualize a crimson qi like a chicken’s egg rising from within, ascending through the eyes, then expanding to envelop the body in flame, burning both within and without until all is pervaded as one. When the body feels slightly warm, strike the teeth three times and urgently summon the three spirits: *Shuang Ling*, *Tai Guang*, and *You Jing*. Then softly intone:
*Within the Mystic Palace of the Great Tenuity, the Primordial Yellow and First Azure refine the three hun. May Tai Guang rest in tranquility. The divine treasure of the Jade Chamber is born with me. Let them not stir recklessly, for the Great Numinous watches over. Should they desire to soar, they may only ascend to the Supreme Clarity of the Great Ultimate. Should they hunger or thirst, they may only drink the jade essence of the returning waters.*

**Method for Restraining the Seven Po**
At dusk, lie down with feet stretched upward, cover both ears with the palms, and let the fingertips meet at the nape. Close the eyes, hold the breath seven times, and strike the teeth seven times. Visualize a white qi like a small bean at the tip of the nose, gradually expanding to crown the body in nine layers, each transforming into celestial beasts. Two azure dragons dwell within the eyes, two white tigers within the nostrils, all facing inward. The vermilion sparrow rests upon the heart, its beak toward the mouth. The dark tortoise lies beneath the left foot, the numinous serpent beneath the right, their necks also turned upward. A jade maiden clad in black brocade holds flames of fire at each ear. After a long while, swallow saliva seven times, strike the teeth seven times, and summon the seven po: *Shi Gou*, *Fu Shi*, *Que Yin*, *Tun Zei*, *Fei Du*, *Chu Hui*, and *Chou Fei*. Then softly intone:
*Nine cycles of pristine qi restrain the po and repel treachery. Celestial beasts guard the gates, the maidens hold the passes. Refine the po to harmony, that they may rest with me. Let them not stir recklessly, for they are watched over in their forms. Should they hunger or thirst, they may only drink the yellow of the moon and the cinnabar of the sun.*

**#2**
Before retiring at night, first visualize the *Red Child* in the *Mud-Pill Palace*, whose name is *San Yuan Xian*, also called *Di Qing*, clad in red. The *Perfected One of the Crimson Palace* is named *Zi Nan Dan*, also called *Zhong Guang Jian*, clad in red. The *Infant Brother of the Cinnabar Field* is named *Yuan Yang Zi*, also called *Gu Xia Xuan*, clad in yellow. In all, six persons.

Head like that of an infant, with a radiance of gold and jade. Then visualize the *Great Lord of the Life Gate and Mysterious Portal within the Palace of Generation* at the navel’s *Mingmen*, clad in crimson, wearing a purple lotus crown, holding the *Celestial August Symbol Talisman*, seated facing outward. The three *hun* spirits attend at his side. Then hold the breath for twenty-four cycles, and silently invoke *Tao Hai*, whose name is *He Yan*, three times. Swallow saliva fifty times, and strike the teeth three rounds. Softly intone:

*Great Womb Spirit, August Celestial Lord of the Imperial Net, holding the Embryo Talisman, head crowned with purple, yellow revolving and red turning, ascending to refine the Life Gate, transforming spirit to rebirth. The Six Harmonies intermingle, the bodily frame gleams with luster, and Jade Maidens attend the body.*

First visualize this, then summon and restrain the *hun*. Further, on the nights of the new and full moon at midnight, write the *Celestial August Symbol Talisman* in cinnabar on blue paper. Facing north, hold the talisman in the left hand, hold the breath, and silently intone:

*Celestial Emperor’s Mysterious Writ, August Symbol Talisman, uniting with primordial qi, circulating essence to return to the womb. Infant of ten thousand years, flying immortal at the Celestial Pivot, Great Spirit of the Palace of Generation, robed in cinnabar and crimson, head crowned with purple lotus, conspire with me.*

After ingesting it, bow twice. Simply ingest it upon the bed where you sleep.

After eighteen years of ordered practice and recorded affairs, one rides the Three Radiant Essences and soars through the Great Void.

*Here ends the first scroll of* The Hand-Clasp Oral Instructions of the Highest Clarity. *(Note: The original text has minor lacunae. The base text did not originally contain the words “Lacuna Noted”; the collator added them based on the content.)*

*The Hand-Clasp Oral Instructions of the Highest Clarity, Second Scroll*

**Method for Guarding the Mysterious Elixir**
On the first, third, seventh, eleventh, and fifteenth nights of the month at midnight, the visualization follows the same method as that for the Three Ones. On ordinary days and evenings, proceed according to the present instructions.

At dusk, in tranquil repose, dispel all thoughts. First visualize the Northern Culmen star, from which a purple qi emerges like a bowstring, descending to enter the Palace of the Mysterious Elixir. Soon the palace fills and overflows, encircling the body and merging completely with the purple qi. Then visualize the sun suddenly flying in to enter the palace, gleaming brilliantly within the purple qi. Next visualize the Highest Clarity’s Central Yellow Supreme One Perfected Lord emerging from the Northern Culmen’s purple qi to sit within the sun. His attire, colors, name, and implements are all as before. Call his title and name three times. Suddenly visualize yourself stepping before the Supreme One, bowing twice with head touching the ground, and seeking the Dao to attain immortality. Then swallow the purple qi thirty times and the saliva thirty times.

Next visualize the Dipper’s *Kui* asterism emitting a red qi like a bowstring, which enters the Palace of the Mysterious Elixir. Thereupon, the Perfected Lord and you together mount the sun and travel within the red qi’s path, ascending to rest within the *Kui*. Focus the visualization clearly, then lie down to sleep, and true resonance will occur.

At times other than evening, simply visualize the Supreme One in the Palace of the Mysterious Elixir, with purple qi emerging to encircle the body, and swallow it. If you hear ringing in the ears, cover them with crossed hands and intone:

*The Red Child dwells in the palace, the Nine Perfected in the chamber. Hearken to the divine command, discern inauspicious omens. The Supreme One’s flowing fire overawes the ten thousand evils.*

Point to the ear’s gate seven times. If the face feels warm, it is auspicious. If the nape grows cold in patches, evil qi has entered. Immediately lie down, close the eyes, and visualize the Supreme One of the Mysterious Elixir wielding a fiery bell to cast it out, expelling the evil qi beyond the ears. The firelight will follow, blazing brightly to illuminate the entire body. After a long while, equilibrium will return.

For all inauspicious sights and sounds, concentrate on visualizing the Perfected Lord to seek deliverance and protection, and the ten thousand evils will not intrude.

**Method of Great Stillness**
Those who guard the One, on *jia-wu*, *jia-chen*, and *jia-yin* days at midnight, sweep and purify the courtyard of their tranquil chamber. Alternatively, construct an altar one *zhang* square, screen its four sides, lay out mats, burn incense, face north, bow twice, sit upright with hands clasped, close the eyes, and visualize the Three Palaces and Three Ones as prescribed.

Next visualize the Three Radiant Cloud Qi, each within its palace, with the Three Persons seated within the qi. The Three Radiant Ones wear purple, cyan, and crimson robes, layered in deep obscurity. Then gaze upward at the Northern Dipper and visualize purple qi emerging from the *Kui* like a straight bowstring, entering the mouth and dispersing into the Three Palaces. Thereupon, the Three Ones, the Three Ministers, and you suddenly emerge, together mounting the purple qi to ascend into the Dipper’s *Kui*. Then, riding the Three Radiant Essences, traverse into the Northern Culmen, where you behold the Purple Chambers, Jade Stairs, and celestial officials in ordered ranks. The Supreme One Perfected Lord, crowned with a purple dawn cap and clad in dragon-embroidered phoenix robes, sits facing south. You and the six others ascend the stairs, face north, bow, and entreat the Way of flying transcendence and long life. After a long while, you forget yourself as if dwelling in heaven for ages, then quietly rise and return to your chamber. On rainy days, perform the visualization while lying in bed.

On *shang-jian* days at dawn, face due east, sit upright, hold the breath, close the eyes, and inwardly visualize the Three Palaces, Three Ones, and Three Ministers as prescribed. Then visualize them suddenly emerging to sit before you. Rise in your heart and bow twice to each, making them appear vividly. Then silently intone:

*Celestial Honored Three Emperors, guard my Gate of Destiny. Roam the Void, where the Six Qi mystically divide. Nourish my Five Spirits, rectify my Three *Hun*. Let my Five Viscera spontaneously flourish, that I may attain long life and fly as an immortal.*

Next visualize them suddenly returning from the Void to the Three Palaces, where they remain as prescribed. Then swallow saliva thirty times. With prolonged practice, you will dream of gold, jade, white crows, and other objects—signs of gradual attainment of the One.

On *shang-chu* days at midnight, rise quietly, face north, and gaze upward at the Dipper’s inner image, the forms of the Assistant and Minister stars. Suddenly visualize the Three Ones and Three Ministers emerging from the Assistant Star to descend into the Three Palaces. Return to your chamber, hold the breath, close the eyes, and inwardly visualize with focused concentration as prescribed. After a long while, softly intone:

*Supreme Celestial Assistant, realm where the Three Emperors roam, the Three Ministers follow in attendance, uniting with the Perfected. Descend into my body, sit in tranquil stillness. Exhale essence to bathe my form, harmonizing *hun* and *po*. Let me fly as an immortal, riding a cloud chariot in the floating heavens.*

Swallow saliva twenty-seven times.

On *kai* days at midnight, rise and sit facing east. Remove your headcloth—you may also loosen your hair, comb it, and tie it again. Close the eyes, inwardly visualize, and softly call:

*Three Perfected of the Upper Prime, Infant within the Perfected. Dishevel the hair, open the mist, ascend to connect with the Celestial Terrace. Solidify the Mud-Pill, congeal it to be coeval with heaven. Let me fly as an immortal, traversing the Terrace of Intermingling.*

Swallow saliva nineteen times, then don your headcloth and lie down. Further visualize the Three Ones in their palaces exhaling qi thirty times, and you also exhale qi thirty times. You should feel a warm, gentle heat suffusing your body—this is the sign of harmonized *po* and congealed *hun*.

When the moon first appears, face it and bow twice. Visualize the moon’s white light with ten rays descending to embrace your body, penetrating and illuminating the Three Palaces. Silently intone:

*Mysterious Essence of the Great Yin, Radiant Moon Lady, newly born flowing light, illuminate my Three Palaces. Let the divine immortals ascend and fly, roaming the eight directions. Wherever I turn, wherever I wish, may all be enveloped in blessing.*

You may also bow twice.

Before eating, first compose the mind. Close the eyes and visualize the Three Ones in their palaces, joining from afar to partake in the offering. Only then begin to eat.

After eating, silently intone:

*May the hundred grains enter the stomach,
unite with the spirits in qi,
fill and replenish blood and fluids.
May the corpse-demons and malevolent forces perish and fall away.
May I endure as long as heaven and earth,
ascend in flight to the Jade Towers,
command the Six Dings,
and be attended and guarded by divine youths.*

When guarding the One at the Central Dipper to repel evil,
whether going out, entering, walking, or standing still,
always visualize the Northern Dipper covering your head,
its handle pointing forward,
with the Celestial Pass seven feet from your face.
Thus, no hundred evils or baleful qi dare invade.

Following this essential formula,
one may also recite while pacing the Flying Steps:

*I am the Heavenly Eye,
pursuing the heavens.
My essence swift as lightning and thunder,
radiant across the eight domains.
Piercing sight within and without—
nothing does not submit.*

Refining the Form with Fire:
At night, face the fire, draw in its light through the mouth,
and swallow it without count.
Visualize your body enveloped,
permeated as if by fire.
After a long while, cease.
Practiced for three years, one may sit within fire.

This is the Red General Zi’s method of refining the form.

Facing the Primordial Simplicity:
On the ninth day of the first month,
eighth day of the second month,
seventh day of the third month,
sixth day of the fourth month,
fifth day of the fifth month,
fourth day of the sixth month,
third day of the seventh month,
second day of the eighth month,
first day of the ninth month,
tenth day of the tenth month,
eleventh day of the eleventh month,
and twelfth day of the twelfth month,
at night in a quiet chamber,
face north and bow twice.
Kneel, press the forehead to the ground, and say:

*With reverence, I invoke the Supreme Great Dao,
the Lofty Void, the Jade Dawn,
the Purple Palace of Primordial Simplicity,
the Eight Numinous Lords of the Three Origins,
the Central Yellow Elder, the Primordial Radiance of White Origin,
the Five Elders of the Supreme Perfected, the Highest Immortals,
the Three August Jade Lords of the Great Ultimate Yellow Essence.
I, disciple [Name], of the Great Cavern’s Three Luminants,
on this night of the announced day,
when the Celestial Pass opens ninefold,
do humbly address the Supreme Jade Sovereign of the Most High,
entreating long life in the world,
longevity without bound,
to ride at times the Yellow Dawn’s green-canopied dragon chariot,
ascend to the Purple Courts above,
command the myriad spirits,
and be attended by the Four Luminaries.*

When finished, let no one know.

It is said that practicing the Hidden Writ of the Great Cinnabar
and visualizing the Three Origins’ Cavern Chambers
pertains to the methods of prior advancement,
not the Way of the Three Ones,
but among the various formulas.

If one has not yet walked this path,
this supplication should not be employed,
though these days are auspicious within the lunar cycle.
They are fitting for all manner of virtuous deeds.

At the dawn of the Jade Dawn’s mornings—
on the fourth day of the first month,
the eighth of the second,
the fifteenth of the third,
the eighth of the fourth,
the ninth of the fifth,
the sixth of the sixth,
the seventh of the seventh,
the eighth of the eighth,
the ninth of the ninth,
the fifth of the tenth,
the third of the eleventh,
and the twelfth of the twelfth—
at sunrise, face north and bow twice.
Declare your original intent and state your wishes,
then swallow saliva thirty-six times.

It is said that on these days,
the Supreme Great Dao’s Jade Dawn Lord
ascends to the Jade Firmament’s Jasper Chambers,
casting his gaze upon the world
to observe those with lofty aspirations and far-reaching resolve.
Thus, he commands that supplications be made.

First, invoke your title and name as in the audience rites,
saying, *“This humble dust-mote, so-and-so, entreats...”* and state your plea.

If rain or snow falls, perform the invocation in a quiet chamber,
then bow twice more,
and remain kneeling to swallow saliva until finished.

**Audience with the Azure Lord**
On *dingmao* days, at sunrise,
face the sun and bow twice to make your entreaty.
From the ninth month to the first month of the following year,
face the direction of sunrise.
Use this occasion to absorb the sun’s essence.

On these days, the Azure Youth of the Eastern Sea
ascends to the Eastern Florescence Terrace of Square Cauldron Mountain
and surveys the four quarters.
(Note: Square Cauldron lies east of Kuaiji,
slightly to the south—
when facing it, one aligns with the *yi* direction.)

In summer, when the sun rises in the northeast,
do not face it directly.
Instead, visualize the location of the Eastern Florescence Terrace
and make your invocation there.

After the entreaty, bow twice again,
then proceed with solar practices.
The recipient need only inhale the radiant essence,
swallowing nine times.

**Intensive Visualization**
Regularly on the second day of the second month,
the third of the third,
the eighth of the eighth,
the ninth of the ninth,
and the tenth of the tenth,
at night in your bedchamber,
engage in the Cavern Chamber visualization practices,
burn incense, invoke the Perfected,
and remain vigilant without sleep.
As if awaiting something, exercise utmost caution,
and on these days, redouble your virtuous deeds.

It is said that those who cultivate the Cavern Chamber methods
are observed on these days by the Jade Lads and Maidens of the Protective Scriptures,
accompanied by the Perfected of the Great Ultimate’s Canonical Prohibitions,
who descend from the void to inspect good and evil.
Thus, one must be circumspect,
refraining from all other affairs
and devoting oneself solely to Daoist practices
and the cultivation of virtuous dharmas.

**Ominous Dreams**

Upon awakening from an ominous dream, press the philtrum with the left hand thirty-four times, and gently gnash the teeth thirty-four times. Whisper the following incantation:

*"Great Cavern, True Mystery—
Zhang refines the Three Hun.
The First Hun swiftly guards the Po,
the Second Hun swiftly guards the Mud-Pill Palace,
the Third Hun obeys the heart’s command.
Hasten to summon the Supreme Lords of the Three Origins.
I have encountered an inauspicious dream:
the Seven Po, wandering corpse-spirits, have come to cling to the source of evil.
Swiftly call upon Peach-Kang to shield my life,
dissolve the malign fluids,
transform misfortune into fortune,
and preserve the primal bond of life and death."*

When finished, lie down again, and a favorable response will surely come.

It is said that those who frequently encounter ominous dreams do so for three reasons: first, the Po’s demonic influence; second, the heart’s trial; third, the corpse-thief’s plunder. Thus, by dispelling and dissolving these, one seals the Three Passes below, turning misfortune into fortune.

**Auspicious Dreams**
Upon awakening from an auspicious dream, rub the eyes thirty-four times, gnash the teeth thirty-four times, and whisper the following incantation:

*"Supreme High Essence,
Three Emperors of Cinnabar Spirit,
the Crimson Palace radiant and clear—
auspicious omens declare their message.
The Three Origins soften the Po,
the Heavenly Sovereign bestows the scripture.
All I pursue harmonizes,
I ascend as an immortal to the Upper Clarity,
ever in the company of Jade Perfected,
together we gather in the Purple Court."*

These incantations for auspicious and ominous dreams derive from the affairs of the Great Cinnabar Cavern Chamber. If one has not received this scripture, it is improper to perform these rites or make petitions while reciting them.

When troubled by an ominous dream, at dawn one should invoke the Supreme, rectify the Hun and Po, and dispel inauspiciousness. Face the direction of the sunrise, bow in reverence, and petition for absolution. Place a musk sachet at the neck to repel the qi of water infusions and banish ominous dreams.

If one frequently dreams of tombs or the deceased, upon awakening, face upward and gnash the teeth three times, then whisper this incantation:

*"Supreme Origin, Upper Mystery,
Nine Capitals of the Purple Heaven—
govern the Hun, protect my life,
Lofty Plain Perfected.
I have received the supreme method,
taught by the Great Mystery.
Long life and enduring vision,
spirit soars, body becomes immortal.
Tombs forever at peace,
ghostly disputes and treachery sealed.
Hun and Po harmonious and joyful,
malign qi vanishes like smoke.
Wandering demons, do not covet;
specters, dare not assail my spirit.
The Northern Emperor commands,
seize the qi and cast it into the abyss.
Receive the register of the Supreme August,
report to the Jade Dawn."*

Recite this twice, and with each recitation, gnash the teeth three times. This is the Northern Emperor’s secret incantation. For all ominous and inauspicious dreams, one may apply this method. Those with sincere intent may also practice it.

Upon awakening at night, swiftly close the eyes, gnash the teeth nine times, and swallow saliva nine times. Then, with the hands, press along the sides of the nose, moving up and down dozens of times, and whisper:

*"Supreme Four Luminaries,
Nine Gates emit essence.
Ears and eyes profoundly clear,
communing with the true, reaching the numinous.
Pavilion of Heaven’s Center,
flowing qi harmonized and balanced.
Maiden Jiao with cloud-like bearing,
eyes of the youth bright and keen.
Flourishing wisdom, resplendent clarity,
all senses refined and pure.
Preserve harmony in the Upper Origin,
wander through the Nine Citadels.
The Five Viscera plant their roots,
ears and eyes naturally thrive.
The Heavenly Terrace, lofty and plain,
pillars and beams stand firm.
The Seven Po refined and tempered,
the Three Hun at peace.
The Red Child carries the radiance,
ever at my side.
Should any dare obscure my ears and eyes,
the Supreme shall crush them with flowing bells.
All myriad misfortunes vanish,
every wish shall be fulfilled.
Sun and Moon guard the gates,
the heart stores the Five Stars.
As the True Sovereign has invoked,
let all echoes heed with reverence."*

When finished, swallow saliva nine more times, and rub the face until it is slightly warm. Make this a regular practice. Upon every awakening, perform this pressing and incantation without fail.

It is said that this is the Way the Perfected conduct themselves in daily life. Practicing it constantly, whether sitting or lying down, sharpens the ears and eyes, restores a youthful complexion, governs the Hun, refines the Po, and repels a thousand demons.

Upon awakening at night, visualize the solar image within, swiftly grasp it in the palm, and cause the sun’s red rays to flow backward from the arm to the elbow and armpit. After a long while, the solar rays suddenly transform into fire, burning the arm until it is thoroughly permeated inside and out. Then, inaudibly recite:

*"Four Luminaries of the Upper Origin,
qi of the Sun and Moon divide.
Flowing light radiant and bright,
irrigating the fluids, congealing the Hun.
Divine fire scatters the radiance,
scouring filth, refining smoke.
Thoroughly penetrating the wind and qi,
all evil burns away.
May I attain long life,
my four limbs whole and sound.
Malignant ghosts that inflict harm,
consign them to the Northern Asterism."*

Afterward, engage in visualization for a long while, then relax the body and forget the self.

It is said that those afflicted with wind in the hands should practice this. For wind qi in the head, face, or other areas, apply this method to the respective location and burn with visualization while reciting the incantation.

At the time of living qi, swallow saliva thirty-four times, and press the afflicted area of the body. Face the direction of the ruler and recite:

*"Left Mystery, Right Mystery,
Three Spirits unite as one.
Left Yellow, Right Yellow,
Six Floras align.
Wind qi and ghostly ailments,
subdue and conceal in the four directions.
Jade fluid flows with moisture,
up and down freely circulating.
Internally dispatch water and fire,
externally repel inauspiciousness.
Long life and flying immortality,
the body ever strong and at ease."*

When finished, swallow saliva twenty-seven more times. Practicing this regularly will ensure freedom from illness.

For acute pain, press the afflicted area thirty-one times in rapid succession. When the pain flares, press swiftly while reciting the incantation, repeating this several times before ceasing. The painful spot need not be precisely located.

For numbness or immobility in the arms, first gently massage the afflicted limb with one hand for a long while. Then, with eyes closed, inwardly visualize, click the teeth, and swallow saliva three times. Compose the mind and softly recite:

*"Supreme Four Mysteries,
Five Floras and Six Courts,
Three Hun and Seven Po,
Celestial Pass and Earthly Essence,
Divine Palaces and Protective Qi,
Radiance of the Heavenly Terrace,
Hundred Spirits of the Four Limbs,
Myriad Spirits of the Nine Joints,
Receive the Jade Dawn Register,
Inscribed in the Five Cities,
Jade Maidens attend my body,
Jade Lads guard my life,
Forever aligned with the Two Luminaries,
Ascending as an Immortal to the Upper Clarity,
Ageless as the sun and moon,
Transcending to ascend as a Perfected One,
Attaining Great Peace.
Flowing winds and congealed ailments,
Possessing ghosts and flying demons,
Specters and tomb qi,
Yin qi assailing me,
Encircling my limbs,
Threatening my flourishing and decline—
Celestial Soldiers of the Supreme,
Dragon and Tiger manifest their might,
Slaying ghosts and inauspiciousness,
Crushing wind and evil.
Examine and suppress hidden grievances,
Concealed poisons and falsehoods,
Restore me to my normal state,
Radiant as the sun and moon.
If examined and violated,
The Northern Asterism shall seize and destroy,
As though defying the luminous might."*

This is the Northern Emperor’s Curved Incantation. For all afflictions of a similar nature, employ this method. If unable to press the area oneself, have another do so while you inwardly visualize, swallow saliva, click the teeth, and recite. Practicing this a hundred times will dissolve the ailment.

Before sleeping at night, first close the eyes tightly and face east. With the thumbs behind the palms, press and wipe the eyes toward the ears, crossing the hands to meet at the nape thirty-nine times. Visualize three colored qi—purple, azure, and crimson—emerging from each eye. Then recite in silence:

*"Eye Lads of the Three Clouds,
True Lords of the Two Eyes,
Brilliant and luminous, infusing essence,
Opening and clarifying the pure spirit,
Cloudy Splendor of the Great Mystery,
Spiritual maidens fluttering,
Safeguarding the twin gates,
Unsealing the nine portals,
Hundred joints resonating,
Morning saliva ascending to the Mud-Pill Palace,
Body ascending to the Jade Palace,
Ennobled as an Upper Perfected One."*

When finished, swallow saliva fifty times, then open the eyes. This may be practiced regularly upon sitting or rising, not only at night, though it is best performed during the time of living qi. Practicing this for a year will clarify hearing and vision. With prolonged practice, one may perceive a thousand miles and behold the radiance of spirits. Thus, it need not be confined to night; from midnight until noon, whenever there is leisure, perform it—always facing east.

At midday, swallow saliva twenty-seven times and press the Celestial Perfection point, located at the inner corners of the eyebrows. For the Mountain Source, press the philtrum just below the nose. For the Flowery Court, press the hollows beneath the eyebrows. Press each thirty-nine times while reciting:

*"Open the Celestial Court,
Grant me long life,
Perceive ten thousand miles,
Hun and Po return as infants,
Extinguish ghosts and repel demons,
Summon a thousand spirits,
Ascend to the Supreme,
Merge with the sun,
Attain the rank of Perfected One,
Inscribed in the Mysterious Register."*

This enables spiritual perception and repels all evil. The points may be pressed sequentially or simultaneously while reciting. Regularly press the small cavities behind the eyebrows thirty-nine times. Rub the area beneath the eyes and above the cheekbones with the palms and fingers. Rotate the ears thirty times, then reverse the motion, sweeping the forehead thirty-nine times from the midpoint of the brows upward into the hairline. Swallow saliva freely, without count. With both hands, stroke the head in all directions, smoothing the hair and tying it securely—do this frequently. When finished, press the corners of the eyes eighteen times until light is clearly perceived. Practice diligently, without fixed times or limits. After a year, one may write in the dark; with prolonged practice, one may perceive a hundred spirits. This method derives from the *Supreme Treasure Spirit Scripture*, and even Perfected Ones do not abandon it. Practice it whenever leisure permits, without restriction.

Before sleeping and upon rising, rub the hands until warm, then wipe the neck, ears, and their surroundings until gently heated. Stroke the head in the direction of the hair, then rub the palms to treat the face and eyes. First, rub the palms vigorously until hot, then wipe the face. Stroke the hair toward the nape, alternating hands. When finished, swallow saliva thirty times.

Upon rising, sit upright and compose the breath. First clasp the hands, then raise them to cover the nape. Tilt the head back, straining the neck against the hands three or four times. Flex and extend the body, stretching the limbs to their utmost, arching backward and twisting to the sides, mobilizing all joints—repeat each movement three times. This is the Essence-Light Massage Method, harmonizing essence and blood, preventing the intrusion of wind qi. With prolonged practice, one will neither die nor fall ill.

Regularly press the inner corners of the eyes near the nose while holding the breath; cease when qi flows smoothly, then exhale and begin anew. With persistent practice, the eyes will attain penetrating vision. Frequently press and rub the ears on both sides, without count. Do the same for the nose. Often cover the mouth and nose with the hands, close the eyes, and gently breathe. Over time, saliva will form in the palms; use it to rub the face and eyes, imparting fragrance to the body.

When sitting, often close the eyes and inwardly visualize the five viscera and intestines. With prolonged practice, they will become distinctly clear. When lying down, close the eyes, relax the body, and breathe softly. Inwardly gaze and listen to the four directions, extending perception to a thousand miles. With focused intent, one may perceive events a hundred miles away and hear the sounds of metal, stone, silk, and bamboo. Though initially indistinct, with time and sincerity, one will naturally attain mastery. Begin by focusing on one direction, progressing from near to far—hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of miles—then shift to another direction, encompassing all without obstruction.

When combing the hair, face the direction of the kingly earth. At the beginning of combing, softly recite the incantation: *"Mud Pill’s mysterious blossom, preserve essence and ensure its longevity. On the right lies the hidden moon, on the left the root of the sun. The six harmonies refine the essence, and the ten thousand spirits receive grace."* Upon completion, swallow saliva three times.

When bathing, constantly visualize the Six Dings, and whatever one desires will come to pass. Each of the Six Dings corresponds to its respective cyclical period and should face its designated direction. One should bathe frequently—there is no harm in bathing often, only in one’s inability to do so. It washes away the stench of the corpse, allowing true qi to enter. On every *jiazi* day, one should bathe; if not, then at the beginning of each month, to enable spiritual communion.

If one treads upon filth or any unclean place, one should wash and bathe to purify the body and dispel impurities. The method involves ten liang of bamboo leaves and four liang of peeled white peach bark, boiled in one *hu* and two *dou* of clear water until it reaches a single boil. Adjust the temperature and bathe the body, and all impurities will vanish. While bathing is most effective, this water should not be used for washing the hair. Instead, use the pure essence of refined water for bathing. If one must wash the hair, follow the usual method separately.

It is also said that among worldly talismanic waters, none compare to this method when used for rinsing the mouth or holding in the mouth. There are also other talismanic water methods. Orthodox Unity Daoists have their own regular practices, while the Eight Officials and Six Jias possess a separate talismanic water superior for dispelling impurities. Here, it is appended for concurrent use.

Write in cinnabar on white paper, then place it in clear water while facing the kingly direction. Hold the water vessel in the left hand and a sword in the right. Strike the teeth three times, then spray the water while reciting: *"Ghosts of the hundred impurities, swiftly depart ten thousand miles. If you do not leave, you will be slain. O White Youth of the West."* Strike the vessel’s edge with the sword three times, then recite and strike the teeth again, repeating this three times in total. Use the water to rinse the mouth, whether for oneself, another, or an unclean place, and the impurities will dissolve—no bathing is required.

When ingesting immortal medicines, always face one’s life direction upon completion, and avoid speaking of death, mourning, or inauspicious matters to prevent harming the fetal spirit, rendering the medicine ineffective. Before eating, do not discuss death, nor leave food exposed, lest various malevolent qi gather. When eating, face one’s life direction or the kingly qi.

Daoist methods and plain garments should not be lent to others, nor should carriages, clothing, beds, or bedding be shared. The chambers where one sits or sleeps should be kept clean and uncluttered to receive pure qi; if unclean, one will absorb stale qi. Stale qi disrupts the chambers, causing endeavors to fail and undertakings to falter. The body should also be frequently washed and bathed to remain pure; otherwise, immortality cannot be attained. Infrequent bathing is the nature of the *po*; to distance the *po* and return to the true, one refines its turbid filth, and the *po* will gradually vanish. Bathe often, constantly visualize the Six Dings, and whatever one desires will come to pass.

Beware of discussing Daoist studies, for such talk invites ghostly interference. If one is unafraid, illness will swiftly follow, as the body has not yet attained authenticity. When transcribing scriptures, always burn incense on both sides. When deeply contemplating, burn incense nearby.

Impatience and violence are thieves and illnesses of the body. In all matters, one should be gentle, unhurried, and thoroughly pure. Those who wish to study the Dao should never let others know what they have seen or heard; in all things, act with utmost discretion.

**Method of Storing the Sun in the Heart**
On the fifth, fifteenth, and twenty-ninth days of the lunar month, at midnight, visualize the sun entering the mouth and residing in the heart, illuminating the heart’s interior. Merge with the sun’s light for a long while until the heart feels warm, then recite: *"Great brightness nurtures essence, internally refining the cinnabar heart. Radiance converges and reflects, and divine perfected beings come seeking."* Swallow saliva nine times.

It is also said that this practice should be performed frequently, not strictly on these days, and may be done every night. This is the internal method of the Crimson Lord of the Great Void.

**Method of Ingesting the Sun and Moon’s Forms**
Men ingest the sun’s form, women the moon’s form, once daily without fail. It is said to write the characters for "sun" and "moon" and ingest them, though the time is not specified. Now, one may write the character for "sun" in cinnabar on blue paper, nine *fen* square, cut into thousands of pieces. Each dawn, face east, hold them in the left hand, visualize the sun’s form with its proper radiance, then swallow them, allowing them to reside in the heart. Strike the teeth and swallow saliva nine times each.

Women should write the moon’s form in yellow on yellow paper and ingest it with the right hand. This is the method of the Perfected One of Eastern Florescence.

**Method of Ingesting the Sun’s Rays**
The true forms of the sun and moon are to be ingested separately, as recorded in the *Hidden Instructions*. Sit upright, close the eyes, and directly visualize the sun’s form within the heart, the size of a coin, crimson in color, with nine rays of purple light. It rises from the heart, passes through the throat, and reaches the teeth, then returns to the stomach. After a long while, clearly visualize the heart and stomach, then exhale, rinse the mouth with saliva, and swallow it thirty-nine times.

Perform this three times a day: at dawn facing east, at noon facing south, and at dusk facing west.

**Method of Ingesting the Moon’s Rays**
At night, visualize the moon in the Mud Pill Palace, yellow in color, with ten rays of white light. It also reaches the teeth but does not emerge, returning instead to the stomach. This should also be performed three times a night, during the *hai*, *zi*, and *chou* hours. The moon, one *cun* in diameter, resides in the Cinnabar Field Palace, its ten white rays flowing into the mouth, then swallowed into the throat and stomach, allowing the white light to illuminate everything. Exhale, swallow saliva thirty-nine times, and visualize while lying down.

This is the method of the Lord of Western City, transmitted from the Central Teachings of Eastern Florescence, enabling the sun and moon to constantly illuminate the body, causing ghostly and primal beings to conceal their forms. Unceasing practice ensures protection and the vision of Great Peace.

**Method of Ingesting the Three Qi**
Daily, face the sun, close the eyes, and visualize green qi, white qi, and red qi, each like a thread, descending from the sun into the mouth. Inhale them ninety times until satiated, then stop.

With each inhalation, swallow once, allowing the three qi to enter the viscera. They branch and flow through, permeating everything; once the count is complete, the qi subsides.

This method was first received by Fan Jian of Dongyang and You Zhong from the High Prime Lord’s *Inner Radiance of Grand Simplicity*. Its effects are rare yet easily verified.

**Method of Ingesting Mist**
At dawn, within a quiet chamber, sit or lie as you wish. First close the eyes and inwardly visualize, faintly perceiving the five viscera. Then, facing the light, exhale through the mouth, emitting the five-colored qi twenty-four times, so that the eyes behold the five-colored qi intertwining and swirling before the face in a dense cloud. Next, inhale this five-colored qi through the mouth fifty times, then swallow saliva sixty times. Softly recite the incantation:

*"Great mist unfurls its radiance,
Spirit-mist traverses the four directions,
Coiling qi bends and twists,
Five colors illuminate the cavern-heaven.
Divine smoke converges and ascends,
Metal and stone blossom with true essence.
Purple emptiness gathers in lush abundance,
Refining form to preserve its wholeness.
Emerging from light, concealed in mystery,
The five numina transform and divide.
Conjoined brightness fans the void,
Riding the six clouds in harmony,
They gather and shield my body,
Ascending to the Nine Heavens."*

When finished, knock the teeth together seven times and swallow saliva seven times, then open the eyes.

This method was transmitted by the Mistress of the Enshrouded Terrace, the female perfected Zhang Weizi, as part of the Eastern Florescence teachings. Though it speaks of exhaling the viscera’s qi and is called "ingesting mist," the twenty-four exhalations are the viscera’s qi, which then harmonize with the misty qi of Heaven and Earth to re-enter the body—hence the sudden intake of fifty breaths.

**Method of Guarding the Mysterious and White**
At dawn, sit or lie as you wish. Visualize qi within the Mud-Pill Palace, white qi within the heart, and yellow qi within the navel. All three qi emerge like small beans, gradually growing larger, intertwining and merging into one to envelop the body. Then transform them into fire, which burns the body until inner and outer become as one, utterly luminous.

Continue from dawn until midday, then ingest qi one hundred twenty times to conclude.

This method was received by Du Guangping from the *Black-White Inner Radiance of Embryonic Essence* within the *Central Teachings of Jie Yan*. It repels all harm and grants immortality. First, abstain from sexual intercourse and all meat, the five pungent flavors, and other impure foods. After thirty years of practice, one may conceal the body and vanish, traveling five hundred *li* in a day.

**Method of Ingesting the Heart-Opening Talisman**
On the first day of the lunar cycle, the fifteenth, and the twenty-seventh, face the sun and write in cinnabar. Bow twice and recite the prayer:

*"Five spirits open the heart,
Piercing hearing to sever sound.
Three hun souls gather essence,
Firmly guarding the cinnabar heart.
Let me never forget,
As the five viscera roam afar."*

When finished, ingest the talisman, then swallow saliva five times and knock the teeth together five times. Do not let others witness this.

This method was taught by the Perfected Lord, from the *Heart-Opening Talisman of the Bright Hall’s Inner Canon*. Write the talisman in cinnabar on white paper beforehand, preparing about ten copies. On each appointed day, hold the talisman in the left hand while bowing and ingesting it.

**Great Exorcism Against Malevolence**
Whenever traversing perilous paths, passing through ghostly shrines, or encountering doubtful and difficult places, first press the tongue inward, swallow saliva three times, and with the second and third fingers of the left hand, pinch the area below the nostrils at the inner edge of the diaphragm thirty-six times—counting silently without lifting the fingers.

Knock the teeth together seven times, then press the palms over the nose. With eyes closed, softly recite the incantation:

*"Vermilion Bird soars through the heavens,
Divine might inwardly expands.
The four mountain springs stand guard,
Ghostly essences flee in terror.
The spirit-pool exhales its qi,
Evil roots cower and hide.
The soul-terrace shines with fourfold brightness,
The jade chamber resounds with tinkling jade.
The jade perfected stand majestic,
Seated to guard the Bright Hall.
Hands wave purple auroras,
Head crowned with dawn’s light.
Reciting the *Cavern Canon*,
Its thirty-nine chapters:
Within dwell the exorcising dragon and tiger,
Severing peaks and cleaving ridges.
Fierce beasts and stampeding oxen,
Clutching blades and devouring spears.
Uplifting mountains and tolling heaven,
Divine birds and venomous dragons,
Six-headed serpents spewing fire,
Devourers of ghost-kings.
Lightning walls and thunder’s father,
Seizing stars and streaming meteors.
Owls and krakens ablaze,
Defying winds to stride crosswise.
Celestial birds arrayed in ranks,
All stand beside me,
Spitting fire a myriad fathoms,
To dispel all misfortune.
Hosts of spirits clear the path,
Sealing and banishing mountain hamlets.
A thousand gods and a hundred numina,
All clasp hands and bow their heads.
Marshals and constables bear lamps,
Burning incense for me.
Wherever I go,
Ten thousand spirits welcome and serve."*

When finished, knock the teeth together three times, then open the eyes and remove the hands.

This comes from the *Highest Great Exorcism of the Grand Cavern*, summoning celestial beasts to guard and causing a thousand spirits to tremble and submit.

**Fengdu Great Exorcism**
First, with eyes closed, visualize the five viscera until fully present. Knock the teeth together thirty-six times, then recite the incantation, tapping the teeth once for every four words as a cadence:

*"Heavenly Vanguard, Heavenly Vanguard,
Nine Primes’ slayer of youths,
Five Ding marshals, High Diao Northern Duke,
Seven Governors, Eight Numinous Ones,
Grand Supreme expels the fierce.
Long-skulled giant beasts,
Hands grasping the Emperor’s bell.
White owls, three spirits,
Sternly driving leviathan dragons.
Mighty-sword spirit-kings,
Severing evil and erasing traces.
Purple qi ascends the heavens,
Cinnabar auroras surge and clash.
Devouring demons, consuming ghosts,
Bodies transverse to drink the wind.
Azure tongues, green teeth,
Four-eyed old men.
Heavenly Ding warriors,
Mightily subduing the southern fierce.
Heavenly couriers, fierce and keen,
Northern guardians biting blades.
Three hundred thousand soldiers,
Encircle me in ninefold ranks.
Repelling corpses a thousand *li*,
Dispelling all misfortune.
Dare any petty ghost
Approach to witness my form?
Heaven’s great axe,
Severing the five forms of ghosts.
Flame Emperor rends their flesh,
Northern Dipper burns their bones.
Four Brightnesses shatter their skeletons,
Heavenly Strategy annihilates their kind.
A single stroke of the divine blade—
Ten thousand ghosts scatter and dissolve."*

When finished, if reciting during daylight or night, or when afflicted by illness, this becomes a perpetual exorcism.

Ghosts that hear this incantation thrice shall perish with rotting eyes. It is said this is the secret incantation of the Northern Emperor of Fengdu, wherein all names are those of offices that behead ghosts. Kept secret, it becomes efficacious. Those who obtain this incantation and recite it constantly tread the Way of Undying.

**Six Palaces Incantation**
When about to retire at dusk, first face north and softly recite:
*"I am a disciple of the Most High, governing the Six Celestial Palaces below. These are my domains—not merely mine, but those ruled by the Most High. I know the names of the Six Celestial Gates, and thus attain long life. Should any dare transgress, the Most High shall sever you."*

First Palace: named the *Zhoujue Yintian Palace*;
Proceeding eastward, the Second Palace: named the *Dasha Liangshi Zongtian Palace*;
Third Palace: named the *Mingchen Naifan Wucheng Tian Palace*;
Fourth Palace: named the *Tianzhao Zuinqi Tian Palace*;
Fifth Palace: named the *Zongling Qifei Tian Palace*;
Sixth Palace: named the *Gansi Lianwanlü Tian Palace*.

Conclude by clicking the teeth six times, then recite the incantation thrice more before resting, thus repelling all ghostly and pernicious qi. It is said that those who know the names of the Six Celestial Gates of Fengdu shall find no harm from the hundred ghosts.

**Ode to Fengdu**
Xiang Liang of the city composed the *Ode to the Fengdu Palace*, saying:

Zhoujue marks the Dawn of Emperors,
Liangshi meets the Lofty Ridge,
Flaming like smoke in the clouds,
Surging as radiance in bloom,
Wucheng girds the divine blade,
Tianzhao swallows the Azure River,
Changhe overlooks the Cinnabar Well,
Cloud Gates rise in towering majesty,
Qifei links the wondrous canopy,
Lianwan spreads its demon-quelling might—
The Six Heavens bar the northern road,
Here is the abode of ghosts and spirits.

Recite these softly at night,
and you shall repel all ghosts.
These are the names of the Six Palace Gates,
and thus even ghosts fear them.
Wuyang and Wucheng are distinct,
yet one may invoke them as needed.
When traveling by night, click the teeth—
no fixed number, but the sound slays ghosts,
and wayward spirits ever dread the clicking of teeth.
If combined with rinsing the mouth and reciting incantations,
the effect is even better.

The Immortal’s method states:
Constantly swallow saliva and click the teeth
to make one grow younger.
Among worldly fools, fierce and stubborn ghosts
often take the form of women
to delude and test mortals.
Should you encounter such,
hold your breath,
envision the celestial pivot of Tian Guan,
the stars of Heng Fu,
summon your body’s spirits,
compose your countenance,
steady your will,
and gaze intently at the pupils of their eyes.
If they appear dim and murky,
it is a ghost’s test.
Swiftly visualize the Seven Stars before your face—
or above your head—to repel them.
It is fitting to use the Seven Stars’ Celestial Eye incantation,
and to visualize the Cavern Chamber and Bright Hall,
the inverted arc of sun and moon,
and the Perfected Lord Taiyi.
You may also invoke the Tianpeng and Vermilion Crow Palaces.
If the eyes are clear and upright,
it is an immortal or Daoist adept—
bow and entreat them.
Failing to recognize the true
is to fail the test.
To mistake the perverse for a Perfected One
is also to fail the test.
Be deeply cautious.

When passing through sacred shrines,
visualize within your mouth a Perfected One
named the Red Spirit Venerable,
attended by two jade maidens.
One maiden is named Hua Zheng,
the other She Jing.
The Venerable wears a red robe,
the maidens, yellow garments.
Then shout in command:
“Spirits of the shrine, hasten forth!
Let all perverse beings be brought
before the Red Spirit Venerable to be beheaded.
Let the host of evils retreat a thousand miles.”
This is the method of the Three Heavens’ vanguard for capturing ghosts.

Su Jun’s Transmitted Method for Conducting Affairs

The human head contains nine palaces. Three *fen* above the space between the eyebrows lies the *Shoucun* Palace. It has the Green Chamber and the Purple Portal, wherein two spirits reside. One *cun* above is the Bright Hall Palace, where the Luminous Youthful Perfected Official, the Luminous Mirror Spirit Lord, and the Luminous Female Perfected Official—three in all—reside. Two *cun* above is the Cavern Chamber Palace, where Wu Ying, Yellow Elder, and White Prime—three in all—reside. Three *cun* above is the Cinnabar Field and Mud-Pill Palace, where the Upper Prime Red Child and the Imperial Minister—two in all—reside. Four *cun* above is the Flowing Pearl Palace, where the Flowing Pearl Perfected Spirit resides. Five *cun* above is the Jade Emperor’s Palace, where the Jade Clarity Spirit Mother resides. One *cun* above the Bright Hall is the Heavenly Court Palace, where the Upper Clarity Perfected Maiden resides. One *cun* above the Cavern Chamber is the Ultimate Perfection Palace, where the Grand Ultimate Imperial Consort resides. One *cun* above the Cinnabar Field is the Mysterious Cinnabar Palace, where the Grand Unity Perfected Person resides. One *cun* above the Flowing Pearl is the Grand August Palace, where the Supreme Lord’s Queen resides.

In all, the head contains nine palaces, each one *cun* square. The Jade Emperor’s Palace, the Heavenly Court Palace, the Ultimate Perfection Palace, and the Grand August Palace are the four palaces of the feminine unity; their scriptures are transmitted only to those who have attained Perfection. The remaining five palaces have already circulated in the world, though the *Flowing Pearl Scripture* has not yet been seen.

The method of Guarding the One: On the midnight of the Beginning of Spring, sit facing east, close the breath, shut the eyes, clasp the fists upon the knees, and first visualize within the *Shoucun* Palace. On the left is the Crimson Terrace, within which is the Green Chamber, and in the chamber is a spirit clad in green robes, named Upright Heart, styled Cutting Square. On the right is the Yellow Gate, within which is the Purple Portal, and in the portal is a spirit clad in purple robes, named Tranquil Serenity, styled Dharma King. Both hold flowing golden bells. Call their names thrice and softly intone:

“Purple Portal and Green Chamber,
home to two great spirits,
hands grasping flowing bells,
bodies seated upon wind and cloud,
flanking and guarding the true Dao,
barring all that lies without.
Let my thoughts and perceptions
flow freely through the numinous gates,
entering and exiting with integrity,
ascending through the nine portals,
that I may behold the Nine Perfected,
the honored ones of the Supreme.”

Next, visualize within the Bright Hall Palace. On the left is the Luminous Youthful Perfected Official, named Mysterious Yang, styled Lesser Green. In the center is the Luminous Mirror Spirit Lord, named Illuminating Essence, styled Fourfold Brightness. On the right is the Luminous Female Perfected Official, named Subtle Yin, styled Lesser Prime. Their forms are all like those of infants, clad in green brocade robes, girdled with four crimson jade bells, mouths holding crimson jade mirrors. Kneeling upright and facing outward, they all exhale crimson *qi*, which envelops my body. Close the eyes and gently swallow it. Then make the jade bells ring, their sound reaching the Grand Ultimate. The mirrors emit crimson light ten thousand *zhang* long; in an instant, crimson *qi* coils about the body, transforming into fire that burns both within and without, merging light into one. Thereupon call their names thrice and click the teeth nine times.

If hungry or thirsty, visualize the three lords exhaling crimson *qi* into my mouth and inhale to swallow it. If walking in darkness, visualize the three lords emitting three beams of fire to illuminate the path ahead. If in peril or distress, also visualize the three lords ringing their jade bells, flashing and casting them forth.

Next, visualize within the Cavern Chamber Palace. On the left is the Lord of No-Florescence, wearing a lotus-flower crown, bearing a purple dawn canopy, and girded with flowing golden bells. Seated facing outward, softly intone:

“Three Primes’ flourishing *qi*,
Grand Mystery’s purple dawn,
Yellow Gate and Golden Chamber,
within dwell great spirits.
Lotus crown and purple canopy,
dragon robes with tiger patterns,
emerging from cinnabar, entering the void,
summoning yin and calling yang.
The Way of Heaven holds a truth,
named No-Florescence.
Support me, give me life,
and abide with me forever.”

Next, visualize on the right the Lord of White Prime, wearing a yellow dawn-flower crown, dragon-patterned robes, and girded with the Spirit Tiger Talisman. Seated facing outward, softly intone:

“Supreme divine essence,
right at the Gate of Spirit,
dragon robes and tiger sash,
yellow dawn-flower crown.
Holding registers and grasping scriptures,
this is White Prime.
Travel with me,
ascend to the Yang Barrier,
wander through the Nine Clarities,
and return to rest in the Yellow Chamber.”

This is the method of the Cavern Chamber.

Furthermore, regularly at the time of *qi*-generation after midnight, press the hands upon the knees, close the breath, shut the eyes, and inwardly gaze. Swallow saliva one hundred and twenty times, and visualize the Lord of No-Florescence, his attire and incantation as prescribed. Again, at sunrise, face east, bow twice, close the breath, shut the eyes, and inwardly gaze. Swallow saliva one hundred and twenty times, and visualize the Lord of White Prime, his attire and incantation as prescribed. Again, on the midnight after a *jiazi* day, let the hair down, apply powder, press the hands upon the knees, ingest *qi*, and swallow saliva one hundred and forty times. Then call the names of the two spirits. Listen inwardly for a response, as if someone answers, or for the sound of scripture recitation—this is the sign of resonance.

At the Beginning of Spring, face east; at the Beginning of Summer, face south; at the Beginning of Autumn, face west; at the Beginning of Winter, face north. On the midnight of the Spring Equinox, sit upright facing east, shut the eyes, and visualize the purple *qi* beneath the Northern Dipper, as thick as a bowstring, descending straight before me. Let the Three Ones, the Three Ministers, and myself—seven in all—with me at the center, all be enveloped. The handle of the Dipper’s seven stars points forward in a goose formation. Together we ride the purple *qi* upward to the Yang Brightness Star, enter, and sit together. All swallow the purple *qi* thirty times, then collectively inhale the green and purple *qi* descending from above, returning it to the Three Palaces. Focus the mind and visualize this, then intone:

“Three honored Perfected Ones,
lofty spirits of the Grand Mystery,
Yang Brightness governs spring,
ten thousand youths open the gates.
Cinnabar Prime governs summer,
crimson and purple merge in mist.
Yin Essence governs autumn,
heavenly might in sixfold array.
North Culmen governs winter,
ten thousand evils block and repel.
Five Earths’ seasonal lords,
the celestial barriers of *wu* and *ji*.
All that they shatter is destroyed,
all that they face is undefiled.
Refine my seven *po*,
harmonize my three *hun*,
nurture my five viscera,
that I may attain the true.
Ascend and fly to the Upper Clarity,
float upon the light of the Seven Primes.
Live long and journey forth,
whistle and command a thousand spirits.”

At the Summer Solstice, face south and ascend the Cinnabar Prime Star;

At the Autumn Equinox, face west and ascend the Yin Essence Star; at the Winter Solstice, face north and ascend the North Culmen Star—all according to this method. On the first or fifteenth day of the sixth month, to avoid the Summer Solstice and Autumn Equinox, face southwest, together ride the crimson, purple, azure, and yellow *qi*, and ascend the Celestial Barrier Star, swallowing each of the four-colored *qi* ten times. Begin with crimson, then proceed in order. This is called the Inner Method of the Five Dipper Stars.

On each *jian* day at dawn, visualize the Three Ones emerging from the Three Palaces and sitting before you, as if truly seen. Then rise slightly, bow twice, and intone:

“Heavenly Honored Three Emperors,
guardians of the Gate of Destiny,
roaming amidst the clouds,
the Six *Qi* in mysterious division.
Nurture my Five Spirits,
rectify my Three *Hun*,
let my Five Viscera flourish of themselves,
that I may attain long life and ascend as a flying immortal.”

Then visualize them returning from the void into the Three Palaces, and swallow saliva thirty times to conclude.

At midnight on the last day of the month, rise in secret and face north. Gaze up at the Northern Dipper, and visualize the Three Ones descending from the Auxiliary Star, each entering the Three Palaces within you. Then return to rest, silently visualize, and softly intone:

“Supreme Heavenly Auxiliary,
where the Three Emperors wander,
the Three Ministers in mutual support,
united with the Perfected.
Descend into my body,
settle in tranquil stillness,
exhale essence to bathe my form,
harmonize *hun* and *po* in softness,
that I may ascend as a flying immortal,
riding cloud chariots upon the floating light.”

Swallow saliva twenty times.

On each *kai* day at midnight, rise and sit facing east. Remove your headscarf—you may also loosen and comb your hair—then recite.

Softly intone:

“Supreme Three Perfected of the Upper Primordial,
the Infant within the Perfected,
completing love to open the mist,
ascending to commune with Heavenly Terrace,
the *Niwan* palace firm and congealed,
coeval with Heaven itself—
grant that I may ascend as a flying immortal,
exchanging steps upon the Terrace of Florescence.”

Swallow saliva nineteen times, then don the headscarf and retire to rest.

Further visualize the Three Ones and the Three Ministers, each seated facing within their respective palaces. The Three Ones exhale qi thirty times, and I likewise exhale thirty times in turn.

This visualization on the *kai* day of the *jianchu* cycle follows the same method as before, proceeding in order from guarding the inch to completing the names of the Three Palaces. Then adhere fully to the entire practice.

On the days of *jia-wu*, *jia-chen*, and *jia-yin*, at midnight, go out to the courtyard altar. Spread a mat one *zhang* above the ground, burn incense, face north, bow twice, and sit with hands resting upon the knees. Gaze up at the Northern Dipper and visualize purple qi issuing forth from the Dipper, entering the Three Palaces within you. The Three Ones, the Three Ministers, and yourself all ascend upon the purple qi to the North Star, body dissolving in rapture as if mounting the bed of Heaven.

Behold within the North Star the purple chambers and jade steps, the celestial officials arrayed in order—these seven attendants before the Emperor, seated in discourse on the Dao. Request the boon of flying immortality, and bow in reverence with the heart. Then return to rest.

The North Emperor is the Supreme One of the Upper Clarity; his separate chamber resides within the Great Ultimate.

Next, face north and visualize within the Palace of the Mysterious Elixir a purple chamber and verdant chamber, suffused with crimson mist. There sits the Perfected Lord of the Great One, named *Guiying*, styled *Huaxuan*. His form is like that of an infant, clad in a purple embroidered brocade robe, a belt of flowing gold and fire-bells at his waist. In his left hand he holds the handle of the Northern Dipper, and in his right, the net of the North Star. He sits facing outward upon a golden bed within a jade canopy. Visualize him clearly.

Then visualize the purple qi of the North Star descending into the palace, brimming over to envelop the body in a penetrating, all-pervading union. Further visualize the sun entering the palace, resting at the center of the purple qi, radiant and warm. Then visualize the Perfected Lord of the Great One descending from the purple qi of the North Star to sit within the sun. Suddenly ascend and sit facing him, bow twice with the heart, prostrate at his knees, and inquire of the Dao to seek immortality.

Thereupon swallow the purple qi thirty times and swallow saliva thirty times. Again visualize within the Northern Dipper a red qi like a bowstring, descending directly into the Three Palaces. The Great One and I then together mount the sun and ride the red qi to repose within the Dipper’s bowl. Then retire to rest.

This method may also be practiced alone, without awaiting the Three Ones.

On the first, third, seventh, eleventh, and fifteenth days of the month, at midnight, visualize the Perfected Lord of the Great One—his name, attire, and colors as before—seated facing outward. From his mouth issues forth blue-green qi, which enters your own mouth; swallow it fifty times. Swallow saliva fifty times and softly intone:

“Supreme Perfected August One,
Purple Lord of the Central August,
whose tabooed name is *Guiying*,
whose style is *Huaxuan*,
seated upon a golden bed within a jade canopy,
robed in purple embroidered brocade,
girded with fire-bells,
slaying demons and vanquishing treachery,
holding the essence of the stars in hand,
the sun’s perfection crowning his head—
rightly seated, he exhales qi,
granting that I may swallow and imbibe,
converse with me as a companion,
feast together in the Mysterious Elixir,
temper and bathe the seven *po*,
harmonize and soften the three *hun*,
spirits and numina attending in guard,
that I may ascend as a flying immortal,
the five viscera self-generating,
restoring the youthful countenance of a child,
receiving scriptures of the Upper Clarity,
appointed as an official of the Lord of Destiny,
all wishes and desires fulfilled,
a hundred blessings ever renewed.”

Visualize yourself ascending into the palace to repose before the Great One. Then lie down to sleep.

For the practice of Guarding the One, rise each day and swallow saliva thirty times, visualizing it as crimson. Then rub your face and ears with your hands until warm. On days not designated for visualization, simply maintain the Three Ones seated peacefully within the Three Palaces. As for the Mysterious Palace, visualize often without neglect.

Should you suddenly sense strange or foul sensations around your head and neck, it means malign qi has entered. Immediately lie down, close your eyes, and visualize the Great One of the Mysterious Elixir Palace, wielding a flowing fire-bell to cast it forth, driving the malign qi out through the ears. Let the fire’s radiance follow, illuminating your entire body until you fully recover.

If your ears suddenly ring, it signals other ghosts or malevolent spirits attempting entry. Guard the three spirits of the inch, summoning the ear spirits Jiao Nü and Yun Yi to sound the chime-bells in vigilance. Cross your hands to cover your ears and intone:
“The Red Child dwells within the palace,
the Nine Perfected abide in the chamber.
Hearken to the divine command,
discern all that is inauspicious.
The flowing fire of the Great One
shall extinguish the ten thousand evils.”
Point your fingers to your ear gates seven times.

Before eating or drinking, first visualize the One partaking of the meal, then proceed to eat. Upon finishing, silently intone:
“As the hundred grains enter my stomach,
they merge with the spirit’s qi,
filling and replenishing blood and fluids.
The corpse-demons and malevolence perish,
I shall live as long as heaven and earth,
ascend to the Golden Towers,
command the Six Dings,
with divine youths attending in guard.”

Regularly face the newly risen moon and bow twice, silently intoning:
“Dark essence of the Great Yin,
Lady of the Radiant Moon,
as your nascent light streams forth,
illumine my Three Palaces.
May I ascend as an immortal,
soaring high through the eight directions,
wherever I turn, may fortune and divine favor abide.”

On the days of the Eight Nodes, inscribe the True Talismans of the Three Origins in cinnabar. At dawn, face the sun, consume one talisman, and bow twice. Offer prayers as your heart desires. Begin on the first day of the lunar month and cease on the sixteenth, resuming with the next node as before. Also inscribe on white silk, place it in a brocade pouch, and wear it upon your head. After five years, you shall meet the True One.

On the first dawn of the new year, inscribe the Precious Chapter in blue-green ink, face north, bow twice, and swallow it. Also inscribe on white silk and wear it upon your left elbow. After eight years, the Three Ones shall all come to meet you. Take a gold tablet, nine inches long, four inches wide, and three fen thick, engrave it, and seal the spirits of the Five Peaks Mountain within your palm.

The method of refining form from the Red General Zi: at night, close your eyes, draw in light through your mouth, and visualize your body burning, permeated inside and out like fire. Practice this for three years, and you shall be able to enter fire. This is the Zhou Lord’s formula.

The method of guarding the Three Origins and True One within the Five Pecks of Grain: refine your essence for three months, and you shall faintly perceive your form attaining longevity. Guard the True Lord of the Mysterious Elixir for fourteen years, and you shall ascend with the Great One to the Web of the Seven Origins. After sixteen years, you shall reach the Upper Clarity, granted eighteen jade boys and eighteen jade maidens.

The Mao Lord’s transmitted method of practice:
The method of visualizing the Mysterious Perfected in the Hall of Light: in a quiet chamber, at dawn, close your eyes, place your hands upon your knees, and visualize the sun by day and the moon by night—each as large as a ring, positioned nine feet before your mouth. The sun’s color is crimson, with nine rays of purple light; the moon’s color is yellow, with ten rays of white light, straight as strings, entering your mouth. Within the sun and moon dwells the Jade Maiden of the Great Mystery and Upper Mystery’s Vermilion Mist, named Chan Xuan, styled Mi Zhen. She wears a crown of purple hibiscus and a robe of red brocade, facing you directly. She declares her name and title, then exhales crimson qi into your mouth. As she exhales, you swallow ninety times, sensing the sun and moon gradually nearing your face. The Jade Maiden’s mouth joins with yours, her qi and fluids entering your mouth. Silently intone:
“Purple Perfected of the Grand Empyrean,
Yin spirit of the Hall of Light,
essence born of sun and moon,
Jade Maiden Chan Xuan,
first sprung from divine birth,
styled Mi Zhen,
her head wrapped in purple blossoms,
crowned with a hibiscus spirit-diadem,
her body draped in brocade,
robed in vermilion flying skirts,
emerging from the sun, entering the moon,
her celestial radiance profound and fragrant.
From her mouth exhales crimson qi,
irrigating my Three Origins.
My face beholds the Heavenly Well,
softening the *po* and restraining the *hun*,
mysterious fluids flowing,
the embryo’s essence perfected and whole.
The five viscera bloom with splendor,
reversing age to restore a child’s countenance.
Overseeing the ten thousand spirits,
appointed as an official of the Lord of Destiny, ascending as a flying immortal.”

Visualize the Jade Maiden’s mouth pouring fluids into yours, rinse and swallow them ninety times. If unable to perform this at the appointed time, visualize the Two Radiant Ones returning to the Hall of Light, the sun to the left and the moon to the right, their brilliance merging with the pupils of your eyes.

On the first day of the lunar month and your own life-day, at midnight face east. Inscribe the Yang Talisman in cinnabar on blue-green paper and the Yin Talisman in yellow on blue-green paper. Then close your eyes and visualize the sun’s purple light and the moon’s yellow qi within the Hall of Light, illuminating your entire body. With your left hand, hold the Yang Talisman, hold your breath, and silently intone:
“The Two Radiant Ones stream their essence,
their light suffusing my form.
To the left, I gather the sun’s splendor,
to the right, I pluck the moon’s blossoms.
Merging the two qi,
irrigating the Three Fields.
Flying mists and mysterious radiance
fortify my numinous root,
granting me long life,
coeval with heaven and earth.”

Consume the talisman, then bow twice. With your right hand, hold the Yin Talisman, hold your breath, and silently intone:
“Yellow qi of Yin’s splendor,
Yang’s essence luminous and fresh.
The five spirits refined and softened,
the Three Lefts firming the fluids.
The Two Radiant Ones gleam resplendent,
flowing mists irrigating the Perfected.
Yin and Yang’s qi interpenetrate,
revolving yellow to infuse the cinnabar.
My entire body transmutes,
ascending to the imperial palace.”

Consume the talisman, then bow twice. Practice the Way of the Mysterious Perfected for five years, and the Jade Maiden of the Great Mystery shall descend, subject to your command, communicating with spirits and attaining the Perfected. Your body shall glow with jade’s radiance, you shall command the ten thousand spirits, and ascend to the Jade Chamber.

The Wang Lord’s transmitted method of practice:
At the time of arising qi, sit or lie as you wish. Knock your teeth nine times and silently intone:
“Azure Teeth of the East,
purple clouds streaming with mist,
the Three Pristine Ones lingering,
mysterious frost and jade gauze.
Consume the morning’s radiance,
drink the dawn’s blossoms.”
Press your tongue against the outer edge of your upper lip, gather fluids, and swallow thirty times. Then knock your teeth nine times and intone:

To the Vermilion Cinnabar of the South,
where dawn’s radiance meets the Grand Tenuity,
ninefold crimson mists scatter luminous splendor—
consume the numinous morning,
drink from the Cinnabar Pool.
Press your tongue against the outer edge of your lower lip, gather fluids, and swallow thirty times.

Then knock your teeth nine times and intone:
To the Luminous Stone of the West,
where flying auroras become golden liquor—
consume the Grand Clarity,
essence of pristine clouds,
drink the Jade Liquid,
as divine radiance awakens the spirit,
that I may ascend the void,
rising to the highest purity.
Press your tongue against the inner edge of your upper lip, gather fluids, and swallow thirty times.

Then knock your teeth nine times and intone:
To the Mysterious Nourishment of the North,
where blessed spirits quicken the embryo,
green auroras unfold at dawn,
purple canopies and azure banners—
consume the Cinnabar Flower,
drink the Nectar of Jade.
Press your tongue along the inner edge of your lower lip, gather fluids, and swallow thirty times.

Then knock your teeth nine times and intone:
At the origin of Wu and Ji,
where yellow and pristine fivefold clouds arise,
four auroras and purple visions,
eight luminaries and nine dawns—
divide the radiant brilliance,
seven luminaries and numinous lords,
harmonize essence and irrigate qi,
consume the Central Origin,
the dragon-embryo of jade splendor,
drink from the Sweet Spring.
Rinse your mouth, swirling fluids between teeth and tongue, and swallow forty times.

This may be practiced after midnight.

The Wei Lady’s transmitted method of practice:
At dusk, burn incense and recite the *Huangting Neijing Jing* once. There is a separate scroll of scriptural instructions.

For the morning and evening audience in stillness, follow the regular practice without need for elaboration. On one’s fate-day, after the Jia-Wu day, count ninety days to reach the Jia-Zi day—on these two days, at dawn, enter stillness, burn incense, and face north to pay homage to the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. Silently intone:
“I, [Name], humble mortal of dust and clay, respectfully bow twice and pay homage before the Jade Tower and Purple Palace of the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. May I attain long life as a divine immortal, fulfill all desires and wishes, and have my name inscribed on the Purple Register of the Life-Spirit, recorded by the Jade Sovereign. May I become a paragon among beings and ascend as an immortal to transcend the world.”
Bow twice.

After the first day of the first month, count one hundred eighty-two days, then at midnight enter stillness, burn incense, and pay homage to the Most High Jade Dawn Lord of the Great Dao. Kneel and silently intone:
“I, [Name], humble mortal, respectfully bow twice before the Jade Tower of the Most High and Lofty Sage. I beseech that the Life-Spirit be notified to inscribe my name for long life. May all my wishes and endeavors come to fruition, and may I, as a divine immortal or flying immortal, feast in the Nine Heavens.”
Bow twice.

For these three practices, first purify and fast for one day, wear separate garments, and enter stillness before proceeding. Whenever entering stillness, first cleanse the mouth and hold the breath. Upon entering the chamber, step forward with the right foot first, then bring the left foot forward to join it before proceeding. When exiting, do not look back; rinse the mouth and withdraw.

Reciting the *Huangting Jing* ten thousand times will reveal the five viscera, granting long life without death. Practicing these three audience rites will free one from illness and calamity, preventing death. After eighteen years, one ascends as an immortal.

The Precious Method for Cultivating the Spirit:
Rub your palms together until warm, then wipe your face in circular motions until it is warm and glowing, preventing wrinkles and blemishes.

From the *Taisu Danjing Jing*.

On the fifth, fifteenth, twenty-fifth, and twenty-ninth days of the lunar month, at midnight, visualize the solar image entering through the mouth and residing within the heart, illuminating the heart’s inner radiance. Recite the incantation:

*"Great luminosity nurtures essence,
Within, the cinnabar heart is refined.
Radiance and splendor merge in reflection,
Divine perfected ones come to seek."*

Swallow the saliva nine times. This may also be practiced daily, not solely on these four days. It sharpens perception and insight, and the body emanates a golden luster.

From the *Tai Shang Xiao Mo Jing*.

When rising from bed or sitting upright, first gather both hands, then cross them to cover the nape. Tilt the head back and resist with the hands three or four times. Next, bend and move the body, stretch the limbs to their utmost, arch backward, and twist to the sides, loosening all joints three times.

From the *Tai Shang Dong Jing Jing*.

Regularly press the small cavities behind the eyebrows thirty-nine times with the hands. Then, with the palms and fingers, massage the area beneath the eyes and above the cheekbones. Rotate the ears thirty times with the hands. Finally, starting from the midpoint between the eyebrows, sweep the hands upward across the forehead into the hairline thirty-nine times. Internally visualize the twin luminaries of the sun and moon held by the infant spirit, with joy in the Upper Prime. Swallow the saliva at the corners of the mouth. This unblocks the flow of blood and qi, prevents wrinkles, and with prolonged practice, grants clear perception of the hundred spirits.

From Pei Jun’s *Baoshen Jing*.

Here ends the lower scroll of the *Shangqing Wozhong Jue*.
