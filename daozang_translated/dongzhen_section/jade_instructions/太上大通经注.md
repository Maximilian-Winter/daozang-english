**The Supreme Great Permeation Scripture with Commentary**
*Commentary by Li Daochun, the Firefly-in-the-Clear-Hermitage Learner of Duliang*

"Supreme" (*Taishang*) signifies that which is unsurpassably high; "Great Permeation" (*Datong*) signifies that which is unobstructed in all things. "Scripture" (*Jing*) denotes the path to ascending to truth, the Way traversed by all. The opening chapter speaks of "formless and bodiless," referring to the wondrous principle of true emptiness—the subtlest marvel of the supreme vehicle—embodying the meaning of *Taishang*. The next chapter speaks of "like space, without characteristics," referring to the unimpeded flow in all four directions and eight reaches, embodying the meaning of *Datong*. The following chapter speaks of "without characteristics, without action, boundlessly vast," referring to the Way’s utmost breadth and greatness, its infinite subtlety. In daily use, it manifests everywhere—this is why it is called a *scripture*.

It is born before Heaven, revealing itself in *ren* (benevolence).
Born yet without form, it is stored in function.
It abides after Heaven, and what abides is spirit.
Abiding yet without body, spirit has no fixed direction, and the formless is without substance.
Yet being without substance, yin and yang are unfathomable.
It has never truly abided.
Its transformations are ceaseless.
Thus it is said to be inconceivable.
Its wondrous functioning is inexhaustible.

**Above: The Chapter on True Emptiness.**
It is the origin of the Way.

The Master said: "Does Heaven speak? The four seasons proceed, and the hundred things are born." This is the meaning of "born before Heaven, born yet without form." *The Doctrine of the Mean* says: "Looked at but not seen, listened to but not heard, it embodies things yet cannot be defied." This is the meaning of "abides after Heaven, abiding yet without body." Yet being without body, its transformations and creations are endless. Who but those who exhaust principle and fulfill their nature can partake of this? Thus, the chapter on mysterious principle is imparted.

Stillness is its nature, utterly quiescent and unmoving.
The mind is within it.
Stimulated, it then permeates all.
Movement is its mind; seeing things, one sees the mind.
Nature is within it.
Without things, the mind is not seen.
When the mind arises, nature vanishes—when the mind arises, the myriad dharmas arise.
When the mind vanishes, nature appears—when the mind vanishes, the myriad dharmas vanish.
Like space, without characteristics; the great image without form.
Limpid, perfect, and complete.
Permeating above and penetrating below.

**Above: The Chapter on Mysterious Principle.**
It is the origin of nature.

*The Doctrine of the Mean* says: "Before joy, anger, sorrow, and delight are aroused, it is called the center. The center is the great root of the world." This is the meaning of "stillness is its nature." It also says: "Aroused yet all in accord with measure, it is called harmony. Harmony is the universal Way of the world." This is the meaning of "movement is its mind." Nature is fundamentally still; without the mind, it is not seen. The mind is fundamentally still; without movement, it is not seen. Through things, the mind is seen; through the concealed mind, nature is seen. When nature is quiescent, Heaven is known—this is called *permeation*. If the mind turns with things, nature is thus forgotten. Thus it is said: "When the mind arises, nature vanishes." If one conceals the mind and enters quiescence, nature is thus revealed. Thus it is said: "When the mind vanishes, nature appears." Nature is like empty space: whether moving or still, it is ever quiescent; whether seen or unseen, it is ever luminous. All things come to disturb it, like a wisp of cloud touching empty space—even the Great Clarity is stained. But emptiness does not receive the stain, so it remains limpid, perfect, and complete. My nature and Heaven are also thus.

The Great Way is without characteristics, thus it inwardly gathers into being.
Cultivate its imagelessness, and its image thus endures.
True nature is without action, thus it outwardly does not give rise to the mind.
Without employing the mind, the mind thus endures.
Thus and so, naturally, boundlessly vast.
Without action, there is nothing it does not permeate.
Facing circumstances, forget circumstances—do not sink into the demons of the six thieves.
I do not pursue circumstances, so circumstances do not interfere with me.
Dwelling in dust yet transcending dust—do not fall into the transformations of the myriad conditions.
I do not establish dust, so dust does not defile me.
Attaining stillness, it is unmoving—great samadhi.
Attaining harmony, it is unchanging—great wisdom.
Wisdom illuminates the ten directions—great luminosity.
Empty, it transforms without action—great permeation.

**Above: The Chapter on Mysterious Wonder.**
It clarifies the principle of the Way, thus following the chapter on mysterious principle.

*The Scripture of Penetrating Antiquity* says: "Cultivate its imagelessness, and its image thus endures." This is the meaning of "the Great Way is without characteristics." Mencius said: "Act without action, and there is nothing that is not done." This is the meaning of "true nature is without action." Inwardly without characteristics, it is thus and so, naturally; outwardly without action, it is vast and all-embracing. The Patriarch said: "The cinnabar field holds treasure—why seek the Way elsewhere? Facing circumstances without mind—why ask about Chan?" This is the meaning. Facing circumstances, forget circumstances—what demons could there be? Dwelling in dust yet transcending dust—what conditions could there be? When conditions cease, nature is still; when demons cease, the mind is harmonious. Attaining stillness, it is unmoving; attaining harmony, it is unchanging. Holding to these two principles, one is perfectly luminous and universally illuminating, spiritually transforming without limit.

**Verse:**
With dharmas, awaken to the absence of dharmas—when the mind follows dharmas, dharmas follow the mind’s vanishing.
Without cultivation, understand cultivation—nature is fundamentally uncultivated; cultivation is not nature.
Embracing the ten thousand images, the body—when the mind is empty and nature is quiescent, there is nothing it does not contain.
Not clinging to a single thread—if one is stained by even a speck of dust, it becomes leakage.

**Above: Verse.**
It speaks of its essence and function.

The essence is nonbeing, while its function is being. Thus, from the existence of dharmas comes sudden awakening to the absence of dharmas; through the absence of cultivation, one sees through the illusion of cultivation. When being and nonbeing are no longer established, mind and dharmas are both forgotten. The essence becomes one with the Great Void, all-encompassing and boundless—here, the principle of the Great Dao is fully realized.

*Thus concludes the commentary on the* **Taishang Datong Jing.**
