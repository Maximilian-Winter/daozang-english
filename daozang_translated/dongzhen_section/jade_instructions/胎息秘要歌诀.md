**Esoteric Songs and Formulas of Embryonic Breathing**

**Holding the Breath**
Should illness suddenly strike or harm befall without cause,
Withdraw the mind to a quiet chamber, remove your robes, and leave the outer bed.
Lie supine, clench the fists, knock the teeth, and burn incense.
Thirty-six swallows suffice; the qi of the Cinnabar Field will then exceed the norm.
Guide it with the mind to reach the afflicted part—most efficacious for healing.
Cease when sweat appears; no need to seek remedies far and wide.

**Projecting Qi to Heal Others’ Illnesses**
When the Dao is cultivated with long and focused dedication,
Embryonic breathing takes form within the body.
If others suffer from illness, discern the affected organ or viscus.
Face the patient toward the kingly qi, calm the mind, and do not act lightly.
Transmit true qi and have them swallow it, ensuring they take in several consecutive breaths.
Focus the mind to direct it to the afflicted area, and the suffering will swiftly dissipate.
Ghosts and spirits will flee of their own accord; the illness will unravel its coils.

**The Six Qi: Cease When Illness Subsides, Lest the Heart-Qi Be Harmed**
One: The *Yan* swallow—most numinous in its response. Keep it secret.
Externally linked to the root of the nose, internally connected to the lungs.
For chills, fever, fatigue, oppression, and skin sores,
This exhalation and inhalation will remedy all.

Two: The *He* sigh—governed by the heart, the sovereign.
For dry mouth, parched tongue, and vexing heat,
Assess the severity of the illness and sigh accordingly;
The scorched viscera will harmonize and dissipate of themselves.

Three: The *Hu* breath—governed by the spleen, the spirit of earth.
For vexing heat, qi distension, and a drum-like abdomen,
For obstructed limbs and stagnant qi,
Exhale with *Hu* to restore order as before.

Four: The *Xu* hiss—governed by the liver, the spirit of the eyes.
For red nebulae, dimness, and tears like weeping,
All due to liver heat surging upward,
Hiss with *Xu* to swiftly cure the affliction.

Five: The *Chui* puff—governed by the kidneys, the storehouse of the ears.
For aching waist and knees, frequent cold, and impotence,
Gently expel qi with *Chui*;
No need to seek remedies beyond.

Six: The *Xi* sigh—governed by the Triple Burner when illness arises.
For all disharmonious qi of the Triple Burner,
Which harms its function,
Simply sigh with *Xi* to restore balance.

**Regulating Fluids**
People consume the five flavors, causing stagnation and blockage in the Triple Burner.
When heat is extreme, bitterness and astringency prevail; when cold abounds, water is plentiful.
Use primordial qi to heal—no need to consult alchemical gourds.
Heat retreats with *He*; cold dissipates with *Chui*.
Frequently rinse the mouth and swallow; the fluids will naturally harmonize.
If this proves effective, cold and heat will both recede by dawn.

**Dietary Recommendations**
For those who cultivate the Dao and seek to perceive the true,
Only consume what is suitable amid hunger.
A bland congee at dawn will quench thirst;
Sesame oil moistens the throat and suffices for fluids.
Among grains, rice is most fitting;
Bland noodles and steamed buns are also beneficial.
Good wine, when drunk, disperses the vital qi.

Fresh pepper, when consumed, stills a hundred illnesses.
Before eating, swallow six or seven times;
Let food be the primary measure.
After the meal, exhale three to five times with *He*
To prevent toxic qi from vexing the chest and diaphragm.

**Miscellaneous Dietary Prohibitions**
In a secluded chamber, avoid drafts;
On a high bed, escape the breath of ghosts.
Preserve essence to benefit the body; safeguard qi to spare the life.
Restrain joy and anger; let go of thoughts of profit and fame.

Avoid the flesh of creatures with claws or talons—
Such blood and meat can all endanger life.
Meat and strong flavors corrupt the qi; hunger and satiety are the same.
Be cautious with raw, hard, and cold foods; sour, salty, and pungent are inadvisable.

Refrain from activity during rain, clouds, wind, thunder, and lightning.
Avoid radish soup; do not scorn plain congee.
Furthermore, shun hot foods; do not indulge in melons and fruits.
Stale and foul things are harmful; the impure and putrid offer no benefit.
Guard against swallowing them; do not doubt the qi.

**Abstaining from Grain**
If a thousand days of practice do not waver,
The corpse worms within will gradually perish.
The Three Cinnabar Fields will become full and robust;
The hundred bones and joints will grow firm.
Simply contemplate the cause of fasting and cease consuming flavors.
When the abdomen is empty, swallow down to the navel’s pivot;
Let the primordial qi serve as your sustenance.
When sated, calm the mind and diligently guard the center.
When hungry, hold the breath and refrain from speech.
With such perseverance, success will come in time.
Only then will you trust that nurturing life lies in secret formulas—
How can it compare to the ordinary folk who consume medicines,
Endlessly refining and cultivating without respite?
Their toil exhausts the power of drugs, all in vain.
Stubbornly enduring hunger without true mastery—
How can it rival the constant ingestion of the essence of Grand Harmony,
Which brings clarity, purity, and radiant joy?
If you covet external beauty and disrupt the primal origin,
A hundred illnesses will assail the body, and you will grow ever weaker.

**Vigilant Preservation**
Essence and qi must be firmly guarded with vigilance
To benefit the body, preserve life, and attain longevity.
Many are those who indulge in desires and ruin their forms—
Who is willing to eliminate them and fully attain eternal life?
Worrying about illness before it comes makes it hard to manifest;
After disaster strikes, can it be averted?
Only when facing death does one regret endangering the body—
Too late to gnaw the navel when the body has already decayed.
Even if you diligently cultivate embryonic breathing,
Failure to sever desire will still bring misfortune.
Only with the elixir of yin and the attainment of the Dao is perfection achieved—
How many such people exist in the world?

**Nine Years of Transformation**
Qi, blood, vessels, flesh, and marrow,
Sinews, bones, hair, and form—all arise in sequence.
To reverse aging and restore youthful splendor,
One year for each transformation, nine years in all.

First, sit upright, settle the mind, close the eyes, and still the breath.
Then beat the Heavenly Drum thirty-two times.
With the tongue, stroke the outer upper lip nine times,
Then the outer lower lip nine times,
Next the inner upper lip nine times,
And the inner lower lip nine times.
The outer upper lip corresponds to the south,
The outer lower lip to the north,
The inner upper lip to the east,
The inner lower lip to the west.
The tongue pressed against the palate serves as the center.
When the mouth is full of saliva, swallow forcefully twenty-one times,
Gently expelling a little through the nose.
When swallowing, the throat should gurgle—*ai-ai*—
As if the fluid and qi are entering the Lower Cinnabar Field.
Do this three to five times.
When swallowing, wait for the qi to be exhaled before doing so.
