**Preface to the *Jade Exegesis and Phonetic Gloss of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Perfected Scripture***

Composed by Chen Jingyuan, Disciple of the Three Radiant Caverns of the Great Cavern, Perfected Master of True Stillness, and Recipient of the Purple Robe

The *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Perfected Scripture* hold a title of solemn reverence, standing foremost among the Three Caverns’ treasured scriptures. Its numinous verses and secret incantations, sealed in jade tablets and concealed in hidden writings, are recorded in full detail.

Since the Western City’s Lord of Total Perfection and the Southern Culmen’s Purple Prime Lady bestowed it upon the Perfected One of Pure Emptiness, who in turn transmitted it to Madame Wei of Southern Marchmount, it has been said: “Should you not dwell in the mountains, concealing yourself in pure retreat and voiding the center through breath-regulation, then the *Great Cavern Perfected Scripture* must not be recited recklessly.”

The reason for this is that its wondrous tones resonate through nine heavens, its true sounds soar in lofty chant. The qi of its text intermingles with the Jade Void in profound mystery, its rosy savor harmonizes with the Great Yang in full splendor. When lips move to utter it, jade efflorescence instantly arrives; when its sacred lines are intoned, one joins in covenant with the Most High. In stillness, with hands clasped in reverence, the Purple Chamber reveals itself; in focused contemplation of one’s aspirations, all kindred spirits respond in resonance.

Thus, the seven ancestors gain blessings, receive registers of immortal palaces, transcend the ranks of hidden ghosts, and together feast in the Vermilion Mound. This scripture’s sublimity soars, steering the chariot of dawn’s ascent, riding the Way of the luminous dragon—far beyond the reach of those mired in the dust of mundane custom.

Should one recite it while still entangled in worldly affairs, the Three Officials and the Northern Emperor will disrupt its tones, and the radiant listener, tainted by impure qi, will fail to attain the resplendent resonance of Supreme Clarity or harmonize the voice with the numinous chambers of the Purple Culmen.

The *Azure Essentials and Purple Writ* of the Central Yellow Venerable Lord states: “To behold the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Perfected Scripture* is to ascend to heaven in broad daylight.” Yet some who cultivate it accumulate years without fruition and then claim the scripture is not true. This is entirely due to their names lacking inscription on the Golden Tablet of the Eastern Flower or the Jade Slip of the Golden Watchtower. The true numina do not descend for them, and instead, celestial demons approach, resulting in no responsive efficacy. Though they may obtain spirit-scriptures, they will never succeed.

Had they first memorialized the Golden Tablet to the Azure Palace and presented the Jade Slip to the Thearch-Emperor, securing the attendance of the Golden Dawn Jade Lads and the Western Flower Jade Maidens to guard the numinous text, and had all heavens and earths, the three realms, praised and chanted its verses ten thousand times—how could they not have evoked the response of the jade chariot and purple carriage?

Since this scripture descended into the world, only the Perfected Yang and Xu of Mount Juqu and Master Sima the Refiner of Mount Wangwu, along with successive generations of eminent Daoist adepts, have adhered to its precepts, transmitting it through sworn covenants. The oral instructions for its recitation and the esoteric subtleties of its integration were secretly imparted, enabling them to inscribe their names in the golden register and tread the luminous paths of Supreme Clarity.

Yet today, the true wind has scattered and faded, false recluses dwell in mountain retreats, the standards of the Dao are unheard, the rites between master and disciple have lapsed, and the teachings have declined—nothing is more grievous than this.

Jingyuan left home in childhood, sought the Dao in youth, and wandered for thirty years, presiding over the essentials for over a decade. In old age, I returned to Mount Mao, built a hut, and engaged in repentance. I lamented my meager karmic affinity for the Dao and the weight of my worldly karma. Though I diligently studied the scriptures, I never encountered a true master. How could I dare unseal and recite the Cavern Scripture?

Thus, I purified body and mind, devoted myself to reverence and purity, and broadly sought ancient editions. First, I examined and verified them myself, poring over them in silence, repeatedly analyzing and constructing their meaning. Not a single phrase or character was overlooked.

Yet where two interpretations clashed, my perplexity only deepened—such as the case of *fa* (發) being miswritten as *fa yan* (發煙). Or where characters were altered in their components or forms, becoming confused and inconsistent—such as *qi* (栖) written as *@*, or *@* written as *ge* (歌).

This is because private copyists and illicit transmissions have perpetuated errors through successive generations. I have therefore taken the editions used by earlier practitioners—the Three Caverns Dharma Master, Master of Mystical Observation, Zhu Ziying, and the Three Caverns Dharma Master, Grand Master of Profound Mystery, Huangfu Xiji, both reciters of the Cavern Scripture and contemporaries of the Tiansheng era—as well as the editions preserved at Mount Mao’s repository. Comparing them with the hidden writings, I have compiled this phonetic gloss and exegesis, elucidating discrepancies and roughly resolving doubts. I dare not present this as definitive Dharma teaching, but merely record what I have examined for my own reference.

After three months of purifying my heart in retreat, I transcribed a copy of the *Jade Exegesis of the Cavern Scripture*, which I now reverently contemplate morning and evening. I await the numinous ones to bestow it according to the proper precepts, thereby fulfilling my long-cherished aspiration.

The Mao Shan manuscript omits *元素*. This translation follows the Mao Shan manuscript.

Male and Female Entrust Spirit to Transformation: some versions write *奇* (*qí*) for *寄* (*jì*).

Hundred Primes: pronounced *qí hún qiè* (奇混切). Ancient versions write *混* (*hùn*) as *矫* (*jiǎo*). All ascend to the Imperial Hall Assembly.

Seven Awakenings Uphold the Dao’s Numerology: According to the *Jade Annotations of the Dao Lord*, the Seven Awakenings deeply comprehend the obscure and brightly seek the dawn’s obscurity. Once the heart is illuminated, one knows to pursue the *Dao’s Numerology*. *Dao’s Numerology* refers to the affairs of the *Great Cavern Unity of the Perfected Sovereign*. Some versions write *Seven Awakenings Uphold Numerology Dao*, which is likely erroneous.

Whirlwinds Gather at the Northern Flourishing Hua, Purple Blossoms Sing at the Eastern *＠*, Jade Chimes Harmonize Beyond the Nine Skies, Jade Tallies Summon the Grand Tenuity. The character *＠* is not included in the rhyme schemes of this text, and no pronunciation can be provided. According to the *Scripture on Dispelling Demons, Entering Samadhi Chapter*: *Whirlwinds gleam at the flourishing Lang Hua, Purple Cassia how serene! Jade fruits resound beyond the Nine Skies, Jade tablets summon the Grand Tenuity.* The meaning aligns with the *Cavern Scripture*, suggesting *＠* is a scribal error for *栖* (*qī*).

Luminous Splendor: pronounced *yū wù qiè* (纡勿切). Shi Chong pronounces it *yū wèi qiè* (纡胃切), meaning "elegance." Subsequent instances follow this.

This translation follows Huangfu’s version as *灵* (*líng*), pending further inquiry from the Perfected Master.

Forest-Sprinkled: Shi Chong pronounces it *suǒ yí qiè* (所宜切).

Empty Purity Hua: Shi Chong states this is the original name. Huangfu’s version writes *青* (*qīng*).

Shi Chong’s rhyme: pronounced *huán* (还).
*Hewing Severance*: Shi Chong’s first character *zhī* (之) pronounced *yào* (药切), the second *duàn* (断) pronounced *guǎn* (管切). The latter *duàn* (断) and *luò* (落) are synonymous.
*Luminous Brightness Seven-Generation Descendants*: some versions write *huá* (华) for *yè* (叶); Huangfu’s version writes *Míngmíng Qī Yè Sūn* (明明七叶孙); Mao Shan’s version writes *Wěngmíng* (奣明). Shi Chong’s pronunciation and meaning also write *wěng* (奣), pronounced *wēng* (乌猛切).
According to the Perfected’s hidden taboos: *Upper Mystery True Radiance Dao Lord*, taboo name *Wěngméng* (奣萌). *Jíyùn* (集韵) reads *gǔ měng* (古猛切), meaning *bright*. Homophonous with *kuàng* (矿).
*Bóshā Xuán* (＠沙玄): *＠* is homophonous with *bó* (孛).

*Flanking Me*: Shi Chong states the upper character should be *jiā* (夹), meaning *to attend*.
*Kerchiefed in Gold, Girded with Feathers*: the first character *jīn* (巾) pronounced *xìn* (焮切), meaning to cover the head with a kerchief. *Xìn* (焮) pronounced *xiāng zhǎn* (香斩切).
The *Hidden Instructions on Ascending to Perfection* states: *Kerchiefed in Gold* is the name of the Heavenly Perfected’s cap-kerchief. Its design remains unrecorded.

**Ninth Scripture of the Upper Clarity Purple Essence Three Simplicities Lord**

My body sprouts feathered robes, ascending in flight to the Nine Heavens’ thoroughfare—one version omits *my*. Now, according to collation: including *my* completes the phrasing and sense.

Within the Purple Essence’s Flourishing Forest, the *Dao Lord’s Jade Commentary* states: In the Heaven of Upper Clarity’s Purple Essence, there stands a tree whose leaves resemble bamboo yet are crimson, whose blossoms resemble mirrors yet gleam, whose fruits resemble plums yet bear no pit. This is called the Flourishing Forest of Nurtured Splendor. Eating its leaves averts hunger; eating its blossoms confers immortality; eating its fruits grants flight as an immortal. This is what is meant by *crimson trees and cinnabar fruits, their hues illuminating the five viscera*. One version writes *Flourishing* as *Verdant*.

*Cang King*—one version writes *Azure Jade*. *Guarding this Long Night Assembly*—*Guarding*: one version writes *Gradually*. *Thick-lipped*, pronounced *chún*. *The Five Elders hold the sun in their mouths*, *hold* pronounced *zhì*.

When reciting to this point, silently intone them thrice. The above nineteen characters appear in the Huangfu edition; other versions are all deficient.

**Twelfth Scripture of the Highest Great Simplicity Lord**
Titled *Northern Terrace Lord*—one version omits *Lord*. *Returning Gold to the Great Radiance Land*—one version writes *Minister*. *Sun’s Brightness Eight Ascensions*—the *Secret Essentials of Cultivating Perfection* states: The Perfected Lord within the sun is styled *Lofty Ascending Brightness*. One version writes *Sun’s Splendor Eight Ascensions*. The *Dao Lord’s Jade Commentary* states: *Sun’s Splendor* is the name of the sun’s spirit; *Eight Ascensions* is the name of a tree within the moon. There are eight such trees, all dwelling in the moon. Now, the meanings of *Brightness* and *Splendor* remain unresolved; here we follow Huangfu’s version, writing *Brightness*. *Harmonizing Return to Fall*—one version writes *Fall* as *End*. *Knots unfurl eternally*—one version writes *Knots* as *Auspicious*.

One version writes *Sun Emperor*, likely in error. *Strumming gold, ringing bells*—the *Dao Lord’s Jade Commentary* states: *Strumming gold, ringing bells*. One version writes *Strumming the zither, ringing bells*.

**Fourteenth Scripture of the Jade Dawn Supreme Great Dao Lord**

**Fifteenth Scripture of the Great Clarity Great Dao Lord**
*Radiant harmony*—Shi Chong reads the first character *xī* as *zhīqí*, meaning *harmony*; the second character *qià* as *yí*, meaning *nurturing*. *Firming the body, guarding the passes*—one version writes *gates*. *Mysterious Mother Uncle Fire King*—one version writes *Jade*. *Further blending*—Shi Chong reads the first character *gēng*, the second *hùn*; the same thereafter. *Uprooting kalpas from Ā*—one version writes *Form kalpas from Ā*.

*Mysterious fullness of the Primordial Essence qi*—one version writes *Mysterious Primordial Primordial Essence announces*. *Within the womb planting ghostly calamities*—one version writes *accumulating ghosts*. *His sageliness is called* [one character illegible]—Shi Chong reads the first character *yuè*, the second *gē*.

One version writes *morning ascent*; the two interpretations remain unresolved, and here we follow Huangfu’s version as *morning lamp*.

According to the second fascicle of the *Concealed Instructions on Ascending Perfection*, in the section on *Scriptural and Commentarial Conventions*: The *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern* now circulates in two versions. One is a large scroll, prefaced by the *Method of Revolving Wind and Blending Union*, but its diction and purport are spurious and deceptive. The other consists solely of thirty-nine chapters, within which a few passages align with those spoken by the *Right Consort*, yet they are intermingled and indistinguishable. Only by personally examining the authentic edition can one follow it properly. It is also said that those who obtained the thirty-nine chapters of Yang and Xu found them no different from the common small edition. Since I have not seen it with my own eyes, I cannot judge its authenticity, but it is fitting to transcribe it to complete the catalog. There is also a *Jade Commentary* in one fascicle, which briefly explicates the essentials of the *Cavern Scripture* and may likewise be copied.

Furthermore, according to the *Azure Essentials Purple Writ of the Golden Root Scripture*, the Central Yellow Venerable Lord states: Whoever beholds the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern in Thirty-Nine Chapters* shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight. Yet some who cultivate it achieve no success after years of practice and claim the scripture is not authentic. This is entirely due to their failure to present a *Golden Tablet* to the Azure Palace or offer a *Jade Memorandum* to the Thearch. Without the descent of true numina, they are instead visited by celestial demons, thus yielding no response and vainly obtaining only spirit scriptures, which likewise lead to no accomplishment. Had they first memorialized the *Golden Tablet* at the Azure Palace and presented the *Jade Memorandum* to the Thearch, receiving the attendance of the *Golden Dawn Jade Lads* and *Western Flower Jade Maidens* to guard the numinous writ, and had it universally proclaimed throughout the heavens so that the Three Realms extolled its virtue and chanted its verses ten thousand times—how could they fail to evoke the response of jade chariots and purple carriages?

Here ends the *Jade Instructions on the Sounds and Meanings of the Great Cavern Perfect Scripture of Highest Clarity*.
