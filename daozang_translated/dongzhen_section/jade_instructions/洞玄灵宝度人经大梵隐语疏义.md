### **The Immeasurable Sounds of the Great Brahmā Hidden Language Among the Heavens**

#### **First Explanation: The Great Brahmā Among the Heavens**
**First Section: Among the Heavens**
The thirty-two heavens each possess eight characters, situated in the eight directions among the heavens.

**Great Brahmā** refers to the *qi* of the Primordial Beginning’s Great Brahmā, which unites separation to form sound. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign once transcribed its script, expounding and translating the esoteric chapters while providing explanations—comprising four matters:

1. **Using Brahmā sounds to name things**, such as the sound *tianlou*: this is not the sound of the tower (*lou*) of the *Louguan* (Tower Abbey), yet now it is applied to name the towers of the Mysterious Capital.
2. **Using Brahmā sounds to denote Brahmā names**, such as the Brahmā sound naming the Heavenly King as *Yimiao*, which is now still called *Yimiao* when referring to the king.
3. **Splitting one deity into two**, such as *Xuyuan*, originally one deity, now interpreted as two titles: *Xuyuan* and *Yuanyin*.
4. **Merging two matters into one**, such as *fanheng* (Brahmā conduct) and *dafan* (Great Brahmā), originally two distinct matters, now combined into one *dafan*.

The rest may be inferred by analogy.

**Question:** The sounds of the Western Regions and India often align with Brahmā sounds, yet those of China differ—why?
**Answer:** The sounds are inherently the tones of the True Script. The Dao transforms them through sound there and through culture here.

**Further Question:** *Yin* (sound) is speech; *wen* (script) is writing. Writing does not exhaust speech, so script is inferior.
**Answer:** Not so. That writing does not exhaust speech refers only to worldly script. The True Script is the root of the Three Powers, while verbal teachings are but the end of propagation—roots surpass ends.

#### **Second Explanation: Hidden Language**
**Second Section: Hidden Language**
The two characters *yinyu* (hidden language) refer to the sounds of the Great Brahmā, which differ from those on earth, giving rise to matters of concealment and revelation.

**Concealment** means secrecy, not manifesting externally. Within this, there are also concealments and revelations. Here, *yinyu* refers to two kinds of matters:

1. **The script is Brahmā script, and the sound is Brahmā sound, yet adapted to earthly use.** Earthly sounds reveal the exterior, while the Great Brahmā’s sounds are concealed within. This thing covers the Brahmā sound, leaving the Brahmā sound unused and hidden internally—hence *yinyu*, illustrating the principle of responsive transformation.
2. **Within a single character, multiple meanings are contained.** If one directly seeks meaning from a single character, it remains unseen; only through explanatory formulas is its purport revealed—hence *yinyu*, elucidating profound and subtle principles.

Within hidden language, there are four types:
1. **Concealed names**
2. **Concealed taboos**
3. **Concealed matters**
4. **Concealed meanings**

Why not say *names, taboos, matters, meanings* but instead *hidden language*?
**Language** (*yu*) means awakening (*wu*), and its character is *my speech* (*wuyan*). By using my speech to demonstrate language, it opens and awakens the human mind—hence the term *language*.

#### **Third Explanation: Immeasurable Sounds**
**Third Section: Immeasurable Sounds**
*Wuliang yin* (immeasurable sounds) has two meanings:
1. **Immeasurable transformation and adaptability**
2. **Immeasurable teaching and transformation**

**Immeasurable transformation and adaptability** refers to the fact that within the inner sounds, the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign, though only translating them into the proper sounds of China, enables these sounds to universally apply across immeasurable lands. Different regions and distinct kinds all name things accordingly, each attaining understanding. The sounds transcend all bounds—hence *immeasurable*.

**Immeasurable teaching and transformation** refers to the fact that, as different regions and kinds each name their things, all become virtuous speech, universally attaining wondrous meanings without limit. There are no evil words, and the transformative influence is boundless. The sounds encompass the five scripts—hence *immeasurable sounds*.

### **Exegesis of the Middle Chapter of the *Numinous Writ* by the Dao Lord**
This refers to the source of the above title, namely, the middle chapter of the *Numinous Writ*.

This scripture contains two hundred fifty-six characters, each a square *zhang* in size, with eight luminous corners. The uses of this middle chapter are threefold:

1. **Distributed among the thirty-two heavens**, eight characters per heaven, to dispel inauspiciousness and accomplish salvation for all.
2. **Inscribed upon the gates, towers, and palaces of the Mysterious Capital and the heavens.** If one cultivates and ingests its luminous characters, then according to one’s practice, riding the *qi*, one ascends to their respective abodes.
3. **To summon, command, and govern the ten directions.**

**Interpretation of "Yu Dan Chang Sang Bokong Du Xian"**
This is the eighth celestial chant of the *Non-Ultimate Vow* Heaven.
*Yu Dan* is the capital name of the *Vow* Heaven.
Above it lies the *Qianlin* grove, which shades the *Eastern Florescence* Palace. The leaves of the *Qianlin* bear the *Great Grotto’s* scriptures, inscribed with purple characters of jade, resplendent in the *Upper Clarity*.
Below stands the *Fusang* tree, where the *Azure Phoenix* sings beneath its canopy, and *blue mists* adorn its peaks. *Divine winds* stir the *fragrant herbs of returning scent*, playing the *music of the Fusang and Cypress Grove*. When the *divine wind* stirs once, the *Grotto’s* scriptures arise from the void.

These two characters are inscribed on the *Jade Terrace of the Mysterious Capital*.

Where this world’s west becomes that world’s east, thus do heaven revolve and earth rotate, never fixed to one direction—this is the principle. All else may be inferred accordingly.

This is the *First Radiant Court’s* *Celestial Melody of the Azure Vault*. *Juewu* are the *Flying Heavenly Divine Persons* of the *Dragon Han*.

All else follows this model. *Yü* is the *Heavenly King’s* esoteric name. *Nine* refers to the *Nine Mysteries’ Gates*. *Sun* is the *Sun Youth*. The *Yü King*, riding his elephant-wheel chariot, traverses the *Nine Mysteries’ Gates*, turning the *Nine Mechanisms’* degrees to align with the kalpa’s juncture and heaven’s cyclical end.

She perpetually governs the earth’s mechanisms, turning the wheel of *primordial qi* to correspond with the *Heavenly Pass*. When the *Heavenly Pass* turns, the earth’s mechanisms move, completing one revolution of the heavens. Waters then surge three thousand three hundred times, and the *Nine Seas* overflow, their waters filling the sky. As the kalpa nears its transition, the *Kun Mother* emerges above the *Eastern Alaya*, summoning the *Bird Mother* to convene the kalpa’s assembly and deliver the disciples of immortality. These two characters are inscribed upon the *Fusang’s* *Bureau of Numinous Governance*. *East* refers to the *Eastern Well’s* *Long Source*. *Covering* is the *Water-Covering Spirit*, who dwells upon *Mount Sumeru* to stabilize the *Great Sea* and obstruct the *Eastern Well’s* *Long Source*, preventing the earth’s mechanisms from sinking.

Disciples of the *Mystery* receive the *Feathered Supervisor’s* talisman and traverse the *vast and distant* *cloudy empyrean*. The *Feathered Forest* weaves *cloud qi* into garments, entering the *Vermilion Numinous Palace* to merge in radiance with the *Flying Heavenly King* above the clouds.

*Shatuo Jieliang: Dragon Han’s Radiant Freshness—Exegesis*
This is the *Fifth* *Primal Upper* *Constant Fusion Melody*. *Sha* is the *Shalan Palace*—a detached hall of the *Purple Tenuity*, situated above the *Jade Clarity*, resplendent within the *Purple Void*. *Tuo* are the *Tuoqiu multitudes*—the *Shalan Palace* contains the *Tuoqiu multitudes*, numbering in the hundreds of millions. The *Tuoqiu* are those newly delivered and receiving the numinous. Their merits incomplete, they remain dispersed therein. When the kalpa’s transition arrives, the *Tuoqiu multitudes* are evaluated by the weight of their merits and ascend to the *Vermilion Numinous Palace*, receiving blessings and immortality. *Kalpa Measure* refers to the *Tuoqiu multitudes’* passage through the kalpa’s transition, whereupon they receive rank and measure to attain immortality.

At once, a solemn *spirit-wind* gathers the mist; as the *spirit-wind* stirs, its resonance forms a *cavern-chapter*. *Song* is the *cavern-chapter*. *Preservation* means preserving beyond the kalpa’s end. *Precious* refers to the *Precious Spontaneous Scroll*, which delivers humanity.

**Postscript Section**
This section is the *Dao Lord’s* re-sequencing of the scripture, clarifying the origin and conclusion of the *hidden language* and the fruition of its merits. *One zhang square* measures ten *chi*, encompassing the ten directions. *Zhang* signifies *length*, the foremost of the *ten thousand virtues*. *Correct* refers to the *Middle Kingdom’s* sound. The *Heavenly Perfected Sovereign* of old inscribed these texts to establish the *correct sound*, for while the *Brahman sound* names earthly things, it remains the *Middle Kingdom’s* *correct sound*. If its resonance resides in heaven, it becomes the *heavenly correct sound*, named the *Supreme’s wondrous thing*; in other lands, it remains universally applicable, termed the *foreign lands’* *distinct thing*, without partiality or stagnation. This is the same *correct sound*, differing only in nomenclature. Just as foreign lands employ the *five tones* and *four voices*, as does the *Middle Kingdom*, the names of things differ, yet their vocalization remains the same—so it is with all myriad things. The *Heavenly Perfected Sovereign’s* present exegesis addresses only the *Middle Kingdom’s* *correct sound*, excluding the *foreign lands* and *distant domains*.

Within the *correct sound*, there are similarities and differences. *Similarities*: in the heavens above, *ānuò* is called *ānuò*, and here below, it is also called *ānuò*, no different from foreign lands where *pátra* is called *pátra* and *sūtra* is called *sūtra*, retaining the same names. *Differences*: in heaven, *bodhi* is called *Dao*, while here it is called *Supreme Perfected*; just as foreign lands name *literature* as *rú*, while here it is simply called *wén*. Though the sounds differ, all form auspicious speech, never malign words, thus uniquely constituting the *true, wondrous, and boundless sound*. If *bodhi* were called *Supreme Perfected*, the *Dao sound* would be obscured; if *wén* were called *wén*, the *rú sound* would vanish—hence, it is collectively termed *hidden language*.

*The Various Heavens* refer to the *Divine Treasure Great Dao Emperor* and the *multitude of sages* within the *various heavens*. *Merit* signifies that as merit accumulates and expands, the *Demon Kings* bear witness. *The Perfected Way of the Upper Immortals* denotes the completion of merit and practice. *Roaming the Three Realms* means not abiding within the *Three Realms*. *Golden Gate* refers to the *Nine Palaces’ Golden Gate of Great Radiance*, located within the *Western Pass’s* domain, above the *Heaven of Supreme Simplicity* and the *Profound Mystery*. Within its gate stands the *Kan Tree*, atop which perches the *Golden-Winged Bird*, while below lies the *Smelting Pool*, containing *Stone Essence*, *Golden Marrow*, and *Jade Nectar*. All who cultivate to become immortals, ascend to heaven, or undergo *corpse-transformation* must pass through the *Golden Gate* to receive refinement. The *Golden-Winged Bird* weaves its feathers into *immortal robes*, allowing ascent to the *Upper Palace’s* clouds. This sound repels all that is not *profoundly profound*.

This is the original preface from the *Primal Origin’s Numinous Writ’s* middle chapter, summarizing the *hidden language’s* sublime virtues. *Línláng* refers to *resonant pearls and jades*, signifying that when the *jade sound* is emitted, it resounds like *línláng’s* vibration. Another interpretation: when the *cavern-chapter* is performed, *línláng* responds in kind. *Profound* means *silent*. *Wisdom* is *prajñā*. *Cavern* signifies *interpenetration*. *Pure* denotes *clarity*. *Boundless* means *impartial and universally salvific*, delivering countless beings. *Profoundly Profound* signifies that its meaning is *profoundly profound*, surpassing the *profundity of scriptural arts*. These six qualities summarize its merits. *Boundless*—alternatively rendered as *Great Boundless*—signifies *encompassing all without exception*, measuring and delivering all things. This derives from the *inner resonance*, titled *Great Brahman Hidden Language’s Primal Boundless Sound*. The scripture states, *"This is called boundless, universally delivering the inexhaustible"*—not *Great Boundless*.

*Exegesis of the* *Cavern-Mystery Numinous Treasure’s* *Scripture of Delivering Humanity’s* *Great Brahman Hidden Language* *concludes*.
