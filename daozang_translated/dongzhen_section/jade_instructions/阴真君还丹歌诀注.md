**Obscure Lord of Yin’s Elixir Song Commentary**

The **North’s Primal Qi** is the **River Chariot**,
The **North’s Black Sovereign**—most exalted—
The **Yin’s foundation** within humanity.

**Primal Qi** belongs to **Water**, the blood of man.
The **River Chariot**—when the North’s Qi flows south,
Fire refines the water into dust,
Transforming into the **River Chariot’s essence**—
The **lower elixir’s refined essence**.

The North’s black belongs to **Water**, the **kidneys** of man.
The kidneys are the **root of life**,
Dividing into **sun and moon’s essences**,
The **void’s breath**—
The **kidney sovereign** becomes the **赤子** [Red Boy].

**Jia-Yi** are named **golden sands**,
The **East’s Qing Emperor**, ruling the **liver**—
**Jia-Yi**—
For the North’s water and South’s fire,
Fire born from Wood,
Water nurtures it—
Lush and verdant, thus **Jia-Yi**.
Belonging to **Wood**, it governs the **elixir field**.

**Golden sands** are generated—
Though the world’s waters number as the **Ganges’ sands**,
Like the **Han River’s waters** or **Jialing’s streams**,
Where golden sands naturally form—
Workers dredge and refine them into **gold**.
Thus another method:
Within the body, residing in the **upper elixir field**,
With a **palace**, called the **Jade Spring Cave**,
Where **Jade Spring Water** flows—
Named the **Pure Source**—
Its extraction is the **Great Merit God-Water**.
Boundless in depth, it descends to the **lower elixir field**,
Over time, naturally congealing into **sands**.

**Two essences** nurture as one,
The **Two**—**Yin and Yang**—
**Heaven as Yang**, **Earth as Yin**;
**Left as Yang**, **Right as Yin**.
**Yin and Yang** are **husband and wife**.
Within the body, the **elixir field** is Yang,
Its lower aspect is Yin—
Nurturing the **four seasons**, moving the **five phases**,
Heaven and Earth in harmony—
All things naturally arise.
**Sun contains Moon**, naturally luminous;
**Moon contains Sun**, naturally generating stars.
**Husband follows, wife harmonizes**—
Thus **male and female** are born.
Now, by method, extracting the **upper elixir field’s Great Merit God-Water**,
Refining and descending it to the **lower elixir chamber** for cultivation—
**The Vermilion Bird** nurtures the **golden flower**.

The **Vermilion Bird** is **Fire**—
On Earth, the **South’s Bing-Ding Fire**,
In Heaven, the **Mars planet**.
On Earth, it is **Fire**; in man, it is the **heart**—
Its fire’s rise and fall are human-willed,
Encompassing **Heaven and Earth**, yet entering the **finest hairs**—
Restrain it, and it stops;
Release it, and it rages—
Called in the scriptures the **Bright Fire**.
**Fire’s regulation**—
Refining into **mud**, then firing into **tiles and bricks**,
Enduring **millions of years** without decay;
**Wood** burned into **charcoal**, buried in earth,
Endures **millions of years**—
The charcoal remains.
Man, through mastery, extracts the **upper elixir field’s jade spring water**,
Refining it with **heart-fire** into the **lower elixir field**,
Locking it in the **Jade Prison Gate**.
The **Jade Prison Gate**—
Another method for **Yin Elixir**—
Naturally generating its **soul**,
With prolonged **sun-moon** cultivation,
Naturally radiant, congealing—
Called the **Golden Pool**.

The *Great Elixir Precept* says:
**"Gold Father, Wood Mother—true lead and mercury."**
Lead contains **five colors**, belonging to the **North’s Water**,
Water holding **gold**—
Gold as **dikes and levees**—
Thus called the **Golden Flower**.

The **Golden Flower** produces **Heaven-Earth’s treasure**—
Like the **Han River’s golden sands**,
Naturally forming within.
Extracting the elixir from water,
Residing in the **lower elixir chamber**—
Over time, the water’s essence becomes **golden dust**,
Naturally forming **pearls**—
Called **"fire from water."**

Another method:
Retaining the **lower elixir’s essence**,
With **heart-fire** circulating in the **upper elixir field**,
Naturally forming **pearls** in the **brain’s palace**—
Called **"water from fire."**
Thus the *Huangting Scripture* says:
*"Jade-Clear Pool’s water irrigates the sacred root—*
*Only those who cultivate it may endure."*

Few grasp this **true Dao**.
Men do not believe in the Dao—
The Dao is called **Void-Nothingness**.
Thus the scripture says:
**"The Great Dao is not the common Dao."**
The Dao is like **empty space**,
Depending on nothing.
The Precept says:
*"Like fish in water, unseen is the water;
Man in the Dao, unseen is the Dao.
Dragons do not see their mountains and stones,
Ghosts do not see their earth."*
These words—
Are they mere idle talk?
The **true Dao** is humanity’s **refined essence**—
Most lose it through **women**, thus begetting **male and female**,
Their faces, forms, and spirits resembling their parents—
Their natures identical.
Retaining it within the body,
Extracting the **upper elixir’s water**,
Combining it with the **lower elixir field** to forge the elixir—
Named **"precious treasure."**
Thus the *Yin-Shu Scripture* says:
*"Yin fields interact—naturally harmonized."*
Those who grasp this—
The **true Dao is complete!**

**Child is Tiger**, **Mao is Dragon**—
The two phrases speak of separate matters.
**Child-Tiger** belongs to **Yin**,
**Yin** belongs to **female**—
The **water’s nature**, thus called the **North’s Ren-Gui**—
This is the **Water’s position**.
The *Yellow Emperor’s Precept* says:
*"Called **black lead**—able to subdue mercury into sand.
If one attains the true Dao,
Entering the **Yang Elixir Field**,
Using it—**before noon is best**."*

**Dragon** belongs to **Wood**—
The **East’s Wood**—
The Precept calls it **mercury**.
**Mercury** belongs to **Fire**—
Also called **liquid silver**.
Another says:
*"Green liquid silver—if refined with medicine to subdue fire,
It becomes the **world’s treasure**.
Within the body, it is the **refined essence**."*
The Precept says:
*"Refining Yang with Yin—its truth may endure."*
The method must rely on **one Yin branch**.

The *Dan Theory* says:
*"Yang’s movement cannot be subdued;
Yin’s killing cannot be subdued."*

Nurture it so that it is subdued—
When Yin dies and Yang is born,
The born, like mercury subdued by fire,
Becomes the world’s treasure.

Yang, mercury subdued by Yin,
If unmoving and steadfast, becomes the body’s treasure.
Thus the *Classic* says:
*"Tending the灵柯 so it withers no more,
Sealing the命门 to preserve the玉都."*

Probing the tongue’s structure,
Perform it after midnight, before noon.
Probing the upper玉泉’s water—
This is also called Yang mercury.

When containing Yin,
The probe is called lead-water,
Known as the **Double Dragon-Tiger**.

Thus the *Heavenly Abundance Upper Classic* says:
*"Beneath the green beginning, the moon and sun unite—
Two substances blending into one.
Emerging from the玉池, entering the金室,
Each person possesses it—guard it well, lest it be lost.
If one attains it, all matters are complete.
Why seek it externally?*

The **Dragon** dwells in the **Shock position**—
At its eighth phase,
The **Tiger’s** number is **One**, born in the first palace.
This is the method of probing from **New Moon to Full Moon**—
Probing above increases the **hun**;
From **Full Moon to New Moon**, chanting benefits the **po**.

At eight years, boys’ teeth emerge,
At sixteen, they reach their prime,
Below ten years—
If one practices the method to attain True Dao, it is supreme.
Others may achieve **corpse dissolution**.

There are days for gathering,
Times for taking.
The upper method is practiced,
Avoiding **New Moon, Full Moon, and Eclipse**.

For the lower method,
Wait for the moon’s fullness in the sky,
When the spirit pervades the body—
Probing on the day of the moon’s alignment,
Following its sequence, is best—
After midnight, before noon, at the **Mao hour**.

Probing Yin-qi to ascend the **Nine Palaces of Mud**,
Thus the Classic says:
*"Irrigating the灵柯 so it withers no more."*

Even without seminal emission,
Beauty is restored—
Daily at the **pearl**,
It becomes the **Great Void**,
A void beyond hope or action,
Yet within it, a substance exists—
This is the Yin-qi transforming upward,
Returning to the **Nine Palaces of Mud**,
Then drawing water from the **玉池**,
Pouring it into the **lower Dan Field’s 金室**—
Its origin is unknown,
Nor where it departs,
Its position arranged—
Each has divine transformation,
With time naturally becoming a **treasure pearl**.
Thus, people do not die.

Hence the Classic says: *"The Great Dao is formless."*

Yet the world uses it,
Unknowing how to gather it—
If the timing is misjudged,
All labor is in vain.

Or if one encounters **celestial prohibitions**,
Misplacing the arrangement,
Or if the **Yin orifice** does not open,
Taking it recklessly harms the body,
Causing swift aging.

Thus it is said:
*"At the time of attaining the One, behind Kunlun,
Even if one’s tongue is cut, do not abandon the Dao.
If one speaks recklessly to the world,
Crossing the lines, blood will flow—
Life will end prematurely.
This text is not for ordinary people."*

Its transmission lies with the **Taiyi Official**—
The Classic says:
*"Taiyi has a sovereign,
All say it dwells within the heart’s spirit,
Beyond conception—
Who can see it?
It cannot be measured."*

It resides in the head,
As **Kunlun**,
Above the **Upper Palace**,
Where the divine dwells—
Each has its own chambers.

From the nape to the crown,
The **Nine Palaces** are occupied—
Each spirit has a name,
Found in the **Taiyi’s Ling Index**,
With separate essential texts.

Below the navel’s **Palace**,
There are three more palaces,
Depending on the twelve before—
Each has towers and halls.

Thus the *Inner Vision Classic* says:
*"Within are twelve-tiered towers—
This is it."*

Again, the **Dan Field** has twelve towers,
Corresponding to the twelve hours,
Used in the **transformation method**.

To attain the divine and the saintly is most easy—
The wise probe the two medicines within the body,
Though they may not know their limits,
The body’s spirits do.

Yet people cling to superficial flowers,
Unknowing of transformation—
Thus it is said:
*"Knowing the Dao of longevity,
Yet separated by ten thousand mountains."*

Few in this age understand.
Seeking the **Palace’s cauldron**,
On the body’s twelve palaces—
Only then does one know the **Great Dao’s vessel**,
The divine and saintly.

First, seek the **cauldron** within the **Palace**—
Its method is not transmitted,
Its texts cannot be revealed openly.
Thus the *Dao Classic* says:
*"Gold and jade fill the hall,
Yet none can guard them.
Rich and noble, yet proud,
They bring ruin upon themselves."*

This is why, born into the world,
Green between heaven and earth,
People must avoid arrogance, luxury, and wealth,
Seeking not the Great Dao.

**Nurturing with warmth**—
Adjusting Yin and Yang—
**Nurturing** calms the mind,
**Fire timing** uses the **heart-fire** of the four seasons,
Adding chants in pairs—
Its method is passed orally.

**Nurturing Yin and Yang**—
Distinguishing true Yin and true Yang,
Residing in the two **命**,
Probing to merge as the **command level**.

It is said:
*"Two substances, one body."*

Arranging the **furnace-chamber** requires choosing the place.
**Arranging**—
Probing the true **water-qi** above,
Placing it at the **lower origin**;
Probing the **Yin-qi water** below,
Circulating it to the **upper origin**,
Arranging each in its **furnace-chamber**—
This is the divine transformation’s function.

If the arrangement lacks its place,
Disaster befalls the body.

The **furnace-chamber**—
Its wondrous method lies with the female,
Separate in the **Yin Elixir’s One Precept’s upper method**.

The **furnace-chamber**—
The body and mouth serve as the furnace,
The **electricity**—
The **Palace’s chambers** are its favor.

What is broken and unusable
Is what others have used—
Worn out, no longer suitable.

In **Chamber Technique**, the five levels—
The excessively fat are unusable,
The excessively thin are unusable.

The **Dao’s three mergings**, five levels—
Those aged fifteen to twenty
Are the middle path.

Above twenty years,
All are unusable.

What can be used must borrow their **qi** to merge with mercury,
Or it will be stolen by ghosts and spirits.

**Choosing the place**—
Knowing the **Palace’s chambers** and timing.
Without the place, do not act recklessly.

For those refining Yin—
If not following the earlier prescribed ages,
Or the **cauldron’s** substances,
Treasure cannot be formed.

Borrowing **qi** before the proper age,
One may temporarily reside,
With the function of dispelling exhaustion and demons,
Yet lacking the power to ascend and aid.

「If within the **precepts**, one must not fail to observe their measures and proceed accordingly—
then youthful attainment of treasure is possible.
If one merely seeks to grasp the intent and act upon it,
there is no hope of success whatsoever.

Most importantly, one must practice in utmost secrecy and vigilance.
When about to practice the **Dao** in quiet seclusion,
one should reside idly, engaging in **guiding-and-drawing**,
knocking the teeth, gathering the **spirit**,
grasping the **lower abdomen** and sitting upright,
and perform it in secret.

In **preservation**—
one must eat sparingly, speak little,
and avoid joy and anger.
Do not reveal the **mysteries of Heaven and Earth**.
In **preservation**—
one must exhaust all bodily functions:
if ten years of practice are observed,
from head to tail reaching the **heart**,
prolonged practice will then naturally ease,
but if only the head is practiced without the tail,
the **foundation** will be hollow, wasting one’s efforts.
A thousand times, it will not succeed!

This medicine’s transformations are beyond imagination.
Its efficacy in ingestion:
nine years without losing its **signs**,
adding ten *liang* of **shouting breath** suffices,
fulfilling three thousand **merits**,
with eight hundred **actions** complete—
then the formula is achieved, and it is easy!

Its **virtue/power** cannot be killed by Heaven,
nor buried by Earth—
its efficacy is beyond imagination.

**Note**: Heaven and Earth have transformations,
its body is firm and unyielding,
its **virtue/power** has three outcomes:
the highest attains **ascension to the Immortal Dao**,
the middle and lower attain only **corpse dissolution**.

**Yin True Sand**—
**Yang True Cinnabar**,
the **Yin essence of the lower element** refined into sand,
when the **Yin essence of the upper element** is sought,
it sinks and becomes sand,
belonging to **Yang qi**.

**Yin True Mercury**—
the **Yin essence of the upper element** congeals into treasure,
the **Yin essence of the lower element** enters the **Kunlun mud pill**,
and is cast as a **pearl**—
it can illuminate the **Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds**!

When encountering this **precept**,
understand these words,
or when encountering this **song**,
refine and ingest it—
one attains the **True Immortal Dao**.

If one encounters this **song**,
abandon all reckless actions,
and silently cultivate the **heart**,
preserve the **mind**,
do not abandon the **initial resolve**,
and diligently advance the **earlier intent**—
only then may one refine and ingest it to attain the **True Immortal Dao**.

**Yin True Sand** and **Yin True Mercury**—
ordinary cinnabar and sand are not to be trifled with.
Common folk take sand and silver to make mercury,
take vermilion, copper, and iron to make cinnabar—
if one seeks the **Dao** with these, it will not be achieved.

Upon meeting this **precept**,
grasp these words,
or when encountering this **song**,
refine and ingest it—
one attains the **True Immortal Dao**.
If one encounters this **song**,
abandon all reckless actions,
and silently cultivate the **mind**,
preserve the **spirit**,
do not abandon the **initial resolve**,
and diligently advance the **earlier intent**—
only then may one refine and ingest it to attain the **True Immortal Dao**.

The **Song of Yin True Sand’s Return to the Elixir** concludes here.»
