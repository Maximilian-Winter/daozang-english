**Preface to the *Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s *Yinfu Jing***

Master **Su Weitan (蘇為淛)**, a scholar of the Right Commandery, was a paragon of virtue among the literati—his excellence rivaled that of **Shiguan Gong (石涧翁)**. Such men are rare today.

Gong devoted his life to studying the *Yijing* (易), gaining profound insights. Thus, he upheld tranquility without ostentation and lived to a venerable age. His elucidations of this text reveal truths beyond what **Zhu Xi (朱夫子)** had fully articulated. Were Zhu Xi to rise again, he would surely affirm this work as unassailable.

Moreover, his disciples—**Ziyu (子玉)** in upholding his legacy and **Sun Zhen (孙桢)** in diligent study—demonstrate that Heaven’s rewards are boundless and unceasing.

Ziyu presented this work to me, requesting a preface. How dare I presume? Yet after days of reading and reflection, my admiration deepened. I thus pen these words in gratitude—not merely as an old friend, but as a testament to our shared bond.

Alas, my words are those of an aged man—can they truly inspire trust? Can they truly inspire trust?

Written on the **15th day of the 10th month, Zhizheng 8th year (1348)**, by **Shi Yu (師余)** of **Meishan (眉山)**.

**Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s *Yinfu Jing***
By **Linwu Shanren Yu Yan (林屋山人俞琰)**, also known as **Yu Wurou (玉吾叟)**.

To observe the **Dao/Way of Heaven**, to grasp its operations—this is complete.

That which unfolds **naturally and effortlessly** is the **Dao/Way of Heaven**.
That which **revolves left and right without ceasing**, day and night, is Heaven’s operation.
*The Doctrine of the Mean* states: **"Sincerity is the **Dao/Way of Heaven**."**
It further says: **"Supreme sincerity knows no exhaustion."**
Sincerity is **true and unerring**, pure in its alignment with the natural principles of Heaven.
**"No exhaustion"** means that even in the briefest instant, there is **qi/nourishment**—
its existence is continuous, never interrupted for a moment.

If a person can **observe the **Dao/Way of Heaven** and cultivate sincerity within,
grasp Heaven’s operations and **strive unceasingly**—
then they walk as a companion of Heaven.

**"Complete"** refers to the eight characters **"observe Heaven’s **Dao/Way**, grasp its operations"**—
concise in expression, exhaustive in meaning, with nothing further to add.

Heaven has **five calamities**, and those who perceive them thrive.
The **five calamities** reside in the heart and manifest in Heaven.
The **five calamities** are the **Five Phases**.

Zhu Ziyou said:
*"The virtues and vices of the world arise from these five—*
*thus, reversing their names, we call them **five calamities**."*

I say that Heaven’s **Five Phases** are **water, fire, wood, metal, earth**;
while humanity’s **Five Phases** are **vision, hearing, speech, demeanor, thought**.
Heaven’s **Five Phases** are visible in Heaven—
but can humanity’s **Five Phases** be seen within the heart?

If a person can perceive what is easily seen
and also what is difficult to see,
then there is nothing they cannot perceive.
Thus it is said: **"Those who perceive them thrive."**

How does it reside in the heart?
**Vision** must be **clear**, **hearing** must be **acute**,
**speech** must be **faithful**, **demeanor** must be **respectful**,
and the heart’s function is **thought**.

How does it manifest in Heaven?
**Wind, rain, sunshine, cold, and heat**—these are its expressions.
The universe lies within the hands;
ten thousand transformations arise from the body.

If a person can **activate their innate mechanism** to override Heaven and Earth’s operations,
then the creative forces of Heaven and Earth rest within them.
Thus it is said: **"The universe lies within the hands;**
**ten thousand transformations arise from the body."**

Shao Yong’s *"Observing the *Yijing* in Verse"* states:
*"One thing’s origin stems from one body,*
*One body returns to encompass Heaven and Earth.*
*Know that all things are complete within me—*
*Why set apart the Three Realms as roots?*
*Heaven divides creation from the One—*
*Man weaves fate from the heart.*
*Heaven and man—how could they differ in essence?*
*The **Dao/Way** acts not in vain, for it lies in humanity."*

This is the meaning.

**Heaven’s nature** is **humanity**.
**Humanity’s heart** is the **mechanism**.

Humans are born in stillness—this is **Heaven’s nature**.
Thus it is said: **"Heaven’s nature is humanity."**
The **mechanism** stirs within—this is **humanity’s heart**.
Thus it is said: **"Humanity’s heart is the mechanism."**

To **establish the **Dao/Way of Heaven** is to stabilize humanity**.
If a person can **uphold sincerity** and not be swayed by desires,
then **Heaven is steadfast** and **humanity is steadfast**.
Thus it is said: **"To establish the **Dao/Way of Heaven** is to stabilize humanity."**

When **Heaven’s killing mechanism** is unleashed, **dragons and serpents** rise from the land.
When **Earth’s killing mechanism** is unleashed, **stars and constellations** fall into obscurity.
When **humanity’s killing mechanism** is unleashed, **Heaven and Earth reverse**.

When **Heaven’s killing mechanism** is unleashed from above,
**dragons and serpents** respond and rise from the land;
when **Earth’s killing mechanism** is unleashed from below,
**stars and constellations** respond and fall into obscurity;
when **humanity’s killing mechanism** is unleashed from within,
then **above and below** respond, and **Heaven and Earth reverse**.

Strategists who understand this principle
compare it to the **Hengshan serpent**—
strike its head and its tail responds,
strike its tail and its head responds,
strike its center and both head and tail respond.

Practitioners who understand this principle
take the **head as Heaven**, the **torso as Earth**, and the **heart as humanity**,
their method being to **conceal the spirit within**,
regulating the **inhalation and exhalation**—
ascending to the **Mingmen (命门)** at the base,
descending to the **Dantian (丹田)** above—
causing the **Five Phases** to invert and circulate within,
descending so that **metal and water** merge with **earth**,
ascending so that **wood and fire** pair with **earth**,
endlessly rising and falling without end—
this is the **reversal of Heaven and Earth within the body**.

Though the two schools speak differently in intent,
their principles converge in harmony.

For the **benevolent**, this is **benevolence**;
for the **wise**, this is **wisdom**—
yet their essence is one.

Otherwise, why would this text be called the *Yinfu Jing*?

I observe *The Laozi* and find:
*"The **spirit of the valley** does not die—
this is called the **mysterious female**;
The **gate of the mysterious female**—
this is called the **root of Heaven and Earth**.*
*Endlessly present, yet used without exhaustion."*
This speaks of **cultivation**.

It further says:
*"To govern a great state is like poaching a small fish."*
And:
*"Fine weapons are ominous instruments."*
Indeed, these also encompass **governance**,
not solely the **art of cultivation**.

Works such as *The Zihua Zi*, *The Guan Yin Zi*, *The Wenzzi*, *The Liezi*, and *The Zhuangzi*
are likewise so.

Some cling to one aspect and speak only of that—
this is erroneous.

Zhan Gu’s commentary on this text
takes **coercive techniques of seduction and warfare** as **strength in battle and victory**—
this is the greatest error of all.

When **Heaven and humanity’s mechanisms** align,
the foundation of **ten thousand transformations** is set.

The **mechanism of Heaven** and the **mechanism of the human heart** resonate—
when they move, they harmonize in response—
this is **Heaven and humanity’s unified activation**.

The **mechanism of Heaven and humanity’s unified activation**—
who but the **enlightened** can comprehend it?

To know this **mechanism** yet act without recklessness
is to establish the **root of ten thousand transformations**.
Thus it is said: **"When Heaven and humanity’s mechanisms align,**
**the foundation of ten thousand transformations is set."**

Practitioners who grasp this **unified mechanism**
thus, in the stillness of night,
**concentrate their spirit and gather their qi** in the **Dantian** for a moment—
when **spirit enters qi** and **qi merges with spirit**,
they remain **motionless and tranquil**.
By the end of **Hai (亥)** and the start of **Zi (子)**,
when **Heaven and Earth’s qi** arrives, they **urgently gather it**;
when it has not yet arrived, they **remain empty and await it**,
daring not to act prematurely.

**Nature** has **aptitude and clumsiness**—it can be **concealed**.
Humans have **wisdom and folly**—
thus their **nature** varies in aptitude and clumsiness.

「If the **Great Knowing** is like **Great Folly**,
and **Great Skill** is like **Great Clumsiness**,
then their **nature** is concealed within
and not perceived by others.

Thus it is said: **"Nature** has **aptitude and clumsiness**—
it can be **concealed**."

The **evil of the nine orifices** lies in the **three essentials**—
they can be controlled through **action and stillness**.
**Evil** is what **human desire** is.

When **human desire** burns fiercely,
**Heaven’s principle** is extinguished—
this is why the **noble one** restrains their **evil**.

The **orifices** are nine, yet the **essentials** are three—
the ears, eyes, and mouth.

When the **noble one acts**, they do not gaze
unless it is **proper ritual**,
they do not listen unless it is **proper ritual**,
they do not speak unless it is **proper ritual**—
**action** is thus **sincere**.

When they are **still**, they neither gaze nor listen,
but **carefully restrain** their **joyousness (yui)**—
**stillness** is thus **sincere**.

The **noble one**, whether in **action** or **stillness**,
is **sincere** in both—
**sincere** in **action**, **sincere** in **stillness**,
and with **sincerity** in all things,
they can go nowhere without success.

Thus it is said: **"The evil of the nine orifices**
lies in the **three essentials**—
they can be controlled through **action and stillness**."

Fire **arises from wood**—
when **disaster** is about to strike, it **must be subdued**.
**Deceit** **arises from the state**—
when **turmoil** is about to emerge, it **must be broken**.

To **know** and **cultivate** this **Dao/Way**,
is to be called a **sage**.

Fire **arises within wood**—
when fire **flares**, wood **is consumed by it**.
Thus it is said: **"Fire arises from wood**—
**disaster** is about to strike, it **must be subdued**."

**Deceit** **arises within the state**—
when **deceit** **stirs**, the state **is shattered**.
Thus it is said: **"Deceit arises from the state**—
when **turmoil** is about to emerge, it **must be broken**."

The **method of cultivation** is this:
**Hide the heart** in the **depths (yuan)**,
**nurture its luminous roots**—
when **still**, fire **poses no threat of upward flames**,
just as wood, though harboring fire,
**is not consumed by it**.

**Restrain its evil** while **preserving its sincerity**,
and it is like a state, though harboring **deceit**,
**not being shattered by it**.

Thus it is said: To **know** and **cultivate** this **Dao/Way**,
is to be called a **sage**.

**Heaven’s creation and killing** are the **principles of the Dao/Way**.
There is the **emergence of spring rain**,
and there is the **stern killing of autumn frost**—
this is the **natural course of Heaven’s Dao/Way**,
the **inevitable operation of principle**.

**Heaven and Earth** are the **thieves of ten thousand things**;
**ten thousand things** are the **thieves of humanity**;
**humanity** is the **thief of ten thousand things**.

When the **three thieves** are **properly managed**,
and the **Three Powers (Heaven, Earth, humanity)** are **settled in harmony**,
then **Heaven and Earth** stand firm,
and **ten thousand things** flourish.

Thus it is said: **"Heaven and Earth** are the **thieves of ten thousand things**;
**ten thousand things** are the **thieves of humanity**;
**humanity** is the **thief of ten thousand things**."

Though it speaks not of **nurturing** but of **harming**,
it is but the **inverse** of the same.

If each of the **three** attains its **proper place**,
then **Heaven and Earth** take their **positions**,
and **ten thousand things** are **nourished**—
thus it is said: **"The three thieves are properly managed,
the Three Powers are settled in harmony."**

Thus it is said: **"To eat the **timing** of Heaven and Earth,**
**the hundred bones** are **regulated**.
To **stir the **mechanism** of humanity,
**the ten thousand transformations** are **settled**.
**Timing** refers to **Heaven and Earth’s timing**.

If I can **eat the timing** of Heaven and Earth,
and **align with them**,
then **the hundred bones** are **regulated**.

**Mechanism** refers to **the human heart’s mechanism**.
If I can **stir the mechanism** of humanity,
and **align with Heaven and Earth**,
then the **ten thousand transformations** of my body are **settled**.

Humans know the **manifest spirit** of their **spirit**,
but do not know the **principle of the unmanifest spirit**—
how it **becomes spirit**.

**Spirit** is the **unfathomable interplay of yin and yang**.
It **penetrates ten thousand things** and **gives voice** to them—
not the **supernatural marvels** of the vulgar world.

The **foolish** are **confused by principle**,
and **bewildered by tales of supernatural marvels**,
thus they call it **spirit**.

Yet the **movement of the sun and moon**,
the **shift of the four seasons**,
the **changes of ten thousand things**—
these, through **habituation**, become **commonplace**,
and thus are called **unmanifest spirit**.

Who truly knows
how the **unmanifest spirit** **becomes spirit**?

The **foolish** have heard from **recluses** that:
**Heaven** is **vast and empty**, yet its **form resembles a chicken’s egg**,
while **Earth** is **encased within Heaven**,
like the **yolk** within a chicken’s egg.

The **upper and lower, four directions** of **Earth**—
all are **empty**, and the **void within the void** is **Heaven**.

**Earth** **suspends** in the **void**,
enduring eternally without **falling**,
because **Heaven** **operates externally**,
**revolving day and night** without **ceasing for a moment**.

**Heaven** **tilts northward and southward**,
thus the **North Pole** **rises above Earth** by **thirty-six degrees**,
while the **South Pole** **descends below Earth** by **thirty-six degrees**.

The **Yellow Path (Dao/Way)** **encircles Heaven’s core**,
and the **sun and moon** **traverse the void**,
never **departing the Yellow Path** during **day and night**.

The *Book of the Sui Dynasty* claims: **"The sun enters the water."**
This is **false**.
Water **originates from Earth**,
and its **movement** does not **depart from Earth**.

Earth’s **four boundaries** are all **Heaven**—
how could there be water?
To say water **floats upon Heaven** and **loads Earth** is even more **false**.

On the **Winter Solstice**,
when the **day** is near the **South Pole**,
the **sun** **travels in Heaven’s southern region**,
and **yang qi** is **far from humanity**,
thus **cold nights** **retreat into Earth’s void** below,
while **yang qi** **remains beneath humanity’s feet**—
this is why **wells and springs** are **warm**.

On the **Summer Solstice**,
when the **day** is near the **North Pole**,
the **sun** **travels directly above humanity’s head**,
and **yang qi** **straight down**—
thus **hot nights** **retreat into Earth’s void** beyond the **northern expanse**,
while **yang qi** is **not in Earth’s depths**—
this is why **wells and springs** are **cold**.

**Ten thousand things** **spring forth and grow**,
**summer-long and winter-hide**,
by the **yang qi** from the **solar yin** beneath Earth,
**steaming upward** from below.

They **autumn-harvest and winter-conceal**,
by the **yang qi** **gradually withdrawing** from Earth’s depths.

This **principle** is **clear**, yet the **bewildered** do not know it.

Even **birds, beasts, insects, and fish**—
those **born from the womb**, those **born from eggs**,
those **born from dampness**, those **born from transformation**—
and **grasses and trees** **blooming and bearing fruit**,
white as white, red as red,
large as large, small as small—
all **common folk** see their **manifestation (ran)**,
yet none know their **principle of manifestation**.

Thus it is said: **"Humans know the **manifest spirit** of their **spirit**,
but do not know the **principle of the unmanifest spirit**—
how it **becomes spirit**."**

The **sun and moon** have **fixed numbers**,
and **great and small** have **determined measures**.
From this **sage’s function** **emerges**,
and **spiritual luminosity** **arises**.

The **sun and moon**—are they not **spirit**?
Their **movement and revolution**,
one **cold**, one **hot**—
when **cold departs**, **heat arrives**,
and when **heat departs**, **cold returns**—
this too is **spirit**.

Who else but the **sage** could **illuminate** it?
To **know** and **illuminate** **spirit**—
its **function** is **indeed that of the sage**.**

The sun advances one degree each day,
and in one cycle traverses **365¼ degrees** to complete the heavens.
The moon advances **thirteen degrees and a fraction** each day,
and in twenty-eight days completes the heavens—
yet it requires **two additional days** to align with the sun and form a new moon.
In twenty-seven days, it completes the heavens—
yet it requires **three additional days** to align with the sun and form a new moon.
Thus it is said: **"The sun and moon have fixed numbers,
and great and small have determined measures."**

The sage considered that the common people did not know
the fixed numbers of the sun and moon,
and that their **spring plowing and autumn harvests** would lose their proper timing.
Thus he established the calendar and clarified the seasons,
using **intercalary months** to regulate the four seasons and complete the year.
**Every three years**, one intercalary month is added;
**every five years**, two are added;
**every nineteen years**, seven are added—
this constitutes a **chapter**,
and thus the new moon always falls on the same day.
Its numbers are fixed and cannot be altered.

The sage **assisted the nurturing transformations** of Heaven and Earth,
and his achievements were such that the common people all came to know
the **spirit of the sun and moon**,
and its principles became clearly manifest.
Thus it is said: **"The sage’s function emerges,
and spiritual luminosity arises."**

As for **stealing the mechanism**—
none under Heaven can see it,
none can know it.
The **noble one** who attains it **fortifies his essence**,
while the petty one who attains it **recklessly endangers his life**.
Before the mechanism is triggered, it is hidden and does not reveal itself—
who can see it?
Who can know it?
Thus it is called **"stealing the mechanism."**

This mechanism—
when the noble one attains it, he **fortifies his essence**,
for the noble one **knows the Mandate** and does not act recklessly;
when the petty one attains it, he **recklessly endangers his life**,
for the petty one **does not know the Mandate** and acts recklessly.

The blind excel in hearing,
the deaf excel in sight.
Cutting off one source of profit,
one’s effectiveness is **tenfold** that of a teacher;
**threefold reversals** of day and night,
one’s effectiveness is **ten thousandfold** that of a teacher.
The blind have no sight, yet their ears are keen;
the deaf hear nothing, yet their eyes are sharp—
one focus, undivided.
Those who study the **Dao**,
if they can **sever private desires for profit** and apply their will without division,
their effectiveness will be **tenfold** that of the masses.
People merely fail to reflect upon themselves.

If one can **diligently guard the three essentials**—
**ears, eyes, and mouth**—
and maintain sincerity day and night,
their effectiveness will be **ten thousandfold** that of the masses.

The **heart** arises from things,
dies from things—
its mechanism lies in the **eyes**.
The heart moves in response to things—this is to **arise from things**;
to chase after things and forget to return—this is to **die from things**.
The heart is the **dwelling of spirit**,
the eyes are the **windows of spirit**.
Where the eyes go, the heart follows—
its mechanism indeed lies in the eyes.

Heaven’s **greatest benevolence** arises from its **seeming lack of benevolence**.
Swift thunder and violent winds—
all creatures tremble in response.
Heaven, in its dealings with things,
lets them follow their natural course—
though one might say it has no benevolence.
Yet when it **strikes with thunder and lightning**,
and **nourishes with wind and rain**,
all living things beneath Heaven tremble and respond—
is this not **great benevolence** arising from what seems like none?

**Supreme joy** leaves **nature in excess**,
**supreme stillness** brings **clarity**.
The wise find joy—
joy brings **knowing the Mandate** and **no cause for worry**,
so their nature is in **abundance**, unconstrained;
the virtuous are still—
stillness brings **calmness** and **no desires**,
so their nature is **pure and ungreedy**.

Heaven’s **ultimate particularity** becomes **ultimate universality**.
Heaven’s **Way** is utterly universal and without particularity.
People see only one thing’s birth, one thing’s growth,
and assume Heaven’s **ultimate particularity**,
without considering the sun and moon’s illumination,
the rain and dew’s reach.
All flying, swimming, moving, and rooted beings
each maintain their **nature and life** while harmonizing with the **Great Unity**—
this is Heaven’s **ultimate universality**.
How could Heaven ever **partially favor** one thing?

The **regulation of birds** lies in **qi**.
In spring, the **oriole sings**—who makes it sing?
In autumn, the **wild geese arrive**—who makes them come?
The regulation of birds lies in **qi**.

**Life** is the **root of death**;
**death** is the **root of life**.
**Benevolence** arises from **harm**,
**harm** arises from **benevolence**.
**Life** refers to the movement of all things—
when movement reaches its extreme, it returns to stillness,
thus **life is the root of death**.
**Death** refers to the stillness of all things—
when stillness reaches its extreme, it returns to movement,
thus **death is the root of life**.
**Benevolence** refers to Heaven’s **nourishing of things**,
**harm** refers to Heaven’s **destroying of things**.
There is **autumn and winter’s storage and concealment**,
then **spring and summer’s flourishing and growth**;
there is **spring and summer’s spreading and prosperity**,
then **autumn and winter’s withering and fall**.
Thus it is said: **"Benevolence arises from harm,
harm arises from benevolence."**

The foolish take Heaven and Earth’s **patterns and principles** as **sagely**,
I take **seasonal things’ patterns and principles** as **wise**.
The foolish consider Heaven and Earth’s **patterns and principles** as **sagely**—
if sagely, they cannot be fully measured.
Since they cannot be measured, they do not exhaust their principles.
Though they call it sagely, they do not know **how** it is sagely.

I consider **seasonal things’ patterns and principles** as **wise**—
if wise, they can be known.
The knowing exhaust their principles to attain knowledge—
then even if Heaven and Earth are sagely,
I too can measure them—
how much more so for seasonal things?
The **patterns and principles of seasonal things**
are the **patterns and principles of Heaven and Earth**.
To not know Heaven’s **patterns** is to observe only Heaven’s **timely suitability**,
to not know Earth’s **principles** is to perceive only Earth’s **material tendencies**—
why seek them in the distant and lofty?

The concluding passage, over a hundred characters long,
some take as **commentary**, others as **main text**,
such as: *"The **Way of Heaven and Earth** is gradual,
thus **yin and yang** prevail in turn."*
Meaning: In the space between Heaven and Earth,
when **yang is strong**, it **overcomes yin**,
when **yin is strong**, it **overcomes yang**—
like water **gradually permeating** things.
Though Zhu Wuzhi took it as commentary and did not explain it,
when answering his disciples’ questions, he deeply adopted its meaning—
thus I include it as well.
