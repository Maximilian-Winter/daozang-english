**Preface to the Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s Yinshu Jing**
Composed by Shu Chancellor Zhuge Liang

What is called *ming* (命) is *xing* (性).
Since *xing* can communicate with *ming*, the Sage reveres it—
with Heaven’s decree, the common man is made foolish,
while the Sage is made wise.

Thus it is said:
*"When the Heavenly mechanism is taut, there is no death;
when the Earthly mechanism relaxes, there is no birth."*

Observing the *Yinshu*,
one sees that creation lies in the hands of mortals,
while life and death lie in the hands of mortals.

Thus the Sage conceals it in the heart,
using it to mold Heaven and Earth,
to gather and disperse the world without leaving a trace—
this is the Heavenly mechanism.

Hence, the Yellow Emperor attained it and ascended to the Cloudy Sky,
Tang and Wu attained it and ruled the world,
and the Five Hegemons attained it and unified the feudal lords.

Though it is easy for a subject to wield it,
it is difficult for a ruler to employ it lightly.
Tai Gong at ninety was not unmet—
he simply discerned his master’s worth.

If a wise man were to grasp and apply it,
setting stone as sovereign and carving wood as king,
he could still enjoy the world.

Yet when a subject exhausts his loyalty
and the ruler recoils in fear—
is this not difficult indeed?

Alas! Without a virtuous ruler,
the righteous man dies rather than serve,
preferring to scatter his resolve among the rocks
and nurture his life in seclusion,
awaiting rebirth in the lofty stages of existence.

The world deems Confucius as unmet,
and Qin Yi as fortunate in his time—
yet how could one who seeks to establish the cosmos
stoop to chase after petty gains?

This is what the *Yinshu* condemns.

Alas! Later sages who discern and apply it—
Fan Li was heavy and enduring,
while Wen Zhong was light and perished.
Was this not a betrayal of Heaven’s mechanism?

He who betrays Heaven’s mechanism
shall sink for three kalpas—
this is inevitable.

Thus the Sage concealed it in sacred mountains,
transmitted it to kindred spirits,
and hid it in golden repositories,
fearing that the petty would steal and misuse it.

**Collective Commentaries on the Yellow Emperor’s Yinshu Jing**
Commentaries by Yi Yin, Tai Gong, Fan Li, Guiguzi, Zhuge Liang, Zhang Liang, and Li Qun.

*"To observe the Dao of Heaven,
to grasp Heaven’s actions—
this is exhaustive."*

**Introduction:**
The *Yinshu* first speaks of Heaven’s Five Thieves—
those who perceive them prosper.

Tai Gong says:
The first thief is *ming* (命),
the next thief is *wu* (物),
the next thief is *shi* (时),
the next thief is *gong* (功),
the last thief is *shen* (神).

To steal *ming* with a single act,
the world uses it for *wei* (味).
To steal *wu* with urgency,
the world uses it for *li* (利).
To steal *shi* with trust,
the world uses it for *fan* (反).
To steal *gong* with favor,
the world uses it for *yuan* (怨).
To steal *shen* with verification,
the world uses it for *xiao* (小) and *da* (大).

Guiguzi says:
Of Heaven’s Five Thieves,
none is greater than stealing *shen*—
for the small can take the great,
and Heaven and Earth cannot conceal it,
yet it sinks into the hands of mortals.

Li Qun says:
The Yellow Emperor stole the mechanism of *ming*,
and ascended in broad daylight.
The Yin and Zhou dynasties stole the verification of *shen*,
and used the small to extinguish the great.
Guan Zhong stole the trust of *shi*,
and united the feudal lords nine times.
Fan Li stole the urgency of *wu*,
and became hegemon of the southern Yue.
Zhang Liang stole the favor of *gong*,
and defeated the mighty Chu.

The Five Thieves reside in the heart,
yet their effects manifest in Heaven.
The cosmos lies in the hands of mortals,
and all transformations arise from the body.

Tai Gong says:
The Sage calls them Five Thieves,
while the world calls them Five Virtues.
Man eats the Five Flavors and lives,
eats the Five Flavors and dies—
yet no one abandons them in resentment.
The heart’s inclinations are the same.

Guiguzi says:
Stealing *ming* can lead to immortality—
the Yellow Emperor was inspired by a maiden’s *jing* and *qi*,
and the same applies to all things.
Even winter grass, if covered, does not die,
but exposed, it withers—
plants and trees, with their rooted nature,
are still thus;
how much more so for humans,
the most refined of all things,
whose mechanisms depend on the maiden’s timely essence.

Guangchengzi says:
To accumulate fire and burn the Five Poisons—
the Five Poisons are the Five Flavors.
When the Five Flavors are exhausted,
immortality is attained.

Li Qun says:
Man lives by the Five Flavors,
dies by the Five Flavors—
each flavor governs its own domain:
harmonizing them brings life,
defying them brings destruction.
Prolonged indulgence accumulates *qi* and fumes,
rotting the five viscera,
until annihilation is near.
Thus, those who do not complete their natural span
are weighed down by their own excess.

Hence, the Supreme Dao is insipid,
and embryonic breathing is flavorless.

There are a hundred methods of Daoist cultivation,
yet their essence lies in *bao yi shou zhong* (embracing unity, guarding the center).
There are a hundred methods of maidenly arts,
yet their essence lies in *huan jing cai qi* (returning essence and refining *qi*).
There are a hundred methods of Golden Elixir alchemy,
yet their essence lies in *shen shui hua chi* (divine water, flowered pool).
There are a hundred methods of statecraft,
yet their essence lies in *qing jing zi hua* (clarity, purity, self-transformation).
There are a hundred methods of warfare,
yet their essence lies in *qi zheng quan mou* (strategic odd-even, power and deception).

These five matters—
when rolled up, concealed in the heart, hidden in the spirit;
when applied, they permeate Heaven and bind Earth.

The cosmos can be grasped in an instant,
life and death can be wielded in the body.
The Yellow Emperor attained it,
first securing the Three Palaces,
then governing the myriad lands,
and when the tripod was complete,
he rode the dragon and ascended to Heaven.

Heaven’s nature is *ren* (人).
Man’s heart is the mechanism.
To establish Heaven’s Dao is to define humanity.

Zhuge Liang says:
To establish Heaven and define humanity—
this lies in the Five Thieves.

When Heaven’s killing mechanism is unleashed,
dragons and serpents rise from the land.
When man’s killing mechanism is unleashed,
Heaven and Earth are overturned.

Fan Li says:
In ancient times, Yi Yin served the Yin,
and when he unleashed Heaven’s killing mechanism,
the command of Xia was exhausted,
and the deed was fulfilled.
Thus there were grievances from the eastern conquest of the western barbarians,
and the southern conquest of the northern nomads.

Tai Gong says:
If one does not till the fields,
three years of great drought follow.
If one does not inspect the people,
ten years of land collapse follow.
When one slays over ten thousand,
great winds and storms arise.

Zhuge Liang says:
When Chu unleashed its killing mechanism against the Han army of tens of thousands,
great winds obscured the skies, darkening the day as though Heaven and Earth were overturned.
This is when Heaven’s and humanity’s killing mechanisms align—
the foundation for all transformations is set.

Liang says:
From this single act of trust arises all trust—
thus it becomes the foundation for all transformations.

Qian says:
In times of great chaos and disorder,
wars, floods, droughts, and locust plagues—
these are Heaven’s killing mechanisms.

Yu Shun refined the clay to make vessels,
Xia Yu rescued the drowned,
Yin imprisoned the Xia sovereign,
Zhou held the Zhou king captive in Youli,
Han Zu became a market overseer,
Wei Wu begged for alms—
all were not born to royal station,
yet they seized Heaven’s killing mechanisms.

Rising from obscurity to rule,
virtuous men in exile while knaves hold power,
tyrants wielding authority,
the people yearning for rebellion—
these are humanity’s killing mechanisms.

Tang of Shang exiled Jie,
Wu of Zhou overthrew Zhou,
Xiang Yu beheaded the infant heir of Chu,
Wei deposed Liu Xie—
these were seizing humanity’s killing mechanisms.

When the noble falls to ignominy,
and the lowly ascends to nobility,
it is as though Heaven and Earth were overturned—
Heaven’s and humanity’s mechanisms align,
and the logic of success and failure is manifest.

Amid myriad transformations and changes,
the Sage acts in accordance to establish the foundation of affairs.

Nature has its clever and clumsy—
these can be concealed or revealed.

Liang says:
When the Sage perceives cleverness or clumsiness,
where one’s advantage lies in another’s disadvantage,
his strategy is formed in mind;
where one’s advantage aligns with another’s,
then the Dao of the Sage, the wise, and the heroic unfolds.
How much more so in the art of war?

Qian says:
When inner desires do not manifest, it is called *opening* (启);
when external evils do not penetrate, it is called *closing* (闭).
External closing and inner opening—
this is the mechanism.

Hard to discern as darkness,
immovable as mountains—
the clever and clumsy of nature
make one unable to detect gaps,
yet allow glimpses.

The nine orifices’ evils
lie in the three critical points,
which can be moved or stilled.

Tai Gong says:
The three critical points are the ears, eyes, and mouth.
Ears can be pierced to dull hearing,
eyes can be blinded to disrupt vision,
the mouth can be sharpened to stammer.
When raising an army and stirring the masses,
no ten thousand men can fathom its subtlety.
Among these three, some can be moved, some can be stilled.

Qian says:

The two leaves covering the eyes—
the great Tai Shan cannot be seen;
the two beans plugging the ears—
the thunder cannot be heard;
a single berry brushing the tongue—
one cannot speak with ease.
When the nine orifices are all filled with evils,
they cannot perceive the subtleties of change.

Yet among these three, there are *spirit* (神), *mind* (心), and *will* (志).
When the mechanism moves but has not yet taken form,
*spirit* follows it;
when the mechanism’s signs are about to manifest,
*mind* plans for it;
when the mechanism is triggered and action begins,
*will* decides upon it.

When the mechanism moves,
its force aligns with *yang* (陽),
and the Five Great Mountains cannot suppress its corner,
nor the Four Great Seas contain its span.
When the mechanism stirs,
its virtue harmonizes with *yin* (陰),
and wise men cannot manipulate its glory,
nor deep scholars discern its schemes.
Heaven and Earth cannot alter its timing—
how much less can men?

Fire arises from wood,
and disaster strikes when it erupts.
Deceit arises from the state,
and collapse follows when it moves.
To know this and refine one’s conduct—
this is the way of the *sage* (聖人).
Qian says:
Fire arises from wood,
yet when it first appears, it is formless.
Deceit arises from the state,
yet when it first appears, it is without sign.
Only the *Supreme Sage* (至聖) can cultivate the self and refine actions,
preventing the fire of deceit from igniting.
Thus, a state may have soldiers without war,
and disasters without calamity.

Ji Zi fled yet was bound in a leather apron,
Shang Rong was imprisoned while Shěn Shù wept.
Heaven’s birth and death—
the Dao’s natural order.
Liang says:
The mechanism emerges from the mind,
like Heaven’s giving life or taking it,
so that those born say they gained their birth,
and the dead say they met their fate.

Heaven and Earth are thieves of all things;
all things are thieves of man;
man is a thief of all things.
When these three thieves are in harmony,
the Three Talents are at peace.

Ghost Valley Master says:
The three thieves are mutual ignorance—
this is called *spirit*.
To understand these three,
how much more can one abandon wealth and treasure,
even if it could empty rivers and seas,
or shift mountains to cover the earth?
If one acts without *fate* (命),
then success follows.

Qian says:
Heaven and Earth, along with all things, are born of *qi* (精氣),
and they decline and age through theft.
All things, as man’s tools and adornments,
steal from him through arrogance and excess.
Man, as the sovereign of all things,
steals from them through ruin and destruction—
all proceed naturally,
and the three thieves each fulfill their role,
while the Three Talents sequentially uphold their duty.

Thus it is said:
To eat in season, the hundred bones are in order.
To move the mechanism, all transformations are at peace.
Ghost Valley Master says:
I do not wish for future generations of rulers
to hoard treasures and amass gold and silk,
for if one can abandon them,
even emptying rivers and seas would not be enough to challenge it.
To eat is to nourish the hundred bones,
yet losing one’s season brings a hundred ailments.
To move is to harmonize all things,
yet losing the mechanism harms all things.
Thus the most opportune moment
admits no pause—
to act before it is to overreach,
to act after is to miss it entirely.
Hence, the virtuous guard the moment,
while the unworthy cling to fate.

Men know their *spirit* yet remain *spirit*,
but they do not know how *spirit* comes to be.
Qian says:
All men possess the *sage’s* virtue,
yet they do not value the *sage’s* folly.
Having seen their virtue,
they must also observe their folly.
Having seen their folly,
they must again see their virtue—
hence the *Book of Documents* says:
To rely solely on cleverness and insight,
affairs will not succeed.
To rely solely on obscurity and dullness,
affairs will all falter.
One moment of clarity, one moment of obscurity—
the multitude depends upon them.

Yi Yin kept taverns,
Tai Gong butchered cattle,
Guan Zhong made leather,
Bai Li Xi sold porridge,
yet when the time of decline and chaos came,
men said they were not *spirit*-guided—
until they met Tang the Victorious,
encountered Wen Wang,
served Qi Huan,
or met Qin Mu,
when the Dao flowed through their lives,
and their achievements reached the cosmos,
and men called them *Supreme Spirit*.

The sun and moon have their numbers,
the great and small have their limits.
From these, *sage*ly achievements arise,
and *spirit* and clarity emerge.

Ghost Valley Master says:
Future generations pondering this will realize
that Heaven and Earth are not to be prized—
how much less so men?

Qian says:
A year contains three hundred sixty-five days,
and days have their numbers,
months cycle eleven or twelve times,
with accumulated *intercalary months* (闰) defining great and small—
the remaining fractions are set,
all receiving *qi* (精氣) naturally,
not created by *sage*ly achievements or *spirit*.
*Sage*ly achievements and *spirit* also arise from *qi*,
not from the sun and moon.

Thus, success is not prized from Heaven and Earth,
nor defeat blamed upon *yin* and *yang*.
Its theft of the mechanism—
none under Heaven can know it.

The *gentleman* (君子) who gains it secures his life;
the *petty man* (小人) who gains it risks his fate.
Zhuge Liang says:
Was the Duke of Zhou not more virtuous than Sun, Wu, Han, and Bai?
Yet this is why the *gentleman* and *petty man* differ.

The Four Sons’ courage reached the point of self-sacrifice,
yet they were slain because they did not grasp their master’s intent.

Qian says:
When the master’s intent is slighted,
none under Heaven can perceive the mechanism of humiliation,
nor can they know the source of it.
When the *tyrant-king* (霸王) moves to expand his realm,
none can perceive the mechanism of founding a state,
nor can they know its source.

The *gentleman* who gains the mechanism
responds to Heaven and aligns with men,
thus securing his life.
The *petty man* who gains the mechanism
disturbs the military and indulges in violence,
thus risking his fate.

The *Book of Changes* says:
The *gentleman* acts upon seeing the mechanism,
requiring no delay until day’s end.
It also says:
Does one know the mechanism’s *spirit*?

The mechanism is easy to see yet hard to know—
to see the near and know the far.
The blind excel in hearing,
the deaf excel in sight.
To sever one source of advantage,
one can multiply the army tenfold;
to reverse day and night three times,
one can multiply the army ten thousandfold.

Yin says:
To ponder with precision,
is to exhaust its subtleties.
Liang says:
Future generations pondering this—
the sharpness of ears and eyes,
to sever one source of advantage.

Qian says:
The ears and eyes of men
are all divided by the mind,
and culminate in *spirit*.
When the mind is divided,
the mechanism is not precise;
when *spirit* is exhausted,
the mechanism is not subtle—
thus, Shi Kuang blinded his eyes yet sharpened his ears,
Li Zhu coated his ears yet brightened his sight,
yet relying on one source of advantage alone
would reverse the army’s strength in the mind.
To undertake actions and trigger the mechanism,
all will be fully achieved.

The retreat of thought through three reversals,
to traverse the day and endure the night—
to think, then act.

When undertaking actions and triggering the mechanism,
all will be accomplished with absolute certainty.

**Taigong** says:
When the eyes move, the heart responds.
If what is seen is favorable, act;
if what is seen is not, halt.

The heart arises from things, perishes from things—
the mechanism lies in the eyes.

**Qian** says:
None surpass the heart and eyes
in being the mechanism of the world.

The heart can activate the eyes,
the eyes can perceive the mechanism.

When Qin Shi Huang toured the east at Kuaiji,
Xiang Yu saw its mechanism—
his heart arose from things—
and told Xiang Liang:
*"He can be taken and replaced."*

When the Jin army fully assembled at Huaihe,
Fu Jian saw its mechanism—
his heart perished from things—
and told Fu Rong:
*"They are a formidable enemy—
why are they so few?"*

Thus, one knows that the heart’s life and death lie in things,
while the mechanisms of success and failure appear in the eyes.

Heaven, though without favor, gives rise to great favor.
Swift thunder and fierce winds—
none fail to tremble in awe.

**Liang** says:
How resplendent!

**Taigong** says:
Caution and reverence bring fortune.

**Qian** says:
Heaven’s heart has no favor,
yet all things have hearts,
returning favor to Heaven.

**Laozi** says:
Heaven and Earth are not kind,
treating all things as straw dogs.
The Sage is not kind,
treating the people as straw dogs.

Thus, they bestow without expecting repayment,
give birth without claiming credit.

Yet when swift thunder and fierce winds strike—
their might is distant, their terror near—
all things tremble in fear,
Heaven holds no threat, yet all things fear it,
and all things, fearing, return threat to Heaven.

The Sage, in bestowing rewards,
has no favor toward those who merit them.
In punishing crimes,
has no threat toward the guilty.

Thus, rewards and punishments are established by the ruler,
while awe and favor operate below.

Supreme joy leaves excess,
supreme stillness leaves purity.

**Liang** says:
The mechanism lies here.

**Qian** says:
Joy leads to extravagance,
stillness to integrity.
Excess dulls the spirit,
purity clears the spirit.

The spirit is the source of wisdom—
when clear, wisdom is bright.
Wisdom is the repository of the heart—
when balanced, the heart is even.

No one mirrors themselves in flowing water,
but in still water—
for its clarity and evenness.

When the spirit is clear and intent is balanced,
one can discern the true nature of things.

The Sage does not indulge in supreme joy,
nor rest in supreme stillness,
but dwells between pure spirit and measured delight—
this is called *guarding the Middle*.

Thus, advantages cannot seduce,
sounds and colors cannot disrupt,
persuasive speakers cannot deceive,
wise men cannot sway,
brave men cannot intimidate.

They foresee calamity beyond the heavy gates,
anticipate disaster in the deepest darkness—
Heaven itself cannot defy them,
let alone the deceptive ways of war.

Heaven’s utmost partiality—
**Yin** says:
*Refining the subtlest extremes.*

Its use is utterly impartial.
**Liang** says:
*Its mechanism is flawless—
even without commanding the world, it acts.*

The world cannot know it,
the world cannot defy it.

**Qian** says:
Heaven’s Dao curves to complete all things without omission.
The *chun* mushroom, the *jun* fungus, the *peng* bird, the *yuan* wildfowl—
ministers of varying refinement and stature,
each attaining its place—
this is utmost partiality.

Clouds march, rain descends,
thunder crashes, lightning strikes,
frost and rainbows—
life and death balanced—
this is utmost impartiality.

The Sage follows Heaven, models Earth,
nourishes the people,
discerns their labor and suffering—
this is utmost partiality.

Issues just decrees,
applies laws with precision—
this is utmost impartiality.

**Sun Wu** says:
View your soldiers as beloved children—
you can die with them.
View your soldiers as infants—
you can lead them into deep ravines.

Love without command is like a spoiled child—
thus, govern them with ritual,
align them with force.

The principle of *qi* determines prey.
**Taigong** says:
*Does it not lie in greatness and smallness?*

**Yin** says:
*Qi is Heaven’s mechanism.*

**Qian** says:
The tortoise devours the python,
the falcon strikes the crane.
The *huangyao* (yellow-bellied beast) preys on tigers,
the flying squirrel severs the monkey,
the toad and leech consume fish,
the wolf and *yi* (wild dog) gnaw at cranes.

Gold melts in sweetness,
the *heche* (river turtle) absorbs it to endlessly transform into jade,
realgar alters iron,
there are woods that do not burn,
stones that float—
when birds, beasts, trees, and stones attain their *qi*,
even the small can overcome the great—
how much more so when heroes attain their *qi*,
and cannot purify the world or master the cosmos?

Life is the root of death;
death is the root of life.
Favor arises from harm,
harm arises from favor.

**Taigong** says:
Those who diminish themselves are loved by things,
those who enrich themselves are slighted by things.

**Qian** says:
To plot for life,
one must first die, then live.
To accustom oneself to death,
one must first live, then die.

**Huguanzi** says:
Not dying, not living,
not severing, not completing.

**Sun Wu** says:
Cast them into death’s ground and they will live,
drive them to ruin’s edge and they will survive.

**Wu Qi** says:
On the battlefield, where corpses stand,
those who must die will live,
those who hope to live will die.

Favor is the source of harm,
harm is the source of favor.
Wu bestowed favor on Yue and gave rise to harm,
Zhou established harm against Shang and gave rise to favor.

Life and death, favor and harm—
opposing yet intertwined.

The foolish take Heaven and Earth’s patterns as sagely,
I take the patterns of things as wise.

**Taigong** says:
Observe the timing of birds and beasts,
scrutinize the changes of all things.

**Qian** says:
When the *jing* star appears,
when the yellow dragon descends,
when the soaring phoenix arrives,
when the *li* spring gushes forth,
when fine grains grow,
when the river does not overflow,
when the sea does not surge,
when the sun and moon are eclipsed,
when the five stars stray,
when the four seasons disorder,
when day darkens and night shines,
when mountains collapse and rivers dry,
when winter thunder or summer frost strikes—
the foolish take these as Heaven and Earth’s patterns,
as the mechanisms of order and chaos.

With tranquil thought, light shines to the four quarters,
virtue is perfected, and the nine clans are cherished.

The six ministries and three affairs
do not encroach upon their ranks,
all grains are cultivated,
the myriad people prosper—

While the foolish ruler and corrupt ministers
issue conflicting laws,
impose heavy taxes and harsh governance,
deceive above and below,
while noble relatives and favored ministers
indulge in arrogance, excess, and licentiousness,
drunk on wine, obsessed with music,
building towering halls and ornate walls—
the people flee and resent the ruler.

「At this moment, the patterns of things are the mechanisms of order and chaos.
The common folk regard it as a time of doubt and foolishness,
but I do not regard it as such.
The common folk hope for a sage, but I do not wait for one.

The *Yǔ* says:
*"The hearts of the wise and virtuous are profound and subtle, beyond measure.
The traces of *Yóuchuāng*’s actions may be glimpsed by some.
But when it comes to responding to change without fixed methods,
to the boundless intelligence that shifts with every circumstance—
how could the common folk foresee it?
To judge the heart by its traces is the folly of the ignorant."*

Thus it is said:
*"To sink into water or plunge into fire is to court one’s own destruction.
To govern men without wisdom leads to their ruin,
to lead armies without strategy results in the loss of soldiers.
Without death, there is no escape from death;
without life, there is no escape from life—
thus, one who understands death and life
brings peace to the state.*

The Dao of Nature is tranquil,
and so Heaven and Earth, along with the myriad things, flourish.
The *Yǐn* says:
*"When tranquility reaches its utmost, one does not know how things come to be.*
The Dao of Heaven and Earth is gradual,
and so *Yīnyáng* prevails in its transformations."

The *Liáng* says:
*"The Dao of Heaven and Earth is subtle yet relentless in its unfolding triumph.
When *Yīnyáng* push against each other, their changes proceed in perfect harmony."*

The *Liáng* says:
*"When *Yīnyáng* clash and interact, their transformations appear even in the flicker of an eye.
Thus, the Sage knows that the Dao of Nature cannot be defied,
and acts accordingly to regulate it."*

The *Liáng* says:
*"The great person sees it as the natural way,
the wise and virtuous see it as regulation,
the foolish see it as mere transformation."*

The *Yǐn* says:
*"To know the Dao of Nature is to realize that all things cannot defy it.
Therefore, one acts in accordance with it for advantage."*

The Dao of utmost purity
cannot be fully captured by laws and calendars.
The *Liáng* says:
*"Observing the timing of birds and beasts,
and noting the changes of all things—
when birds and beasts reach their purest state,
laws and calendars cannot fully grasp them.
Yet, from this, one discerns their hidden patterns."*

Here lies a wondrous instrument,
the source of all phenomena.
The eight *guà* and sixty *jiǎzǐ* cycles
decipher but one ten-thousandth of its workings.
Its principles are divine, its secrets concealed.

The *Liáng* says:
*"The six *yǐng* cycles are the hidden Dao of Heaven,
capable of concealment and suppression."*

The techniques of *Yīnyáng*’s mutual triumph
are made manifest through their symbols.
The *Liàng* says:
*"This wondrous instrument is the Sage’s wisdom.
Heaven displays its symbols,
and the Sage follows them in action.
By tracing the *jiǎzǐ* cycles,
drawing the eight *guà* patterns,
interpreting the *shī* stalks and *guī* shells,
and consulting laws and calendars—
the emotions of ghosts and gods,
the principles of *Yīnyáng*,
are revealed in their symbols,
and nothing remains concealed."*

The *Liàng* says:
*"The symbols of the eight *guà* are applied and put to use;
the sixty *jiǎzǐ* cycles are turned and utilized.
When divine principles emerge and spirits move,
all is illuminated in a single moment."*

The *Liáng* says:
*"The origin of all things and their transformations
is the mind itself.
To master the techniques of concealing and revealing *Yīnyáng*,
and to align with the cycles of sun and moon—
these are made clear in the human heart."*

The *Guǎngchéngzǐ* says:
*"The *jiǎzǐ* cycles correspond to the number nine of *Yīnyáng*.
The patterns of the *guà* reveal the methods of deploying armies.
To deploy armies is to use the *Lǜ* [music/ritual],
to move in accordance with ghosts and gods,
to follow Heaven’s will and adapt to the times—
thus, one applies the Dao of ghosts and gods."*

The *Yǐnhújīng* of the Yellow Emperor concludes here.
