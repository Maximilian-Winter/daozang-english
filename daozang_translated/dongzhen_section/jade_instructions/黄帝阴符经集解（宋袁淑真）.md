### **Preface to *The Yellow Emperor’s Yinshu Jing with Explanations***

The Yellow Emperor, in his profound contemplation, reached the depths of boundless mystery (*huanghuang*), pondering the interplay of Heaven and humanity, elucidating the subtle workings of yin and yang in motion and stillness. The text states: *"To know and refine—this is the sage."* Indeed, the Yellow Emperor attained this and ascended to the Cloud Celestial; his wisdom was unmatched.

The Yellow Emperor expounded the Dao’s principles, seeking to save all beings. Fearing later generations might neglect its practice, he condensed its essence into over three hundred words, piercing to the true source and transmitting it to the world. The worthy concealed it as a *xian* scripture, yet common folk passed it down as a military treatise.

This text is concise yet profound, its words simple yet its meaning deep. Former scholars, though many, offered interpretations, yet their explanations remained incomplete, leaving mediocre scholars either preserving or losing its core. Until the Tang dynasty’s **Lixian of Longxi (Li Qun)**, who further elucidated it—yet without establishing chapter-by-chapter commentary—how then could the profound text be fully illuminated?

The **Mother of Mount Li** said: *"The Yinshu’s three hundred words—one hundred speak of the Dao, one hundred of method (*fa*), one hundred of technique (*shu*)."* She further stated: *"Above, there is the Dao of the Immortals embracing Oneness; in the middle, the method of enriching the state and benefiting the people; below, the technique of strengthening arms and achieving victory."* The Holy Mother revealed these three aspects clearly.

Confucian scholars followed tradition but failed to analyze them. Now, I shall outline the three chapters’ essential meanings, dividing them into three volumes—upper, middle, and lower—each expounding its foundation. First, I briefly sketch the framework; later, I elaborate in detail. This is not to surpass former masters but to supplement the deficiencies of later learners.

### **Volume One: Explanations by Yuan Shuxin, Former Official and County Magistrate of Changsha, Yuan Shuxin**
**Chapter: The Immortal’s Embracing of Oneness—Elucidating the Dao**

**Text:**
*"Observe the Dao of Heaven, grasp Heaven’s actions—thus it is complete."*

**Yuan Shuxin’s Explanation:**
If one observes Heaven’s Dao in principle and follows it in practice, then the proper interplay of yin and yang in motion and stillness is fully realized.

Heaven is the refined *qi* of yin and yang. The light and pure ascends to form Heaven, while the heavy and turbid descends to form Earth. Heaven and Earth are connected yet never separate. Thus, **Liezi** in *Yuce* told the people of **Qi**: *"Heaven is merely accumulated *qi*; Earth is merely accumulated matter. From Earth upward, all is Heaven. You walk within Heaven all day—why fear its collapse?"*

Thus, knowing Heaven and Earth reveals that yin and yang are two *qi*, and within *qi* are the Five Phases (*wuxing*), which are the dynamic functions of yin and yang. All things emerge and grow from them; thus, they are the offspring of the Five Phases.

If one observes the Dao of Heaven and Earth—yin and yang—and follows the Five *Qi* of Heaven in action, then the rise and fall of all things, life and death, can be discerned. Beyond this, there is nothing further to observe or grasp—hence, *"it is complete."*

**Text:**
*"Thus, Heaven has five ‘bandits’ (*zei*); those who see them prosper."*

*"The five ‘bandits’ dwell in the heart; their actions extend to Heaven. The cosmos lies within the palm; all transformations arise from the body."*

**Yuan Shuxin’s Explanation:**
Heaven generates the Five Phases—these are the *"five bandits."* If one attends to them with the mind, follows Heaven’s actions, then the cosmos rests within the palm, and all things manifest from the body.

The *"five bandits"* are the *qi* of the Five Phases: Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth.

**Lü Wang’s Commentary** states: *"The sage calls them ‘bandits’; the world calls them ‘virtues’ (*de*)."* People consume the Five Flavors yet do not resent them for causing death—this is the meaning of *"bandits."*

**Yuan Shuxin’s View:**
*"Bandits"* means *"harm."* If one acts contrary to their natural order, they become harmful—thus, they are called *"bandits."*

This refers to how yin and yang encompass the Five *Qi*. In Heaven, they are the Five Stars; on Earth, the Five Sacred Peaks; in governance, the Five Directions; in things, the Five Colors; in sound, the Five Tones; in food, the Five Flavors; in the body, the Five Viscera; in the Dao, the Five Virtues. If not used properly, they become *"bandits."*

*"Bandits"* refers to how the Five Phases mutually restrain and generate one another, ceaselessly day and night, able to steal life and death, the success and failure of all things—hence, *"bandits."*

If one understands the restraining Dao of the Five Phases and discerns the sources of yin and yang’s rise and fall, then acting in accordance with them is *"seeing"* them. Thus, the Five Viscera are truly realized, and skillful use brings fortune and prosperity.

Why does the text say, *"Those who see them prosper"*? Because the Five Phases are within the heart. Once the heart knows them, one uses them to observe and grasp the Five *Qi* in action, distinguishing between what is contrary and what is顺, aligning with Heaven’s mechanisms without error. Then, the cosmos lies within the palm, and all things arise from the body. Thus, all actions are auspicious, and one wanders with the Dao—how could this not bring prosperity?

In governing, if one upholds *ren* (benevolence), *yi* (righteousness), *li* (rites), *zhi* (wisdom), and *xin* (faithfulness), one achieves wealth, honor, and flourishing—how could this not be prosperity?

Thus, if one follows the Five Phases’ generating cycle in action, it aligns with *yang* and becomes *virtue/power* (*de*). If one applies their restraining cycle, it aligns with *yin* and becomes *"bandits"*—harm.

Therefore, the Three Realms’ Celestial Masters all govern by principle, and their established scriptures and teachings speak only of cultivating goodness and calling it *virtue/power*, never of cultivating evil and calling it *"bandits"* or harm.

Thus, those who cultivate *virtue/power* (*de*) with goodness are *xian*—masters of *yang*; those who indulge in *yin*’s evil and harm are *mo*—essence of *yin*. Beyond this, idle discourse is vain.

Hence, Confucius proclaimed: *"The Three Hundred Poems"* may be summed in one phrase—*"Think not evil."* The *Yijing* states: *"When one’s words are good, they resonate a thousand miles away; when they are not, they meet with resistance."* This is the ultimate Dao—why must one elaborate on cultivation?

The essence of the Dao lies not in these words. Those who grasp the origins of *yin-yang*’s success and failure in the Three Realms find all principles exhausted in the first chapter of the *Yinfu*. Yet common folk, seeing few words and shallow meaning, fail to fathom profound logic beneath the surface—how much more so than the vast teachings of the Three Teachings?

Thus, the Mother of Mount Li said: *"To observe its refined principles, the Eight Scenes of the *Huangting* are insufficient for study; to discern its utmost essence, the Classics, Commentaries, and Histories are inadequate for exposition; to employ cunning intelligence, the stratagems of Sunzi, Wuqi, Han Fei, and Baiqi are insufficient for ingenuity."* Such is its meaning.

The scripture says: *"Heaven’s nature is humanity; human heart is the mechanism."* Establishing Heaven’s Dao to govern humanity.

*Shuzhen* says: *"To establish Heaven and govern humanity lies in the Five Evils."* For the human heart governs the soul’s office, while the body is the spirit’s domain. When one seeks to enact the Five Evils, none surpasses the heart’s influence. Thus, if the heart’s deeds are deliberate, this diagram must align with Heaven’s Dao.

Then, though the cosmos be vast, all observation lies within the hand; though myriad things exist, their life and death are confined within technique. Thus, Heaven and Earth are not to be prized for their remoteness, let alone what lies before the ears and eyes. Hence it is said: *"A rectified heart repels evil."*

The scripture says: *"When Heaven unleashes the killing mechanism, dragons and serpents rise upon the land. When humanity unleashes the killing mechanism, Heaven and Earth invert."* When Heaven and humanity jointly unleash the killing mechanism, all transformations are fixed.

*Shuzhen* says: *"Heaven’s killing mechanism is the public way; humanity’s is private sentiment."* Dragons and serpents, stirred by the public way, rise in trembling; private sentiment disrupts Heaven and Earth, causing inversion. Both align with the public way, and thus ten thousand transformations are fixed.

Heaven contains the Five *qi*, sequentially giving life and death—this is natural. Heaven’s life and death mechanisms all align with their proper function; they should not act arbitrarily. *Yin-yang* transformation, eras shifting, discarding the old for the new—this is Heaven’s killing mechanism, utterly just.

Those who ride Heaven’s killing mechanism, whether as dragons or serpents, or hidden beings, all rise in trembling upon the heights. Following Heaven’s timing, they move freely within their due—this is to ride Heaven’s mechanism without error.

When humanity unleashes the killing mechanism, causing Heaven and Earth to invert: humanity is the child of the Five Phases, and must follow the Five *qi*’s life and death, submit to *yin-yang*’s transformation. How dare they presumptuously stir life and death?

As for the world’s laws: *"He who kills shall die; he who takes life shall be punished."* Why? Because it is not Heaven’s will to kill that person—how dare they kill?

As for treacherous ministers, rebellious subjects who defy Heaven’s Dao, betray their sovereign and kin, indulge in cruelty, harm the world, and presumptuously slaughter—what then? They invert Heaven to make Earth, and Earth to make Heaven. Such great chaos is the greatest calamity against Heaven—this is called *Heaven and Earth’s inversion*.

Then, humanity’s resentment and the gods’ wrath arise; Heaven will punish them, and humanity will slay them. If a ruler loses Heaven’s mandate, and both Heaven and humanity align in their killing mechanism, this is called *"Heaven and humanity jointly unleashing the mechanism, fixing all transformations."*

To subdue rebels and punish traitors, executing them in accordance with Heaven’s will—this aligns with Heaven’s proper mechanism, fulfilling the utmost justice. Then all things submit, none daring to act arbitrarily—this is called *fixing the mechanism*.

The Dao of ruler and subject values public justice. If one’s actions and responses align with Heaven’s mechanism, and their applications harmonize with Heaven’s Dao, this is *Heaven and humanity jointly unleashing the mechanism*.

How then does this bring peace to the heart, stability to all things, order to the Five Phases, and sanctity to mountains and rivers? Above, *virtue/power* and *Dao* are practiced; below, rites and righteousness are mirrored. Disasters do not arise, calamities do not occur—Heaven and humanity remain tranquil. This is called *Heaven’s mechanism*.

The scripture says: *"Nature has skill and clumsiness, which may be concealed."* *Shuzhen* says: *"Human skill and clumsiness must not be revealed; speak cautiously, choose goodness, lest misfortune arise."*

All possess innate wisdom—skill, clumsiness, virtue, and folly—yet few speak of it. As for those with slight cleverness, eloquence, and wisdom, who flaunt their talents without regard for gain or loss, only to invite ruin—why? Because they do not conceal themselves, do not act with caution, and thus court disaster.

The *De Jing* says: *"Great eloquence seems stammering; great skill seems clumsy."* This speaks of concealment. The *Zhouyi* says: *"If the ruler is not discreet, he loses his ministers; if the minister is not discreet, he loses his life; if affairs are not discreet, harm is done."* Such is the meaning.

To conceal means that even the wise and virtuous, though possessing cleverness, eloquence, and vast learning, must in action align with propriety—how then is this not skill? If they always conceal themselves, hiding great and small, their use may invite jealousy, envy, slander, and retaliation. How much more so for the clumsy and foolish, who act impulsively, revealing nothing, and thus invite misfortune?

The virtuous cultivate the Dao and nurture *virtue/power*; their skill and clumsiness are hidden within. Then, inwardly, they observe their true nature; outwardly, they scorn evil and licentiousness. They act upon the good and diminish the bad, refining their conduct to become sages—how could outsiders know their innate skill or clumsiness?

「All say I am naturally virtuous and saintly, yet they do not know the cultivation and refinement that bring this about, hence the saying: *"It can be concealed."*

The Classics state: *"The nine orifices’* **evil tendencies** (邪, *xie*—harmful or misaligned tendencies), rooted in the three essentials—**eyes, ears, and mouth**—can be governed through **action and stillness** (动静, *dongjing*—active and passive responses)."

**Shu Zhen** (淑真) says: *"The nine orifices* (九窍, *jiuqiao*—nine sensory openings: two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, mouth, anus) *all can generate afflictions*, but these originate from the three essentials—**speech, sight, and hearing**—so one must be cautious to prevent calamity from arising."*

**Zhuangzi** (庄生) taught: *"Humans possess a hundred limbs, nine orifices, and six viscera* (六腑, *liufu*—six internal organs: liver, gallbladder, spleen, stomach, large intestine, small intestine), *yet life persists within them.* Humans are formed from the five **qi** (五气, *wuq*—five elemental breaths: wood, fire, earth, metal, water), with the head round and the feet square. The four limbs and five viscera, along with the **three souls** (三魂, *sanhun*—spiritual essences associated with the kidneys, liver, and lungs) and **seven spirits** (七魄, *qiqi*—spiritual essences associated with the heart, spleen, lungs, kidneys, liver, gallbladder), alternately give rise to **evil and virtue** (邪正, *xiezheng*—harmful and harmonious tendencies), and reciprocally serve as **lord and subject** (君臣, *junchen*—ruling and subordinate forces).

Among these, the **nine orifices** (九窍) are the pathways where **evil and virtue**, **calamity and blessing** (祸福, *huofu*—misfortune and fortune) flow through the body. The most urgent matters of **evil and virtue**, **calamity and blessing**, lie within the **three essentials**—that is, the **eyes, ears, and mouth** (眼、耳、口).

The *Dao De Jing* (《道经》) says: *"The five colors* (五色, *wuse*—colors associated with the five elements: green, red, yellow, white, black) *blind the eyes, the five sounds* (五音, *wuyin*—musical notes associated with the five elements) *deafen the ears, and the five flavors* (五味, *wuwei*—tastes associated with the five elements) *dull the mouth."* This is so.

Those who embody **Dao and virtue** (道德, *daode*—the Way and its moral power) do not let their eyes behold **evil colors** (邪色, *xieze*—lustful or corrupting sights), their ears listen to **evil sounds** (邪声, *xieyin*—harmful or seditious words), or their mouths speak of **evil matters** (邪事, *xieqi*—wicked deeds). For all **virtuous affairs** (正事, *zhengshi*—righteous or beneficial matters), they engage in **seeing, hearing, and speaking** of them—this is called **action** (动).

When encountering **evil**, they forget it, and **all** (悉, *xi*—completely) do not allow their **hearts, eyes, ears, and mouths** to dwell upon or repeat it—this is called **stillness** (静).

**Confucius** (宣尼) said: *"To choose and follow the good is called **action** (动). To choose and abandon what is not good is called **stillness** (静)."*

The *Xiao Jing* (《孝经》) states: *"When words fill the world, there is no mouth without fault; when actions fill the world, there is no resentment or grievance*—this arises because one’s **body and mind** (身心, *shenxin*) are upright and free from **evil tendencies** (邪恶, *xie’e*), thus achieving this outcome. But when one encounters the good, they act; when they meet with **evil**, they remain still—then **all calamities and misfortunes** (祸息, *huoxi*—disasters and afflictions) are prevented by the **eyes, ears, and mouth** being firmly guarded.

Hence the saying: *"The nine evils lie in the three essentials, which can be governed through action and stillness."*

The Classics also say: *"Fire arises from wood, and when calamity erupts, it must be subdued."* *"Delusion* (奸, *jian*—deceit, corruption) *arises within the realm* (国, *guo*—state, body), *and when it acts at the wrong time, it will collapse.*" Knowing this and refining oneself is what is called a **sage** (圣人).

**Shu Zhen** says: *"The metaphor of* **delusion-fire** (奸火, *jianhuo*—corrupting or harmful tendencies) *is likened to human nature, while* **wood-realm** (木国, *muguo*—the body as a realm) *is likened to the human form. This teaches one to govern their state and stabilize their body, preventing* **delusion-fire** *from erupting, and then refining their conduct to become a sage.*"

This is one illustration of the **sage’s intent** (圣意, *shengyi*), using metaphors to clarify the **appropriateness of action and stillness** for the **nine evils** and **three essentials** above. It urges one to be earnest in cultivation and refinement, lest they fail to exhaust the principles and fully grasp their nature. Thus, the metaphor of **fire hidden within wood and delusion within the realm** is employed, commanding diligent refinement to attain sainthood.

The phrase *"wood contains fire"* is a metaphor for *"the human body harbors* **evil tendencies** (邪恶, *xie’e*) *and the* **Five Poisons** (五毒, *wudu*—five corrupting influences: lust, anger, greed, delusion, doubt)." **Lu Wang** (吕望, *i.e.*, Zhuangzi) annotated: *"Guang Chengzi* (广成子, *a Daoist sage*) *believed that accumulating fire could purge the* **Five Poisons***, thus knowing fire as a fierce and powerful* **qi** (气)."

The *Book of Documents* (《书》) says: *"Fire blazes across the hills, and even jade and stone are consumed."* If **fire** is present within **wood**, one must beware of probing it—when the fire erupts, the wood will burn. If **evil tendencies** and **poisons** reside within the body, one must be cautious not to indulge them—if they are given free rein, **all goodness** (万善, *wanshan*) *will perish, and the body will collapse.*

The saying *"Delusion arises within the realm, and when it acts at the wrong time, it will collapse"* means that in any **realm** (国), there are inevitably **deceitful individuals** (奸人, *jianren*) *and treacherous ministers* (贼臣, *zeichen*) *who harbor calamity and plot against the state.* They scheme to usurp power or seek wealth and honor through underhanded means—such cases are countless. All these **evil tendencies** lurk within the realm, yet the ruler cannot fully discern them.

But if the ruler upholds **Dao and virtue**, and the ministers act with loyalty and integrity, if the times are harmonious and customs flourish, then the world will be at peace. Even if **deceitful individuals** have wicked intentions, they lack the means to recklessly act upon them. They await their opportunity, and only when conditions align do they move—how could the ruler lose their **Dao**, or the ministers abandon their **virtue**, when **floods, droughts, famines, and plagues** (兵水旱蝗, *bingshuihanhuang*—military conflicts, floods, droughts, locusts) arise, and **taxation and levies** (征敛, *zhenglian*) *are harshly imposed* (苛克, *keke*—excessively oppressive)? In such eras, **all things** (万物, *wanwu*) *are filled with rebellious intent*—how much more so for those who already harbor **delusion**? How could they refrain from acting?

Moreover, **delusion** takes many forms. When the time comes for their schemes to unfold, all manner of **corruption** erupts, and how could such a **realm** avoid collapse? This metaphor illustrates the **nine evils** and **three essentials**, explaining the **appropriateness of action and stillness** for the wise and virtuous.

The saying goes: *"If one possesses* **Dao and virtue**, *the wisdom and insight* (定慧, *dinghui*—calm discernment and enlightened wisdom) *are concealed within their* **body and mind**. *Even* **evil tendencies, licentiousness, and depravity** (淫秽僻, *yinhuiqi*—lustful, filthy, and perverse inclinations) *cannot provoke them to act.* If **evil tendencies** and **licentiousness** erupt unchecked, then the body will collapse. Hence, the metaphor of **delusion-fire** hidden within the **wood-realm** illustrates how **evil and virtue** are concealed within the **body and mind**. This metaphor reveals that the wise and virtuous thoroughly understand its meaning, comprehend the principles of **interest and decline** (兴废, *xingfei*—rise and fall), and apply **action and stillness** appropriately. Then, through refining their conduct and purifying their actions, they become sages—this is called knowing and cultivating, and thus they are called sages.*"

Hence the saying: *"Above, there is the Dao of the* **immortal sages** (神仙, *shenxian*) *who embrace* **Oneness** (抱一, *baoyi*—embracing the singular, unified principle)."

**Zhuge Liang** (诸葛孔明) further stated: *"The sage conceals their wisdom within the heart, shaping the* **Heaven and Earth** (天地, *tiandi*) *as if molding clay*—this is the way of the* **Yellow Emperor** (黄帝). *The virtuous learn and master this method.*"

**Shu Zhen** says: *"To govern through the five elements’* **virtue** (五行之善政, *wuxing zhishen zheng*—beneficial policies aligned with the five phases), *not to defy Heaven’s timing* (不逆天时, *buini tian shi*—not opposing the natural seasons), *not to disrupt Earth’s order* (不逆地理, *buni di li*—not contravening natural laws), *not to harm the times* (不伤时, *bu shang shi*—not damaging the temporal flow), *and not to injure beings* (不害物, *bu hai wu*—not harming living things)—to enrich the state and secure its people, making oneself a virtuous and wise ruler—this is to master the method.*

Those who embody **Dao and virtue** as rulers are like **Emperor Yao** (尧) *and* **Emperor Shun** (舜). *The wise learn and attain the art.*"

**Shu Zhen** says: *"To apply Heaven’s Dao, to distribute Earth’s benefits, to be cautious in one’s conduct and moderate in one’s use to nourish one’s parents—this is to practice* **ren** (仁, *benevolence*), **yi** (义, *righteousness*), **li** (礼, *propriety*), **zhi** (智, *wisdom*), **xin** (信, *trustworthiness*), **zhong** (忠, *loyalty*), **xiao** (孝, *filial piety*), and to honor **jun** (君, *ruler*) and **qin** (亲, *kin)—to remain steadfast in* **cheng** (贞, *uprightness*) *and* **lian** (廉, *integrity*), *and to safeguard one’s blessings and position*—this is to attain the art. Such are the virtuous ministers like **Qin** (夔) *and* **Long** (龙)."

*The petty learn and reap their punishment.*"

**Shu Zhen** says: *"To command the* **Five Phases’ qi** (五行之气, *wuxing zhqi*—elemental breaths of wood, fire, earth, metal, water) *without considering the beneficial applications of cultivation, using one’s cleverness, eloquence, and wisdom* (巧智辩慧, *qiaozhi bianhui*—artifice, intelligence, persuasive cunning) *to engage in the three reversals* (三反, *sanfan*—three forms of perversion: harming Heaven, Earth, and humanity) *day and night—disturbing the military, indulging in warfare, plotting secretly to slaughter and harm, selfishly pursuing luxury and splendor, plundering and seizing from others in this world*—though they may temporarily gain wealth and honor, they do not reflect upon the impending **calamity** (祸患, *huohuan*), instead inviting **ruin and defeat** (亡败, *wangbai*), which extend to future generations. This is to reap their punishment. Such are the **usurpers and treacherous ministers** (篡逆悖乱之臣, *cuan ni beiluan zhichen*) like **Lu Sima** (禄山) *and* **An Lushan’s** (思明, *i.e.*, An Lushan’s title) *ancestors, the deceitful and rebellious officials of ancient and modern times.*"

The **Sage Mother** (圣母, *Shengmu*—likely referring to **Lady Zhi** or **Empress Fu Shou**, mythical Daoist figures) further remarks: *"This text is profound and vast, like the morning tide of the great sea that gathers all streams."* It is the **chapter of the immortal sages embracing Oneness and manifesting the Dao** (抱一演道章, *baoyi yandao zhang*—section on the unified principle and its unfolding in the Way) from the **one hundred and five words** above. All these teachings clarify the **principles of yin and yang** (阴阳之道, *yinyang zhidao*), the **logic of rise and fall** (兴废之理, *xingfei zhili*), and the **appropriateness of action and stillness**—then one must refine their conduct and purify their actions to become a sage.*"

「The **Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing* with Commentary, Volume One** and **Volume Two**—Commentary by **Cluan Shuxin**, a **Jiaosancang Lang** of **Changsha County**, **Xingtan Prefecture**—**Chapter on the Way of Prospering the Nation and Securing the People** (*Fu guo an ren yan fa zhang*)

The *Jing* states: *"Heaven and Earth are the thieves of all things."*

Cluan Shuxin explains: *"Heaven covers, Earth bears; all things grow unseen. The **qi of the void** (冲气, *chongqi*—primordial, unrestrained *qi*) nurtures in darkness, hence they are called 'thieves.' Heaven and Earth are none other than **yin and yang** (阴阳, *yinyang*). The terms **yin and yang** (阴阳), along with the **Five Phases** (五行, *wuxing*), together form the **Seven Qi** (七气, *qigong*). Beyond these, how can anything else in the world be more perplexing?*

It speaks of how all things—whether born from **embryonic development** (胎卵, *tailuán*), **moist transformation** (湿化, *shīhuà*), or **sprouting** (百谷草木, *bǎigǔ cǎomù*)—all derive from these **Seven Qi** to grow and flourish, emerging from the **formless** (无形, *wúxíng*) yet giving rise to the **formed** (有形, *yǒuxíng*). They silently nourish and complete their own bodies, like thieves in motion—unnoticed yet ever-present. Heaven and Earth also silently bestow their **qi**, responding endlessly, all things secretly receiving their cover and sustenance, each attaining its own peace.

Thus it is said: *"Heaven and Earth are the thieves of all things."*

The *Jing* states: *"All things are the thieves of man."*

Cluan Shuxin explains: *"All things steal from Heaven and Earth to grow and flourish; man steals from all things to nourish his body. If one knows the proper **division and alignment** (分合宜, *fēnhé yí*), it is but the natural order of things.*

Man, along with beasts, plants, and trees, all receives **yin and yang** to grow. Yet man is the most **refined** (最灵, *zuìlíng*), positioned in the **central realm** (中宫, *zhōnggōng*), with a **mind of wisdom and insight** (智度, *zhìdù*), capable of **reflecting upon his true nature** (反照正性, *fǎnzhào zhèngxìng*), penetrating to the **original source** (本始, *běnshǐ*), and comprehending the **harmonious interplay** (明会, *mínghuì*) of the **qi of yin and yang and the Five Phases**. He follows their patterns and applies them—this is why the **Sixty-Four Hexagrams of the *Zhou Yi*** (周易六十四卦, *Zhōuyì liùshísì guà*) and the **Sixty Jiazi Cycles** (六十甲子, *liùshí jiǎzǐ*) exist.

Thus the earlier passage says: *"Those who see it prosper."* Man, within these **Seven Qi**, can silently take and nourish his body from all things that grow from them, hence the saying *"thieves."* For example, the **cultivators of fields and silkworms** (田蚕之类, *tiáncán zhīlèi*).

*The *Liezi* states*: *"There was a wealthy man of the State of Qi who said: ‘I am skilled in thievery.’ Heaven has its seasons, Earth has its advantages. When Heaven’s seasons and Earth’s advantages align, thieves steal the **abundant rains** (雨泽, *yǔzé*) to nourish their fields. Land thieves steal from beasts and birds; water thieves steal from fish and turtles. I began with thievery, and in the first year, it was urgent; in the second year, it was sufficient; in the third year, it was abundant. From then on, my wealth extended to the entire region. I steal from Heaven and Earth without suffering misfortune or blame. But you steal from others’ gold and silk—how can you remain unpunished?’*

All things steal from Heaven and Earth to grow; the people steal from all things to nourish their bodies. If one knows the proper **division and alignment**, it is but the natural order. This is the meaning of *"all things are the thieves of man."*

The *Jing* states: *"Man is the thief of all things."* When the **Three Thieves** (三盗, *sǎn dào*—Heaven, Earth, and man) align properly, the **Three Powers** (三才, *sān cái*—Heaven, Earth, and man) are at peace.

Cluan Shuxin explains: *"‘既’ (既, *jì*) means ‘to exhaust’ or ‘fulfill.’ When the **Three Thieves** exhaust their proper roles, the **Three Powers** fulfill their positions in harmony."*

It speaks of how man, if he only knows to steal from all things to nourish himself and attain wealth, yet fails to recognize that all things can also steal from man to bring misfortune. The **three interdependent roles of thievery** (上来三义更相为盗, *shànglái sān yì gēngxiāng wéi dào*—the cyclical nature of Heaven, Earth, and man as thieves) are also part of the natural order.

In all cases of thievery, there must be **Dao/Way**. If one conforms to its proper alignment, it brings **good fortune** (吉, *jí*); if one defies its natural logic, it brings **calamity** (凶, *xiōng*). Thus, *The Liezi* asks: *"Is there a Way in thievery?"* and replies: *"How could it lack a Way?"*

To **enter first** (入先, *rùxiān*) is **sageliness** (圣也, *shèng yě*—divine foresight);
To **know what is permissible or forbidden** (知可否, *zhī kěfǒu*) is **wisdom** (智也, *zhì yě*);
To **enter first** (入先, *rùxiān*) is **courage** (勇也, *yǒng yě*—boldness in action);
To **exit last** (出后, *chūhòu*) is **righteousness** (义也, *yì yě*—proper conduct);
To **distribute fairly** (分均, *fēnjūn*) is **benevolence** (仁也, *rén yě*).

Without these **Five Virtues** (五德, *wǔ dé*), one cannot become a **great thief** (大盗, *dà dào*). This is the **Dao/Way within thievery** (盗中之道, *dào zhōng zhī dào*).

In the **Three Thieves**, one must also follow **Dao/Way**, ensuring all align in their proper roles—then the **Three Powers** will not falter, and each will fulfill its position in harmony. This prevents **transgressing boundaries and harming one’s nature** (越分伤性, *yuèdào shāngxìng*), which would bring misfortune.

The *Jing* states: *"Eat according to the seasons, and all parts of the body will be in order. Act in accordance with the **mechanisms of change** (动其机, *dòng qí jī*—the natural triggers of transformation), and all transformations will be at peace."*

Cluan Shuxin explains: *"If man’s **diet and nourishment** (服食, *fúshí*) do not lose their proper seasons, his body will suffer no harm. If his **actions and movements** (兴动, *xīngdòng*) align with their proper mechanisms, all transformations will be at peace."*

It refers to man’s **understanding of life and destiny** (理性命, *lǐngxìngmìng*)—all are tied to **diet and flavors** (滋味, *zīwèi*). Thus, *The Zuo Zhuan* states: *"Flavors circulate the *qi*; *qi* circulates the mind. Nourishing the form and moistening the spirit must return to **diet**."* The **Yellow Emperor** says: *"When man takes **food and drink** (服食, *fúshí*), he must first consider the **Five Flavors** (五味, *wǔ wèi*), the **Five Meats** (五肉, *wǔ ròu*), the **Five Vegetables** (五菜, *wǔ cài*), and the **Five Fruits** (五果, *wǔ guǒ*), all requiring **proper timing and moderation** (调候得所, *tiáohòu désuǒ*). If consumed **cooked** (熟, *shú*), they benefit the body; if consumed **raw** (生, *shēng*), they harm the **organs** (脏, *zàng*). This is the meaning of **‘eating according to the seasons.’***

Thus, if man’s **diet and nourishment** do not lose their proper seasons, and his **flavors** do not exceed their proper alignment, conforming to the **middle way** (中道, *zhōngdào*), without transgressing boundaries or harming his nature, then his **four limbs** (四肢, *sìzhī*) will be harmonious, his **five organs** (五脏, *wǔ zàng*) will be at peace, no sickness will arise, and he will **preserve his longevity and fulfill his natural lifespan** (保终, *bǎo zhōng*). Is this not the meaning of *"all parts of the body will be in order"*?

Thus, *The Kang Cangzi* states: *"Eating well in winter keeps the body warm; eating well in summer keeps the body cool. If the seasons are right, man will have no sickness; if man has no sickness, epidemics will not spread; if epidemics do not spread, man will attain his natural lifespan."* Hence it is said: *"Grains are man’s **life-essence** (命, *mìng*); Heaven therefore **prospers kings through agriculture** (兴王务农, *xīngwáng wù nóng*). If a king does not **pursue agriculture** (务农, *wù nóng*), he abandons his people. How then can he have a nation?"*

Only when the **Three Thieves** align in their proper roles and the **Three Powers** fulfill their duties in harmony—all conforming to the **natural order**—must one then **adjust with laws and governance** (法令平正, *fǎlìng píngzhèng*) to **employ the worthy and utilize the capable** (用贤使能, *yòng xián shǐ néng*). Let **beneficence extend to all creatures** (泽及昆虫, *zé jí kūnchóng*) and **transformation pervade all plants** (化被草木, *huà bèi cǎomù*). If all actions align with the **proper mechanisms of Heaven’s Dao** (天道之机宜, *tiāndào zhī jī yí*), then **yin and yang will follow the seasons** (阴阳顺时, *yīnyáng shùnshí*), the **world will be in peace and tranquility** (寰宇宁泰, *huányǔ níngtài*), and all things will attain their own stability and peace.

This is the meaning of *"acting in accordance with the mechanisms of change, and all transformations will be at peace."*

The *Jing* states: *"Man knows his **spirit** (神, *shén*) through its manifestation, yet does not know how the **non-manifested spirit** (不神, *bù shén*) manifests the spirit."*

Cluan Shuxin explains: *"**Yin and yang** generate all things—man calls this ‘spirit.’ Yet he does not know of the **supreme Dao/Way**, which remains **still and silent** (静嘿, *jìng hū*), yet is the **ultimate source of spirit** (至神, *zhì shén*) that can generate **yin and yang and all things.** ‘Spirit’ is the **mysterious and unfathomable** (妙而不测, *miào ér bù cè*)."*

The *Yijing* states: **"Yin and yang’s unfathomable workings are what is called spirit."** Men merely see all things arising from yin and yang, sun and moon, and call this "spirit." Yet they fail to recognize that yin and yang, sun and moon, arise from the **non-spirit**. What is this **non-spirit**? It is the **Supreme Dao/Way**. The **Supreme Dao/Way** is **empty and still**, **silent and quiescent**, yet **not spirit**—yet within this **non-spirit** lies the power to generate sun and moon, yin and yang, the Three Realms, and all ten thousand things, flourishing and thriving. All this originates from the **Supreme Dao/Way’s** empty stillness. Thus, the **non-spirit** is the **ultimate spirit**.

Therefore, the *Dao De Jing* says:
*"Fathomless and obscure,
Within it lies the essence;
Vague and indistinct,
Within it lies the substance."*
This clearly reveals the principle that within the **Supreme Dao/Way’s** **non-spirit** lies the **ultimate spirit**.

To awaken cultivators to the principle of **effortless non-spirit**, they must reflect upon their true nature, practice the **Way of non-action**, preserve thought and hold to the One, return to simplicity and restore authenticity, and align with the **Way of non-action**, ever deeper into the **mysterious**. Only then will they attain **silent quiescence** and **non-spirit**, and thus **"act without doing"**—this is what is called **non-spirit**.

Hence, *Laozi* says:
**"The Dao acts without doing, yet nothing remains undone."**
This is the **non-spirit** that achieves the **ultimate spirit**.

The *Jing* states:
**"Sun and moon follow their appointed courses, great and small have their fixed measures."**
From this arise **sagely efficacy** and **spiritual luminosity**.

Cluan Shuxin explains:
The sun and moon revolve without deviating from their degrees, their greatness and smallness are fixed—this reveals the power of **sagely efficacy** and the effects of **spiritual luminosity**. Sun and moon are the **refined qi of yin and yang**, the most exalted within the **Six Extremes**. Their courses, their greatness and smallness, are determined by calendrical and astronomical laws, each with its allotted measure, revolving without error. Thus it is said:
**"Sun and moon follow their appointed courses, great and small have their fixed measures."**
From this arise **sagely efficacy** and **spiritual luminosity**, for within the **Six Extremes**, all things rely on the sun and moon’s illumination, the movement of yin and yang to generate life—possessing **dynamic and vegetative power**, profound and sagely. Hence it is said:
**"From this arise sagely efficacy and spiritual luminosity."**
Yin and yang’s unfathomable workings are called **spirit**, the sun and moon’s luminous clarity are called **luminosity**—thus, **spirit and luminosity**. All things under heaven and earth are nurtured by **sagely efficacy and spiritual luminosity**, emerging from **non-being to being**, their functions manifest. Hence it is said:
**"From this arise sagely efficacy and spiritual luminosity."**
Again, all things in the world receive this **sagely force** and are born. Great and small have their fixed measures—none overstep, so the small does not covet the great, nor the great despise the small. Thus Zhuangzi says:
**"The peng and the yuan each soar freely, neither envying the other."**
This is the meaning of **"great and small have their fixed measures."**

Further, from the sovereign down to the common folk, each follows its appointed measure, neither encroaching nor usurping, so that above and below live in harmony, customs are settled, and the times are peaceful—this is called **Great Peace**. Hence it is said:
**"Within it lies the method for enriching the state and securing the people."**

The *Jing* states:
**"Those who steal the mechanisms—none under heaven do not see them, yet none can know them. The sage who attains them secures his person; the petty man who attains them risks his life."**

Cluan Shuxin explains:
Stealing the mechanisms is profound yet easily seen, difficult to know. The sage recognizes the mechanism of **accumulating virtue** and thus secures his person; the petty man pursues the mechanisms of **honor and disgrace** and thus risks his life.

What is **stealing the mechanisms**? Suppose a family steals from heaven to gain wealth—all see it as the mechanism of planting and cultivating, yet they do not grasp the deep principle behind their gain. Because they themselves lacked it first, they recognize it in others, secretly plotting to activate its mechanisms, unaware, stealing what is to come to enrich themselves—this is called **stealing the mechanisms**.

All under heaven see this **stealing of mechanisms**, yet none can fathom its depths. If some do know, their understanding differs between the petty and the sage. The sage knows the mechanism of **securing his person**: he recognizes that within the **Supreme Dao/Way** lies all virtue, and whatever he seeks will surely come to pass, like an echo to sound. By secretly and silently cultivating, activating the mechanism of habitual virtue, aligning with the Dao, guarding the One, preserving thought, and refining essence to cultivate, he steals the profound mysteries to preserve his nature. Perhaps he steals the **Spirit Water, Flower of Jade, or Golden Elixir** to attain immortality—sages and virtuous men know this wondrous mechanism, cultivating and refining to become sages. Hence it is said:
**"The sage who attains them secures his person."**

The petty man’s mechanism of **risking his life** is this: he merely seeks wealth and jade, sparing no labor, or cultivates talent and martial skill, enduring no hardship, adorning himself with clever stratagems to seize the world’s fleeting mechanisms of honor—whether through extravagance and favor, military peril, or avarice that harms himself, or entanglement in wealth and desire that brings calamity. Though he may briefly gain superficial honor, he cannot escape misfortune and blame, for he does not know the wondrous mechanism of the Dao. Hence it is said:
**"The petty man who attains them risks his life."**

This is the chapter expounding the **method for enriching the state and securing the people**, with ninety-two words guiding people to take and discard according to the mechanisms, clearly perceiving the principle of the **ultimate spirit**—this is the mechanism of **nurturing transformation, securing life, and fortifying the person**. Hence it is said:
**"Within it lies the method for enriching the state and securing the people."**

**"The *Method for Strengthening the Army and Achieving Victory* Chapter**

The text states:
*"The blind excel in hearing, the deaf excel in sight.*
*Cutting off one source of profit, the army is ten times more effective;
*Threefold reflection day and night, the army is a hundred thousand times more effective."*

Cluan Shuzhen comments:
*"Cutting off profit"* means that if one blocks out distractions, vision becomes clear, and if one closes the eyes, hearing becomes acute. The aim is to keep the body and mind unperturbed, and one’s affairs sharply focused. It is said that when a person’s eyes covet improper sights, they cannot hear true sounds; when their ears indulge in improper noises, their vision fails to discern proper sights. Thus, sight and hearing both originate from the mind.

*The Daoist sage*, whose mind is free of deceit, though exposed to myriad sights and sounds, remains steadfast in their purity. Without attachment or craving, their mind is as unobstructed as one without ears or eyes. Why must they be blind or deaf?

But when the mind aligns with truth, ears and eyes remain untainted; when ears and eyes are untainted, the body and mind remain undisturbed; when undisturbed, thoughts become luminous; when thoughts are luminous, all actions and decisions conform to the **Dao/Way**, yielding tenfold advantage over ordinary perception. All undertakings succeed—why need they rely solely on an army?

The same principle applies elsewhere.

*"Threefold reflection day and night, the army is a hundred thousand times more effective"* means that when the ruler’s mind is steadfast, their ears and eyes keen, and their actions and decisions tenfold more effective than usual; and when, moreover, they engage in threefold deliberation, day and night, with unwavering focus, their actions and decisions are a hundred thousand times more effective than ordinary perception—why need they rely solely on an army?

Confucius said: *"Threefold reflection, then act. This suffices."*
He urged people to deliberate with utmost precision—this is the same intent.

*"The army"* refers to **warriors**;
*"Warriors"* are **tools of violence**;
*"War"* is a **perilous matter**.

In lands of conflict or moments of dire peril, one must engage in threefold reflection and careful deliberation. If one is negligent in strategy, reckless in advance or retreat, defeat will follow immediately. That is why this passage emphasizes the need for disciplined reflection—it is not about truly employing an army, but using the metaphor of *"the army"* to urge one to cultivate and safeguard their own mind.

Moreover, the **Daoist sage** who abhors evil as they would a sworn enemy—this is the **thief** (of virtue). The wise recognize this: by severing the source of profit, embracing threefold reflection, and deep, meticulous contemplation, they align with truth, dwell in integrity, and exterminate the deceitful thief within. Thus, they fortify their own person, and over time, attain the **Dao/Way**—as when the Yellow Emperor vanquished **Chi You**.

As for ancient and modern great generals—Sun, Wu, Han, Bai, **Wu Hou (Zhuge Liang)**, and **Li Jing (the Duke of Wei)**—all excelled in employing armies, mastering threefold reflection day and night, and achieving success in their undertakings. Thus, they ascended to the ranks of **enlightened rulers**, securing their own honor and wealth, and only then could they be said to possess the *Method for Strengthening the Army and Achieving Victory*—a **Dao/Way** that risks one’s life if misapplied.

The Yellow Emperor attained it and ascended to the **Cloudy Heights**, while his teachings endure in the **Play of the Mysterious Void**.

Hence, the earlier passage states:
*"The sage who attains this fortifies their person;
*The petty man who attains it risks their life."*

The text states:
*"The mind is born from things, dies from things; the mechanism lies in the eyes."*

Cluan Shuzhen comments:
*"When the mind covets things, it shortens one’s lifespan;
*When the eyes see without restraint, the will becomes reckless.*
But if one can curb the eyes and gather the mind, there will be no misfortune or ruin.

*The Daoist sage*’s mind does not generate deceit, nor does their mechanism move recklessly—they simply respond to circumstances. Yet those who indulge in them, taking all things to nourish their body and sustain their life, also follow natural principle—only they must not exceed their proper measure, nor act contrary to nature, lest they harm their own essence.

Thus, the *Kang Cang Zi* says:
*"Ten thousand men drawing bows, all aiming at a single target—no arrow misses.*
*Target: a mound (of arrows).*
*Or: Target, the archer.*
*All things manifestly harm one life—the life that cannot escape injury is the **essence of life**.*
*Today’s deluded ones often nourish their **essence of life** with things, thus knowing no rest.*
This speaks of how the mind’s greed for things leads to being robbed by them, bringing ruin to one’s person.

Thus, the *Family Sayings* say:
*"Unrestrained desires, insatiable cravings—this is the **death of the form**."*

The *Laozi* says:
*"Knowing contentment brings no disgrace;
*Knowing restraint brings no peril.
*This is how one endures long—
*The precious thing is knowing contentment.*
*To dwell in moderation, not exceeding bounds,
*Yet one indulges in nourishing themselves with things,
*And harms their true nature—
*This is to invite harm from others,
*And is how the mind is born from things.*

*The mechanism lies in the eyes* means that when one’s actions generate deceitful thoughts toward things, it is always because the eyes have seen them, and the mind has thus been stirred—hence it is said: *The mechanism lies in the eyes.*

To curb the eyes, one must not gaze upon improper or lustful sights, lest the mind generate reckless movements toward things. This preserves the **essence of life** and fortifies the person.

The text states:
*"Heaven’s lack of favor is its greatest favor."*

Cluan Shuzhen comments:
*"Heaven and Earth give birth but do not possess;
*They act but do not rely on their deeds.*
*They nurture all things without seeking repayment,
*Yet all things, moved by their sheltering care,
*Naturally generate favor in return.*
*Heaven and Earth, along with all things, exist by nature—
*This is all contained within the **ultimate spirit** of the Dao.*
*They do not demand repayment from all things,
*Yet all things, receiving Heaven’s sheltering care,
*Naturally hold favor toward Heaven and Earth.*

Thus, the *Laozi* says:
*"Give birth but do not possess;
*Act but do not rely on your deeds;
*Nurture but do not dominate."*

The text states:
*"Swift thunder and fierce winds—none fail to tremble."*

Cluan Shuzhen comments:
*"Swift thunder and fierce winds are the movements of **yin** and **yang**;
*People naturally fear them, and tremble in response.*
*Swift thunder is the striking sound of **yin** and **yang**;
*Fierce winds, as Zhuangzi says: The great breath exhales—this is what we call wind.*
*In all such winds and thunders,
*They arise from **yin** and **yang** by nature,
*And do not inherently threaten people—
*Yet people fear them,
*And tremble in response.*

*The sage who follows the Dao*, nurturing all beings, mirrors Heaven and Earth’s lack of **virtue/power (ren)**, yet the people, beasts, grasses, and trees all naturally return their favor to the ruler, as they do to Heaven. Each abides in its proper place, each finds ease in its work, and none fail to dwell in **effortless harmony (xiaoxiao)**."*

「The enlightened ruler merely issues his just decrees to display the standards of the state;
*When the common folk see his stern commands,*
*They respond like swift thunder and fierce winds—*
*All tremble and are moved,*
*Each bearing a heart of fear,*
*All self-alerted,*
*Refining their conduct and proceeding with caution.*

*Applying this principle to military affairs,*
*The generals grow bold and the soldiers strong,*
*The superiors command fear in their inferiors,*
*And such an army will assuredly*
*Slay the violent and pacify rebellion.*

*Thus it is said: Below lies the art of strong armies and victory in war.*

*The Classics state: Supreme joy leaves vitality intact; supreme stillness brings purity.*
*Adhering to this principle,*
*One’s aspirations remain modest and tranquil,*
*The heart knows no anxiety or dread,*
*And contentment and ease abound,*
*With effortless harmony overflowing.*

*Supreme joy is not the frivolous mirth of strings and pipes,*
*For such pleasures would exhaust one’s vitality.*
*Hence, the *Family Discourses* say:*
*"Supreme joy is soundless,*
*Yet it brings peace to all under Heaven."*

*The *Three Strategies* declare:*
*"The ruler who follows the Dao delights his people with joy."*

*This refers to the virtuous sage and noble ruler,*
*Who, unattached to worldly things,*
*Uninfluenced by wealth or gain,*
*Govern the state and secure the home,*
*Without licentious punishments,*
*Without transgressing the state’s precepts,*
*Without personal fault,*
*And thus free from all concern,*
*Naturally harboring delight and ease,*
*With joy and nature harmonizing,*
*And effortless harmony overflowing.*
*Would they seek such frivolous pleasures as feasts and revelry,*
*And yet call it supreme joy?*

*As for the ancients,*
*They plucked strings to attune the heart,*
*Gathered fallen grains to express humility,*
*And sang as they awaited their end,*
*Hence the saying:*
*"Supreme joy leaves vitality intact."*

*The Classics state: Supreme stillness brings purity.*
*This means that, having avoided*
*The vulgar pleasures of strings and pipes,*
*One preserves the joy of*
*Worry-free and carefree contentment,*
*Thus remaining unperturbed by sounds and colors,*
*With nature tranquil and spirit steadfast,*
*And purity unassailable.*
*Hence, the *Kang Cangzi* says:*
*"The noble grow fluent in speech,*
*The wealthy grow fluent in movement,*
*The poor grow fluent in thought,*
*The still grow fluent in spirit."*

*These four harmonies*
*Reside in supreme stillness.*
*When one attains supreme stillness,*
*One achieves spiritual fluency—*
*This is called*
*"Supreme stillness brings purity."*

*The nature of generals and strategists*
*Demands purity and stillness,*
*Suppressing all clamor and disturbance,*
*With rewards and punishments*
*Not favoring kin over children,*
*And thus the military heart*
*Harbors delight and joy,*
*With vitality and courage abundant,*
*Yet they can crush the wicked and conquer foes,*
*And their achievements will surely flourish.*

*Thus it is said: Below lies the art of strong armies and victory in war.*

*The Classics state: The mechanism of birds lies in their **qi (qi)**.**
*Adhering to this principle,*
*The pterodactyl flaps its wings nine thousand miles,*
*Accumulating **qi** to ascend,*
*While the cicada and sparrow*
*Strike their wings against the mulberry,*
*And descend with sudden resolve—*
*All move freely by mastering their **qi**.*

*Birds are the feathered kind of all winged creatures.*
***Qi** is the primordial harmony of Heaven and Earth.*
*Human movement relies on hands and feet,*
*Advancing or retreating for advantage;*
*But birds move by beating their wings,*
*And with their hearts they advance or retreat,*
*Soaring through the clouds,*
*Beyond human reach.*

*This says that even birds,*
*Though lesser in speech,*
*Can harness the primordial harmony of **qi**,*
*And with their hearts directing,*
*Their wings flapping,*
*Go wherever they will,*
*Ascending or descending at their own command.*
*How much more so should humans,*
*The most refined of creatures,*
*Be unable to master*
*The Dao/Way’s and Heaven’s Earth’s **qi**,*
*And thus cultivate their bodies and prolong their lives,*
*To attain eternal youth and longevity?*

*If humans could master the **qi** of the Dao/Way,*
*They might roam the boundless expanse,*
*Through the celestial realms,*
*And surpass even the birds.*
*For the strategist,*
*Skilled in harnessing the **qi** of the Five Phases,*
*Knowing the sources of yin and yang’s dominance,*
*Crushing the wicked and conquering foes*
*Would pose no challenge—*
*Thus it is said:*
*"Below lies the art of strong armies and victory in war."*

*The Classics state:*
*"Life is the root of death,*
*Death is the root of life."*

「The *Shúzhēn* says: Foolish men follow things and crave life,
But those who understand life’s true nature—
They hasten their own demise.
The virtuous, however, diminish themselves to seek life,
And those who grasp the Dao/Way’s profound virtue/power—
Nurture their bodies yet remain unharmed,
This is the way of mortals in the world:
To covet life and abhor death,
All indulge their own bodies,
Fearful of destruction’s approach.

To rear and sustain one’s life,
One must drink and eat, wear clothes and garments—
This too is the natural harmony of Heaven and Earth.
Thus *Zhuāng Zhou* spoke:
*"Plow to eat, weave to clothe oneself,*
*And virtue/power never departs.*
*Weave to clothe oneself, plow to eat,*
*This is called ‘same virtue/power,’*
*Thus knowing that human life relies on food and clothing for sustenance.*

Yet when moderation and frugality prevail—
Fortune follows.
If one indulges in excess, luxury, and waste—
Misfortune comes,
And life itself is harmed.

As for the ancient sages,
Who dwelled in nests and caves,
With simple natures and unrefined minds,
They knew not of longevity or short lives,
Following the Dao/Way’s natural course
And thus lived long and eternally.

But in later ages,
As the true Dao/Way faded,
And superficiality arose,
Palaces grew grand, garments splendid,
Delicacies abounded, pleasures multiplied—
Beyond measure, they pampered their bodies,
Fearful their health might fail,
Yet unaware that overindulgence
Wearies the mind and strains the thoughts,
Accelerating the very demise they dread.
Thus it is said:
*"Life is the root of death;*
*Death is the root of life."*

To the Dao/Way’s virtuous ones,
Who sacrifice themselves for truth,
Who do not covet wealth nor follow things,
Seeking the art of eternal life—
Some feast on mist and breathe in vital qi,
Abandon grains and cease from food,
Their hearts like cold ashes,
Their forms as withered wood—
To the world, death’s likeness,
Yet truly, this is life’s root.
Thus it is said:
*"Death is the root of life."*

The strategist’s virtue/power,
Who knows that life must end,
Yet death can return to life,
Preserves their armies and protects their people—
Such is the mark of a true general.

Thus the military arts declare:
*"Drive troops to death’s ground*
*And life shall return—*
This is the art of strong armies and victory in war."*

The Classics say:
*"Favor arises from harm,*
*Harm arises from favor."*

The *Shúzhēn* says:
*"The noble avoid harm and feel gratitude,*
*Thus favor arises from harm.*
*The petty betray favor and invite harm,*
*Thus harm arises from favor.*
This speaks to human hearts’ shifting tides,
Where favor and harm intertwine.

Originally, there is no harm,
Nor is there any favor—
Yet when harm is averted,
Favor springs forth—
This is favor arising from harm.

As for the virtuous noble,
When the petty face peril,
And others rescue and uplift them,
They cherish gratitude and virtue/power,
Never forgetting—
This is favor arising from harm.

Yet the petty, who receive
Their lord’s grace and bounty,
Residing in honor and wealth,
Cannot guard or repay favor,
Nor maintain caution from start to finish—
When arrogance replaces restraint,
They fall into legal snares,
Blind to their own faults,
And harbor resentment, birthing harm—
Thus they betray favor and invite harm,
And it is said:
*"Harm arises from favor."*

The Dao/Way’s virtuous ones,
Who feel Heaven and Earth’s nurturing grace,
Do not betray the Way’s virtue/power,
Nor abandon its creation—
They refine governance, return to simplicity,
And thus no harm can spring from favor,
Nor favor give rise to harm.
They do not let favor and harm distort their nature,
Guarding stillness and silence to birth true benefit.

Yet those who see
Favor and harm as intertwined,
Where honor and disgrace alternate—
These are the petty’s views.

The strategist’s virtue/power,
Who does not betray the Emperor’s grace,
Nor boast in honor’s embrace,
Who remains steadfast from start to finish,
Preserving favor’s light,
Who exhausts their strength in loyalty,
Achieves success and establishes deeds—
Thus no harm can spring from favor,
Nor favor give rise to harm.
With the Dao/Way’s virtue/power leading armies,
They conquer without battle.

Thus it is said:
*"Below lies the art of strong armies and victory in war’s unfolding."*

The Classics say:
*"Foolish men take Heaven and Earth’s patterns as sacred,*
*I see time and things’ patterns as wise."*

The *Shúzhēn* says:
*"Foolish men see stars flowing, solar halos,*
*Winds and lightning, thunder and tempests,*
*Or seasons unbalanced, floods and droughts,*
*And disasters of locusts—*
They fear and recoil within themselves,
Unknowing that the Dao/Way’s virtue/power
And harmonious governance
Can soothe the people,
Turning calamity to blessing.
Thus I alone perceive the patterns of time and things.*

Heaven and Earth’s patterns—
The sun and moon suspended to illuminate good and evil,
The constellations arrayed to show fortune and misfortune—
All are the Dao/Way’s natural virtue/power.
To say that foolish men gaze upward at the three luminaries,
Observe celestial changes,
Witness thunder’s wrath,
Or seasons out of order,
Floods and droughts,
Disasters of locusts—
They fear and recoil within themselves,
All harboring dread.

Thus foolish men take these patterns of time and things as sacred.

The patterns of time and things—
If the lord harbors modesty and stillness,
And ministers display loyalty and integrity,
If crows and magpies do not cry out,
And border beacons remain unlit,
If all the people live in ease,
And the world is tranquil—
Even should Heaven and Earth send omens of calamity,
They cannot take effect.

The sage alone perceives these patterns of time and things,
Thus the *Jiāyǔ* says:
*"In the time of Yīn Tàiwù,*
*The Dao/Way was absent, laws corrupt—*
*Thus his demise was brought about,*
*And mulberry trees grew in the palace courtyard,*
*In seven days, they arched high.*
*Diviners said:*
*'Mulberry trees normally grow in the suburbs,*
*Now they appear in the palace courtyard—*
*Fear the court will perish!'*
*Tàiwù, in terror,*
*Turned to virtue/power, reflecting on ancient governance,*
*Spreading the Dao/Way’s nurturing path.*
*After three years,*
*Sixteen distant states, drawn by his virtue/power,*
*Came bearing tribute,*
*And the mulberry trees could no longer be calamitous.*
*The Master said:*
*'Life and death, blessings and misfortunes,*
*All arise from human action—*
*Heaven’s disasters and Earth’s portents*
*Cannot add to them.'*
*Thus calamities and portents*
*Cannot overcome virtuous governance,*
*Nor evil dreams*
*Overcome virtuous deeds.*

Again, *Yáo* faced the great flood,
And *Tāng* the severe drought—
Both endured for years,
Yet the people lived in peace,
None starved—
Why so?
For lord and ministers followed the Dao/Way,
Governance was balanced and harmonious,
The ruler trusted, ministers were loyal,
The people revered their lord—
Even floods and droughts could not bring disaster.

Floods and droughts are the patterns of time and things,
Yet if one understands their true nature,
All can turn calamity to blessing,
And death to life.»

「Thus it is said:
*"The sage governs through the Dao/Way of time, things, and their natural patterns and principles.*
*For military affairs,*
When the sun’s halo displays five colors,
Stars drift across the four cardinal directions,
Ominous beasts charge into the encampment,
Wild birds enter the dwelling—
At such times, Heaven and Earth reveal their portents of calamity and omens.
Yet if one can refine governance and laws,
Devise strategies with careful thought,
Show kindness and soothe the soldiers,
And transform misfortune into blessing,
Then how could the enemy dare to resist?
This is the Dao/Way of time, things, and their natural patterns and principles.
Thus it is said:
*'The lower realm possesses the art of strong armies and victory in battle.'*
*The lower realm’s hundred and thirteen words*
All make one deeply cultivate kindness and still reflection,
So that harm and injury do not arise,
And one understands the principles of life and death,
Both public and private, hidden and revealed,
Opening the mysteries of things and accomplishing deeds,
Observing Heaven’s signs and aligning with the seasons—
Hence it is said:
*'The lower realm possesses the art of strong armies and victory in battle.'*

*The Classic says:*
*"The Dao/Way of nature is tranquil,*
So Heaven and Earth give birth to all things.
*The Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth is moist and penetrating,*
So yin and yang prevail.
*Yin and yang interact, pushing one another,*
And their transformations proceed in harmony.
*The Dao/Way of perfect stillness*
Cannot be fully measured by calendars and computations.
*Yet there exist wondrous instruments,*
Which give rise to all phenomena.
*The Eight Trigrams and the Heavenly Stems/Earthly Branches*
Contain divine mechanisms and arcane concealments.
*The art of yin and yang overcoming one another*
Is clearly manifested beyond the realm of symbols.
*The Yellow Emperor’s *Yīn Fú Jīng* (Secret Signs of Yin) [with] annotations concludes here.*»
