**Preface to the Commentary on the Supreme Red Writ of the Ancient Cavern Scripture**

The supreme Dao is wordless; true emptiness is formless. Those who contemplate it cannot know it; those who gaze upon it cannot see it. It cannot be fathomed, nor can it be attained through practice. It shapes heaven and earth, follows the transformations of creation, abides in stillness yet unmovable, and pervades the six directions of emptiness, bestowing blessings upon the myriad things and restoring the lives of all beings.

How lofty and perfect it is! Who but a sage could comprehend it?

Moreover, the Primordial Beginning Great Sage, with boundless compassion and wisdom illuminating the ten directions, beheld sentient beings lost and forgetful of their origin, drifting through the world in endless cycles of rebirth, suffering across kalpas without self-awareness. Moved by this, he caused the Dharma-rain to descend, proclaiming the wondrous Dao, guiding and delivering all beings from the sea of birth and death. They wander the realm of purity and emptiness, the land of tranquility and ease, transcending the dust and filth, treading the vast expanse, roaming freely in solitary transformation, subtly mysterious and profoundly penetrating, effortless and spontaneous, returning to the state of pure simplicity and primordial chaos.

**Chapter on Holding Fast to the True (Part One)**

The movement that moves arises from non-movement. That which moves responds to the moment; that which does not move embraces the Origin and guards the One, returning to the root and restoring the mandate. Thus the Scripture says: "The clear is the source of the turbid; the still is the foundation of the moving." Only be refined, only be one—truly hold fast to the center. All things flourish and flourish, each returning to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; ultimate stillness is non-movement.

Action that acts arises from non-action. In non-action, spirit returns. Spirit’s essence is profound tranquility; moved, it then responds, arising only when unavoidable, engaging things as they come, its wondrous function boundless. Abandoning wisdom and benevolence, one follows Heaven’s principle. Serene and without limit, all marvels return to it. When spirit returns, the ten thousand things become as clouds, silent and still. Concentrate qi to attain softness, able to be like an infant. Embrace and guard the harmonious void; true qi billows and swirls, and all things attain long life.

To know harmony is called constancy; to make the mind command qi is called force. The forceful grow rigid, strong, and aged—followers of death. Without movement, qi dissolves; when qi dissolves, the ten thousand things do not arise. When qi is cut off and spirit departs, the nine orifices and hundred bones transform and vanish into dust—what doubt can there be?

Spirit guards spirit, things support one another, each returning to its root. With emptiness nourish emptiness; with fullness nourish fullness. Why? Forget the form to nourish qi; forget qi to nourish spirit; forget spirit to nourish emptiness. When the empty chamber gives birth to light, auspiciousness abides and abides. Spirit and qi surge in tranquility; the numinous root is deeply firm—thus is the Dao of long life and enduring vision achieved.

Silently comprehend it; I know it myself. The mystery of the supreme Dao is not obtained through external things. Silent and dim, without response or inquiry, the solitary radiance of numinous light shines, utterly transcending root and dust. The body reveals true constancy, not following the ten thousand dharmas—thus can one preserve life and return to the origin.

Entering the realm of no-gap: "no-gap" means "nothing exists." This is the teaching without words, the benefit of non-action. Perfectly unobstructed, responding and transforming endlessly, pervading the ten directions, moving ceaselessly without interruption.

Neither dying nor living—the luminous Mystery Pearl shines brightly, ever radiant across past and present. The ten thousand things are blended into one; all dharmas are equal. Centered and still, unstained, without beginning or end—thus is it called "neither dying nor living." Becoming one with Heaven and Earth.

Heaven’s Dao is clear and empty—thus it endures long. Earth’s Dao is tranquil and still—thus it lasts. If one can awaken to principle and grasp the wondrous Dao, attain utmost emptiness and guard stillness firmly, serene and undisturbed, unburdened by the ten thousand things, pure and non-active—can one not become one with Heaven and Earth?

**Entering the Sage Chapter**

Forget the eyes, and light overflows without limit. The five colors confuse brightness, causing the eyes to go blind. "Color" is manifestation; "all colors" have never truly appeared. What does this mean? The Dharma-eye is perfectly unobstructed, illuminating the ten directions and three realms. Seeing things as no-things, seeing emptiness as not-empty, one gazes into darkness. Within the profound darkness, alone one sees the dawn. Numinous light fills and pervades, boundless and infinite.

Forget the ears, and the mind’s awareness remains a deep abyss. The five sounds confuse hearing, causing the ears to go deaf. The mind is a clear abyss, originally pure and limpid. Right and wrong in speech, beautiful and ugly sounds—all are false emotions and artificial things. Whirling winds and sudden rains disturb the heart’s source; the spirit’s chamber loses its numinosity. If one can extinguish right and wrong, not receiving them within, then within the soundless, alone one hears harmony. Only then can one hear the immortal’s songs—*White Snow* without the strumming of *Yangchun*, the melodies of celestial music.

Forgetting both senses, one closes the gate of all marvels. Sound and color both extinguished, movement and stillness both forgotten. Hearing not through qi, seeing not through spirit—this is called the wonder of the Great Mystery, the numinousness of vast emptiness. Deep and ever deeper, yet able to embrace things. Spirit and ever more spirit, yet able to refine essence.

Non-action that acts—knowing without knowing. Numinous clarity is vast and penetrating, boundless and empty, wondrous beyond all limits. Pure and complete, it accords with the great square. Self and other both forgotten, existence and non-existence not established. Dim and silent, profound and obscure, boundless and without limit, neither external nor internal. Its roaming has no beginning; its emergence has no direction. Nurturing and transforming the ten thousand things, it cannot be represented—blended and formless, without boundaries.

Vast and boundless, it accords with the measureless. The supreme Dao is doubly mysterious, vast and unconfined. Its principle has no equal. Concealed, it is primordial essence; employed, it is the ten thousand spirits. Contained, it is the Great One; released, it is the Great Clarity. Without form or name, most honored and noble—deluded, one is a common person; awakened, one is a sage.

The vastness of Heaven and Earth is what I sustain. Ancient sages and perfected ones who attained the Dao—lifting Heaven and Earth, grasping yin and yang, carving and shaping the ten thousand things, bestowing blessings upon all beings—was this difficult? The multitude of the ten thousand things is what I uphold. The cosmos is in my hands; the ten thousand transformations arise from my body. How can there be an end? To speak of its limitations is to exhaust it.

The sage speaks directly of the wondrous Dao, universally manifesting universal light, only fearing that later generations of common people will not believe and will doubt. Thus he humbly declares, as if words cannot fully express the principle, speaking of its limitations to avoid erroneous and contradictory teachings.

**Abiding in the World Chapter (Part Two)**

Nurture that which has no form, and form thus endures eternally. True qi steams and rises, and time knows neither cold nor heat. Pure yang flows unceasingly, and the people transcend death and life. Thus it is said: when the lamp of the heart shines brightly, the Dharma-body abides forever. If the candle of wisdom does not illuminate, how can the Dao’s countenance be borne? Preserve that which has no substance, and substance thus remains wholly true.

Heaven and Earth unite to descend sweet dew, nourishing and flourishing all beings. If one can dwell in tranquility and harmony, the precious vessel stands firm, the jade nectar fragrant and sweet. True water descends, nourishing the wondrous body, returning the aged to the state of a child—is this not excellence? When the true and the real aid one another, one may endure long. When water and fire are in harmony, hun and po guard each other, lead and mercury congeal, the great elixir is refined, and the golden pill is formed. Resplendent with radiance, it illumines even the darkest depths. Pure and white, it returns to simplicity, embracing non-action and restoring primordial integrity. Abiding in eternal life, the body never perishes—this is called a true person.

Heaven attains its truth and thus endures. Having obtained the pure and unadulterated Dao, it can cover all existence, embrace the ten thousand forms, remain clear and congealed through kalpas, reflect things without partiality, respond without speech, and manifest boundless wondrous function. Lofty, empty, vast, and far-reaching, it encompasses all without limit, enduring unchanged through time.

Earth attains its truth and thus abides long. Having attained its truth, it nurtures the ten thousand things, deepening roots and securing stems, resting in stillness and non-action—thus it endures.

Humans attain their truth and thus live long. Those who die yet do not perish are long-lived. Yet if worldly people awaken to the true essence, grasp the wondrous origin, and merge with the Dao in truth, their bodies will not perish, and they will join the ranks of the sages. Their descendants will offer sacrifices without cease—what could surpass this?

The reason worldly people cannot endure is that they lose that which has no form and scatter that which has no substance. The five flavors foul the mouth; the five odors assail the nose; sounds and sights block the ears and eyes. Taking and rejecting disturb the heart, causing the nature to soar wildly. Deluded emotions pursue external things, thoughts entangle one another, and the heart’s wisdom wanders outward while ghosts and spirits enter within. Right and wrong, favor and disgrace disrupt the spirit’s source, and one clashes and grinds against things, exhausting oneself all one’s life. Entangled in the web of karma, one knows not where to return—how lamentable!

The body may dwell in luxury and richness, adorned in brocade and silk, yet the mind is deluded by perverse views, lost in inverted and false thoughts. Even unto old age, one does not know Heaven’s mandate. Those who lose themselves in things and forfeit their nature to worldly customs are called the "inverted people"—how pitiful! Unable to make the hundred bones and nine orifices coexist with the true body, they die.

Within, the original nature is fundamentally pure, luminous, empty, and radiant. Yet why cling to the ten thousand conditions, failing to turn inward in reflection? The solitary spirit drifts away, and one sinks into the delusion of ten thousand kalpas, unable to awaken to the true body. Transmigrating into another shell, one loses the true source and corrupts the inner self. Trapped in the cycle of rebirth through ten thousand kalpas, drifting in the sea of birth and death, unable to transcend—how deeply pitiable!
