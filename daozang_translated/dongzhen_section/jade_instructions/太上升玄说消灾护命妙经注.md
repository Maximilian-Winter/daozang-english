The Heavenly Worthy declares: The Limitless Dao gives birth to Heaven and Earth. Among the myriad things, none lacks its mystery, yet only humans possess the finest essence and the most refined spirit. Though refined, people are born in different lands and receive varying endowments, resulting in disparities of wisdom and folly. Thus, the Heavenly Worthy, moved by boundless compassion, opens the gate of expedient means to universally transform the world, illuminating the original true nature and preserving the life of the embodied self.

Refine thoughts with the heart, return emotions to nature, silently activate the celestial mechanism, transform essence into *qi*, and gather it in the Palace of *Qian*, suffusing the four limbs—this is called *Ascending Mystery*. Circulate the talismanic fire to refine the spirit, swallow the golden elixir to refine the body. When the body is strong and the spirit clear, no evil can enter, no illness can arise. One attains longevity, transcends the dust, and escapes the kalpas—this is called *Dispelling Calamities and Protecting Life*.

Those who can receive and uphold this Dao, circulating it throughout the body, will ride alongside the sages and immortals, sharing the same form as Heaven and Earth—this is the *Wondrous Scripture*.

The *Daode Jing* states: "The good person is the teacher of the ungood; the ungood person is the resource of the good." Thus, none are to be discarded. Though sentient beings are bound by desires and attachments, within them all lies the nature of wisdom and goodness. The Heavenly Worthy expounds this scripture, revealing its profound principles to enlighten those who come after. By circulating, reciting, and delving into its teachings, one may grasp the origin of the Great Dao. Those who awaken may transform folly into wisdom, turbidity into clarity, transcend the mundane, and enter sagehood. Naturally, calamities are dispelled, sins are eradicated, life is preserved, and years are prolonged—is this not the *Wondrous Scripture*?

**Eulogy:**
The Limitless, the Mysterious Origin,
Majestic and sacred, the Treasure of the Numinous.
Ascending Mystery spreads the teachings,
Revealing the Dao through scriptural discourse.

**At that time**, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy was in the Fivefold Luminous Palace within the Seven Jeweled Grove.

*At that time* refers to the era of primordial chaos.
*Primordial* (元始) signifies the ancestral *qi*.
*The Heavenly Worthy* is the singular, most revered spirit, unmatched above Heaven or below Earth.
*The Seven Jeweled Grove* represents the heart and the spirit.
*The Fivefold Luminous Palace* is the Yellow Court.

In worldly terms, this corresponds to the beginning of the Dragon Han kalpa, when eight rays descended, and a single point of ancestral *qi* from the primordial kalpa transformed into ten thousand paths of upright *qi*, filling the void and coalescing into a sacred body. A singular spirit embraced the mystery of the myriad existences—hence the provisional name *Primordial Heavenly Worthy*. At the time of this discourse, he resided in the Fivefold Luminous Palace within the Seven Jeweled Grove of the Azure Heaven.

In Daoist practice, every person possesses the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. This refers to a single point of true yang *qi*, dwelling in the secret chamber of the Gate of Life. Within it hangs an empty aperture, called the Heavenly Heart, where nature also resides. It is the ancestral gathering place of the ten thousand spirits—this is the Primordial Heavenly Worthy.

Whenever the first yang stirs, at the time of scripture recitation, the spirit descends to the Mysterious Pass. The *Xun* wind stirs the fire of the *Li* Palace’s samadhi, chasing the two *qi* along the Yellow Path, uniting the three natures in the Primordial Palace, and blending them into the elixir. Thus, nature is refined, as firm as metal, wholly dependent on the power of fire. Fire is governed by seven, earth by five—hence the reference to the Seven Jeweled Grove and the Fivefold Luminous Palace.

This aligns with the *Scripture of Salvation*, which states: "The Primordial One suspends a single pearl, as large as a millet grain, in the void of the Mysterious. Five feet above the earth, it guides the way of the Heavenly Perfected."

**Eulogy:**
The Primordial precedes Heaven and Earth,
The Effortless, the Ancestor of Kalpas.
One heart embraces all bodies,
The true descends to contemplate true emptiness.

Together with the Limitless Assembly of Sages, he radiated boundless light, illuminating the limitless worlds.

This continues the above: when the singular spirit is rightly established, the ten thousand spirits pay homage. In worldly terms, when the Heavenly Worthy expounded the scripture, all the heavens, all the earths, the three realms, the ten directions, and the limitless assembly of sages gathered in the Seven Jeweled Grove and the Fivefold Luminous Palace, listening to the wondrous discourse. At that moment, boundless light radiated, illuminating the limitless worlds.

In Daoist practice, when refining the elixir, the turning of the Celestial Pivot reverses the mechanism of the Dipper’s handle. Then, the ten thousand spirits and ten thousand *qi* of the entire body gather in the heart. After a brief moment of refinement, the spirit becomes clear, the *qi* becomes harmonious, the heart expands, the body flourishes, the numinous embraces emptiness, and the ten thousand apertures radiate light—this is the illumination of the limitless worlds.

This corresponds to the *Scripture of Salvation*, which states: "The lofty sages, the perfected of wondrous conduct, and innumerable multitudes floated through the void, entering the pearl together. Once within its mouth, their whereabouts were unknown. The ritual complete, the heavens resumed their positions. In an instant, all was silent, without a trace."

**Eulogy:**
A single millet grain contains Heaven and Earth,
All the perfected gather in the sacred body.
Wisdom’s light arises in the indistinct,
Illuminating the void across all realms.

He beheld the limitless sentient beings, suffering limitless afflictions, tossed and turned in the world, revolving through birth and death, adrift in the River of Love, swept by the Sea of Desire, sunk in the mire of sound and form, deluded by existence and non-existence.

The term "observation" here signifies profound insight. "Limitless" expresses the boundless multitude of beings in Heaven and Earth, their lives endless in succession. "Sentient beings" refers to the foolish and greedy among humankind, as well as all creatures possessing spirit and consciousness. In the passage that follows, the Heavenly Worthy, abiding in the stillness of the ultimate, gazes with the eye of wisdom into the great expanse, beholding within the kalpa’s defilement a class of greedy, vulgar, and benighted souls who fear neither Heaven’s decree nor the value of their own lives. Though they wear the form of humans, their hearts are like those of beasts. Alas, such beings know not human ethics, nor do they respect the laws of the land. Their minds are enslaved by their forms, chasing profit and delusion, forsaking life in ceaseless greed, never satisfied. They commit manifold transgressions, accumulating boundless karmic offenses. Once they bring calamity upon themselves, Heaven’s retribution falls upon them: in minor cases, they harm only themselves; in grave ones, their kin suffer as well. Thus they endure limitless afflictions, revolving through the world, trapped in the cycle of birth and death within the Six Paths, with no hope of escape. Adrift in the River of Love, tossed in the Sea of Desire, they sink and drown without respite.

The Heavenly Worthy, moved by the suffering of sentient beings, finds it deeply lamentable. For this reason, He reveals these truths to awaken the world, urging them to turn back early. Yet they fail to understand that those who commit evil will inevitably face retribution, like a shadow following form. Without reflection, they persist in indulging their desires, ensnared by sound and form—what their ears hear, what their eyes see—endlessly chasing externals. Their vital essence dissipates, transforming into other species without recovery, yet they remain unaware, deluded by existence and non-existence, never changing.

**Eulogy:**
The hearts of sentient beings are self-deluded,
Creating karma, they sink in the wheel’s depths.
Ensnared by sound and form, love’s attachments,
How are they different from beasts and birds?

Neither void nor non-void, neither form nor formless,
Neither nothingness nor non-nothingness—
From beginning to end, they remain in darkness,
Unable to awaken, forever lost in confusion.

This passage continues the above, explaining that sentient beings, deluded by existence and non-existence, fail to awaken. Thus, it speaks of the origin of the great Dao: fundamentally formless, without emotion, without name. Through the transformation of qi, the One divides into Two, giving rise to form, emotion, and name. The reason sentient beings cannot attain the true Dao is that they cling to illusory forms as real, obscuring their original nature. The Dao is not inherently void, yet they grasp it as void. The Dao is not inherently form, yet they grasp it as form. The Dao is not inherently shape, yet they grasp it as shape. The Dao’s emptiness is truly real, yet they grasp it as nothingness, taking this as existence. Their deluded minds do not trust the true Dao, unaware of its coming or going. Thus, from beginning to end, they remain in darkness, unable to awaken, forever lost in confusion. For this, they commit evil and transgress, suffering defilement and disgrace, enduring endless retribution, forever losing the true Dao.

**Eulogy:**
The great Dao is originally without form,
True emptiness is not mere nothingness.
If one penetrates this truth,
The ancient family’s wind is revealed.

The Heavenly Worthy declares: You sentient beings exist within non-existence, and are non-existent within existence; you possess form within formlessness, and are formless within form. You take non-existence as existence, non-nothingness as nothingness, non-form as form, and non-emptiness as emptiness. Emptiness is emptiness, yet emptiness has no fixed emptiness; form is form, yet form has no fixed form. Form is emptiness, emptiness is form. Emptiness is the Dao’s formless body; form is all things possessing shape.

In the passage that follows, the Heavenly Worthy, moved by the world’s failure to awaken to the true Dao, repeatedly admonishes and instructs, describing the Dao’s essence and function, teaching people to perceive the Dao’s ultimate formless body. Because the non-void gives rise to form, form establishes the Dao. Form is the dwelling of the Dao, and the Dao is the function of form. Thus, where there is form, there must be spirit, and there must be the Dao. The human primordial spirit is inherently numinous and empty, yet constrained by form, it becomes obstructed and loses its clarity. It is like the sun in the sky: a thousand rivers share its reflection. When the water is clear, the moon is bright; when the water is turbid, the moon is dim. The moon does not leave the water, nor the water the moon; form does not leave spirit, nor spirit form. Form may decay, but spirit is neither born nor destroyed. Human life is but a temporary borrowing of this illusory form to accomplish the Dao. Why, then, are sentient beings so foolish? They cling to this illusory form, allowing it to control them, abandoning their root to chase the branches, never awakening to the principles of nature and destiny.

The Heavenly Worthy therefore says: You sentient beings, listen carefully to My words. "Existing within non-existence" means that form is not eternally real—do not mistake form for true existence. "Non-existent within non-nothingness" means that the human spirit is empty and numinous, enduring through past and present, neither born nor destroyed—do not mistake spirit for nothingness. "Possessing form within formlessness" means that the great Dao is pure and empty, originally without form—do not become infatuated with form. "Formless within form" means that the human spirit contains wondrousness, governing all affairs, originally without emptiness—do not stubbornly cling to emptiness. "Taking non-existence as existence" means that when a person is first born as an infant, they are originally simple and unadorned, not truly possessing anything—today, do not greedily pursue wealth and profit as your own. "Taking non-nothingness as nothingness" means that in the birth of all beings, each body and aperture, each thing and every Taiji, the wondrous principles of creation are all present within the human body—do not abandon your own existence to become nothing. "Taking non-form as form" means that the great Dao is empty and tranquil, pervading all things. Heaven, Earth, and the gods and spirits exist everywhere, yet originally there is no visible form—do not stubbornly take non-form as form.

"Taking non-emptiness as emptiness" means that one who has attained the Dao transforms freely and exists eternally across kalpas, originally not empty but truly existent—do not stubbornly cling to it as nothingness and mock it as emptiness.

"Emptiness is emptiness, yet emptiness has no fixed emptiness" means that the great Dao is formless and its transformations unfathomable, giving birth to heaven, earth, and all beings—how could there be a fixed principle of emptiness? Just as the blue sky and bright sun may suddenly transform into wind, clouds, thunder, and rain, instantly pervading the great thousandfold world, so too when a person’s nature is tranquil, it is like the vast emptiness; yet when joy or anger arises, the divine mechanism is unpredictable—is this not emptiness without fixed emptiness?

"Form is form, yet form has no fixed form" means that when people see form with their eyes, the eyes themselves are form; if one can awaken to this, perceiving form through form, turning the light inward to reflect, and thoroughly illuminating the emptiness of the heart, then all form vanishes. Moreover, between heaven and earth, yin and yang transform and give birth to the myriad things, taking shape according to qi and changing color according to form. The sentient may become insentient—chaste women turning into stone mountains, earthworms into lilies; the insentient may become sentient—cinnabar maples into feathered beings, rotting grass into fireflies. All things transform in endless cycles of rebirth—is this not form without fixed form?

Thus, form is emptiness, and emptiness is form. Have you not heard the *Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra* say: "There is no self, no person, no sentient being, no lifespan. All appearances are illusory. If all appearances are not appearances, then one sees the Tathāgata." These words are perfect.

Let the learner savor this—perhaps they may approach understanding!

A verse says:
The Dao’s wonder is not empty dharma,
Yet people are deluded by illusory form and heart.
Let go of both existence and non-existence,
And the land will all become level and still.

Hark!
Do you comprehend?

Where the path ends at water’s end and mountain’s edge,
birds sing and flowers laugh—spring remains the same.
If one can know emptiness as not-empty,
know form as not-form,
this is called "illumination,"
and one first attains the wondrous sound.

Recognizing the non-empty Dharma of emptiness,
one gazes through without obstruction.
Entering the gate of all wonders,
one naturally awakens to understanding.
Free from the net of doubts,
one does not cling to the view of emptiness.

This passage continues the above,
transforming sentient beings.
Those who can awaken to this
do not fall into dull emptiness
nor cling to perverse views.
They abide in the single mind,
serene and ever still,
lucidly perceiving true emptiness—
nothing unknown,
nothing not penetrated.
The Dao is within me, not in another.

If one’s awakening reaches this stage,
one truly believes in knowing emptiness as not-empty,
knowing form as not-form.
Thus, it is called "illumination,"
and one first attains the wondrous sound.
Recognizing the non-empty Dharma of emptiness,
one gazes through with freedom.
This mind connects with all minds,
and nothing fails to fulfill its nature.
It pierces mountains and penetrates stone,
without hindrance.
Within, one’s wisdom-nature generates light,
illuminating boundlessly.

Thus, entering the gate of all wonders,
one naturally awakens to understanding.
Everywhere is the Dao,
and all things share the same truth.
All nets of doubt are overturned,
revealing one’s original nature,
without clinging to the view of emptiness.

A verse says:
Emptiness is not truly empty,
form is not truly form.
Directly awakening to the mystery,
one knows the white yet guards the black.

Purify the six senses,
cut off perverse obstructions.
"Purify" means emptying the heart and filling the belly.
The "six senses" are the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind.
"Cut off" means to sever;
"remove" means to eliminate.
"Perverse obstructions" are all worldly toils, sensory desires, and defilements.

This continues the meaning of not clinging to the view of emptiness,
teaching one to purify the six senses
and sever perverse obstructions.
Neither emitting within nor receiving without,
one naturally becomes spiritually clear and qi-serene,
the six senses at peace,
perverse obstructions severed.

A verse says:
Thoroughly penetrating the single mind,
one connects heaven and earth.
Yang flourishes while yin dissipates,
and demonic forces retreat.

Now I shall expound this wondrous scripture for you,
entitled *The Scripture of Life Protection*,
to deliver and ferry sentient beings,
to propagate and transmit its teachings in the world,
and to circulate its recitation.
"I" refers to the Heavenly Worthy’s self-designation.
"You" refers to those who awaken to the Dao.
"Expound" means to enlighten.
"Wondrous" means profound.
"Scripture" is the heart—like a path,
a road shared by all.
"Deliver" means to guide and lead;
"ferry" means to cross to the other shore.

In this passage, the Heavenly Worthy declares:
If one can awaken to the Dao with clarity,
unbound by form or fettered by perverse obstructions,
penetrating the mechanism of transcendence
and reaching this stage,
only then may I speak to you of the great Dao’s essence
and the wonders of scripture transmission.
Those who recite this scripture
may commune with spirits.
Those who awaken to it
may nurture life.
Those who attain it
may prolong their years.
Thus, it is called *The Scripture of Life Protection*.
To deliver and ferry sentient beings,
to propagate its teachings in the world,
and to have all circulate and recite it—
may each swiftly awaken to perfection,
fulfilling the Heavenly Worthy’s intent.

A verse says:
Each body shares the Dao,
every heart is the scripture.
Concentrating essence and consolidating spirit and qi,
one protects life and preserves longevity.

Then there are the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings,
the Demolishing-Delusion Vajras,
the Dharma-Protecting Spirit Youths,
the Salvation-from-Suffering Perfected Ones,
and the Golden Essence Fierce Beasts—
each accompanied by hundreds of millions of attendants,
all guarding this scripture.

In worldly terms,
those who cultivate the Dao and uphold this scripture
should, in accordance with its teachings,
have such spirit youths and fierce beasts
attend and protect their bodies.
In terms of Daoist practice,
the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings
represent the turning of the numinous treasure and the ascent of the mysterious.
The Demolishing-Delusion Vajras
represent martial refinement.
The Dharma-Protecting Spirit Youths
represent literary refinement.
The Salvation-from-Suffering Perfected Ones
represent demon-quelling
and the restoration of the celestial heart.
The Golden Essence Fierce Beasts
are the five-colored lions.

In summary,
when practicing the numinous treasure,
one should turn *The Scripture of Life Protection*.
When my yellow intent enters the Eastern Sea,
whipping the submerged dragon to drive the fire chariot,
ascending to the palace of the Mysterious Valley—
this is called the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings.
Reversing the flow of the Yellow River’s waters,
making them the cleansing rains of Kunlun to dispel miasmas—
this is called the Demolishing-Delusion Vajras.
Riding the White Tiger from the Western Mountains to return home—
this is called the Dharma-Protecting Spirit Youths.
Vanquishing powerful demons
and restoring the original spirit to its place—
this is called the Salvation-from-Suffering Perfected Ones.
Sitting upon the empty mystery of the five-colored lions,
solemn and majestic in demeanor—
this is called the Golden Essence Fierce Beasts.
With the myriad spirits and qi of the entire body
gathered into the single heart—
this is called the hundreds of millions of attendants
all guarding this scripture.

Those who awaken to this mystery
internally cultivate unceasing, subtle practice,
while externally, the ten heavenly good spirits
constantly protect them.
This scripture’s profundity
holds inconceivable merit and virtue.

A verse says:
A single point, no more,
is the foundation for transcending the ordinary and entering sagehood.
The Dao is high, and demons naturally submit;
the numinous and wondrous manifest majesty.

Wherever one makes offerings,
one wards off calamity and supports the frail,
ferrying all sentient beings
and freeing them from defilements.
This means that those who recite this scripture with the Dao
are accompanied by divine protection wherever they go.
Externally, they subdue hordes of demons;
internally, they connect with the true and manifest sagehood.
All sentient beings
receive the shade of the Dao.
The sentient and insentient alike
all cross to the other shore.
Thus, they ward off calamity and support the frail,
ferrying all sentient beings
and freeing them from defilements.

A verse says:
The Dao’s wonder is boundless,
its divine transformations unfathomable.
It delivers sentient beings,
warding off calamity and supporting the frail.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy spoke this verse:
"Seen yet not seen,
heard yet not heard,
free from all extremes—
this is called the wondrous Dao."

Now that the Heavenly Worthy has finished expounding the scripture,
not daring to praise himself,
he respectfully refers to "that time" and speaks this verse,
depicting the wonder of the great Dao
and summarizing the profundity of this scripture.

These four lines of verse are the crucial point for learners.
What Laozi called "seen yet not seen is called the Even, heard yet not heard is called the Rare, grasped yet not obtained is called the Subtle."
Thus, the Dao abides in Heaven and Earth, yet Heaven and Earth do not know it; the Dao abides in the myriad things, yet the myriad things do not know it.
It cannot be clarified by settling, nor muddied by stirring.
Within movement, it does not move; within stillness, it is not still.
Its wondrous essence is utterly empty, its numinous response pervades the ten thousand beings—it cannot be captured in form or description.
One may depart from form and abandon cleverness, applying it thus:
Within not-seeing, one intimately sees; within seeing, one does not see.
Within not-hearing, one intimately hears; within hearing, one does not hear.
Silently comprehending, the mind connects; spirit apprehends, meaning is grasped.
At this juncture, one naturally departs from all manifold appearances—only then is it called the wondrous Dao.
How could this not be the rarest attainment for learners?

A verse says:
The great image has no form,
the great sound is soundless.
The void shatters to dust,
the spirit ascends to the Great Clarity.
