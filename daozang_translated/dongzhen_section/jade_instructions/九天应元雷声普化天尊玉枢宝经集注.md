### *The Jade Pivot Precious Scripture of the Nine Heavens Responsive Primordial Thunder-Sound Universal Transformation Heavenly Worthy: Collected Commentaries, Fascicle One*

**Commentary states:**
Nine is the yang number, the Dao of Heaven. It governs the *Zhen* Palace, hence the saying of the "Nine Voids" in the southeast—this is the realm where the Thunder Master enters and departs. Heaven is the supreme, sagely, boundless, and non-acting *qi*. "Responsive" means all things receive Heaven’s mandate to be born. "Primordial" is the greatest, the chief of all virtues, the first of the four seasons, and the origin of the Five Agents. Thunder is Heaven’s decree, wielding the power of generation and destruction. Its movements are unfathomable, and the myriad spirits obey its commands. "Sound" is life—all things sprout upon hearing the thunder’s roar. It is also said that Heaven does not speak but uses thunder as its voice. "Universal" encompasses the four directions, the eight wilds, the formless and the formed. "Transformation" is the operation of Heaven’s Dao through yin and yang. It is the shift from non-being to being, from being to non-being, the birth and decay of the myriad things. Laozi said: "I practice non-action, and the people transform of themselves." He also said: "This is the transformation through virtue." "Heavenly Worthy" is the most exalted and noble title. "Scripture" is praise, the propagation of teachings, the elucidation of mysteries. "Jade" is the essence of Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, the congealed splendor of yin-yang and water-fire. It is moistening and warm, precious and noble, imperishable for ten thousand generations. "Pivot" is the mechanism, the axle—the origin of life and death. "Precious" means revered. "Scripture" is the path, the essential road to cultivating perfection and entering the Dao.

**Exegesis states:**
This scripture is named for the *Jade Pivot* because it embodies the ebb and flow of Heaven and Earth, the movement and stillness of yin and yang. The primordial number is the *Qian* trigram’s "use of nine," and the Universal Transformation Heavenly Worthy presides above, supreme among the Three Realms and luminous across the Ten Directions.

**Exposition states:**
The Heavenly Worthy’s vows are vast, transforming all living beings. His virtue is immeasurable, his mechanism unfathomable. Thus, he employs thunder’s sound for transformation and the jade pivot as the balance. Good and evil, killing and generation—all are governed by the True King of the Nine *Qi*. Therefore, the myriad spirits of the Three Realms and the deities of the Ten Directions all praise the Heavenly Worthy’s primordial transformation.

**Eulogy states:**
The primordial *qi* suffuses the Great Void,
The Nine Heavens are truly the Nine Heavens’ abode.
Commanding thunder and dispatching rain, golden talismans take flight,
Reviving creatures and nurturing life, the jade pivot is complete.
All sentient beings in the Three Realms attain the Dao,
No path in the Ten Directions is impassable.
Great is the Universal Transformation, radiant in primordial beginning—
Sun and moon shine equally, this is no falsehood.

**At that time, the Nine Heavens Responsive Primordial Thunder-Sound Universal Transformation Heavenly Worthy...**

**Commentary states:**
The Nine Heavens govern the thirty-six heavens collectively. Originating from the nine *qi* of the southeast, they emerge from the Thunder Gate, thus presiding over the thirty-six thunder commands. They receive the seals of all bureaus, courts, and halls, generating good and destroying evil without regard for human sentiment. The name "Nine Heavens" signifies their yang vigor, which does not perish. "Responsive Primordial" reveres the primordial beginning of the ancestral kalpa, when the One *Qi* divided into the true forms, and the Jade Clarity True King embodied the responsive primordial essence. Thunder arises from the conjoining of yin and yang *qi*. With the advent of thunder and lightning, the Nine Heavens Thunder Ancestor divided their jurisdiction. These were further subdivided into five attributes, employed by the Divine Empyrean True King to govern the Three Realms. The True King resides in the Divine Empyrean Jade Palace, whose Dao lies in *Xun*. *Xun* is the earth within Heaven, the southeast being the realm of the nine yang *qi*. Congealing into luminous clarity, the Primordial Father and Ancestor transformed into the Divine Empyrean Jade Clarity True King. The Jade Palace lies within the azure empyrean’s Brahma *qi*, two thousand three hundred *li* from the Thunder City. The Thunder City stands eighty-one *zhang* high, with the Jade Pivot Five-Thunder Envoy Court to its left and the Jade Palace Five-Thunder Envoy Court to its right. Heaven has four directions and four corners, divided into the Nine Empyreans. Only this one empyrean dwells within the Brahma *qi*. That which is in the heart is called *shen*, hence the name *Divine Empyrean*—the True King’s seat of governance, the Heavenly Worthy’s capital. Ministers, teachers, envoys, and officials are arrayed in offices, governing Heaven’s calamities and blessings, holding the balance of things, overseeing life and death, inspecting and sealing, managing the keys of generation. From the Heavenly Sovereign above to the Earthly Emperor below, none can issue decrees without thunder. From life and death to withering and flourishing, none can administer governance without thunder. Thunder’s governance and commands are subordinate to the Three Clarities’ Sagely Thunder Ancestor, the Ten Poles’ Supreme Thunder Origin, the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven who issues thunder’s decrees, the Queen of Earth who regulates thunder, and the Northern Culmen Purple Tenuity Great Emperor who wields the Five Thunders.

There are thirty-six thunder spirits of old, once arrayed before the Most High. The thunder methods comprise seventy-two ranks, for the heavens and earth reward good and punish evil, and all things arise through thunder. Though it be the clash of yin and yang, it is also the stirring of divine and human agency—when thunder roars, rain descends.

Sound is the benevolent voice of heaven and earth. At the spring equinox, five days later, thunder’s voice arises, audible for a hundred leagues, shaking the nine heavens and stirring the nine earths, startling the four seas and churning the four abysses. The Most High said: “Were I not to emit the sound of yin and yang, my great tone would have no means of summoning. Thus I drum forth with thunder and lightning to call forth qi with sound.”

Before the Thunder Thearch stand thirty-six thunder drums. Whenever thunder is to be deployed, the Thunder Thearch personally strikes the drum of his own division once, and immediately the thunder lords and thunder spirits unleash their thunderous voices.

The Vast Transformation Heavenly Worthy was born of the nine sons of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Floating Radiance. The Jade Clarity Perfected King transformed and gave rise to the Thunder Voice Vast Transformation Heavenly Worthy. Through kalpas of responsive manifestation, the Heavenly Worthy assumes titles in accord with the times. From the original qi of the Primordial Ancestral Kalpa, the qi divided and became perfected, giving rise to the Jade Clarity Perfected King, sovereign of the nine empyreans. For one month and four celestial markers, he oversees the myriad heavens, roaming the three realms and the nine provinces of the ten thousand lands, rewarding good and recording transgressions—such is the Vast Transformation, most great and most noble.

In principle: Though the nine heavens are said to be the number of qian, yang and firm, yet not yielding, they are in truth the birthplace of the nine qi. Therein, essence gathers and spirit congeals, forming the transformed body of our Jade Clarity Perfected King.

Responsive Origin: The qi of heaven and earth, the yin and yang of the five phases, flow above and below—there is not a single thing that does not receive the mandate of heaven and obtain the qi of yin and yang by which it is born. Thus it is called Responsive Origin—what doubt could there be?

Great indeed is thunder! Therefore, the celestial sages and earthly perfected of the three realms and ten directions each have their offices, yet the Jade Clarity Perfected King of the nine heavens governs all their commands.

Sound is the function of qi; qi is the command of sound. It clarifies right and wrong, shakes the sprouting and raises the submerged—without the command of thunder, how could life arise?

The Vast Transformation Heavenly Worthy: Heaven is I, I am heaven. With vast and boundless vows, I transform my body throughout the ten directions. For all sentient beings who turn their hearts toward the Dao, I shall embody them in body—what else is this if not the Vast Transformation of the Heavenly Worthy?

Explanation: At that time, the nine qi took form and coalesced into the nine heavens, above the thirty-six heavens, the ancestral qi of the ten directions and three realms. The reason for employing the number nine is that its qi fundamentally arises from the body of the Three Clarities, and its use of the name of the nine heavens is fitting.

Responsive Origin: It is the principle of heaven as yang and earth as yin. Now, our Heavenly Worthy is born of yang and dwells in heaven, firm and unyielding. Thus all things born of earth without exception heed the command of the Heavenly Worthy, so that each thing attains its proper place. Worldly people do not understand this principle, yet their original essence all derives from the surplus qi of the Heavenly Worthy. The Heavenly Worthy desires that all people become Heavenly Worthies—why would he begrudge his qi and not respond to the wondrous Dao of their original essence?

Thunder is of a kind, giving rise to the myriad kinds and arousing the multitude of species. Who does not know that thunder is the clash of yin and yang qi, yet it has its overseers? Why does it sever evil, punish perversity, drive winds, and dispatch rain? The common folk, lacking understanding, how could they recognize the mechanism of life and death of the Primordial Beginning or the wondrous function of the Jade Clarity Perfected King?

Sound is command, it is hearing. Without sound, heaven’s thunder and lightning would not move; without sound, earth’s grasses and trees would not sprout; without sound, humans could not distinguish purity from turbidity. Thus sound is the root of the self, the primordial darkness of yin and yang.

Heaven is impartial—sun and moon shed their light. Heaven has virtue—all beings are born. Therefore, our Heavenly Worthy acts on heaven’s behalf to enact the Dao, bestowing virtue upon the three realms, so that the pure become sages and the turbid become worthies. For all sentient and formed beings, he enables them to ascend to the immortal ranks and together complete the one qi.

Eulogy:
Nine heavens, nine heavens,
Mysterious, again mysterious.
Suddenly behind me,
In an instant before me.
Right: Nine Heavens.

Though the two qi divide into yin and yang,
The Jade Clarity soars high, transforming the Perfected King.
Above heaven, below earth, they harmonize,
Spreading teachings and dividing forms throughout the ten directions.
Right: Responsive Origin.

The rectitude of the two qi,
The command of the five phases.
Severing demons, punishing perversity,
Heaven and humans respond in echo.
Right: Thunder.

Broadly proclaiming the Thearch’s virtue to arouse the multitude of beings,
The heroic spirits of the three realms incline their ears to listen.
Do not say that old heaven is silent,
For you must know the command is in the thunder’s roar.
Right: Sound.

The virtue of cherishing life cannot be measured,
The teachings spread through all heavens and the ten directions.
High in Jade Clarity, governing the Thunder Bureau,
The myriad spirits in court robes pay homage to the Perfected King.
Right: Vast Transformation.

Within the Heaven of Jade Clarity, together with the Heavenly Lords of the ten directions, they gather in the Palace of Jade Void and Ninefold Radiance, the Hall of Lush Mist and Expansive Net, the Chamber of Purple Ultimate and Hidden Depths. They peruse the azure-green jade tablets of the Profound Darkness, examine the books of the Luminous Dawn of the Subtle Cavern, whispering intimately of the profound mystery, with many attendant ministers standing respectfully by.

The Heavenly Worthy sits in tranquil repose, reciting the cavern scriptures. The Heavenly Lords of the ten directions chant the "Pacing the Void." Jade maidens and immortal sisters scatter flowers in circling dance, then lead one another to wander and play in the Emerald Palace. The host of immortals guides the way, with pennants preceding and iron staves following, dragon banners and simurgh chariots soaring through the vast sky, all assembling at the Seven-Treasured Tiered Terrace of Jade Brahmā.

Annotation: At that time, the Heavenly Worthy roamed within the Heaven of Jade Clarity, feasting with the Heavenly Lords of the ten directions in the Jade Void Palace, the Purple Ultimate Chamber.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy examined the caskets of the Profound Azure Jade, reviewing the records of the Cavernous Subtlety and Luminous Dawn. Those who leaned close in whispered conference were the Heavenly Lords of the ten directions, seated in ordered ranks, sage transmitting to sage, together listening to the subtle and mysterious, the profound and arcane words. At that moment, each Heavenly Lord had his many household ministers standing respectfully by, attending with reverence.

The Heavenly Worthy sat in serene majesty, reciting the cavern scriptures. The Heavenly Lords, deeply enlightened, rose from their seats one by one, chanting long hymns and pacing the void in praise of the Heavenly Worthy’s teachings. Jade maidens and immortal sisters scattered flowers in circling dance around the Heavenly Worthy’s seat, then entreated the Heavenly Worthy to proceed to the Seven-Treasured Tiered Terrace of the Emerald Palace, desiring that the Heavenly Worthy expound the wondrous Dao. The tiered terrace was the Dragon-Phoenix Seat, with seven levels, each adorned with precious treasures—hence its name, the Seven-Treasured Tiered Terrace.

The Heavenly Worthy mounted his divine carriage, with white cranes and lions leading the way in solemn procession. Azure dragons and white tigers, the Six Jia and Six Ding spirits, guarded his left and right. The Nine Heavens’ immortal maidens and the Twelve Stream Perfected intoned celestial music. The Heavenly Great Emperors, Divine Lords, Divine Kings, and Supreme Perfected of the Great Ultimate followed in phoenix-scripted chariots and dragon-drawn carriages, traversing the Emerald Palace. Immortal banners and ritual halberds, dragon standards and simurgh chariots soared through the vast sky, assembling at the jeweled terrace.

Annotation: At that time, roaming the Heaven of Jade Clarity and halting at the jeweled terrace, the Heavenly Worthy grandly expounded the mysterious texts and broadly proclaimed the essential teachings. All the immortals and humans to his left and right opened their hearts to receive his transformation, their merit and practice thereby exalted.

Exegesis: At that time, our Heavenly Worthy was within his own celestial abode, where halls and chambers of the Nine Radiance Palace stood arrayed. There, he perused the scriptures and reviewed the canons, desiring to instruct the Heavenly Perfected Lords of the ten directions in the great Dao. Thus, the Heavenly Perfected Lords, robed in virtue and submitting in reverence, knew not how to dance in joy. The Heavenly Worthy, greatly pleased, wished to journey to the outer palaces. The myriad immortals and transcendents, to his left and right, before and behind, with ritual halberds and ordered banners, escorted our Heavenly Worthy to halt his simurgh carriage at the Emerald Palace. The Emerald Palace was the traveling palace of the Heaven of Jade Clarity.

The Thunder Master, his heart heavy with unspoken petitions, found no means to present them. By good fortune, our Heavenly Worthy ascended the jeweled terrace, raising his golden, radiant ruyi scepter to survey all beings below.

Eulogy:
Thus grasping the mysterious, the one aperture of the mysterious opens,
And the ten directions and three realms respond in due time.
The jade scriptures are perused with care to preserve the primordial qi,
The precious canons are proclaimed anew to nurture the original embryo.
The attendant maidens, leaning close, understand in their hearts,
The reverent ministers, standing in awe, compose their intent.
Suddenly, the teachings are expounded, and celestial flowers dance,
Phoenixes and simurghs soar gracefully above the Seven-Treasured Terrace.

At that moment, the Thunder Master, Elder Hao, stepped forth from the ranks of immortals, prostrated himself before the Heavenly Worthy, trembling in reverence, and knelt to address the Heavenly Worthy: “Greatly compassionate Heavenly Worthy, greatly sagely Heavenly Worthy, father of all beings, master of the myriad spirits—now, all the heavens enjoy this blessed audience. We have just witnessed the Heavenly Worthy perusing the precious canons and reviewing the jade scriptures, wherein lie boundless secrets beyond enumeration. Yet there is the Jade Firmament Prefecture, which governs the Inner Courts of the thirty-six heavens, the Eastern and Western Flower Terraces, the Mystic Coil Wondrous Chambers, the Four Prefectures and Six Courts, and all their subordinate offices, each with its own bureau and division—altogether, they oversee the Five Thunder Heavens’ descent into the three realms. O Most August Heavenly Worthy, your heart is ever close to the affairs of the multitudes. By what cause or condition might these minor omens be made to submit and serve? We humbly wish to hear your teaching.”

Annotation: The Thunder Master, Hao Huang, was an elder minister of the Celestial Emperor, a venerable preceptor and esteemed official. The Jade Firmament Prefecture was the Jade Clarity True King’s Court in the Highest Divine Firmament Heaven, residing above the thirty-six heavens. It comprised five halls: the Eastern Hall of Elixir Pearls, the Western Hall of Azure Jade, the Northern Hall of Azure Splendor, the Southern Hall of Concentrated Spirit, and the Central Hall of Longevity. There was also the Great One’s Inner Court, the Han Zhong Bureau, the Eastern and Western Terraces, the Four Offices and Four Divisions, and beyond them, the Great Brahmā Purple Tenuity Chambers and the Immortal Capital Fire-Thunder Halls. All had their jade prefectures, with the Left and Right Mysteries, the Golden Gates’ Chamberlains, the Chief Ministers, Supreme Ministers, Perfected Transcendents, Perfected Lords, Ministers and Attendants of the Celestial Court, Immortal Gentlemen, Jade Gentlemen, Jade Boys and Jade Maidens, Left and Right Commanders, and the various departments of thunder deities—officers, generals, and officials—who together governed the thirty-six heavens.

The thirty-six heavens were divided as follows:
**Eastern Eight Heavens:** Highest Dao Tranquility Heaven, Highest Yang Qi Heaven, Highest Cavernous Radiance Heaven, Highest Purple Impulse Heaven, Highest Jade Numinosity Heaven, Highest Clarity and Emptiness Heaven, Highest Subtle Fruit Heaven, Highest Rectified Heart Heaven.
**Southern Eight Heavens:** Highest Dao Origin Heaven, Highest Great August Heaven, Highest Mystic Impulse Heaven, Highest Ultimate Perfection Heaven, Highest Brahmā Qi Heaven, Highest Imperial Assistant Heaven, Highest Mystic Ancestry Heaven, Highest Sequential Transformation Heaven.
**Western Eight Heavens:** Highest Left Constellation Heaven, Highest Governance and Transformation Heaven, Highest Talisman Advent Heaven, Highest Preservation and Splendor Heaven, Highest Essence Stabilization Heaven, Highest Azure Splendor Heaven, Highest Scintillating Jade Heaven, Highest Cinnabar Essence Heaven.
**Northern Eight Heavens:** Highest Peace and Radiance Heaven, Highest Vast Ancestry Heaven, Highest Vast August Heaven, Highest Hopeful Mystery Heaven, Highest Celebratory Abode Heaven, Highest Celestial Tower Heaven, Highest Transformation and Immortality Heaven, Highest Ascending Mystery Heaven.
**Additional Heavens:** Highest Reverent August Heaven in the Northeast, Highest Spirit Shifting Heaven in the Southeast, Highest Jade Numinosity Heaven in the Southwest, Highest Ascending Ultimate Heaven in the Northwest.

Below, they oversaw the thirty-six ramparts, with each direction possessing nine yang Brahmā qi, corresponding to the thirty-six qi of the year, each qi ascending in ten-day cycles. Each heaven had its emperor, who governed one qi, and the merits and transgressions of heavenly immortals, spirits, and ghosts were submitted to their respective heavens for judgment. Those with merit were recorded in their heaven’s register, while those with transgressions were imprisoned in their heaven’s celestial dungeon.

All matters of good and evil are reported by the August Lords of the thirty-six ramparts to the Divine Numinous Jade Treasury for investigation and judgment. Each heaven possesses dragon spirits who summon thunder, giving life or executing death, punishing violence and slaying the wicked—nothing proceeds without their authority.

The Four Treasuries are: the Nine Numinous Jade Clarity Treasury, the Eastern Ultimate Azure Mystery Treasury, the Nine Heavens Responsive Primordial Treasury, and the Cavernous Abyss Jade Treasury. The Six Institutes are: the Supreme Unity Inner Institute, the Jade Pivot Institute, the Five Thunders Institute, the Dipper Pivot Institute, the Celestial Yang Institute, and the Immortal Capital Fire-Thunder Institute. The various administrative offices include: the Heavenly Department Thunder Bureau, the Penglai Capital Water Bureau, the Supreme Unity Thunder Bureau, the Northern Emperor Thunder Bureau, the Northern Dipper Punitive Expedition Bureau, the Northern Dipper Defense Bureau, the Jade Treasury Nine Thunder Bureaus, and the various subordinate offices and departments.

Whenever the world suffers from scorching yang, untimely winds and rains, reckless warfare, or repeated famines, petitions are submitted to the Jade Treasury, passing through the Jade Pivot, to be widely proclaimed across the celestial divisions. Concurrently, the Three Bureaus judge the merits and transgressions of the generals and soldiers, the ghosts and spirits of the Three Realms, aiding and rescuing the common people. All thunder-related offices, institutes, and treasuries assist the Jade Pivot’s decrees, receiving and executing them accordingly. As for the axes and halberds of thunder, the rewards and punishments, the commendations and executions—all proceed in perfect order, each under its designated office. Some are called concurrent bureaus, mobile bureaus, or inspection offices, all staffed with officials and functionaries.

Thus, the Jade Numinous Treasury alone governs the Five Thunders’ descent upon the Three Realms. In principle: the Heavenly Worthy, with jade scriptures and numinous texts, transforms the celestial perfected. The Thunder Masters silently comprehend the Heavenly Worthy’s intent, petitioning for the gates of expedient means. At such times, lord and ministers, though differing in form, share a single heart—nothing but opening the paths to enliven all beings. When reciting scriptures, the gentleman should take the Thunder Master’s heart as his own; thus, his merit will naturally find its return.

Explanation: At that time, our Heavenly Worthy ascended the Treasure Terrace to observe all beings, speaking without words. Just then, the Thunder Master, Radiant Elder, whose duty lies in the Thunder Treasury and who surpasses the celestial perfected, discerned the Heavenly Worthy’s heart with his own and thus addressed him. Our Heavenly Worthy’s virtue and transformation are boundless, the true and primordial having their own origin; his mysterious scriptures and secret registers cannot be enumerated in detail. Therefore, he revealed the governance of the thirty-six heavens’ eastern and western terrace treasuries, institutes, and bureaus—none not unified under the Jade Numinous Treasury. Through the Thunder Master Radiant Elder’s initiative, he brought forth what our Heavenly Worthy had not yet proclaimed.

The Thunder Master petitioned the Heavenly Worthy: “Your heart is most great and most sagely, encompassing the ten thousand kinds. Though I, your minister, am of humble talent, by what cause or reason may I attend the Jade Celestial Court? I beseech the Heavenly Worthy to clarify my former kalpas, that I may assist in the primordial transformation and the affairs of the Jade Numinous Treasury.” One should hold one’s breath and listen reverently.

Eulogy: Suddenly rising to kneel, he respectfully addressed the True Ancestor. All offices, institutes, treasuries, terraces, and pavilions—honor and veneration!

The Thirty-Six Offices—clouds, thunder, rain, and wind—what spirit is not complete, what sage does not follow? Their duties govern life and death, their affairs determine fortune and misfortune. To hear the supreme teaching, one must reveal the cinnabar heart.

How benevolent! How benevolent! Thunder Master Radiant Elder.

The Heavenly Worthy spoke: “Thunder Master Radiant Elder, you and the immortal ministers have stored merit from former lives and accumulated deeds from past existences. Thus, you were promoted to the Jade Treasury and recorded in the Jasper Palace. Now, your meritorious deeds surpass those of former times. Devote yourselves wholly to the Thunder Bureau and entrust your hearts to the Fire Department. Day after day, year after year, as merit accumulates and conduct shines, your nature will clear and your spirit harmonize. You will then attain the rank of High Perfected and ascend the wondrous Dao.

Yet consider the ghosts and spirits of the Thunder Department: they toil by day and labor by night, ceaselessly driven. Some endure beatings; in grave cases, they face execution. Like chiseled clouds or carved snow, their tasks never end. Summoning dragons and commanding crows, when one task ceases, another begins. You must heed the causes of their suffering.”

Thunder Master Radiant Elder and all the gods and immortals of the heavens pricked up their ears in silence.

The Heavenly Worthy sat upon the Nine-Phoenix Cinnabar-Radiance Screen, raising a golden luminous ruyi scepter. A pure, cool breeze arose, and resplendent clouds gathered in lush beauty. The Heavenly Worthy remained still for a long while.

*Annotation:* The Thunder Bureau issues commands and executes affairs with the swiftness of wind and fire, allowing no delay. Where blessings descend, there is direction; the sound of thunderclaps follows measure. Whether to bring drought or rain, all must obey the imperial decree. How do the ghosts and spirits of the Thunder Bureau carry out their tasks? These are people who, while dwelling in the dusty world, were disloyal, unfilial, unkind, and unjust; who disrespected the Three Treasures and neglected the Five Constants; who wasted the Five Grains. Thus, after their bodies perish, they are subjected to the Thunder Bureau’s drudgery—this is the retribution for their sins.

Hearing the Heavenly Worthy expound the causes of good and evil, Thunder Master Radiant Elder and all the gods and immortals of the heavens listened with ears alert and hearts trembling.

As the Heavenly Worthy sat, a divine wind arose, pure and cool, while vibrant clouds gathered in splendid beauty. After a long silence, he prepared to address the assembly of immortals once more.

*Exegesis:* Good roots should be planted; evil karma must not arise. Even the Heavenly Perfected accumulate merit and cultivate conduct—how much more should later scholars and gentlemen devote themselves wholeheartedly?

*Exposition:* Thunder Master Radiant Elder shares the same body as heaven and earth, his brightness equal to the sun and moon. Thus, the Heavenly Worthy spoke of his stored merit from former lives and great deeds performed before the primordial beginning. Having long accumulated and refined his essence and qi, he transformed into form and was thus promoted to the Jade Treasury and recorded in the Jasper Palace. Now, he oversees the Bureau of Good and Evil, dispensing transformation and aiding others—his merit is no small matter. His wholehearted devotion to the Fire Department is his true nature. With each passing day and month, his name grows loftier and his conduct more illustrious. By preserving his primordial qi, the words “his nature clears and his spirit harmonizes” are no empty phrase. Thus, he becomes a minister of evidential proof to the Highest Perfected Kings and ascends the ranks of the Great Dao.

The Heavenly Worthy discussed the two paths of good and evil for the Perfected of the heavens, then recounted how the ghosts and spirits of the Thunder Department toil day and night without rest. “Chiseled clouds” refers to their labor in rushing to the four directions, shaping clouds into formations. “Carved snow” describes their suffering as they brave freezing winds and congealed rain to craft frost-flowers. When they enter the sea to summon dragons or traverse forests to command crows, their tasks shift ceaselessly—east to west, rising and falling without pause. Thus, the causes of good and evil are made clear.

At that moment, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the Thunder Master: “I attained the rank of Great Transformation Perfected and Highest Perfected because my heart first aligned with this Dao. You, too, must take my merit as your own if you wish to ascend the immortal throne, assist in the transformation of the mysterious scriptures, and accomplish the Dao. Now, listen well.”

All the Heavenly Thearchs, hearing these words, pricked up their ears in reverent attention. The Heavenly Worthy’s majesty defies description: a divine wind arose, and resplendent clouds shone in pure, lush beauty. The Heavenly Worthy and the Nine Qi merged as one, still and unmoving.

*Eulogy:* The two paths of good and evil are as distinct as echo and shadow. Good becomes Heavenly Perfected; evil becomes demons and specters.

The Heavenly Worthy said: “In a former kalpa fifteen hundred eons past, my heart first aligned with this Dao, and I attained the rank of Highest Perfected. My intent nurtured this merit, and I gained authority over the Great Transformation. Once, before the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Great Ultimate, I vowed with a pure and vast heart: ‘In future worlds, may all sentient beings—heavenly dragons and ghosts—who invoke my name be liberated. If this is not so, may I bear the burden myself.’ Now, purify your hearts, for I shall expound the teaching.”

**Annotation:** "Heart-sewing this Dao" means, like cutting cloth to make garments—without stitching, how can it become clothing? Moreover, the single primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth disperses throughout the vastness of the Six Directions. Humans receive from their parents a single primordial *qi* within their bodies, which is the legacy of their ancestors. If one cultivates it with wisdom, stabilizes the mind in pure observation, gathers the Seven Treasures, and coalesces the Returning Elixir, this is called "sewing with the heart to complete the Great Dao and attain the rank of Highest Perfected." Furthermore, with the *qi* of Heaven and Earth’s transforming purity and the Dao’s merging with the marvel of harmonious emptiness, one ferments vast merit, thereby wielding authority over the Great Transformation, lifting Heaven and Earth, and becoming unfathomable in concealment and manifestation. Before the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Great Ultimate in the Great Canopy, the Heavenly Worthy vowed with a vast and pure heart: "May all sentient beings—heavenly dragons and ghosts—who invoke my name be liberated. If this is not so, may I bear the burden myself." This fully reveals the Heavenly Worthy’s universal protection of humans and celestials, and his vast and solemn vow.

**Exegesis:** Having fortunately obtained a human body, one must not let it slip away in vain. One should uphold this Dao, recite this scripture, and daily progress toward merging with the Dao—is this not of great benefit?

**Exposition:** The difficulty of attaining the Dao lies in the challenge of uniting with it. In the beginning of five hundred kalpas past, our Heavenly Worthy’s heart first aligned with this Dao, which is the formation of the Nine *Qi*. Thus, he was called the True King and came to govern the Great Transformation. Once, before the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Great Ultimate in the Great Canopy, our Heavenly Worthy, with the untainted truth of the Nine Heavens, made a boundless vow across the Three Realms: "In future worlds, any being that receives the Nine *Qi* and turns to my transformation by invoking my name shall be able to raise the dead and restore life. If any do not believe and follow, I shall transform the Primordial One *Qi* into the Nine *Qi* to restore their original state." The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Heavenly Emperors and Lords, saying: "Purify your hearts, for I shall now reveal to you the profound mysteries of the Great Dao."

**Eulogy:** The Dao is the heart of Heaven and Earth,
Yet the deluded do not seek to understand.
A torn robe must be mended—
One needs a needle honed by water’s patience.

The Heavenly Worthy said: "All you heavenly beings, if you wish to hear the Supreme Dao—the Supreme Dao is profoundly subtle, not found elsewhere. Since you wish to hear it, know that ‘no hearing’ is true hearing, and ‘having perception’ is the true Dao. When hearing and perception vanish, only you remain. You are not even ‘you’—how much less the Dao? To ‘hear without hearing’—what Dao is there to discuss?"

**Annotation:** The Supreme Dao is not found elsewhere but within oneself. If you wish to hear it, understanding your own Dao means there is no need to hear. Thus, it is said: "No hearing is true hearing; having perception is the true Dao." If you hear others speak of yourself, having perception is the true Dao—yet hearing and perception must both dissolve, for they are not the true hearing or seeing. If you claim there is no ‘you,’ yet seek to hear the Dao, you cannot be spoken to about the Dao.

**Exegesis:** The Great Dao is formless, without self or other, beyond existence and non-existence—this is the true Dao. Where is the Dao in the realm of form and action? Those who enter the Dao must plant their feet where there is no ‘no.’

**Eulogy:**
Dao, Dao, Dao, Dao—
Speaking of it is laughable.
Heaven, Earth, I, and all beings—
One family, one aperture.

The Heavenly Worthy said: "The Dao is entered through sincerity, guarded through silence, and employed through softness. Using sincerity appears foolish; using silence appears inarticulate; using softness appears clumsy. Only thus can one forget form, forget self, and even forget forgetting. Those who enter the Dao know when to stop; those who guard the Dao know caution; those who employ the Dao know subtlety. Knowing subtlety, wisdom’s light arises; knowing caution, sagely wisdom is complete; knowing when to stop, one attains supreme tranquility and peace. Supreme tranquility and peace complete sagely wisdom; sagely wisdom generates wisdom’s light; wisdom’s light unites with the Dao—this is called true forgetting. Only by forgetting yet not forgetting, forgetting what cannot be forgotten, does one attain the Supreme Dao. The Dao pervades Heaven and Earth, yet Heaven and Earth do not know it. Sentient and insentient beings—all are one, without duality."

**Annotation:** The Dao is the path by which the Three Realms proceed. To enter it, there must be a way; to guard it, there must be a method; its employment follows principle. The Dao is the name for Heaven and Earth’s non-action—it is humanity’s true constancy. Sincerity is uprightness without deviation, the principle of no falsehood. Thus, only with the sincerity of no falsehood can one enter the Dao of true constancy. Yet the Dao of true constancy is realized through personal awakening, so one must silently comprehend and harmonize the heart before guarding it, and act with ease and unhurriedness before employing it. To enter without guarding is not true entry; to guard without employing is not true guarding. Therefore, employing the true and real appears foolish in silence, harmonious and not forceful—how is this different from clumsiness? Yet this foolishness, inarticulateness, and clumsiness are merely appearances—how could they be truly so? Those who enter, guard, and employ the Dao in this way can not only forget things but also forget the self. When both things and self are forgotten, even the act of forgetting is forgotten. What is meant by forgetting form? The heart remains unmoved, profoundly still, without distinction between self and other. The wise recognize this; the enlightened see it—this is called truth. Entering the Dao, one knows when to stop; guarding the Dao, one knows caution—thus one abides in the Dao without straying. Employing the Dao, one knows subtlety—thus one returns to simplicity and is not misled by vastness. This is the original essence of the Dao’s body, the source from which the wondrous functioning of the single heart arises. Thus, all that is universally penetrating and all-knowing is inherently possessed by one’s original nature, and at this point, it is fully restored within oneself. Tracing its origin, it all stems from knowing when to stop."

When one knows when to stop, there is stability; with stability, one can attain stillness. Through prolonged stillness and stability, hearing and sight become complete. The celestial radiance illumines within, and the heart is pure in the Dao, merging with the Dao in truth. Yet one does not know what is the Dao and what is the self—only that the Dao is the self, and the self is the Dao, both forgotten in the state where there is nothing left to forget. This is called the supreme Dao.

The supreme Dao resides within heaven and earth, yet one does not perceive where it dwells. To know the Dao is to recognize that all sentient beings—whether the self or the myriad creatures—and all insentient things—mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees—do not exist beyond the realm of absolute purity and undefiled singularity. Only those who embrace the One as the model for all under heaven understand this.

For those who cultivate truth and refine the Dao, holding fast to the One without admixture ensures that virtue advances without demonic obstruction, and ascension to the immortal realms will come in time.

**Exposition:** This chapter outlines the foundational principles by which the Jade Pure True Sovereign enters, guards, and embodies the Dao. Devotees of the Great Jade Pivot Teachings who delve deeply into this passage will find true attainment, and the words of the Jade Pure True Sovereign will not have been spoken in vain.

**Commentary:** The Great Dao is wordless; words are not the Dao. Thus, the Heavenly Worthy’s previous discourse on the profound and abstruse supreme Dao could not be fully conveyed. If such teachings were to be expounded, later generations would not be transformed by the Heavenly Worthy’s influence. The Dao has arising and ceasing, yet it is without sight or sound—arising, ceasing, sight, and sound are all created by the heart.

When the Heavenly Worthy was born, the nine qi took form, yet what was seen? What was heard? This chapter is the path by which the Heavenly Worthy instructs those who study the Dao and cultivate truth, guiding them in their practice and preservation. It requires aligning one’s sincerity with the sincerity of heaven and earth.

For sincerity is the One. The Dao generates the One, the One generates the Two, the Two generate the Three, and the Three give rise to the myriad things—all originate from the One of sincerity. One who enters through sincerity, guards through silence, and acts through softness will appear foolish in sincerity, dull in silence, and clumsy in softness. Sincerity, silence, and softness are the substance and function; foolishness, dullness, and clumsiness are the Dao and its mystery. Only thus can one merge indistinguishably with the Dao, forgetting form, forgetting the self, and forgetting even the act of forgetting. This is the reality of the Dao and the wonder of truth.

To enter, one must know when to stop; to guard, one must know caution; to employ, one must know subtlety. Knowing subtlety, the radiance of the nine qi is complete. Knowing caution, the sageliness of the myriad spirits is fulfilled. Knowing when to stop, the spirits of the Three Primes are at peace. When the spirits are at peace, wisdom is complete; when wisdom is complete, numinous radiance arises; when numinous radiance arises, the original qi of one’s fundamental nature is united. This is called true forgetting—forgetting yet not forgetting, forgetting where there is nothing left to forget. This is the Great Dao of the true One.

**Eulogy:**
Guard the One, guard the One,
Employ caution and silence.
Without self, without others,
Yet there is a thief.
If you seize it,
Profound clarity congeals like jade.

The Heavenly Worthy said: How shall I benefit the world in this age? For the sake of all heavenly beings, I expound this wondrous treasure. Those who awaken to it will ascend to the immortal ranks.

Students of the Dao, know that there are qi and fate. Wind and earth differ, and thus endowments vary—this is called qi. Wisdom and foolishness differ, and thus purity and turbidity vary—this is called fate. Fate is tied to destiny; qi is tied to heaven. Bound by qi and fate, constrained by heavenly mandate, one cannot attain the true Dao. The foolish can become wise, the turbid can become pure—this is decreed by destiny.

The foolish remain benighted, the turbid remain dark—this is the influence of wind and earth’s endowment. Heaven and earth move by their mechanism, causing people to remain unaware, which is called spontaneity. If one becomes aware of unawareness, it is still called spontaneity. The wonder of spontaneity lies in knowing, yet its wonder arises from not knowing. Nevertheless, the Dao has never begun to make one foolish or turbid.

All heavenly beings heard this, and the four assemblies rejoiced.

**Annotation:** Where people are born, if the land is thick and the waters deep, the earth’s qi is cold, and the myriad things mature late. The work of creation is profound, and thus lifespans are long. If the land is thin and the waters shallow, the earth’s qi is hot, and the myriad things mature quickly. The work of creation is slight, and thus lifespans are short. This is the difference in wind and earth, the variation in endowment.

If one is endowed with pure prenatal qi, one becomes kind, upright, loyal, filial, intelligent, and wise—a lover of immortality and the Dao. If one is endowed with turbid qi, one becomes fierce, wicked, deceitful, cruel, foolish, rebellious, and lacking in humanity and righteousness. This is the difference between wisdom and foolishness, purity and turbidity.

Bound by qi and fate, like the blooming of flowers and trees, each has its season, all receiving the qi of heaven and earth. Constrained by heavenly mandate, it is as if a decree imposes shackles. The unvirtuous remain mired in evil destinies and cannot attain the true Dao.

The foolish can be transformed through the gate of wisdom; the turbid can be transformed through the gate of purity. The foolish remain benighted, the turbid remain dark—this is the natural course, determined by the allocation of wind and earth’s endowment. For heaven and earth give life to and kill the myriad things according to the qi of the four seasons.

The wise receive the qi of the Five Phases and the essence of yin and yang. By cultivating and refining them, they preserve their lives, enduring as long as heaven and earth, as luminous as the sun and moon. The foolish know only sensual pleasures and flavors, unaware that these harm their lives. Thus, students of the Dao should reflect in silence.

**Exposition:** All things born of heaven receive the power of the Two Qi. Those with more pure qi are refined and virtuous; those with more turbid qi are wicked and depraved. Is this not due to the unevenness of wind and earth and the variation in endowment?

**Commentary:** The unevenness of wind and earth is truly tied to qi and fate.

Thus, Our Heavenly Worthy presents this chapter. Why is it placed after the exposition of the Great Dao? Because worldly people, neglecting self-cultivation, recklessly squander their lives. Who among them knows that the light and pure qi forms heaven, while the heavy and turbid qi forms earth? For the human body, the qi of heaven generates essence, fluids, and humors; the qi of earth generates bones, flesh, and sinews. Having received the Two Qi at birth, why then do people differ in lifespan, intelligence, virtue, and folly? Is this not due to the varying thickness of wind and earth, the imbalance of yin and yang?

The mandate of heaven is like a fetter; the allotment of qi is like an enclosure. It is said that no one can escape heaven’s mandate or transgress the bounds of qi. Only we, the students of the Dao, who revere this scripture, may transcend heaven’s mandate and rise beyond the constraints of qi.

When Our Heavenly Worthy finished speaking these words, the assembled ministers, preceptors, and all the Heavenly Emperors, Thunder Masters, and Radiant Elders leapt forth in praise. Even the celestial dragons and spirits, gods and demons, could not contain their joy, dancing with hands and feet.

**Eulogy:**
The suitability of wind and earth depends on qi and blood.
Waters each have their source; beings each have their kalpas.
The light and pure return to the mysterious; the heavy and turbid remain impure.
The Dao is fundamentally undivided; this heart is like the moon.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: “What I have spoken is the *Precious Scripture of the Jade Pivot*. In future ages, if any sentient beings hear my name and silently contemplate it, forming this thought—uttering the name of the Nine Heavens’ Responsive Primordial Thunder-Sounding Universal Transformation Heavenly Worthy—whether once, five or seven times, or a hundred or a thousand times—I shall manifest in the ten directions, extend my mind through the Three Realms, and ensure that all who invoke my name attain their desires. Throughout the ten directions and Three Realms, in all heavens and earths, the sun, moon, and stars, mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees, creatures that fly, crawl, or stir—whether sentient or insentient—celestial dragons, spirits, and gods: if any hear sentient beings invoke my name and yet fail to comply, may their heads be severed and their hearts carved out, reduced to fine dust.”

**Annotation:**
The *Jade Pivot* is the qi of the Jade Clarity. Jade is the most exalted and noble, thus the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning is called the Jade Clarity; the August Emperor of Heaven is called the Jade Sovereign; the Supreme Dao Lord is called the Jade Dawn; the Supreme Venerable Lord is called the Lofty Jade Emperor. The capital of the Three Clarities is named the Jade Capital; the Divine King of the Divine Empyrean is called the Jade Clarity. Jade is the most noble among treasures. The *pivot* is the hinge of heaven. Thunder is the pivot and mechanism of heaven and earth. The heavenly pivot governs yin; the earthly mechanism governs yang. Though heaven is fundamentally yang, it is called the *pivot*—this is the principle of inversion. Though heaven is yang and earth is yin, heaven generates water as the first of the Five Phases. The Greedy Wolf Star of the Northern Dipper is called the Pivot Star; the Greedy Wolf corresponds to the Celestial Origin, the first of the Seven Governors. Like the Bureau of Military Affairs, it is the pivot and mechanism of the imperial court, overseeing the state’s confidential affairs and wielding the power of life and death. The *Scripture of the Jade Pivot* is the thunder script of the Heavenly Treasury. If there are disobedient people, their hearts must be restrained and their heads severed—all by the command of the Thunder Bureau.

**Exposition:**
The Heavenly Worthy’s heart is a heart of cherishing life. Manifesting in the ten directions, he ensures that not a single being is deprived of his grace. If any slander this scripture, the Thunder Bureau will test their heads and carve out their hearts—this is fitting.

**Commentary:**
In this chapter, the Heavenly Worthy’s vast vow is made clear. The Heavenly Worthy’s thoughts and lives are boundless, beyond description; thus, he bestows the numinous scripture of the *Jade Pivot* to transform sentient beings. If, after beings are transformed and attain the truth, they invoke my Heavenly Worthy’s name or inscribe my Heavenly Worthy’s talisman, then all things in the world—mountains, rivers, grasses, trees, creatures that fly, crawl, or stir—anything endowed with the Two Qi, shall tremble and listen, daring not the slightest defiance. If any disobey, the Thunder Bureau will not tolerate it, and they shall be shattered into fine dust.

**Eulogy:**
Heavenly Worthy, Heavenly Worthy,
Your vow is vast and boundless.
Those who slander the mysterious scripture
shall meet harm from the Thunder Bureau.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: “I am the Nine Heavens’ Chaste and Radiant Great Sage. On the sixth day of each month and on the *xin* days within the ten-day week, I oversee the myriad heavens and wander through the Three Realms. If anyone wishes to study the Dao, aspire to immortality, ascend to the Nine Mysteries, or dispel the Three Calamities, let them command a Zhengyi Daoist or, together with kin and friends, perform rites at a towered temple, in their home, or at a village shrine—offering libations of water and flowers, reciting this scripture. Whether once, three or five times, or even dozens or hundreds of times, they shall attain clarity of spirit, vigor of qi, a broad mind, and a robust body. All their aspirations shall be answered in accord with their resonance.”

**Annotation:**
The Heavenly Worthy is titled the Chaste and Radiant Great Sage. *Chaste* means to observe heaven and earth with integrity and to prevail over fortune and misfortune. Thus, the sage emulates the transformations of heaven and earth and models the auspices of fortune and misfortune. The *Book of Changes* states: “The Creative is pure, replete, beneficial, and steadfast.” *Steadfast* corresponds to winter among the four seasons and to the north among the four directions; its command also belongs to the north. Heaven generates water as the first of the Five Phases—this is the ancestral qi of the Jade Clarity. The Heavenly Worthy descends on the sixth day of each month and on *xin* days. The sixth day: six yang descends to generate *qian*; six yin prevails to generate *kun*. The waxing and waning, ascent and descent circulate through the six voids, forming the ultimate Dao. From this arises sagely work; from this emerges numinous illumination. The generative number of heaven and earth is one; the consummate number is six. Heaven and earth attain these to moisten and benefit the world. The *six xin* are the water numbers of heaven, the celestial numbers—hence the name *six xin*. The *xin* number belongs to *qian*, heaven. Heaven generates water—all are the principles of the primordial unity of qi. The *myriad heavens* refer to all heavens from the Great Luo, Pure Tenuity, and Yu-Yu to the Great Red King’s realm. The Heavenly Worthy surveys all heavens without exception, observing the merits and faults of their inhabitants. As for the Three Realms, he wanders through them all, recording the merits and faults of the myriad spirits. If one recites this scripture, all their aspirations shall be answered in accord with their resonance.”

The Heavenly Worthy declares: “Whether endowed with sentiment or devoid of it, whether possessed of awareness or lacking it—all may attain true realization, thereby propagating the great transformation. Those who perceive their own virtue and power as immeasurable shall find their invocations invariably answered. O followers of the Dao, how can you not strive with diligence?”

The Exegesis states: On the day the Heavenly Worthy descends to inspect the world, fearing that mortals, unaware, might transgress celestial statutes, his compassion for all living beings extends even to this. Should any aspirant to the Dao and immortality—whether offering libations of water and flowers, whether kin or friend, or a Daoist—recite this scripture but once, they shall be enrolled among the ranks of immortals, their names inscribed in the celestial registers. Even those of lesser wit, should they suddenly awaken sincere devotion and recite this scripture, shall find their hearts expanded and bodies at ease. If filial sons and obedient grandsons purify their minds, cleanse their thoughts, and establish altars to invite the recitation of this scripture, they shall attain transcendence. Thus, whether dispelling the Three Calamities or summoning the Nine Ancestors, all shall achieve their desires, and none shall fail to receive response.

The Eulogy proclaims:
Sincerity requires no material offering—qi alone suffices to draw near.
Invoke but once the sacred name, and heaven and earth shall renew like spring.

The Heavenly Worthy asks: “Within the body dwell the Nine Spirits—why not summon them? The first is Heaven-Born, the second Peerless Radiance, the third Mystic Pearl, the fourth Central Upright, the fifth Child Cinnabar, the sixth Revolving Brilliance, the seventh Cinnabar Prime, the eighth Great Abyss, and the ninth Divine Youth. To invoke them is auspicious. Within the body reside the Three Essences—why not call upon them? The first is Terrace Light, the second Luminous Spirit, and the third Hidden Essence. To summon them is felicitous. When the five centers are vexed and restless, the six pulses chaotic, the four limbs unquiet, and the hundred joints distressed, recite this scripture.”

The Annotation states: The Nine Spirits are the fundamental deities within the human body. Heaven-Born is the Mystic Female. Peerless Radiance is the Infant Brother. Mystic Pearl is the Valley Spirit. Central Upright is the Muddy Pellet. Child Cinnabar is the spirit of the Numinous Terrace. Revolving Brilliance is the spirit of the Treasured Contract. Cinnabar Prime is the spirit of the heart. Great Abyss is the spirit of the Kidney Palace, the Arrayed Maidens, and the Water Mansion. Divine Youth governs and restrains the spirits of the five viscera. Terrace Light arises when male and female unite in essence, and the embryo first flourishes. Luminous Spirit is the *hun*. Hidden Essence is the *po*. Since one knows these divine spirits dwell within the body, why not call upon them constantly, refining them into a single household? Thus, the path to learning the Dao and aspiring to immortality shall be free of all obstacles. If the five centers are vexed and the six pulses chaotic, reciting this scripture shall pacify all spirits within the body, bringing tranquility and ease.

The Exposition states: The Three Essences and Nine Spirits are not external entities. They abide in our original home—take care not to let them depart. Ensure they ever attend at your side, paying homage to the perfected and revering the sages, and they shall be readily seen and easily attained. Thus, the Heavenly Worthy, fearing that people know not where the great Dao resides, points to it here.

The Exegesis states: Heaven possesses the Nine Luminaries, and humans possess the Nine Spirits. Heaven has the Three Terraces, and humans have the Three *Hun*. When the Nine Luminaries of heaven lose their proper measure and the Three Terraces shift their positions, droughts, floods, and dark omens arise. When the Nine Spirits of humans fail to guard their stations and the Three *Hun* wander recklessly, calamities and misfortunes ensue. Should any of these three conditions arise, recite the scripture with utmost sincerity, burn talismans, and the Three *Hun* shall be pacified, the Nine Spirits stilled, the five centers calmed, the six pulses harmonized, the four limbs at peace, and the hundred joints free of affliction.

The Eulogy proclaims:
Nine Spirits, Nine Spirits—these are my essence.
Call upon them constantly, and ever preserve long life.

The Heavenly Worthy declares: “Should anyone suffer from the five phases in adverse configuration, the Nine Luminaries in disarray, their year afflicted by clashes and conflicts, their fate beset by contention, solitary stars and barren constellations, the Blade of Yang and the Edge of the Sword, the Robber of Destruction and the Spirit of Death, the Ghost Gate and the Hook of Entanglement, their official salary ruined, their Horse fallen into emptiness, their actions fraught with peril, their conduct beset by misfortune—let them recite this scripture. Thereby, they may petition the Celestial Official to resolve celestial adversities, the Terrestrial Official to resolve terrestrial adversities, the Aquatic Official to resolve aquatic adversities, the Five Emperors to resolve adversities of the five directions, the Four Sages to resolve adversities of the four seasons, the Southern Asterism to resolve adversities of one’s original destiny, and the Northern Dipper to resolve all adversities.”

The Annotation states: When one’s five phases are obstructed, the Nine Luminaries lose their proper measure, and one encounters clashes, conflicts, and various baleful stars, all actions and undertakings shall be inauspicious. In severe cases, one may incur celestial reprimands, terrestrial punishments, or even lose one’s life—all governed by the Three Officials, Five Emperors, Four Sages, and Two Dippers. By devoting oneself to this scripture, reciting incantations, burning incense, and presenting talismans, all adversities and calamities may be resolved.

The Exposition states: Among the Three Realms, humans are the most numinous. Yet if they fail to advance toward the higher path, even when stars and constellations contend and clash, and their conduct is beset by misfortune, they should swiftly devote themselves to the true scripture, and the Three Primes and Five Emperors shall dissolve their transgressions. This chapter instructs people to recognize taboos and seek expiation.

The Exegesis states: This refers to those whose five phases are inauspicious and whose Nine Luminaries are disturbed. All baleful stars and malevolent spirits are subject to the decrees of our Heavenly Worthy. Should anyone encounter such misfortunes, by reciting this scripture, the Heavenly Worthy shall command the Six Spirits of Destiny in their household to petition the Celestial Official to resolve celestial adversities, the Terrestrial Official to resolve terrestrial adversities, the Aquatic Official to resolve aquatic adversities, the Five Emperors to resolve adversities of the five directions, the Four Sages to resolve adversities of the four seasons, the Southern Asterism to resolve adversities of one’s original destiny, and the Northern Dipper to resolve all adversities. For these Three Officials, Five Emperors, Four Sages, Southern Asterism, and Northern Dipper are also the functionaries of the Heavenly Worthy. Thus, the term “petition” is used to make known the vast jurisdiction of the Heavenly Worthy’s administration.

The Eulogy proclaims:
The terrestrial net and celestial snare cannot be escaped;
When baleful stars descend, how can they be dispelled?
Recite with sincerity the name of the Heavenly Worthy,
And swiftly burn the jade script and golden talismans.

The Heavenly Worthy declares: “When one is bedridden with chronic illness, afflicted by grave maladies, their condition lingering unresolved, medical treatments ineffective, the five spirits ungoverned, and the four great elements unrestrained—whether before the Five Emperors and Three Officials, the sun, moon, and stars, the mountains, forests, grasses, and trees, the sacred altars and ancient sites, the city gods and earthly temples, the village wells and kitchen stoves, the monasteries, pagodas, and towers, or within the thirty-six hells of the underworld and the seventy-two bureaus of the nether officials—should any grievances or entanglements arise therefrom, they shall be bound and ensnared.”

Or by the curses and oaths they have invoked, or by the debts and burdens they have failed to repay. Grievances spanning three lifetimes, enmities arising from past kalpas—all such faults and offenses, all such confrontations and contentions, must be confessed and repented. Then recite this scripture.

Annotation: For chronic and lingering illnesses that confine one to bed, where medicine and prayers prove ineffective, this is because the Three Officials and Five Emperors, Mount Tai and the sacred peaks, the sun, moon, and stars, the city gods and earthly temples, the village wells and kitchen stoves, the sacred altars and ancient sites, the monasteries, pagodas, and towers, the bureaus of the Five Paths, the nether officials of the underworld, and even the spirits of mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees—all may have been inadvertently offended. Or perhaps there are long-standing grievances, debts of wealth or life, curses from others, or broken vows and violated oaths, with enmities and grudges accumulated over countless kalpas. One must repent, openly confess one’s transgressions, recite the scripture and incantations, and burn these talismanic writings to achieve full recovery.

Exegesis: This chapter specifically addresses the accumulation of illness and the conflicts arising from taboos. By invoking the name of the Heavenly Worthy, misfortune departs and blessings arrive—why doubt this?

Commentary: When one is afflicted with chronic illness that no worldly medicine can cure, and when malevolent spirits stir trouble—whether through self-inflicted curses, others’ maledictions, accumulated debts, or hidden transgressions—the underworld seeks to investigate and pursue the cause, to apprehend and confront the offender. How else may one be absolved? By reciting the precious scripture and burning the sacred talismans, peace and ease are restored at once.

Eulogy:
Yin’s retribution, yang’s transgressions—
Such plagues are but their recompense.
When taboos are violated,
Recite the scripture, pray the talismans.

The Heavenly Worthy declares: There are celestial talismans, terrestrial talismans, and talismans for each year, month, day, and hour. For every direction and orientation, there are corresponding talismans. Great offenses invoke official talismans, while minor ones provoke verbal disputes, governed by the spirits of the Red Mouth and White Tongue. In all actions and undertakings, in going out and staying in, if one fails to observe taboos and encounters these talismans or verbal spirits, one will be harassed incessantly, day and night tormented, lips and tongue embroiled. Flattery and slander arise, leading to lawsuits and punishments. To escape this, recite this scripture, and the disputes will silently dissipate, the talismans forever stilled.

Annotation: In this chapter, the Heavenly Worthy speaks of the spirits of official talismans, the Red Mouth, and the White Tongue—these are malevolent stars sent down by the celestial courts. Because worldly people fail to cultivate the true Way, defy public law, and profane thunder and rain, these spirits are dispatched to harass them. If one transgresses, recite this scripture at once and burn the talismans to dissolve the affliction in that very moment.

Exegesis: In human conduct, there are rights and wrongs, but one often fails to recognize the signs or grasp the principles. Should one transgress, this scripture can absolve it.

Commentary: The Heavenly Worthy’s vows are vast, and his transformations boundless. This chapter specifically addresses the talismanic spirits, for they are easily offended but difficult to appease. Should an ordinary person provoke them, the Red Mouth and White Tongue seize the opportunity to arise. Why do worldly people not recite the precious scripture and burn the jade talismans in advance, so that such misfortunes vanish of themselves?

Eulogy:
Celestial talismans, terrestrial talismans—
Mortals must not provoke them.
To dispel lawsuits and misfortune,
Recite the scripture, petition thrice with talismans.

*End of the Upper Volume of the Collected Annotations on the Jade Pivot Precious Scripture of the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Transformation Through the Thunder’s Resounding Voice*

*Beginning of the Lower Volume of the Collected Annotations on the Jade Pivot Precious Scripture of the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Transformation Through the Thunder’s Resounding Voice*

The Heavenly Worthy declares: The Nine Mounds of the Earth Sovereign are governed by one thousand two hundred spirits, including the Earth Lords, Earth Marshals, Earth Lords and Ladies, Earth Children and Grandchildren, and their entire earthly retinue. Among them are the Year Star, the General Star, the Crane Spirit, Venus, the Nine Auspicious Stars, the Sword Blade, the Male and Female Stars, the Metal Spirit, the Fire and Blood Spirits, the Yellow Body, the Life-Striker, the Three Sha, the Seven Sha, the Yellow Banner and Leopard Tail, the Flying Edge and Execution Block—such are the earthly spirits and malevolent stars. Should one undertake construction or divination and inadvertently offend them, illness, misfortune, and even death may follow. But upon reciting this scripture, all spirits rise in response, and there shall be no taboos in heaven, no taboos on earth, no taboos in yin and yang, and no prohibitions whatsoever.

Annotation: Whenever one undertakes construction or begins a project, one may unwittingly offend these spirits and malevolent stars, bringing immediate calamity. At worst, it leads to death; at best, lawsuits and disputes. How can one not be cautious? By following the rituals, inscribing the talismans, reciting the scripture, and offering prayers, all taboos are lifted.

Exegesis: The Heavenly Worthy cherishes all living beings to such an extent. It is said that we live upon the earth and return to the earth in death, yet few realize how profoundly the earth can harm. For the earth prefers stillness and resists disturbance.

Commentary: Heaven covers the earth—who does not know this? Yet our Heavenly Worthy, as the supreme lord of the Nine Heavens, governs the Three Realms. The Nine Mounds’ Sovereign, his spring retinue, and his many malevolent ministers inflict grave harm upon humanity. The Heavenly Worthy employs the jade script and precious talismans to suppress and dispel them, ensuring that all—from the wise to the foolish—may act without taboos.

Eulogy:
All things arise from earth,
And inadvertent offense brings disaster.
Were it not for the power of the true scripture of Universal Transformation,
Everywhere would be heaps of white bones.

The Heavenly Worthy declares: When worldly men and women marry, they may offend the Salty Pond, the Heavenly Dog, the Three Punishments, the Six Harms, the intersecting angles, the solitary yin and solitary yang, the Heavenly Net and Earthly Snare, leading to difficulties in bearing children and a life of solitude. If one seeks a son, recite this scripture, and the Great Spirit of the Nine Heavens who oversees birth will summon the spirits and command the winds, bringing forth a worthy child. At the time of birth, the Great Unity stands at the door, and the Controller of Destinies waits in the courtyard.

Should grievances, grudges, malevolent spirits, or taboos arise—should ill fortune or calamity strike—causing difficult labor, recite this scripture, and the Nine Heavens’ Guardians of the Chamber will attend, while the Holy Mother silently assists in delivery, ensuring the birth is joyous and the labor free from peril.

For infants in swaddling, tormented by the fifteen kinds of ghosts under the Sandalwood Spirit-King, afflicted with fright and convulsions, this scripture should be recited.

**Annotation:** In marriage and childbirth, all mortals contend with spirit perils. Unaware of directions, heedless of the Grand Year-Star, they may inadvertently offend—such transgressions bear grave consequences. Hasten to recite the scripture and burn talismans to avert misfortune, and peace and prosperity will follow.

**Exegesis:** Fortune and misfortune stand as two paths, ever intertwined. Should discord or barrenness arise, invoke the Heavenly Worthy’s name but once, and all shall dissolve of itself.

**Exposition:** This chapter binds mortal marriage and progeny to the Heavenly Worthy’s dominion. The begetting, betrothal, and rearing of children are no trifling matters. Yet worldly custom, blind to such truths, stumbles into private miscalculations—errors manifold. Should offense occur, husband north and wife south, children will come only with great difficulty. Recite the precious scripture and burn sacred talismans to dispel it, and naturally husband and wife will harmonize, their descendants flourishing.

**Eulogy:**
Marriage is the bond of human relations,
Sons and daughters the love of flesh and bone.
To make the household thrive in accord,
Revere the Jade Pivot’s text.

The Heavenly Worthy declares: Where men dwell, crows and rats deliver omens, serpents and insects sow corruption, bricks and tiles are hurled, chickens startled, dogs provoked, and offerings demanded—even spectral coercion and dream oppression, or worse, theft and debauchery. Should such spirits dare claim a dwelling as their lair, the living will be bewildered. The courtyard and home grow unclean; by night, wailing echoes in the rafters; by day, unseen eyes peer into the chamber. Cattle, horses, dogs, and swine suffer pestilence; calamity clings to kin, disaster befalls livestock. Lewd shrines and heretical altars shelter wicked spirits, while mourners arrive in droves and funeral biers depart in succession. Recite this scripture, and instantly ghostly essences vanish, men and creatures alike find peace.

**Annotation:** Such households, scorning moral principles and the Dao of proper conduct, defy the gods of Heaven and Earth. Their mouths reek of foul meat and rank flesh; their bodies tread paths of lust and slaughter. They flout public law, pursuing only private gain, unleashing venom and violence, indulging every vice. Thus do they provoke the envy of ghosts and the wrath of spirits, summoning malevolent forces. Yet should they repent, confess their faults, recite the scripture, and burn talismans, misfortune will cease, and all will dwell in tranquility.

**Exegesis:** When walls crumble, thieves enter; when karma weighs heavy, ghosts arrive, bringing disaster to livestock and misfortune to household spirits. The Heavenly Worthy, not dismissing even minor transgressions, extends great mercy—recite the scripture often, and calamity will halt.

**Exposition:** When the upright qi is as vast as Heaven, no demon dares encroach. Yet mortals, mismanaging their households, offend the divine intelligence, driving away the Six Spirits, allowing perverse qi to seize the moment. Rat spirits and serpent specters hurl objects and sow chaos; blood-yin strikes without warning, even tainting household members—such perils defy prediction. Or thieves may pilfer goods, shifting things from east to west—all of this kind. Thus do mourners and death-portents run rampant, spirits emboldened to act as they please. Recite the precious scripture and burn jade talismans, and both people and creatures will find peace.

**Eulogy:**
When one does evil, evil arises;
When one acts with virtue, Heaven acts in kind.
Should mortals face such trials,
Inscribe sacred talismans and recite the precious scripture.

The Heavenly Worthy says: The Nine Heavens’ Thunder Duke Generals, the Five Directions’ Thunder Duke Generals, the Eight Directions’ Cloud-Thunder Generals, the Five Directions’ Barbarian Thunder Envoys, the Thunder Department’s Marshal Commanders, the Deceptive Illusion Judges—all issue commands swift as wind and fire. Where there are temples to strike, altars to smite, demons to purge, or malevolent forces to banish, they act. In this degenerate age of declining Dharma, many are the shamans and sorcerers; perverse arts spread, and yin forces freely cast their curses.

Thus, in the Supreme Clarity, there stands the Celestial Court for Binding Ghosts and Registering the Wicked, the Imperial Chamber for Restraining Demons and Interrogating the Perverse. Those who recite this scripture shall find their prayers answered as swiftly as an echo.

**Annotation:** Among the twenty-one sections of this scripture, all are the words of the Heavenly Worthy, yet only this chapter begins with "The Heavenly Worthy says." This is because it extols the Thunder Duke Generals, Envoys, and Judges, who issue commands and manifest their awe-inspiring virtue in instant response. Thus, it does not speak directly.

The followers of shamans and sorcerers, devoted to perverse arts, recklessly fabricate demonic words, casting curses to sunder husbands and wives, or employing bewitchments to entice women into illicit unions. When such malevolent sorcerers are encountered, recite the precious scripture and burn the sacred talismans, and the Thunder Bureau shall eradicate them, meting out retribution as swiftly as an echo, so that people may find peace.

**Exegesis:** Heaven and Earth are impartial, aiding only those of virtue. The retribution for good and evil moves as swiftly as shadow and echo. Those who cultivate the Dao, embodying the heart of Heaven and illuminating their own hearts, shall see misfortunes dispelled and blessings and prosperity arrive.

**Commentary:** This chapter is the Heavenly Worthy’s own praise of the Thunder Bureau’s sagacity. For this reason, it slays ghosts, severs evil, summons clouds, and brings rain—all by the Heavenly Worthy’s command, enacted below. Yet in this age, the sacred and the profane are often indistinguishable. Some employ unorthodox arts to corrupt human relations and violate the law. Recite this precious scripture and burn the talismans, and the response shall be as swift as an echo. How can one not revere and fear this?

**Eulogy:**
The Thunder Bureau discerns good and evil,
Uprooting evil and rescuing the good,
Ever eradicating perverse arts that bring harm.
Recite the Jade Pivot often.

The Heavenly Worthy says:
Heavenly pestilences, earthly pestilences—twenty-five in all.
Heavenly gu, earthly gu—twenty-four in all.
Heavenly consumptive afflictions, earthly consumptive afflictions—thirty-six in all.
Those who recite this scripture shall find pestilences purified,
gu poisons dissolved,
and consumptive afflictions healed.

There are reasons for these afflictions:
Some arise from the lingering influence of the long-dead,
or from the residual qi of corpses,
or from lawsuits over graves and tomb curses,
or from the contamination of dead spirits,
or from the summoning by corpse qi.
All such ghosts and spirits—whether moved by sorrow,
or bound by resentment and entanglement—
cast their baleful influence like arrows.
Seizing every opportunity, they strike when least expected.

Thus this scripture reaches upward to the Three Heavens and penetrates downward to the Nine Springs. It can summon and deliver the wandering souls, transcend and ferry the ancestral generations, for the Most High dispatches the Great General of the White Chariot and White Horses to oversee the rite.

Annotation states: All who suffer from pestilences, gu, or consumptive afflictions have brought them upon themselves—so severe that entire households may perish, and six relations be entangled. Yet if one recites the scripture with sincere devotion and burns the talismanic writs, the Thunder Bureau shall dispatch the generals of the White Chariot and White Horses to extricate them, sparing them from this suffering.

Exposition states: Pestilences, gu, and healing afflictions have their origins. But if one purifies the heart, maintains personal purity, recites the true scripture, and pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy, one shall not fall prey to this suffering.

Exegesis states: Pestilence arises from impure qi, gu from shadowless worms, and consumptive afflictions from hard-to-cure illnesses. Why does the Heavenly Worthy speak of these three? They too have their origins—stemming from lingering connections and contagion, corpse qi and mutual defilement, or tomb lawsuits and spectral summons. Lingering connections are humanity’s great calamity; the world does not know how to perform exorcisms, hence entire families perish. Tomb lawsuits are the governance of the seven ancestral generations’ grievances. Corpse qi arises from ancient coffins in the earth, which transform into tiny insects that may fly into food or fall into vessels; when consumed, they cause gu. When moving residences, one should recite the scripture and burn talismans to eradicate them.

Eulogy states: The great suffering of heaven-and-earth’s pestilences, gu, and consumptive afflictions has its causes, yet it is also self-inflicted.

If one recites the Mysterious Writ, one may rescue the seven ancestral generations, and the White Horse General will act as their protector.

The Heavenly Worthy states: Should one prepare for a distant journey, bandits and thieves may scheme, and the five weapons bring harm. On land, tigers, wolves, mountain spirits, and venomous creatures sharpen their fangs; on water, dragons and alligators gape their jaws. One may encounter the grievances of wronged souls or the predestined trials of wind and waves. The departed may seize the living to replace the dead. Yet if one surrenders body and heart to this scripture, one shall traverse land and water in peace, and all undertakings shall be auspicious.

Annotation states: When traveling by land, one may meet bandits or armed conflict, or encounter serpents, tigers, or malevolent mountain spirits. When traveling by water, one may face dragons, turtles, or alligators stirring waves and winds, or lost souls seeking substitutes. One may suffer predestined trials or be cast adrift in distant lands. Always prepare talismans to guard against these perils; they may be burned in water or fire, or one may urgently recite the sacred name to instantly avert all calamities.

Exegesis states: In all movements and stillness, one must be cautious and vigilant. If one has long upheld this scripture, how could such misfortunes arise?

Exposition states: In all actions and repose, one must be prudent. For fortune and misfortune, clarity and obscurity arise from movement. Thus, in every movement, only one outcome is auspicious—the other three are not. How can one not be careful? Before embarking on a journey, one must first recite the sacred scripture and wear its talismans; then all shall be auspicious.

Eulogy states: Travel by land and water is inescapable in this world; ghosts and spirits secretly plot harm. Yet with a single invocation of the Universal Transformation Heavenly Worthy’s name and the wearing of the True King’s Jade Talisman, all shall be well.

The Heavenly Worthy states: When scorching yang prevails and rain is delayed, prostrate yourself before this scripture, and timely sweet rains shall fall. When excessive yin rages and floods overflow, prostrate yourself before this scripture, and skies shall clear. When the Fire God fans disaster and flames engulf homes, when red rats roam the city and the people suffer from heat, this scripture may be used to exorcise them. When the Sea God loses control and fish and turtles wander recklessly, when floods rise to the heavens and the people drown, this scripture may be used to halt them.

Annotation states: This chapter reveals the Heavenly Worthy’s deep compassion for all beings. Prolonged drought or excessive rain arise from the disharmony of heaven and earth’s qi, and the people’s karmic burdens remain unresolved. Thus, the Three Realms grow wrathful: floods and landslides occur, the Fire God fans disaster, red rats stir chaos, and the people know no peace. In such times, one should recite this scripture and burn its talismans; then rain and sunshine shall be timely, and the people shall be at peace.

Exegesis states: When yin and yang lose their rhythm, as in droughts or floods, it stems from the decrees of the celestial bureaus. For the qi of evil karma does not dissipate, and the true Dao is not revered. The Heavenly Worthy, in turning the wheel of creation, nurtures all beings with a heart of boundless life—how can this not be praised?

Exposition states: Clear skies and storms are no small matters. They concern the celestial courts above and the grotto-heavens below, and arise from the disharmony of the two qi. In times of flood or drought, the devout should establish a ritual altar, recite the numinous writ, and burn the jade talismans; then droughts shall yield rain, and rains shall yield sunshine.

Eulogy states: Floods and droughts are disasters that shake heaven and earth. Yet with sincere recitation of the scripture, skies shall clear, and sweet rains shall fall.

The Heavenly Worthy states: Should one wish to avoid the calamities of the three disasters and nine misfortunes, one must prostrate oneself toward the Northern Asterism on a quiet night. Above the Northern Asterism lie the Three Terraces, their stars aligned like paired eyes, stacked in three tiers to cover the Dipper’s bowl—this is called the Celestial Stairway. Whoever beholds them shall be free from imprisonment in life and the sufferings of drowning in death. Within the Dipper resides the August Emperor, two stars as large as chariot wheels. Whoever beholds them shall preserve their form in the world and attain long life as an immortal. Surrendering to this scripture and offering one’s heart to the Northern Culmen shall evoke a response from the unseen.

Annotation states: The Northern Asterism is the North Star. Among the five asterisms, it is the Emperor’s Seat, ever unmoving while all other stars revolve around it. The Northern Dipper resides at heaven’s center, serving as its pivot, turning the four seasons. All matters of heaven and earth, sun and moon, the five planets, the stellar arrays, the six jia, the twenty-eight lodgings, the host of immortals and perfected beings, and the people of the lower realm—from the Son of Heaven to the common folk—whether concerning longevity, wealth, life, death, fortune, misfortune, or the affairs of the unseen, all fall under the Northern Dipper’s governance. The Most High transmitted to Heavenly Master Zhang the *Northern Dipper Scripture’s Oral Instructions*. In times of peril, one should urgently petition the Northern Dipper, pay homage to the True Lord of one’s life-star, and thereby attain peace and safety. One may also attain the Three Terraces’ life-giving, nurturing, and protective blessings. The Three Terraces consist of six stars: the Upper, Middle, and Lower Terraces. The Celestial Stairway is the path by which the Most High ascends and descends, spanning the second star of the Northern Dipper. The Upper Terrace is *Xu Jing*, the Middle Terrace *Liu Chun*, and the Lower Terrace *Qu Sheng*—these are the stars’ inner names. Knowing the stars’ names dispels all evils and brings all virtues to fulfillment. Beholding their forms ensures freedom from imprisonment in life and all sufferings in death. In a quiet chamber, sit upright and visualize the Three Terraces above your head. Then visualize the qi of your two kidneys rising from your chest to connect with the Three Terraces. After prolonged visualization, tap your teeth fourteen times, exhale gently through your nose, close your mouth, and swallow fully. Then recite the incantation:

*"Joint by joint, flourishing and glorious,
I beseech long life.
Great Mysterious Three Terraces,
Ever cover my form.
In all goings and comings,
May the myriad spirits escort my glory."*

After five years of pacing the stars, the immortal bones naturally form. After seven years, all elixirs become refined. After ten years, one ascends to the Celestial Court. *Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances.*

One may kowtow in reverent gaze and worship, and all affairs will come to fruition.

Moreover, the Northern Dipper is the spirit and essence of yin and yang. Its radiance illuminates the nine Dao, its light shades the ten heavens—seven manifest, two concealed. Ordinary people see only the seven stars and not the two honorable imperial stars. These two stars are the *Fuxi* and *Bixie*, the August Morning Lords, the majestic spirits of Heaven’s hun-soul and Earth’s po-soul. The *Fu* star governs Heaven and is called *Chang*. The *Bi* star governs Earth and is called *Kong*. *Kong* is the hun-essence of the nine heavens; *Chang* is the po-spirit of the nine earths. When Heaven rests and Earth is at peace, *Kong* and *Chang* remain hidden. When Heaven is in turmoil and Earth is roused, *Kong* and *Chang* shine brilliantly. They transform the myriad qi, alter yin and yang, and govern the succession of the four seasons—nothing occurs without their agency.

These two stars are supremely noble, concealed at dawn’s splendor. Even the nine heavens guard their numinous sounds, keeping them from the world. Only those who attain the Dao—lofty immortals and noble perfected beings—may behold them. Those who pursue fame, chase profit, or wallow in the filth of the vulgar world are not illuminated by their starlight and can scarcely glimpse them. In the past, there have been those who mistakenly saw them. If common folk today mistakenly see them, they must not speak of it. To reveal it is to invite the scourge of war and fire, to suddenly take form and suffer in the earth-prisons of hell, and to bring suffering upon their parents in life and death before the Three Officials.

The method of reverent gazing is as follows: On the third and twenty-seventh nights of each month, without others knowing, secretly go to the central courtyard, burn incense, perform rites, and recite the incantation:

*"Honorable Imperial Two Stars,
Numinous spirits of the Northern Culmen,
May your servant soon behold you,
And upon seeing, attain long life.
Boundless fortune and blessing,
Heaven grants enduring years."*

Sincerely recite this scripture again and again, and in silence, resonance will arise. With time, you will naturally behold them. Yet you must not reveal the name of the Celestial Pivot star, which lies within the Dipper’s hub, its form opposite the *Breaker of Armies* star. This star is slightly larger and reddish. In each double-hour, it follows the Dipper’s handle to illuminate one of the twelve earthly branches, ceaselessly revolving without pause. As the scripture says: *"Where the Celestial Pivot points, day and night it ever turns."*

Thunder’s city is arrayed according to the twelve earthly branches, with twelve gates. When thunder desires to sound, it follows the Celestial Pivot, and the gate toward which it points at that hour is where the sound issues forth. For example, if the Celestial Pivot rests in the *wei* position, pointing toward the *chou* palace, why then does fortune or misfortune arise? The Celestial Pivot is the upright qi—it can give life or take it. Where it points is the life direction, and thus there is life qi. Harnessing it can cure illness, replenish deficiency, calm the spirit, invigorate qi, avert misfortune, dispel calamity, prolong life, and deliver from peril. Where it resides, there is killing qi. Using it can decapitate ghosts, expel demons, suppress violence, restrain brutality, sever poison, and subdue malevolent spirits. Thus, where it points is auspicious; where it resides is inauspicious.

In principle: The nine luminaries and Three Terraces are the sovereigns of the body and the pivot of the myriad phenomena. Scholars should worship and petition them according to the method, and there will be no lack of response.

An explanation: The Three Terrace stars are to be revered and exalted. As for the two honorable imperial stars within the Dipper, what are they? They are the hun-soul of Heaven and the po-soul of Earth, the pivot of creation. Yet Daoist practitioners only know the sincerity of worshipping the perfected and paying homage to the Dipper, without understanding the swift path to gazing upon the two honorable imperial stars. There is also the Celestial Pivot star behind the Northern Dipper, which follows the opening of the thunder gates to point to the twelve gates corresponding to the twelve double-hours. The scriptural meaning is clear: where it points is auspicious; where it resides is inauspicious—that is, the thunder gates. Scholars who wish to pay homage to the Dipper and gaze upon the stars will find the method in the annotations. Beholding them ensures longevity and profound fortune.

An ode:
*The mysteries of the Dark Gate are said to be profound.
When merit and conduct are complete, one pays homage to the nine luminaries.*

The Heavenly Worthy said: In this age of decline, the Dao is faint, and people lack virtue. They are disloyal to their sovereigns, unfilial to their parents, disrespectful to their teachers and elders, unkind to their siblings, unfaithful to their spouses, unrighteous to their friends, unawed by Heaven and Earth, unheeding of the gods, irreverent toward the Three Luminaries, and careless with the Five Grains. They possess three bodily and four oral transgressions: using large scales and small measures, killing living beings and harming lives—one hundred for others, a thousand for themselves—engaging in licentiousness, deceit, rebellion, and treachery. From minor to grave, the Three Officials wield their brushes, the Great Unity sends forth documents, and they are handed over to the Bureau of Five Thunders for execution and investigation. First, their spirits are beheaded; then, their forms are examined. Beheading the spirit and executing the hun-soul leaves them in disarray. They become despised, shunned, resented, and hated by others, until their forms are examined and their corpses shattered, leaving them in ruins. They are driven into rolling waters, forced to pull carts, their monthly orifices inspected every ten days, and subjected to repeated torture.

If one hears this scripture, their sins are immediately erased. Should someone incur the wrath of thunder, their corpse cannot be lifted, and they are not received by water or fire. One should invoke the *Nine Heavens Responding to the Primordial, Thunder’s Voice, Universal Transformation Heavenly Worthy*, and recite this prayer: *"May the myriad spirits bow their heads and heed my command."*

An annotation: If a person commits an offense, they rightfully deserve execution—how could the Thunder Bureau of the Celestial Court strike them down one by one? Those who now suffer punishment by law, perish by the sword, drown in water, or die in fire—all these are deaths by misfortune. For people begin with minor wrongs and, failing to reform, accumulate them day by day and month by month, until they become grave transgressions. Once their sins are manifest and they still do not repent, the Three Officials and the Great Unity examine and record them, sending documents to the Five Thunders’ Bureau, which first beheads their spirits and hun-souls. When the appointed time arrives, the punishment is carried out, and their dead souls are then subjected to the Thunder Bureau’s driving, beating, and torture.

If one reforms, turns toward goodness, and surrenders to this scripture, their sins are immediately erased. If a man or woman incurs the wrath of thunder, and their headdress, hair, or beard is not singed, they may appeal to the Heavenly Worthy and seek divine judgment, for the myriad spirits will heed their command.

The Exposition states: The Three Bonds and Five Constants are principles immutable through the ages—how could one dare defy them with reckless conduct? Grain is the people’s life and the nation’s treasure—how could it not be cherished and protected? In recent times, shallowness prevails: loyalty and filial piety are abandoned, righteousness and benevolence forsaken. Extravagance is exalted while frugality is despised; morality is scorned while deceit is practiced. Such governance invites calamity upon calamity. Why not reflect? The Heavenly Worthy has graciously opened the great path—one should tread and follow it, and all evils shall cease to arise.

The Exegesis states: Born between Heaven and Earth, humans receive the two qi and embody the Five Constants. Walking the path of benevolence and righteousness, upholding loyalty and filial piety—why then indulge in reckless disregard for life and commit all manner of unprincipled acts? In grave cases, the Thunder Bureau vents its wrath, exposing corpses in the marketplace; in lesser ones, the courts impose punishment upon the body. Thus, goodness may be practiced, but evil must not be committed. The Thunder Bureau drives and enslaves the unrighteous, while those who cultivate virtue are naturally preserved and delivered. Should one invoke the name of the Heavenly Worthy, all spirits will bow and heed their command.

The Eulogy states:
Loyalty and filial piety form the foundation,
Yin and yang are my true home.
To dissolve all karmic misdeeds,
One need not recite the *Nanhua*.

The Heavenly Worthy declares: The merit of this scripture is inconceivable. In kalpas past, the Divine King of Jade Purity of the Divine Empyrean, the Great Emperor of Long Life, once proclaimed it. Those of noble virtue who transmit this scripture must offer gold and silk as tokens, swearing oaths to Heaven before passing it on.

The Thunder Master Haoxi, rising from his long prostration, reverently addressed the Heavenly Worthy: Wherever this scripture resides, the Earth Deities and Life Mandates shall guard and protect it, while the Thunder Bureau shall descend to inspect and examine in due time. If a household enshrines this scripture with utmost sincerity, auspicious mist will fill its courtyard, propitious clouds will shade its halls, misfortunes will not arise, and blessings will gather. Upon death, they shall not pass through hell. Why is this so? At death, they are reborn; in life, they return to the good Dao, inheriting the Heavenly Worthy’s power and attaining this spiritual efficacy. Carrying this scripture in daily life, all people will revere them, and ghosts and spirits will stand in awe. When encountering peril, wholeheartedly invoking the name of the Nine Heavens’ Responsive Primordial Thunder Voice Universal Transformation Heavenly Worthy will ensure deliverance from all dangers.

The Annotation states: The Heavenly Worthy, moved by great compassion, expounded this precious scripture to benefit the heavens above and deliver all beings below. Those of noble virtue who receive it must offer gold and silk as tokens to affirm their sincerity, swearing oaths to the Ten Heavens before transmission. The gold and silk serve only to bind the heart in oath to Heaven—quantity is not the measure. Though the offerings be modest, the covenant is weighty. The Great Sage does not withhold this scripture out of stinginess but fears that people might treat it lightly; thus, He earnestly instructs. The Thunder Master should command the Earth Deities and Life Mandates to guard and protect it everywhere. If one serves the Heavenly Worthy, reciting the scripture’s name with devotion, the divine perfected will descend to their courtyard, and auspicious clouds will swirl. Those who uphold the true teachings in life shall, in death, return to the good Dao. Further, if one transcribes this scripture according to the prescribed talismanic forms, carries it with utmost sincerity, no calamities will arise, and both humans and spirits will revere and stand in awe.

The Exposition states: The intent of this chapter is to inspire sincere faith without deceit. Later scholars and gentlemen should follow the scripture’s teachings, and they shall not err.

The Exegesis states: The Thunder Master Haoxi, bowing in reverence to the Heavenly Worthy’s supreme transformation, was overcome with joy. Rising from his long prostration, he again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: From this day forward, those of noble virtue who receive this scripture must pledge their hearts with gold and silk before transmitting its text. Wherever this scripture resides, the Earth Deities and Life Mandates shall guard and protect it, while the Thunder Bureau shall descend to inspect and examine in due time. Those who recite and uphold it shall bring blessings to their households and enable their ancestors to ascend. Those who carry it will be revered by all, feared by ghosts and spirits, and upon encountering danger, invoking the Heavenly Worthy’s name will ensure deliverance. Thus, the merit of this scripture is truly inconceivable.

The Eulogy states:
Not gold but a sincere heart is prized,
For the beginning adept, external demons assail.
If one is willing to swear oaths to Heaven and Earth,
Swiftly shall you hear the jade tones of the Dao.

Then the Thunder Master Haoxi, before the Heavenly Worthy, spoke this gatha:
Supreme Jade Purity King,
Ruler of the thirty-six heavens.
Nine Heavens’ Universal Transformation Lord,
Manifesting forms across the ten directions.
With unbound hair riding a qilin,
Barefoot treading layered ice.
Holding the qi of the Nine Heavens,
Whistling winds, lashing thunder.
With the power of wisdom,
Subduing all demonic spirits.
Delivering souls from eternal night,
Benefiting all beings.
Like the silver river’s waters,
A thousand eyes, a thousand moon wheels.
Vowing in future kalpas,
To eternally exalt the Heavenly Worthy’s reverence.

When the Thunder Master Haoxi finished this gatha,

The Annotation states: In this chapter, the Thunder Master Haoxi, suddenly enlightened, spoke this gatha to extol even a fraction of the Heavenly Worthy’s great virtue of cherishing life. Its literary grace flows brightly, its language resplendent—its merit and power defy description.

The Exposition states: The virtue of the Heavenly Worthy is beyond comprehension; thus, the Thunder Master Haoxi likened it to the Silver River. He spoke of the Heavenly Worthy’s primordial qi as supremely pure, noble, sagely, and luminous.

The Exegesis states: The Thunder Master Haoxi, his heart humbled by the divine efficacy, could find no words of praise sufficient. Thus, he composed this gatha. Our Heavenly Worthy, sovereign of the thirty-six heavens, transforms the vastness of the ten directions. When traversing the heavens, He rides a qilin with unbound indigo hair. When breaking through the Nine Springs, He treads layered ice with bare feet. "Holding the qi of the Nine Heavens" refers to the golden radiance of His ruyi scepter. Whistling winds and lashing thunder are the Heavenly Worthy’s commands. Slaying demons, expelling evil, delivering beings, and benefiting humanity—this is the Heavenly Worthy’s work of benefiting all beings. The waters of the Silver River are unseen by mortals, unfathomable in their mystery. "A thousand eyes, a thousand moon wheels" means that those who return to the teachings shall feel as though the Heavenly Worthy is ever before them.

Vowing with boundless resolve, they shall forever propagate the teachings of the Heavenly Worthy.

Praise:
We extol the Heavenly Worthy—truly, this gatha is sincere.
Universally transforming without limit, from the primordial kalpas, one qi.

The Heavenly Worthy declares: This scripture has been transmitted through the world, yet mortals remain unaware. Now, the Nine Heavens’ Responding-to-the-Primordial Palace, which I govern, is served by the Nine Heavens’ Thunder Gate Envoys, assisted by the Recorders of Slanted Records and the Inspectors of Integrity. There are also four bureaus: the first is the Bureau of Surplus Seizures, the second the Bureau of Accumulated Arrests, the third the Bureau of Hidden Grievances, and the fourth the Bureau of Karmic Retribution. Each is overseen by a Grand Minister to manage its affairs. All whom I govern—ministers, masters, and envoys—all praise the primordial transformation.

Annotation:
The Heavenly Worthy speaks of the officials, soldiers, generals, and scribes under His governance, assigning each to their duties of good and evil. Thus, the pivot of life and death lies entirely in the Heavenly Worthy’s commands; the myriad spirits of the Three Realms all obey without exception.

Exegesis:
This chapter reveals that the Heavenly Worthy assigns each good and evil deed to its respective office, all of which praise and fulfill the primordial transformation.

Exposition:
This chapter concludes the scripture’s discourse, anticipating that later scholars may not know the offices under the Heavenly Worthy’s governance. Thus, they are listed here. For all prayers and petitions, the officials, officers, generals, and soldiers, upon hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s commands, all praise and fulfill the primordial transformation.

Praise:
Offices established, duties divided to wield thunder and lightning,
Wind and fire soar, commands resound with clarity.
Rewarding good and punishing evil as swiftly as shadow follows form—
The Nine Heavens’ Primordial never bends to mortal whim.

When the Heavenly Worthy finished expounding this scripture, a seven-jeweled jade terrace of layered tiers appeared, celestial blossoms scattered in profusion, and fragrant jade incense curled in the air. The Heavenly Sovereigns of the ten directions all proclaimed, "Excellent indeed!" The dragon deities, ghostly spirits, thunder officials, and the myriad beings of the Three Realms all rejoiced greatly, faithfully receiving and upholding the teachings.

Annotation:
Once the scripture was expounded, the Heavenly Sovereigns and thunder officials, along with all ghostly spirits, praised it with exultation before departing. All of like mind—devout believers and virtuous people—who encounter this precious scripture should purify their hearts and cleanse their thoughts, reciting the true text with utmost sincerity. Thus, calamities shall not arise, and eternal longevity shall be preserved.

Exegesis:
Proclaiming the scripture and praising the transformation, the Three Realms and ten directions all attain their desires. Scholars who encounter this precious scripture and jade talismans should purify their hearts, cleanse their thoughts, offer water and flowers, and recite and inscribe them according to the proper method. Then, no misfortunes shall arise, and all virtues shall converge.

Now, those of noble intent align their hearts with Heaven’s will, purify their own minds, peruse the true text, and compose the mysterious script. How can they not devote themselves wholeheartedly to upholding it, thereby magnifying its transformation?

Exposition:
This precious scripture and jade talismans could not have been bestowed upon the world to transform sentient beings without the decree of the Three Pure Realms’ supreme境 and the command of the Jade Pure True King. Now, the scripture’s purport has been collated and corrected, its annotations made clear; the jade talismans and golden chapters shine brilliantly. How can those who seek divine aid not purify their hearts and cleanse themselves to study the mysterious script?

The noble adept, Dao-ling, holds the office of Capital Merit, serving in the Left Academy. Employing his own spirit and primordial qi, he binds them into radiant accomplishment. On this day, the Heavenly Worthy’s virtue of universal transformation is perfected in scripture, arrayed to the left of the sagely and true. Those who recite this scripture must not treat it with irreverence—great offenses invite heavenly punishment, while lesser ones bring misfortune.

Praise:
The precious scripture is complete—all proclaim, "Excellent indeed!"
Disasters are dispelled, sins absolved; misfortunes depart, blessings arrive.
The *Jade Pivot Precious Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Responding-to-the-Primordial, Thunder Voice, Universal Transformation Heavenly Worthy*, with Collected Annotations, concludes here.

Perfect and Auspicious Mystic Chapter:
From the outset of reciting the scripture, thought after thought, maintain sincerity.
A thousand truths bow in attendance; ten thousand sages commune in spirit.
Responding to the Primordial, merging with the formless,
The Nine Heavens issue their decree; the Three Realms comply.
Dispelling disasters, repenting transgressions,
Praying for blessings, prolonging life.
When merit is complete and conduct fulfilled,
The Great Dao bears witness.

Talismans:
Whenever inscribing a talisman, one should burn incense and arouse profound reverence, reciting with utmost sincerity from the beginning of the main scripture through the three chapters, including the chapter for one’s petition. Then, visualize the Heavenly Worthy’s precious form, recite the Heavenly Sovereign’s divine incantation, and inscribe it. At all times, protect the talisman with yellow paper. When using it, unfold it accordingly. The same applies to all subsequent talismanic texts.

Continuation of Marriage Talismans:
Whenever infants are in swaddling clothes, they may be afflicted by the fifteen kinds of ghosts under the Sandalwood Spirit King, causing frequent convulsions. It is fitting to recite this scripture.

According to the *Sutra for Protecting All Children* in the Buddhist Canon, the Sandalwood Spirit King’s fifteen ghostly forms roam the world, terrifying infants and young children with various frightening appearances. Those who sincerely recite the scripture and burn the talisman shall avoid this calamity.

First: The Mijiuqia Ghost, shaped like an ox, possessing children and causing their eyes to roll.
Second: The Mijiawang Ghost, shaped like a lion, possessing children and causing repeated vomiting.
Third: The Qiantuo, shaped like the Kumāra Deva, frightening children and making their shoulders twitch.
Fourth: The Aboximoluo, shaped like a wild fox, possessing children and causing foam to issue from their mouths.

Fifth: The Muzhijia, shaped like a macaque, possessing children and causing their fists to clench without release.
Sixth: The Mozhijia, shaped like a rākṣasī woman, possessing children and causing them to bite their own tongues.
Seventh: The Yanmijia, shaped like a horse, possessing children and making them prone to weeping and laughter.
Eighth: The Jiamini, shaped like a woman, possessing children and causing them to delight in women.
Ninth: The Libodi, shaped like a dog, possessing children and manifesting various miscellaneous forms.
Tenth: The Fuduna, shaped like a boar, possessing children and causing them to startle in fright and weep while asleep.
Eleventh: The Mandonanti, shaped like a cat, possessing children and making them prone to weeping and laughter in their sleep.
Twelfth: The Shejiuni, shaped like a crow, possessing children and causing them to refuse milk.
Thirteenth: The Jianzhaboni, shaped like a chicken, possessing children and causing their throats to become obstructed.
Fourteenth: The Muqumancha, shaped like a black fox, possessing children and afflicting them with seasonal febrile illnesses and dysentery.
Fifteenth: The Lanpo, shaped like a snake, possessing children and causing them to hiccup and cry out repeatedly.

The *Thunder and Lightning Jade Scripture* encountered by Master Xuanyang is thus in its entirety, and thus it must have its origins. Rather than keeping it secret, he has now resolved to print and disseminate it widely, demonstrating his profound aspiration to benefit others. Though I have not met the man, I have already come to know his heart, and I recognize that he is no ordinary person.

Yet the supreme Dao is wordless, and the most profound teachings leave no trace. Their spiritual illumination and clarity depend upon the individual. You have already gained insight through written words, but by extending this effort, you may yet attain understanding beyond them. Far better that others should call you one who clings to mere images and texts—this is my deepest hope for you. Strive onward.

Written on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month in the *guiyou* year of the Zhishun era, by the thirty-ninth-generation Celestial Master, Taixuanzi.
