**Essential Secrets of the *True Treasury Sutra***

Long ago, there were five destitute scholars who harbored arrogance and disdained the sutras and teachings. They closed the gates of the Three Treasures, disbelieving that:
- sentient beings possess the true nature of the Dao,
- sentient beings possess the wondrous Dharma of the sutras,
- sentient beings attain the extinction of the self in quiescence,
- sentient beings are equal in the Great Vehicle,
- sentient beings are neither born nor perish,
- the minds of sentient beings are like the great ocean,
- sentient beings walk the path of the Heavenly Worthy,
- sentient beings constitute the great assembly of emptiness.

Through such disbelief, they fell gravely ill. In life, they entered the dark prison; in death, they entered the dark prison; in walking, they entered the dark prison; in standing, they entered the dark prison; in sitting, they entered the dark prison; in lying down, they entered the dark prison; in eating, they entered the dark prison; in resting, they entered the dark prison.

All good men and women, each must reflect deeply and never harbor disbelief. If one fails to comprehend, one may still cultivate a sincere heart, refrain from slander, and thereby accumulate vast and boundless merit.

Why is this so? Because the Dharma has no form, the Dharma has no fixed nature, the Dharma is liberation itself. Know that the sincere heart is itself the Dao-field—free from clinging to all dharmas, one enters wondrous quiescence; free from clinging to birth and death, one enters the jeweled marks; free from clinging to grasping and rejecting, one enters all wisdom; free from clinging to anger and delusion, one enters all liberation; free from clinging to greed and desire, one enters all Dharma-treasures; free from clinging to right and wrong, one enters all true paths; free from clinging to sound and form, one enters all fields of merit; free from clinging to the six senses, one enters all that is untainted; free from clinging to the five aggregates, one enters great wisdom; free from clinging to the four elements, one enters all divine powers.

This Dharma is subtle and wondrous—even after kalpas of explanation, it cannot be exhausted. Yet if there be those of quick understanding, a mere half-word suffices to truly realize the Great Vehicle and comprehend the supreme Way. If one can believe with the heart, receive and uphold it, skillfully forget the spirit, and wash away the filth of the mind, the merit will be vast and boundless, beyond all conception.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Without departing from body and mind, one attains liberation. Those who attain liberation dwell in the quiescent Dao-field, enter the seal of the true Dharma, realize the causes of the three times, and accomplish the supreme fruit. All sentient beings—mind-nature is liberated, bodily form is liberated. The mind becomes verbal teaching, the body becomes written scripture. To follow the words and pursue the characters is to forget the traces of the teaching. Awakening to these words, one enters the gate of liberation and realizes the supreme Way.

The Youth of Auspicious Sound addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "I do not yet understand—how is the mind of sentient beings verbal teaching, and the body written scripture? The mind of sentient beings is a deluded mind, the body is a net of darkness. How can sentient beings study this deluded mind and seek this net of darkness to attain the Way? The deluded mind of sentient beings does not know what to study to attain the Way, and those who do not study cannot attain the Way. If one studies the deluded mind, one still cannot attain the Way. Why is this? To study delusion with delusion, the nature of delusion does not arise—how can one attain the Way? The deluded mind of sentient beings, deluded, does not know what to study, and studying, cannot attain the Way. It is like fire within wood—fire does not arise by itself but must be kindled by another before it can be obtained. The deluded mind of sentient beings must rely on a guiding teacher to attain awakening and understanding. I pray you explain this."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "All dharmas are pure, neither born nor extinguished. How then can there be sentient beings who attain the Way? How can there be sentient beings who lose the Way? How can there be sentient beings enmeshed in the net of delusion who study and attain the Way? How can there be a deluded mind that, without study, attains the Way? Dharmas have no inherent nature, ultimately no self. Why do you raise such distinctions among sentient beings? The scriptures I speak are apart from nature—this is not nature’s liberation. It is a skillful means to guide and enable recognition of the scriptures. Apart from nature—this is the liberation of Dharma-nature. It is a skillful means to guide and enable recognition of the true sound. Those who realize the Dharma-sound realize that there is no Dharma to realize, no Dharma to cultivate, no Dharma to study, no Dharma to attain, no Dharma to receive—ultimately pure, merged into oneness, not one.

When the beings of the Two Vehicles hear these words, they are startled, alarmed, and terrified, with no place to stand. Then the assembly of the Dharma-sound suddenly awakens, comprehends the Great Vehicle’s teaching, and realizes equality without duality. Bowing in reverence, they forget their forms and depart.

All sentient beings cling to conditioned existence, delighting in life and fearing death. Though they seek life, they create the karma of death and do not uphold the precepts. Though they may live long, they are like old trees—what difference is there? Those who uphold the precepts, at death, ascend to the heavenly offices and become immortals, free and at ease. Though one may hold the position of emperor or the three highest ministers, if one upholds the precepts, at death one ascends as an immortal, free and joyful. Of all things under heaven, none are everlasting—only the Dao and virtue are neither born nor extinguished.

All sentient beings arise from the Dao and perish in the Dao; all karmic conditions are threaded through a single gate. It is like a mother giving birth to a child—though the child harbors ingratitude, abandons its mother, and commits sins in all directions, ensnared in nets, the mother’s thoughts of longing tear at her bowels, yet the child remains unaware, suffering pain and agony. Sentient beings, inverted and deluded, have lost their root—it is just like this.

The profound teaching of the Great Vehicle bestows virtue according to roots, though one may not be aware of it. Though unaware, one is delivered according to roots—all sentient beings receive its moisture, emerging from suffering into joy, never departing the true treasury. Sentient beings, deluded, conceive of existence through false thoughts and never awaken within the true treasury. Why is this? Because the true nature of Dharma-nature is real—within the true, one receives existence, and existence is a mass of suffering, which is suffering and affliction. I observe all things as great wisdom—neither born nor extinguished, without suffering or affliction, equal in coming and going, equal in entering and exiting.

Bestowing according to lower roots is equality; upholding precepts without precepts according to middle roots is equality; wisdom without wisdom or self according to higher roots is equality. Sentient beings receive joy—joy without reception is equality. The karmic retribution of sentient beings—retribution without karma is equality. All dharmas are equal without anything to equal—because there is nothing to equal, it is called the Great Way.

Diligently study the Great Vehicle and skillfully practice the three wisdoms: first, skillfully accumulate expedient means to extinguish external dust; second, sever all karmic outflows and not emerge in others’ realms; third, seek the true mark until reaching the Dao-field. Having realized and returned to the root, the two views are ever luminous, the three karmas revolve, the four elements are ever pervading, the five aggregates open and clear, the six senses are unstained, the seventh consciousness abides of itself, the eightfold path is without self, and the nine virtues flow unceasingly. Former worthies and later sages all attained the Way by this means. Know that the true treasury is foremost.

All sentient beings—body and nature are pure, the celestial true Way is hidden within, called the true treasury."

Should one expound the *True Treasury Sutra*, the merit of such a person is inconceivable—they shall behold my true form and attain the supreme Dao. If one holds faith and relinquishes all distracting thoughts, they shall gain the Dao-eye, illuminating the causes of the three times with boundless equanimity.

Some may cast away their bodies, shattering them to pieces; some may throw themselves to hungry tigers; some may burn their bodies and lives in fire; some may, bound by karmic cause and effect, relinquish and offer in pursuit of blessings. Yet such merits are meager, and the power of the Dharma remains unfulfilled. Why? Because they lack the power of wisdom and fail to penetrate the truth.

Self-realization is self-seeking; self-attainment is self-possession. Yet in this way, one binds oneself, falls into the obscuration of ignorance, and remains entangled in karma, karma begetting karma—how then can liberation be found?

This contemplation is foremost. First, one counts the mind, yet the mind does not abide in dharmas; because dharmas do not abide, there is no fixed dharma. Because there is no fixed dharma, the wisdom of seeing the Dao arises. One who sees the wisdom of the Dao is none other than one’s original self—unborn and undying.

Not recognizing one’s original self is like a traveler who, upon finding an abandoned casket on the road, opens it to see a mirror. Beholding their own reflection, they mistake it for the casket’s owner, their mind seized with terror. Bowing in apology, they cast it aside and flee. Sentient beings, deluded, forsake the true and grasp the false, abandon the root and chase the branches—just so.

The Heavenly Worthy said: All sentient beings—bodies without limit—are called the Dharma of sutras, also named the assembly of dharmas. Why? Because names arise from the resolution of delusion. Yet if one does not comprehend the essence, they are called sentient beings, also named birth-and-death, also named the mass of suffering, also named inversion, also named external seeking. Why? Because sentient beings do not understand—this is called delusion. For this reason, they fail to recognize their own selves. Within their very selves lie boundless dharmas, fully possessing the Three Clarities’ realm.

Yet sentient beings, deluded, turn outward in search, distrusting the true Dharma and not seeking good spiritual friends—they are called sentient beings. Thus they sink the Dharma into the world, from kalpa to kalpa, never awakening. If they encounter a good spiritual friend, this is called a karmic affinity from past lives, planting the seeds of merit. Why? Because past causes yield present fruits, and through meeting the Heavenly Worthy, the supreme, secret, and profoundly mysterious true treasury is revealed. Understanding past causes, they realize the present fruit.

You who seek must first seek within, perceiving the secret Dharma and widely unfolding the true treasury. Through this treasury of Dharma, all dharmas are gathered and encompassed without limit.

The Wisdom-Power Youth said: Though I have heard the sagely teaching, I cannot comprehend it. What is the Dao? What is the Dharma?

What is a teacher? What is an assembly? Since you do not know, I shall explain for you.

The Heavenly Worthy replied: What you ask pertains to seeking the true treasury and perceiving the secret Dharma. Now still your spirit and abide in quietude, and I shall expound it widely.

All sentient beings possess a nature of purity within their bodies—the true and correct Dao of Heavenly Truth lies concealed therein, called the true treasury.

The Heavenly Worthy further said: To disbelieve that the Three Treasures reside within the root, to disbelieve that sentient beings share the same nature as the Heavenly Worthy, to disbelieve that all dharmas are quiescent and without form, to disbelieve that sentient beings, since time immemorial, have manifested in myriad forms yet remain unborn and undying—such disbelief is called slandering the Dharma, destroying the Dharma, annihilating the Dharma. Having annihilated the Dharma, one revolves in the cycle of birth and death and must inevitably fall into hell, with no chance of escape.

Beware of seeking externally. Without clinging to the form of the body, one pervades all realms; without clinging to the form of the body, one is neither born nor destroyed. The marks of excellence do not arise apart from sentient beings, nor does one fill the void apart from sentient beings, nor does the true treasury exist apart from sentient beings.

All good men, do not give rise to disbelief. What issues from the Golden Mouth is without the slightest error.

The Youth of Auspicious Sound bowed his head, prostrated himself again, and received the teaching with faith, vowing to put it into practice.
