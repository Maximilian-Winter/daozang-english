### **Direct Pointers to the Comprehension of Reality: A Detailed Explication**
**By Xiangchuan the Nameless Master, Weng Baoguang**

Before the manifestation of primordial chaos, there was emptiness and silence—no name could be ascribed, yet by necessity it was called the *Dao/Way*. The Dao descended and gave birth to *One Qi*, neither moving nor still, neither turbid nor clear, vast and unfathomable. The sages, compelled to speak of it, termed it the *Primal True Unity Qi*.

Once *One Qi* divided, it transformed into *yin* and *yang*. *Yin* and *yang* are Heaven and Earth, male and female. Heaven and Earth intermingle, and the myriad things refine into harmony; male and female unite in essence, and the myriad things take form. Thus, since the existence of Heaven and Earth, there has never been a single thing that did not acquire its shape through the intercourse of *yin* and *yang*.

For those who seek to refine the elixir: if one takes the forms of metals, minerals, herbs, or trees—each a vessel of myriad differences—or even the spirit, essence, *qi*, blood, and fluids of the body as the substance of the elixir, these are all postcelestial, turbid, and material things. Turbid and material things possess visible form; how can they generate the formless from the formed? They are postcelestial, born within the bounds of Heaven and Earth. All that has form is subject to decay; how can it transform and transcend beyond Heaven and Earth? Failing to transcend beyond Heaven and Earth, all that has form remains bound to the cycles of *yin-yang* and life-and-death. For *yang* governs life, and *yin* governs death; death and life alternate, advance and retreat—this is the natural principle.

Even if one refines and ingests with skill, extending life to the age of the tortoise or the crane, when one’s allotted span is exhausted, none escape death. Like an arrow shot into the sky, when its force is spent, it must fall—such is the inevitable decay of all that has form. Therefore, the sages gather the *precelestial One Qi* as the elixir, refining form to return to *One Qi*, refining *qi* to return to spirit, refining spirit to merge with the Dao, and thus returning to the formless form. Only then can one transcend beyond Heaven and Earth, stand beyond the workings of creation, grasp *yin* and *yang*, and command Heaven and Earth. The transformations of *yin-yang* and life-and-death are governed by the *One Qi* of the Nine Heavens. Thus, one who attains the elixir-body abides in eternal numinosity, neither born nor extinguished.

It is like moving a jar: one within the jar cannot move it; only by standing outside the jar can one move it. The *True Unity Qi* exists prior to Heaven and Earth, vast and unfathomable. The sages, using things of the same kind, lure it to congeal into the elixir. Just as fire exists within the sun, and one may draw it forth with a burning-mirror; or as water exists within the moon, and one may draw it forth with a moon-receiver. Thus, refining things of the same kind, one establishes the furnace and crucible, calling them the *True Dragon* and *True Tiger*. As Master Lü’s verses say: *"The natural furnace and crucible, the tiger encircling, the dragon coiling."*

These things of the same kind are *emotionless emotion*, *colorless color*—the purest and most numinous of the myriad things, possessing the correct nature and destiny. For example, the *qi* of the crescent moon: when activated and employed, it is termed *True Lead* and *True Mercury*. The Immortal Elder said: *"If men wish to know True Lead and True Mercury, they are not common cinnabar or quicksilver—rather, the qi of the crescent moon."* The crescent moon refers to the numbers of the waxing and waning phases: eight *liang* for the dragon, half a *jin* for the tiger—hence the term *two eights*. At this time, the source of water is utterly clear, possessing *qi* but no substance. Using this *qi*-kind to lure it, the *True Unity Qi* descends in numinosity and takes form.

The Immortal Elder said: *"The medicine meets its kindred qi and assumes form; the Dao abides in emptiness, harmonizing with nature."* To refine this Golden Elixir, one must first seek a propitious mountain and blessed land, then construct a refining chamber of several rafters. Erect a three-tiered altar, plant a sword at each of the four directions, and hang mirrors. Only then establish the dragon and tiger as the crucible and furnace, set the water-clock as the measure, regulate the withdrawal and addition with the principles of water and fire, and employ assistants for the work. Such matters cannot be easily expounded; they also require worldly wealth to bring to completion.

Thus, Master Yin Zhenjun said: *"To cultivate this Dao, one must rely on resources. Without resources, the Golden Elixir cannot be accomplished."* Furthermore, three people must initiate the work—three of one heart, true companions of singular intent. On the night of the first full moon of the eighth month, at the moment when the *yang* first stirs, the principal adept performs the *Yu* step upon the altar, seizing the dragon with the left hand and the tiger with the right. Refining the *qi* and timing the phases, counting the revolutions of the stars, one aligns Heaven’s correctness with *yin-yang*, synchronizing breath with the water-clock’s marks. Thus, metal and water intermingle, and the dragon’s wood nurtures its essence.

One sits in meditation, strategizing like a general weaving the warp and weft of scripture and martial arts, ensuring the beginning and end of the process are flawlessly executed, without the slightest deviation. Thus, the Immortal Elder said: *"It all depends on the power of cultivation; even a hair’s difference will fail to produce the elixir."* Another monitors the water-clock’s precision, meticulously adjusting the withdrawal and addition, ensuring the fire-timing is unerring. If the hexagram’s time is exceeded, the elixir will surely fail. Thus, Master Chaoyuan said: *"I urge you to exhaust the numbers of the celestial revolution; do not let negligence hasten the hexagram’s turn."*

With three people of one heart, mutually verifying each other, in less than half an hour, the *True Unity Qi* is drawn into the Palace of Intercourse, coalescing into a single grain, as large as a millet seed—this is the *Golden Elixir*.

Now within the Northern Sea, a radiant light suddenly pierces the curtains—swiftly and secretly, one must employ the *Mona* technique to pursue it. The moment it enters the mouth, one instantly ascends to the sacred rank. Thus, the Immortal Elder said: *"Swallow but a single grain of Golden Elixir, and you shall know your fate is not ruled by Heaven."*

Once this single grain is lodged within the Cinnabar Field and Sea of Qi, the essence and qi of the entire body converge upon it, instantly coalescing into cinnabar without any loss. Then, through the firing and refinement, the *Golden Liquid Returned Elixir* is formed. Now, *fire* refers to the qi of yin and yang. Yang numbers are odd, yin numbers even. From *zi* to *si*, the six hours belong to yang—thus called *yang fire*. From *wu* to *hai*, the six hours belong to yin—thus called *yin tally*. The * Qian* hexagram’s tally is two hundred and sixteen; the *Kun* hexagram’s tally is one hundred and forty-four. Within these two scrolls, one seizes the four thousand three hundred and twenty years of *True Qi*, returning it to the Cinnabar Field, where it nurtures the *Child Pearl* and coalesces into the *Sacred Embryo*. Laozi said: *"Yang’s oddness arises from *zi*; yin’s evenness issues from *wu*. Beginning and end lie in *Qian* and *Kun*; the dark womb is the moon of the mother’s womb."*

Thus, the external essence and the internal fire of yin and yang are born, and the substance of *Golden Liquid*—without need for forced effort—naturally circulates. From the *Weilü* point, it ascends with a clear, resonant sound, piercing the double passes, reversing upward to the summit of *Niwan*, then descending into the mouth, resembling a sparrow’s egg—fragrant, sweet, and delectable. This is the *Golden Liquid Returned Elixir*. Slowly swallowing it into the Cinnabar Field, it coalesces into the *Sacred Embryo*, nurturing the *Infant*. Thus, the Immortal Elder said: *"The Infant is one who contains the True Qi; when the ten-month gestation is complete, one enters the sacred foundation."*

For the common fetus, ten months pass before birth; so too with the Sacred Embryo. When the ten months of firing are complete and the work perfected, one sheds the embryo and transforms into a body of pure yang. Cold, heat, hunger, and thirst can no longer disturb it. Only then may one wander in remote mountains and deep valleys, or dwell in humble, secluded places, facing the wall for nine years to empty the heart, where there is neither self nor other, and heart and realm become one—this is called the *Immortals’ Embrace of the One*. At the moment the Chan practitioner gathers the ox, only those who recognize the heart and perceive the nature can embrace it, and thus the Dao flourishes.

After nine years of work, the nature of non-action becomes complete, and wisdom naturally arises. The body of pure yang becomes wondrous, and the spirit naturally attains numinosity. Thus, one obtains both nature and life, merging with the Dao in truth and without form. The formless form manifests according to circumstances—encountering wind, it becomes wind; encountering rain, it becomes rain; encountering water or fire, it becomes water or fire. Meeting birds, beasts, grasses, or trees, its transformations are unfathomable—now present, now gone, seen ahead, then suddenly behind. Thus, it can divide into a hundred million bodies, responding without limit. The heart is like the moon reflecting upon ten thousand waters, universally pervading. Therefore, it responds to conditions without fail, meeting every stimulus.

Yet the body of utmost truth dwells in the city of utmost stillness, truly never acting. Here, spirit, form, nature, and life merge with the Dao in truth, returning together to the ultimate source of quiescent emptiness. Thus, the sages forcibly name it the *Nine-Turn Golden Liquid Great Returned Elixir*, or the *Indestructible Vajra Body*—the supreme, most true, and wondrous Dao.

The Immortal Elder alone propagated this Dao, attaining a body of true gold and wondrous hue, manifesting the majestic and luminous visage of true gold, universally appearing throughout the Dharma realm to save and deliver all beings. Thus, he revealed to his disciple Liu Fengzhen the nature-Dao of non-arising, entering quiescence, and later manifested his true body in Wangwu Mountain, demonstrating the twofold Dao of life and nature—imperishable and perfectly penetrating. Therefore, on the fifth day of the third month in the fifth year of the Yuanfeng era, at the time of his liberation by means of the corpse, he left behind these words: *"The wondrous function of the single spirit pervades the Dharma realm."* Without the dual perfection of the Dao of nature and life, and the wondrous union of form and spirit, how could one attain this?

In this world, he lived for ninety-six years. In his lifetime, he extensively expounded the profound and subtle, composing verses on emotion and nature—his words profound and elegant, guiding those who came after. He titled his work *Awakening to Reality*. *"Awakening to Reality"* refers to the truth of nature and life. Yet he feared that later students might know only the Dao of life but not exhaust the nature, or know only the Dao of nature but not nurture life. Thus, he composed a verse on awakening to the *True Suchness* and a hymn on the *Wondrous Treasure of the Colored Body*, to enlighten those of superior wisdom and great capacity, enabling them to fully comprehend the Dao of nature and life, attain ultimate perfection, and transcend the Three Realms. Without the great compassion and equal-hearted wisdom of one who has attained the Dao, who could achieve this?

Though my own understanding is dim, I have received the Immortal Elder’s secret instructions. Thus, through diligent study of this work, I have grasped eight or nine parts of its profound mechanism. Fearing that fellow seekers might not know the source of the Golden Elixir’s lineage, I have traced its origins and essentials from beginning to end, daring to defy heavenly censure by directly pointing to the broad path of *Awakening to Reality*. If there are those with innate affinity for immortality, let them enter directly through the gate of *Awakening to Reality* and seek non-action within the single grain of millet. If sought externally, one cannot hope to attain it.

In ancient times, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning suspended a precious pearl, as large as a millet grain, within the empty mystery. Innumerable sacred hosts eagerly entered through the pearl’s mouth—this was none other than the single grain of Golden Elixir. A grain like a millet seed contains all phenomena, encompassing the Three Powers. Vast without boundary, minute without interior, it spans from antiquity to the present. Countless lofty immortals and supreme sages have verified this Dao—who among them did not attain the supreme great Dao through this single grain of millet?

This Dao is most simple and most easy. Yet without a true teacher’s guidance, none can fathom its deep roots and firm foundation. Even if the root and foundation are known, without great wealth and resources, one cannot accomplish the work or manifest the endeavor.

Once the work is accomplished and the endeavor manifest, without the clarity of seeing one’s nature, none can attain the subtlety of embracing the One. When embracing the One is perfected, the Dao of nature and life reaches its utmost—nothing more can be added.

Thus, the Dao of life is invariably transmitted through a teacher’s guidance before it becomes clear, and through cultivation before it becomes manifest. Yet the Dao of nature is not so—it does not come from without. Without the distractions of external sights and sounds, one falls into the confines of lesser rules and fails to penetrate the ultimate clarity of pure perception. Only by self-awakening and self-illumination within one’s own heart can one fully realize the Dao of nature and attain what is called the Supreme First Vehicle.

Alas, within the Dao of nature, there is no awakening to awaken, no illumination to illuminate—only awakening to nothingness, illuminating nothingness. There is no exhausting to exhaust, no attaining to attain—only exhausting nothingness, attaining nothingness. The Supreme First Vehicle is not supreme in being supreme, not first in being first—only supreme in nothingness, first in nothingness.

Should the disciple grasp the teacher’s intent, seize the celestial mechanism, refine the divine elixir, and undergo the transformation of bone and marrow, then without further need for illuminating the mind or fathoming the root, or awakening to true emptiness, one directly transcends to the Supreme Vehicle and enters the realm of non-action. There, form and spirit are both perfected, nature and life are harmoniously rounded. Mounting cranes and phoenixes, riding dragons and soaring with simurghs, one shall surely join the wanderings of Penglai’s immortal courts.

As for the art of mighty armies and victorious battles—this is the essence of refining the Golden Elixir. In refining the Golden Elixir, one always begins on the first night of the Mid-Autumn moon, when the yang first stirs. Seated to stabilize the celestial pivot, the altar ascends three tiers. To the left, the Dragon is seized to secure the cauldron’s alignment; to the right, the Tiger is grasped to precisely regulate the firing times. Civil and martial forces contend in battle at the mysterious gate; advance and retreat engage in perilous struggle at the Gate of Life.

Breath aligns with the clepsydra’s marks, the count accords with the celestial revolution—let not a hair’s breadth of deviation arise. Thus is the art of mighty armies and victorious battles.

For armies are Dragon and Tiger; battle is their union. Within a single double-hour, the Golden Elixir enters the mouth, and the art of victory is manifest. Therefore, the *Western Florescence Scripture* states: “Mighty armies and victorious battles lie in the cultivation of the Mystic Pearl.”

Thus the Immortal Elder first arrays sixteen poems to clarify that Dragon and Tiger each bear the number one and eight. One poem of five words and four rhymes signifies that in one double-hour, one grain of Golden Elixir is attained. For this reason, I have divided this into the Upper Scroll, setting it forth to elucidate the art of mighty armies and victorious battles—whereby the work of gathering the Golden Elixir is made perfectly clear.

**The Method of Enriching the State and Pacifying the People**

The method of enriching the state and pacifying the people is the essence of circulating the yin and yang talismans and firing times. The human Dao is formless, originating in the primal qi. This qi, in its primordial chaos, divides into yin and yang. The purest yang qi, light and clear, rises to cover above—this is called Heaven. The purest yin qi, heavy and turbid, sinks to bear below—this is called Earth. The accumulation of pure yang qi, ascending to Heaven, is the immortal. The accumulation of pure yin qi, sinking into Earth, is the ghost. Endowed with one yin and one yang qi, neither ascending nor sinking, dwelling between Heaven and Earth, capable of becoming immortal or ghost—this is the human.

If one cultivates and refines, stripping away the yin of the grasses until the form transforms into pure yang qi, one ascends as an immortal. If one knows not cultivation, daily depleting the six yang, until the body transforms into pure yin qi, one becomes a lower ghost. The *Book of Changes* states: “That which is rooted in Heaven inclines upward; that which is rooted in Earth inclines downward.” Each follows its kind.

Thus the sage, gazing above and below, knew that humans, endowed with the finest qi of Heaven and Earth, are most numinous, most noble, most supreme. Therefore, they borrowed the two substances of true yin and true yang to seize the primal qi before Heaven and Earth, forming the Elixir. Ingesting it into the Cinnabar Field and Sea of Qi, one governs the postnatal qi of the entire body. Then the qi of the entire body gathers as one—like the myriad states paying court to the sovereign, or the host of stars encircling the North Star.

Just as humans arise from the essence of their parents’ union, so too do they steal the pure qi of yin and yang to serve as the foundation of transformation, called the yin talisman and yang fire. Circulating within the sixty-four hexagrams, revolving without end, cycling the seventy-two seasonal nodes and twenty-four qi within a single day and night, one seizes the four thousand three hundred and sixty measures of true qi, converging them in the Cinnabar Field and Sea of Qi to warm and nurture the Elixir Pearl.

The Elixir, abiding in the Central Palace, is fundamentally quiescent yet responsive. Thus, externally receiving the yin talisman and yang fire, it generates the true unified divine body. After ten months of womb-transformation, the form transmutes into the pure yang qi of the True One. Hunger and thirst cannot disturb it; cold and heat cannot assail it. Thus is the method of enriching the state and pacifying the people.

For the state is the body; the people are the essence and qi. The people are the foundation of the state; when the foundation is firm, the state is at peace. If the state lacks a sovereign, the people have no refuge; if the sovereign lacks ministers, the people are untended. Therefore, the sage takes the Elixir as sovereign and fire as minister. When Elixir and fire mutually require each other, sovereign and minister rejoice in union, and the world is governed in peace. Essence is secure, the people are at rest—thus the state of the body is enriched.

The *Western Florescence Scripture* states: “Essence complete and qi replete—this is how the state is enriched and the people pacified, precisely after ingesting the Golden Elixir.” Thus the Immortal Elder continued with sixty-four quatrains, corresponding to the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Book of Changes*, to clarify the reckoning of firing the lines. He further composed twelve *Moon Over the Western River* poems, symbolizing the firing and bathing practices, completing the work of twelve months. For this reason, I have divided this into the Middle Scroll, to elucidate the method of circulating fire and the meaning of enriching the state and pacifying the people. Such is the proper sequence of Elixir refinement.

**The Dao of Immortals Embracing the One**

The Dao of immortals embracing the One is the time when the sage’s firing work is complete. When the form has transformed into pure yang qi, the body retreats to a secluded corner, facing the wall for nine years, embracing the One to empty the heart. The heart settles, the spirit transforms, and merges indistinguishably with the Dao.

A eulogy states:
The Dao is nature and life; the original nature is the source of the heart.
Heart and nature are of one body, their transformations boundless.
The common people use it daily, yet call it natural.
If one can awaken to this, forgetting images and words,
Emptying the heart and filling the belly, embracing the One to transcend—
After nine revolutions of the work, one attains immortality.
Such is its essence.

The nine revolutions are nine years—the number nine is the utmost of yang. The One is the potent name for the Dao. Embracing is embracing that which cannot be embraced. At this time, the immortal discards the limbs, dismisses hearing and sight, departs from the mundane and sacred, equalizes self and others, without fixation or insistence, without grasping or rejecting. The heart-mirror is as one, carefree and at ease—thus attaining great stability, emitting the radiance of Heaven.

After nine years, the work is complete: the nature of non-action is spontaneously perfected; the spirit of formlessness is spontaneously wondrous. When the spirit is wondrous, transformations are inexhaustible, hidden and manifest beyond measure. When nature is perfected, wisdom illuminates the ten directions, numinous penetration is unbroken—thus one can divide the body into a hundred million, responding and manifesting everywhere. Yet the body of utmost truth abides in the realm of utmost stillness, unmoving and as if never acting. At this point, spirit, nature, form, and life all merge truly with the Dao—thus is it called the Dao of immortals embracing the One.

In former times, after the Immortal Elder attained the Dao, he demonstrated to his disciple Liu Fengzhen the entry into quiescence through non-birth. Having entered quiescence, he then manifested his body in the Wangwu Mountains—this was the very Dao.

In ancient times, after the Tathāgata entered nirvāṇa, his golden coffin arose spontaneously into the sky, transforming into samādhi fire. Having consumed his body, yet his mother’s weeping unceasing, he again manifested his golden form in the void, speaking half a phrase to console her—this too was this very Dao.

Long ago, Bodhidharma faced the wall for nine years; having entered extinction, he yet carried a single sandal westward, and his body transformed into towering flames. Though form had perished, the sound of his staff still shook the heavens. Such examples are too numerous to recount in full. Only when both nature and life are perfected, when form and spirit are both wondrous, can one achieve the like.

Thus, at the close of his scroll, the Immortal Elder invokes the Chan school’s teaching of nature and Dao, for it truly clarifies the Dao of immortals embracing the One. Hence, I have divided this into the lower volume.

Now, the Dao of nature is vast and boundless, silent and obscure—no form can capture it, no words describe it. All beings, human and non-human alike, are utterly equal, without high or low. Yet from beginningless time, whether in forms with names or in nameless formlessness, not a single thing fails to be perfectly complete and sufficient, for its inherent purity and sufficiency have never admitted description or definition.

Yet the Great Treasury contains fifty thousand forty-eight scrolls—all because sages, seeing people lost in ignorance of the Dao, could do no other than speak of it. They wished that through words the Dao might be understood, but once the Dao is understood, words themselves become superfluous. Thus the *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* states: “If the Tathāgata had taught any dharma, it would be slander against the Buddha.” Therefore, all speech is slander.

Now, when the Immortal Elder sings of the Dao of nature, he too speaks out of necessity, and his words are already redundant. This is why I add no further explanation—lest I paint the lily.

I only wish that those of fierce and lofty aspiration will not seek from without, but directly awaken and realize within their own hearts, shining forth uniquely and assuming the truth without hesitation. Let them take up and employ it, whether in clamor or silence, speech or stillness, taverns or flower-lined streets—whether idle or not, all is well. No distinction remains; everywhere harmony prevails. Throughout the ten directions, a single eye suffices, a single hand extends—wondrous function moves freely in all directions, covering heaven and earth. Wherever they act, it is the real; whatever they do is without hindrance. Then they know that here, originally, the celestial nature is fully sufficient, lacking nothing, with no excess. All deliberation dissolves, subject and object both forgotten. No question, no response; no thought, no concern. Even the word “nature” is no longer needed.

*Secret Essentials of the Three Vehicles*
*Guardian of the Golden Elixir*

Great indeed! A single millet grain foretells the Void,
Returning to the root, flowing into form at the first hexagram’s dawn.
Two realms of Heaven and Earth draw upon creation’s power,
A single pound of sun and moon turns the pivot of the mechanism.
The cycle of stars and the breath-count whisper faintly,
Advancing the fire, the divine work manifests its true tally.
After burning half a watch with civil and martial flame,
The Crimson Dragon seizes the luminous night-shining pearl.

**Method of Moving the Fire**
Once the pearl is ingested, Earth joins Heaven,
At the double-excess Mysterious Pass, the fire blazes bright.
Sixty hexagrams follow dawn and dusk,
Within the nine-fold city, mercury smelts lead.
In drawing and adding, guard against peril,
In bathing and halting the tally, let no smoke arise.
When the work is complete and the embryo shed after ten months,
From the primordial is nurtured a Great Luo Immortal.

**Method of Embracing the One**
The elixir is the trap, the Dao the fish—
Forget the trap to attain the Dao, realizing emptiness.
Do not rigidly cling to embracing the non-doing One,
Shatter the void, and even "one" is no more.
The wondrous being’s numinous radiance ever blazes,
Encompassing the Dharma-realm, naturally thus.
Following conditions to respond, ever pure and serene,
After nine years, the vajra body remains indestructible.

Now, the vast expanse of rosy clouds, ascending to the golden palace—
such words may seem mere rhetoric, matters beyond the mortal realm.
Yet the worldly cannot deeply believe. I have observed the *Preface to the Comprehensive Immortals’ Collection*,
which states: since ancient times, over a hundred thousand have soared aloft,
and more than eight thousand households have ascended with their dwellings.
Liu Xiang, foremost Confucian of the Han, also composed the *Biographies of the Immortals* to bequeath to later ages,
thus it is known that the immortals are no mere fable.

Yet the reason the worldly do not believe lies in nothing else:
the celestial mechanism is profound and mysterious, the immortals and sages keep their secrets hidden.
With shallow habits and frivolous minds, the truth does not reach their ears—
no wonder they do not believe.

Of old, the Most High expounded the *Classic of Constant Purity and Stillness*,
beginning with the formless Great Dao that gives birth to Heaven and Earth,
the passionless Great Dao that moves the sun and moon,
nurturing the myriad beings, molding the multitudes of life,
all returning to the primal beginning of the nameless Origin.
The sages of antiquity probed the human origin to its utmost,
then further elucidated the principles of Heaven and Earth, male and female, purity and turbidity, movement and stillness,
elaborating on the wonders of a pure heart, few desires, and profound stillness—
all to reveal the celestial mechanism and secretly impart the profound purport.
At the end of the text, it is said that those who awaken may transmit the ultimate teachings of the sagely Dao.

From the words of the immortal Master Ge, it was passed mouth to mouth,
never recorded in writing. Alas! Since the departure of the pure customs,
habits have grown shallow, the immortal dust far removed, this Dao left untransmitted.
Though heterodox teachings abound, they all lead to the distant and obscure.
Thus the method of refining lead was not inscribed on bamboo or silk,
the wonders of forming the embryo and nurturing the infant were deeply sealed in golden caskets and jade boxes.
Students of immortality, white-haired from lifelong pursuit,
never found the key to unlock its mysteries.

In the flourishing reign of the Sagely Song, extraordinary figures emerged among men.
The Perfected of Purple Mystery, Master Zhang, in his youth studied at the Imperial Academy,
endowed from birth with a numinous constitution, he set his resolve with diligence,
undaunted by hardship, attaining the Dao from the Elder of Mount Qingcheng,
mastering all the profound secrets of the golden elixir.
Exhausting what he encountered, he expressed it in songs and verses,
naming his work the *Awakening to Reality*.
In my youth, I read it, pondered deeply, and compared it with various teachings,
yet found no illumination.

Some misconstrued it as mere cinnabar-alchemy, others distorted it into theories of inner cultivation. Clasping the scroll, I sighed deeply—years passed thus. By heaven’s grace, I was fortunate to receive from the Immortal of Purple Yang, Master Chen, the *Awakening to Reality* in its authentic transmission, and from the Perfected Sun Wuming, the *Exegesis*. Secretly bestowed, I bathed, purified myself, and recited them with reverence. Suddenly, it was as if mist dispersed and clouds parted, sun shone and moon gleamed—before I could even inquire into the oral instructions and essential teachings, I already grasped the mechanism of generating heaven and earth, the Dao of circulating the sun and moon.

For nurturing the myriad things and molding all beings, nothing lies beyond true yin and true yang, the qi of the upper and lower celestial arcs. As for the application of withdrawal and replenishment, the vigilance against peril and danger—all glitters clearly before one’s eyes. If one can encounter a true transmission and attain this wondrous Dao, nurturing the immortal embryo, transcending the mundane to enter sageliness, one surely will not have lived this life in vain.

Having just gained access to this teaching, I leap with joy and exultation. Respectfully following the brush of Hong Ying, I inscribe these words at the end of the scroll.

*Written in the Mid-Autumn of the Jiazi year of the Jiatai reign of the Sagely Song by Baiyunzi, who signs himself Jin Shu.*

*Postscript on the Origins of the Awakening to Reality*
*The Origins of the Perfected Zhang*

The Perfected One of Purple Yang was originally from Yingluo Street in Tiantai. His original name was Boduan, styled Pingshu, and later renamed Yongcheng. In his youth, he was untutored and aimless, drifting like clouds and water. Later, though he had received the teachings of the Primordial Dao, they were incomplete, so he diligently sought instruction, traveling extensively across the four directions. During the Xining era, when Lord Lu the Dragon Diagram was vigorously governing Chengdu, he followed him to Shu, serving as a policy advisor in the Pacification Bureau of the Sichuan Military Commissioner’s Office. In the year Jiyou, he encountered an extraordinary person who transmitted to him the secrets of the fire-phase, and thus his Dao was perfected. The master admonished him, saying: "One day, if someone comes to free you from your bonds, you must accept them." After three transmissions, each time he encountered disasters and misfortunes, he deeply repented and blamed himself, withdrawing from the world and ceasing all speech. He composed the *Awakening to Reality* in eighty-one chapters, fully expounding the secrets of the two elixirs. Its discussions and main principles deeply criticized the scholars of his time for clinging to their separate schools, as the three teachings flowed in different currents, unable to merge into one. Yet the principle that different schools share a common source shone clearly. He continued the orthodox tradition and powerfully supplemented the Dao, and his work was widely recited throughout the world. When Lord Lu shed his mortal form, hundreds of śarīra were found, resembling cockscomb seeds, all shimmering in a golden-green hue. Later, there were those who claimed to have seen him, saying that during the Zhenghe era, he visited Minister Huang Mianzhong of Yanping under his true name. Huang had long transmitted the teachings of Rongcheng and was deeply devoted to alchemical practices. Though advanced in years, their conversation failed to resonate, and he departed. Subsequently, he sent a letter to Huang, which Pingshu found most extraordinary. Huang’s grandson Quan saw the letter but kept its contents secret, revealing only the general outline to me: Pingshu claimed that both he and Huang were celestial officials of the Purple Tenuity Palace, known as the Nine August Perfected Ones. Due to reviewing the records of kalpas and destinies, they were banished to the human realm. Among them, only six stars are now visible in the celestial enclosure, while three remain concealed in obscurity: Pingshu, Mianzhong, and Master Yu of Weiyang. Pingshu was called the Perfected One of Purple Yang, Mianzhong the Perfected One of Purple Primordium, and Master Yu the Perfected One of Purple Florescence. All those who had been banished as officials had already returned to the Pure Capital, but Pingshu had once again ascended to the ranks of immortals. Only Mianzhong remained mired in the sea of officialdom, having been reborn as a human for ten lifetimes—now in his ninth. If in his next life he again succumbs to delusion and clings to the dust, he will sink into other destinies, with no hope of promotion. Pingshu clearly set forth the covenant of immortals, striving to rescue him, yet Huang ultimately failed to resonate with the teachings and passed away, merely styling himself the Old Man of Purple Primordium. The Nine August Ones are not recorded among the celestial officials, for they are but faint stars—perhaps among the twelve thousand five hundred?

**The Affairs of Master Xue Zixian**
Dao Yuan, surnamed Xue and named Shi, was a native of Jizu Mountain in Shanfu. He had once been a monk, with the Dharma name Zixian. Wandering to Chang’an, he stayed at Kaifu Temple, where he studied under the elder Xiuyan. Yan, perceiving his capacity for the Dao-eye, asked: "Before the golden cock crows, how does one respond to this sound?" He also studied under the monk Ruhuan, who asked: "What is the bite that transcends the Buddha and the Patriarchs?"—to which he replied, "A sesame cake, round and complete." Upon hearing the creaking of a well-pulley, he suddenly attained enlightenment and composed a gatha:

*When the creaking follows the sound’s arising,*
*Not from another does sudden knowing come.*
*The well-pulley sings the song of no-birth,*
*While the snake in the well dances with abandon.*

The two elders affirmed his realization. From then on, he thoroughly awakened to the supreme secret, the perfectly luminous and true essential Dharma. His wit was swift, and he was equally versed in both the school and the teachings. Moreover, he ardently aspired to the cultivation of the golden elixir. In the winter of the Bingxu year of the Chongning era, while residing in Qing Town of Na County to attend a Buddhist lecture, he encountered Shi Tai, styled Dezhi, a native of Xinglin Post in Fufeng County, Fengxiang Prefecture. Though eighty-five years old, Shi had green hair and a ruddy complexion, his spirit and bearing extraordinary. At night, he sewed clothes. Dao Yuan observed him in secret and felt a sense of wonder. By chance, he recited a poem by Zhang Pingshu, and Shi was startled, asking: "Do you know this man?" Dao Yuan replied: "He is my teacher." Thereupon, he recounted what Pingshu had said.

Master Pingshu, originally named Boduan, first encountered an extraordinary person at Tianhui Temple in Chengdu, who changed his name to Yongcheng. The governor of Fengzhou, enraged, pressed charges against him, and he was exiled. Passing through the prefecture, they encountered a great snowfall. He and his escorts drank together at a village tavern, where I happened to be present. After exchanging bows and sitting down, he invited me to join them. I smiled at the group and said: "The guests are fearful, but this guest has not yet begun drinking—why not come and join us?" Thus, we drank together until merry. He asked the reason for my presence, and I explained. I thought to myself: "Governor Deng is an old friend, delighting in goodness and forgetting rank. Though a hundred *li* away, he would not hesitate to come if there were a reason." Pingshu pleaded with his escorts, who agreed. Thus, he was released at He. I went ahead, and with one meeting, he was pardoned. Pingshu was deeply grateful, saying: "If I do not repay this kindness, how can I be called a man? Though I have studied the Dao all my life, I have never heard of such a method. Now, I will transmit the alchemical technique to you to perfect your Dao." I bowed in thanks and reverently received his instructions.

Dao Yuan, having heard Shi Tai’s account, prostrated himself in homage and sought to become his disciple. He ultimately mastered the great elixir and received the true essential oral instructions. Shi further admonished him to go to great cities and metropolises, seeking those of virtue and power to assist in his endeavor. Dao Yuan then came to the capital, discarded his monk’s robes, and donned a scholar’s turban and robe. Concealing his light and blending with the dust, he mingled among ordinary folk, hoping to fulfill this task. Yet among those who study the Dao of immortality, even those who encounter Pingshu’s poems may interpret them differently according to their own understanding, leading to discrepancies. Doubts arise, minds become confused, and clarity eludes them—who then can explain the *Triple Concordance* to them? Thus, many dare not begin their practice. Alas! Was this Master Pingshu’s original intention?

Thus moved by profound resolve, he first undertook to expound and clarify, systematically unfolding the essential principles, penetrating the mysteries and probing the subtleties, dispelling ignorance and awakening the benighted, so that all might readily comprehend. By this means, those who cultivate and refine may avoid error and deviation, attain realization as lofty perfected ones, and employ cinnabar in the elixir’s work.

Master Chuping once vowed, after incurring fault, never to instruct others, yet later sighed and said: “For myself, this may suffice, but it is no way to uphold the Dao.” The Most High’s sacred statutes declare:

*Failing to transmit when one meets the right person severs the celestial Way;
Recklessly imparting to the unworthy leaks the celestial treasure.
To transmit to the proper recipient brings merit to one’s person;
To recklessly transmit brings netherworld torment to seven generations of ancestors.*

Now I have obstinately sealed the celestial Way—calamity will be great indeed. Thus compelled, I composed poems and songs, first to circulate among the world’s extraordinary persons, that they might read and awaken on their own. Yet the meaning within these poems and songs remains deeply concealed, beyond recognition.

Daoyuan therefore expanded upon their intent, composing annotations to make all plain. The true essentials are thoroughly revealed, the profound subtleties of the method fully set forth, the inner and outer radiantly displayed, with no residue left concealed. Those who obtain and peruse this may thereby trace and examine, resolving their doubts without need for inquiry, able to comprehend fully on their own—thus fulfilling Master Chuping’s original intent.

Yet Daoyuan, having resolved to transmit this to later generations, shall henceforth seal his silence and withdraw into seclusion. Those who obtain this text must guard it with utmost secrecy. What Heaven treasures is everywhere attended and protected by numinous forces. Only when a person of resolve, steadfast in the Dao and clear in truth, whose words and deeds are without blemish, has carefully ascertained the path of cultivation, may it then be entrusted to them.

It must not be transmitted amid piles of gold and jade, nor even to one’s closest kin, father or son. For careless disclosure and wanton leakage bring misfortune upon the self, disaster upon the household, and inauspiciousness to descendants. Not only thus: it will further extend calamity to nine generations of ancestors and seven generations of forebears, subjecting them to dark retribution and netherworld punishment, bound eternally to ghostly servitude, never to receive rebirth. Bear this in mind, take heed, and do not neglect it.

The Elder Gardener of Shangqiu, now known as Master Wang Zhenyi of the Present Age, having transcribed and annotated the *Wuzhen pian* ("Awakening to Reality") with its poetic verses, together with the events of its transmission as received in his time, has compiled and recorded them in detail below. Though his words are unadorned, they are a faithful account, so that the beginning and end may be fully seen.

Recorded on the Mid-Autumn Festival of the *yiwei* year of the Zhenghe era [1115 CE].

In the *dingmao* year of the Taiding era [1327 CE], at Ruiyang, I encountered Xue Zixian’s annotation of the *Wuzhen pian* and read it with a sense of loss, regretting that I had not seen the complete edition. In the *guisi* year of the Tianli era [1333 CE], upon returning to Sheng, I obtained the full text and read it repeatedly. Over several years, I began to discern its essential meaning. Later, I received several versions from distant Daoist friends for collation, all of which shared the same annotations. Where they refuted heterodox teachings, some attributed the errors to "a certain person," while others named Ye Wenshu. Herein lies the first doubt.

Recently published editions of the *Wuzhen pian* with annotations by various scholars include references to the commentaries of Master Xiangchuan and the Nameless One. Compared to the annotations I obtained from Zixian, these are identical, yet the authors differ—another doubt.

In the *renshu* year of the Jiatai era [1202 CE], Yuan Gongfu condemned Ye Wenshu’s commentary, leaving its origins obscure. Upon examining Gongfu’s own received teachings, I found they amounted to nothing more than solitary cultivation of a single element. Why, then, did he condemn others? If Wenshu’s work were truly flawed, why did both Zixian and Gongfu denounce it? Herein lies another doubt.

By examining the chronology: Daoguang composed the *Fuming pian* ("Restoration of Life"), stating that he received oral instructions in the *gengzi* year of the Xuanhe era [1120 CE]. Now, Wang Zhenyi of Shangqiu, in the *yiwei* year of the Zhenghe era [1115 CE], recorded the events of Xue Zixian’s life. Ye Wenshu’s annotations date to the *xinsi* year of the Shaoxing era [1161 CE], forty-seven years later. Wenshu may not even have been born—or was still a child—in the *yiwei* year of Zhenghe. How could Zixian have foreseen and condemned him forty-seven years in advance? Moreover, all the errors attributed to Wenshu appear in no other annotations. Herein lies yet another doubt.

Given these uncertainties, I suspected that the annotations were not Zixian’s, though I could not be certain. While his commentary differs from others, it truly captures the essence of the Perfected One’s teachings.

On the third day of the fifth month in the *xinyou* year of the Zhishun era [1331 CE], I encountered the direct instructions on the Golden Elixir, its ingredients, and the firing times—a celestial transmission. Yet I remained doubtful that the annotations were Zixian’s, and the matter weighed on my mind. I questioned ceaselessly and sought answers far and wide.

In the autumn of the *renshen* year of the Zhishun era [1332 CE], an old friend from Wuling transmitted the *Baoguang* commentary by Master Xiangchuan. Overjoyed, I read it for months, and my earlier doubts melted away like ice. It became clear that the annotations long attributed to Zixian were in fact the work of the Nameless One, mistakenly ascribed to Daoguang (Baoguang). How long this error has persisted, yet no one has corrected it!

How do I know this? The Perfected One transmitted the teachings to Shi Yaolin, and Yaolin to Zixian as the third generation—this is widely known. The Perfected One also transmitted to Guangyizi, and Guangyizi to the Nameless One, likewise the third generation—this is rarely known. Those who sought to lend credibility to the Nameless One’s annotations circulated them in abridged form. Later, to bolster their authenticity, they appended Zixian’s name, with the record stating: "by Wang Zhenyi." Thus, two individuals were conflated into one.

The *Wuzhen pian* is a work of universal compassion, fully revealing the celestial mysteries. How could it bear the surname "Yuan Wang"? This is a self-inflicted error in the record, meant to mislead the world. Some further claim that Zixian was a monk, also known as Daoguang or Baoguang. This confusion arises from the shared character *guang* ("light"), leading to the mistaken attribution of criticisms of Ye Wenshu. Yet when we examine the Nameless One’s annotations, no one before Wenshu had written commentaries, nor did anyone after him condemn Wenshu’s errors.

The Nameless One, fearing that the Perfected One’s teachings would be lost and future generations misled, dared—at the risk of heavenly retribution—to annotate the text in the *guisi* year of the Qiandao era [1173 CE], adhering strictly to his master’s instructions. His explanations are meticulous, leaving no detail unaddressed, lest others be led astray. Yet later scholars, having only abridged versions of various commentaries, have never seen the complete text. They further erred by misreading the title "Xiangchuan" as an honorific for an elder, splitting the Nameless One and Xiangchuan into two individuals. More recently, the Nameless One’s annotations have been misattributed to Zixian. Error upon error has accumulated, and even the basic coherence of the text and its chronology cannot be verified. How, then, can one hope to grasp the true transmission of the immortal Dao?

The authentic transmission of the Great Way of the Golden Elixir has endured for ages, yet it now verges on extinction. Though the world is united and seekers of immortality abound, how few have truly encountered this teaching! Will Zixian’s annotations not be transmitted to later generations? Am I alone in having failed to see them?

The Nameless One’s annotations are exhaustive, leaving no obscurities. The annotations commonly attributed to Zixian are largely identical but riddled with omissions. If Zixian had indeed written a commentary, how could the Nameless One have ignored it, instead appropriating the entire text and publishing it under his own name? In his explanation of the "full moon" passage, the Nameless One cites only two lines from Zixian, proving that Zixian never wrote a commentary. The annotator begins with "where human effort is applied to awaken understanding," and later cites "Wu Shi Zi" ("Master of No-This"), a corruption of "Nameless One." This further confirms that Zixian never wrote a commentary.

Today’s error—attributing the Nameless One’s work to Zixian—leads modern seekers of immortality to dismiss the obscure (Nameless One) in favor of the well-known (Zixian), inverting their true significance. Yet the authenticity of their master’s transmission and the orthodoxy of the immortal Dao are the same for both, as both trace their lineage to [Zhang] Boduan.

Wherever the words of the Perfected One reside, numinous forces attend and protect them. How could one fail to treasure this text and preserve it, transmitting it only to those worthy of receiving it?

Herewith the translation:

---

Accordingly, I have appended the recorded origins of the Perfected One and the recent affairs of Zixian to the commentary of the Nameless One, offering a comprehensive critique. Thus may those who study this annotation find its principles readily clarified and its errors easily corrected, recognizing the truth of my words and refraining from falsely transmitting the commentary.

Knowing the rarity of encountering the Great Dao, I dare not lightly transmit it to unworthy recipients. Those who pursue immortality follow a path: through text they grasp meaning, through annotation they penetrate the essence. Unled astray by heterodox teachings, they ascend directly to the Great Dao. This is Heaven’s gift, ensuring the transmission of the Golden Elixir’s Great Dao remains unbroken.

There exists another version, prefaced by a brief introduction by Zixuzi dated the ninth month of the first year of the Chunxi era, placed before Chen Ziyang’s preface. This version omits the Nameless One’s preface, retaining only the secret instructions of the Immortal Elder. It further alters the subsequent text, renaming *The Secret Essentials of the Three Vehicles* and placing it at the beginning. The commentary therein adds:

> Its essential teachings regard virgin boys and girls as yin and yang, dragon and tiger; the qi of male and female as precelestial and postcelestial, as lead and mercury, as true water and fire, as the new moon. The year of *tiangui* is called *gui*’s birth; at sixteen, the three yang are complete, the toad’s light is full, the golden tripod is whole, great and small are unharmed, the two realms are whole, the precelestial qi is the external medicine. Truly, this is a heterodox sect’s perverse flourish, a spurious annotation.

This is the heresy of Zixuzi, who dared not reveal his true name. He falsely dated his work earlier, attributing his unspoken doctrines to the Nameless One to gain worldly acceptance. Some claim Zixuzi is merely another name for the Nameless One. If this were true, the Nameless One would contradict himself. Moreover, in the year *gui-si* of the Qiandao era, the following year *jia-wu* saw the reign title changed to Chunxi. Within a single year, how could the master’s teachings suddenly diverge?

In the *jia-zi* year of the Jiatai era, Baiyunzi prefaced Chen Ziyang’s transmission of this commentary. Thirty-two years later, the annotation remains entirely pure and unified, its secret instructions clear and unambiguous, without a single heterodox word intermingled. From *gui-si* to *jia-wu*, a mere year apart, this version rebels against the prior annotation. At that time, the Nameless One had not yet ascended; had he witnessed this, he would surely have condemned it as heresy. How could one attack Ye Wenshu while upholding Zixuzi?

Furthermore, why did Zixuzi not seek the guidance of the enlightened to verify his transmission’s orthodoxy? If the Nameless One had indeed revised his own teachings, why would he claim to expand upon the Nameless One’s unspoken doctrines? Thus, the spuriousness of this annotation is undeniable.

Scholars of immortality who obtain the authentic version of this commentary should discern its truth and treasure it. Respectfully annotated on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month in the *bing-zi* year of the Zhiyuan era by Kongxuanzi Dai Qizong, styled Yizhong, and his father.

I have heard that in ancient times, the Perfected One Zixian expounded the subtle mysteries of the Great Dao, rescuing deluded disciples from drowning. On the day of his Dao’s fulfillment, he composed the *Wuzhen Pian* to transmit to the world, distilling his life’s experiences therein. Those who study the Dao yet fail to follow this text’s teachings are like travelers bound for the rivers and seas who abandon their oars.

Alas, as the ages recede and the winds of the Dao grow faint, its words become stern and its Way concealed. Some cling to heterodox teachings, slandering the immortal Dao; others obscure its symbolic truths, rejecting its true principles. Thus do they deem the divine immortals as distant and indistinct, the alchemical texts as frivolous and absurd. The *Wuzhen*’s teachings and the Perfected One’s intent remain unrecognized in the world.

Yet the Nameless One, inheriting the orthodox transmission, lamented the proliferation of errors in its annotations and thus released this commentary into the world. Dividing chapters and explicating sentences, he meticulously distinguished each detail, fully revealing the celestial mechanisms and exhaustively recording them within. Through diligent study and profound reflection, one may attain understanding.

My great-uncle, from childhood, revered the Dao and has studied this text for years. Heaven opened his heart, granting him access to its mysteries. Drawing from his father’s and teachers’ instructions, as well as his own insights, he appended this exposition to the Nameless One’s commentary, that future seekers might use it as a standard, avoiding the pitfalls of vagueness and delusion.

How vast is his intent! By karmic affinity, I obtained this book, for which I am profoundly grateful. How might I encounter companions beyond the mundane, treading the fragrant paths to cultivate truth, riding the immortal winds to distant realms? Establishing the crucible and furnace, inhaling and exhaling dragon and tiger, inverting mercury and lead, gathering them in an instant, gestating for ten months, refining for nine years—then, serene, I would mount the flying chariot, cross the Weak Waters, stride the sacred turtle, and stand in the presence of the immortals, hearing the Great Dao of the Reclusive One and rescuing the drowning. This is my aspiration: to emulate Zixian.

Written on the third day of the third lunar month in the *ding-chou* year of the Zhiyuan era by the disciple Dai Shun, bowing in reverence, at the Great Life Grotto-Heaven of Zhuhu.

**Alchemical Symbols of the Golden Elixir**
The Nameless One, in his *Wuzhen Pian* commentary, compiled the alchemical symbols of the Golden Elixir, employing myriad analogies—truly comprehensive. Qizong expanded this collection, gathering from the *Cantong Qi*, various immortal scriptures, treatises, poems, and lyrics. All metaphors drawn from celestial patterns, *Yijing* symbols, human affairs, principles, and objects—comparisons to the yin-yang alchemical symbols—are categorized into seven types and appended to the *Wuzhen Pian* commentary. Thus may students of immortality easily investigate them, discerning the distinctions and similarities between internal and external, their mutual symbolic resonance.

The sequence of the Five Phases’ transformations defies fixed nomenclature. Clarifying their fundamental unity, distinguishing the names of their metaphorical variations, the enlightened masters’ teachings may all be unified. Through this, one may forget the true fishing line and, by this means, achieve the immortal Dao—no small benefit indeed.
