**The Praise of the Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing***

**Chapter of the Dao/Way Embracing Unity to Manifest the Divine**

To observe the Dao/Way of Heaven, to grasp Heaven’s actions—this is complete.
Within Heaven, the symbols hang, refining the primordial essence;
The supreme Dao/Way flows harmoniously in the boundless void.

To attain the One and observe Heaven’s Dao/Way reveals no other path;
The Yellow Emperor’s fundamental essence is made clear in its entirety.

Thus, Heaven has five thieves—those who see them flourish.
The enlightened mind perceives the radiance of the Nine-One;
The Five Stars gather in the *Li Xiang* (离乡, "Exile’s Field").

If mortals could cultivate and obtain them,
The Yellow Emperor’s praise of the five thieves would be in vain.

The five thieves dwell in the heart,
Manifesting in Heaven’s actions.

When the five thieves are subdued, Heaven’s gates turn;
In sequence, they disperse, returning to the Nine.

The golden door of *Jin Hua* (金华, "Golden Splendor") opens within arm’s reach,
The King of Huai Nan harvests without hindrance.

The universe lies within the hand,
Ten thousand transformations arise from the body.

A skilled hand can grasp the light of sun and moon,
Emerging from the body, the myriad forms unfold like the Yellow River’s coiling hexagram.

The Dao’s universe is flawless and without blemish;
Without enlightenment, how could one know the *Kan* (坎, "Abyss") holds the Yang?

Heaven’s nature is human;
Human mind is the mechanism.

Heaven’s advantage and humanity’s harmony align with the cosmos,
The mind’s deepest sensitivity unlocks the Dao’s hidden paths.

The numinous essence is not without feeling—
When the way is found, its power is proven.

To establish Heaven’s Dao/Way is to set humanity’s foundation.
Heaven’s One (天一) reveals the Yang light, shining westward,
Wood’s Three (木三) green qi takes it as its mate.

Water and Mercury are not the true essence of lead,
Yet how does the *Kan* (坎) recognize the *Gui* (圭, "Jade Scepter")?

When Heaven unleashes its killing intent,
Dragons and serpents rise upon the land.

When Heaven compensates the General’s *Bing* (丙) to restore his authority,
Dragons and serpents retreat from the land, ceasing their ravages.

The *Tai Qing* (太清, "Supreme Clarity") Sea transforms into the Penglai Isle,
Fixed in the *Geng Xin* (庚辛) position, standing alone in majesty.

When humanity unleashes its killing intent,
Heaven and Earth recoil in chaos.

If killing qi spreads through the *Yan Gong* (炎宫, "Fiery Palace"),
Even rats scurrying in confusion leave no trace.

In *Ji Zi* (既济, "Already Completed"), dragons and tigers appear in transit,
The *Kan Li* (坎离, "Abyss-Fire") reversal is sealed—its depths cannot be fathomed.

When Heaven and humanity both unleash their intent,
The myriad transformations rest upon a fixed foundation.

Human and Heaven’s paths merge like twin strings,
Advancing and retreating, their radiance shifts day and night.

The myriad transformations now flow within the divine chamber,
The foundation established in the single *Dan Tian* (丹田, "Elixir Field").

Nature has its clever and clumsy;
Both can be concealed.

When virtue is accumulated and perfected, the great *Bian Yin* (辨音, "Discriminating Sound") emerges,
Wisdom and folly in humanity’s methods sink into the depths.

The path to the clouds is not distant—
The clumsy may fail to grasp its essence with their minds.

The nine orifices’ malevolence lies in the three essentials;
The *Ding* (鼎, "Cauldron") guards against deceit in the Eight Gates.

Seal the three essentials to restrain the Yang spirit,
And the *Fu Yao* (复爻, "Returning Trigrams") will turn, dispelling ill omens until reaching *Kun* (坤, "Earth").

It can be applied in motion and stillness.
Fire is born from Wood—disaster arises, yet must be overcome.
Deceit is born within the realm—when the time moves, it collapses.

Wood generates true Fire, turning disaster into blessing,
The body shifts to the Just Metal position, gaining even greater honor.

If the *Fa Xiang* (法象, "Methodic Forms") are incomplete, benevolence and righteousness will falter,
Where then is the path to find the deceitful gates?

To know and refine—this is called the Sage.
The Daoist’s bones can traverse the upper and lower truths,
Knowledge shines forth in an extraordinary form.

Refining lead to achieve the flowing pearl’s dwelling,
The Yellow Emperor’s power will aid in its completion.

To enrich the land and secure the people—manifesting the method (Chapter Middle)
Heaven’s creation and Heaven’s destruction are the Dao’s principle.
The red marrow (赤髓) arises to subdue the white Heaven,
Meeting the Yang, it returns to lead as the killing intent is fulfilled.

Mercury is a single elixir for the Daoist’s fortune,
Abiding in Fire—this is no mere coincidence.

Heaven and Earth are the thieves of all things;
Heaven’s *Li Xiang* (离乡, "Exile’s Field") opens the path of *Gui* (圭, "Jade Scepter"),
Encompassing all forms within the fluid embrace of *Kan* (坎) and *Kun* (坤).

Alas, how petty the thieves of creation are—
The five thieves cross paths day and night, fleeing in disarray.

All things are humanity’s thieves.
Humanity seeks Earth’s advantage, all in harmony,
Yet who knows the rise and fall of creation’s true purpose?

The *Yuan Yang* (元阳, "Primordial Yang") is hidden—why does it not steal?
The *Yuan Yin* (元阴, "Primordial Yin") drifts by in vain for a hundred years.

Humanity is the thief of all things.
Hunger for food, cold for clothing—nurturing the body’s hues,
Yet unaware that the floating illusions steal the spirit’s essence.

How better to delve into the *Yin Fu*’s principles,
To avoid being ensnared by the cycles of flourishing and decay!

The three thieves are pacified, the Three Powers (三才) are secure.
Thus it is said:
To eat in season, all limbs are in order.
To move the mechanism, all transformations are at ease.

The three thieves align with the One, entering the *Dui Gong* (兑宫, "Joy Palace"),
The four seasons encounter the *Jin Gong* (金公, "Metal Authority") with reliance.

The Daoist’s peach ripens beautifully, extending sinew and bone,
A hundred monsters’ mechanisms swiftly reveal their fates.

Humanity knows its spirit when it is manifest,
Yet does not know the spirit’s absence—nor how it manifests.

The Dao’s principles stand as eternal foundations,
The spirit requires the method’s radiance to shine.

The white gold’s traces are hidden—who can measure them?
The *Tai Yi* (太一, "Supreme Unity") knows their coming, aiding the Sage and Emperor.

Sun and moon have their appointed numbers,
Great and small have their fixed positions.
From this, the Sage’s achievements arise,
And the divine brilliance is revealed.

The soul and spirit’s essence flourishes in the Nine-One,
Returning and transforming, pairing in perfect correspondence.

The Sage’s achievements gradually awaken, filling the air with fragrant qi,
The divine chamber’s arrival is certain—it must ascend.

Their thieving mechanisms are such that
No one beneath Heaven can see or know them.
Yet the myriad transformations’ functions cover the One,
And all people witness them, though none can articulate them.

When Yin accumulates, its solution lies in Yin’s enlightenment,
In the flash of stone and fire, one encounters the lotus.

The noble attains it and remains steadfast,
The petty gain it and lose their lives.

The Daoist wards off deceit, refining the cauldron’s heart,
The *Dao* (刀, "Knife") and *Gui* (圭, "Jade Scepter") grow old, filling the Yin in rotation.

The foolish cling to petty gains from the Heavenly officials’ methods,
Lightly valuing life, they only revere the *Dian Hua Jin* (点化金, "Refined Gold").

The myriad sights divide into ten thousand vistas—
With palms, the sage turns the **Heavenly Sphere** and **Earthly Balance**;
Before all things, the heart reveres the **Unobstructed Gate**,
And in the face of phenomena, it stands firm in **Non-duality**.

Leakage lies in **heedlessness**, yet mercy resides within oneself—
When things become the mark of life and death, the **Yang Soul** abides.
At **Supreme Joy**, nature overflows,
At **Supreme Stillness**, it is **pure and refined**.

Having fulfilled the work, one departs with ease from clamor and tumult,
And wanders freely at will in the **Lofty Dao’s Source**.
Guarding **naïveté**, preserving **modesty**,
Refining the **self** to **stillness**—
A single furnace’s **elixir meal** grants a lifespan of millennia.

**Heaven’s utmost secrecy**,
Yet its application is **utterly public**.
The **mechanism** of beasts lies in their **qi**;
**Heaven’s mechanism** makes them soar into **Divine Mysteries**,
And its **elevating power** remains ever fresh.

From **Mao** (卯), **gold and jade** are born, hidden yet flowing with **emerald clarity**,
While **Xu** (戌) and **Hai** (亥) become **auspicious fire**, the **key to passage**.

The living are the **root of death**,
The dead are the **root of life**.
To have the **root of life and death** is to grasp the **Divine**—
Slaying **mercury** refines the **elixir**, reviving the people.

If one abandons the **Five Phases**, they should not **steal**,
Yet without mastering the **Primordial Principle**, their words remain incomplete.

Mercy arises from **harm**,
Harm arises from **mercy**.
The **Moon’s Soul** brings mercy, its **embryo** lies in **Li** (离);
Again, relying on **Geng** (庚) to seize the **Refined Gold’s posture**.

When following **harm** to generate **mercy’s blessings**,
The **Five Omens** and **Tortoise** alone hold the secret.

The **foolish** revere **Heaven and Earth’s patterns** as **sacred**,
Yet the path from **mundane to sacred** is steep and winding,
The **Dao** aligning with **Heaven and Earth**, its **law** having **no and yes**.
The **garlic and mustard seeds** cast upon the peak return to their own dwelling,
Knowing the **Primordial Assembly** is unlike the **foolish**.

I grasp **time and things’ patterns** as **sagely profound**—
The **four seasons’ thin qi** shifts between **Yin and Yang**,
The **Divine Water** once pure now turns to **fermented elixir**.
Even on level ground, there is **lead**; **lead** is not **tin**,
Yet only by exhausting **Heaven’s Principle** can one measure its **wondrous subtleties**.

The **Dao of Nature** is **still**,
Thus **Heaven and Earth** give birth to the **myriad things**.
The **Two Primordials** harmonize, their **qi** balanced—
Phenomena are **carved and polished**, like jade under the knife.
All **movement and stillness** stem from the **Black Tortoise and White Hare’s** power,
The **Primordial Changes** I sing in the **Stone Man’s** hymn.

The **Dao of Heaven and Earth** is **deeply permeating**,
Thus **Yin and Yang** prevail.
The **Earthly Ascension** and **Heavenly Descent** are the **essence of the Primordial Pearl**,
Entering **mystery**, it becomes the **leaping fish of the elixir**.
**Yang’s movement** and **Yin’s dissipation** are **Divine**—
The **Day Soul** and **Moon Spirit** merge, their **origin** beyond knowing.
When **Yin and Yang** propel each other, **transformation** flows naturally—
Mutually **generating** and **conquering**, they **embrace and conceal**.
**Transformation** makes **lead** ascend, **stone** refine into **steel**.
**Decline reaching its extreme**, **prosperity follows**—
Who before their eyes is not **Yin and Yang**?

Thus the **sage** knows the **Dao of Nature** cannot be defied,
And so **follows it** to regulate their **mechanisms**.
The **Immortal’s** **regulation of qi** points to the **Primordial Machine**,
**Gold and Stone**’s **Yin and Yang** cannot be defied.
**Blessings and uses** stem from one **Gate**, as the **Ancients’** *I Ching* teaches—
The **Dao of the Triple Burner** aligns with **Heaven’s Mysteries**.

The **Dao of Supreme Stillness** cannot be measured by **calendars and rites**,
Yet even **birds and beasts** occupy their **positions**.
Here are **wondrous instruments**,
That generate the **myriad phenomena**.
The **Pure Yang** and **Supreme Stillness**—the **Dao of Penetrating Emptiness**—
Would never let **calendars and rites** constrain its **beginning and end**.

The **garlic key** and **mustard lock** hold no **concealment** for **birds and beasts**,
Yet within it lies the **Diagram of the Mixed Primordial**.
The **Eight Trigrams** and **Ten Heavenly Stems**—
The **Divine Machine** hides **ghostly secrets**.
**Li** (离) heads, **Kan** (坎) water, **Xun** (巽) **refines** the **metallic essence**,
**Dui** (兑) enters the **Dragon Palace**, **Zhen** (震) **purifies** the **jade clarity**.

**Jia** (甲) assembles with **Bing** (丙) and **Ren** (壬) in **Heaven’s ghostly concealment**,
**Geng** (庚), **Xin** (辛), **Bo** (艮) **must** **Kun** (坤) to **complete**.
The **art of conquering Yin and Yang** is **radiantly clear**—
The **beautiful maiden** seeks the **matchmaker** to preserve her **complexion**,
The **Yellow Sage** heeds the **Divine** and **rectifies** his **conduct** at the **court’s threshold**.

Hand in hand, they enter the **Golden Flower’s Peak**,
And spend the day at leisure within **Heaven and Earth’s** embrace.
They advance beyond **symbols**—
Looking back on **worldly desires**, they ponder the **path**,
Yet the **journey’s progress** has its **route**, leading to the **Immortal’s fork**.

Only seek the **Yin Symbol’s Principle** above,
For **Heaven’s Way** is **manifest**—one who **sees** knows it.
The **Yellow Emperor’s** *Yin Symbol Classic* is **completed**.
