**Invocation of Marshal Zhao**
Spirit-communication grandly evolving,
Sacred virtue luminously manifest—
Congealing form at the Great Brahmā’s inception,
Revealing transformations in the boundless world.
Wielding whip and lasso,
Driving tigers and subduing demons,
Soaring through the Three Realms—ghosts and spirits tremble;
A single breath—heaven and earth quake.
Majestic radiance resplendent,
None disobey his unspoken will;
Mystic mirror’s spirit-brilliance,
All who seek find response.
Rescuing living beings from suffering,
Preserving households and nations in peace,
Extolling the Dao’s Dharma without end,
Eternally upholding the mystic wind—
Great compassion, great vows,
Great sage, great mercy,
Heaven-Assisting Vast Saint,
*As-You-Will* *Harmonious* *Primordial* *Spirit* Great Divine Lord.
