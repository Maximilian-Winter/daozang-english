**Illuminating the Dao: A Treatise**

**Title:** *Illuminating the Dao* (*Mingdao Pian*). Composed by Wang Weiyi of the Yuan dynasty. One fascicle. Based on the text from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* section, *Zhongshu* category.

**Preface to *Illuminating the Dao***

The Dao is inherently luminous, yet without humanity, it cannot be fully illuminated. When humanity illuminates the Dao, without the Dao, humanity cannot be perfected. Thus, the wise and discerning invariably establish teachings to reveal the Dao, preserving their true nature through it.

In my youth, I studied Confucianism and gained a rough understanding of the Six Classics, comprehending the Dao of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, music, and moral transformation, as well as the principles of heaven, earth, and the myriad things. I privately wondered: since the Three Powers (heaven, earth, and humanity) are founded upon the same Dao, why does the movement of heaven and earth endure so long, while the span of human life is so brief?

Upon reading the words of *Laozi*, I was struck with realization: "That by which heaven and earth endure so long is their non-self-cultivation, and thus they attain long life. That by which humans perish so swiftly is their insistence on self-preservation, and thus they invite early death." Observing the myriad creatures, I saw that beasts, birds, insects, and plants all undergo transformation—dung beetles become cicadas, rotting grass turns into fireflies, sparrows enter water and become clams, pheasants enter the sea and become giant clams, field mice transform into mandarin ducks, and fish scales become dragons. If even these beings can change, how much more so humanity, the most spiritually endowed of all creatures? Surely we can preserve our inherent nature and become immortals of eternal life.

Yet the six desires and seven emotions plunder our vitality, while the snares of fame and the shackles of profit deeply corrupt us. With such constant depletion, premature death becomes inevitable. We cherish life but lack the art of prolonging it; we dread death but possess no means to transcend it.

Having been born into this world and dwelling in the Central Kingdom, how could I not contemplate the great matter of life and death, seeking the method to transmit the Dao across ten thousand kalpas? Thus, I wandered beyond the mundane, pursuing the study of the Golden Elixir and the supreme Dao. Though I examined the scriptures of the Three Teachings, practiced thunder rites, supplications, medicine, divination, and astrology—mastering all without discrimination—and consulted both wise and foolish teachers and friends, I could not attain it in a single step. The Dao is most profound; only through diligent devotion day and night, accumulating sincerity until it moves heaven, did I finally encounter a perfected being who personally transmitted the supreme, most wondrous Dao. With a single word, the true essence was directly revealed.

Upon reflection, I realized the Dao is not at all strange or esoteric; the key lies in utmost sincerity and the investigation of things to extend knowledge. Abandoning the selfishness of human desires and preserving the impartiality of heavenly principle, one naturally discovers boundless medicinal ingredients within the heart and infinite fire symbols within the body. The more the medicine is refined, the more inexhaustible it becomes; the more the fire is cultivated, the more ceaseless it grows.

Having attained this Dao, I dared not keep it for myself. Thus, I reverently composed eighty-one poems, adhering to the pure yang number of nine nines. Among them are sixteen heptasyllabic quatrains, corresponding to the number two eights; sixty-four jueju, corresponding to the sixty-four hexagrams; one pentasyllabic verse, symbolizing the singularity of the Great One; and twelve *Xijiangyue* lyrics, aligning with the twelve pitch standards. I titled this work *Illuminating the Dao*. Within it, the weights and measures of medicinal ingredients, fire times, and alchemical methods—details left incomplete in other elixir classics—are all fully expounded, serving as a guide.

The sages of old established teachings to reveal the Dao and preserve the true nature, yet the will of heaven is secret. How could one not fear the transgression of careless disclosure? Nevertheless, I vow that all under heaven who study this may attain the supreme Dao. If the intent is sincere, what need is there to chase after fortune and misfortune, stumbling along the way?

To those of like mind: if you can delve into the text, grasp its meaning, forget the images to follow the real, and attain even a single insight to hold it forever—this is my deepest wish.

Respectfully inscribed in the mid-autumn of the *jiachen* year of the Dade era by Wang Weiyi, a later student from Songjiang, styled Jingyangzi.

**Sixteen Regulated Poems Arranged by the Gate of Two and Eight**

Life drifts like a dream through fleeting time,
Vainly hoarding wealth and amassing gold.
Sensual pleasures ravage heaven-and-earth’s nature,
The spirit chases after profit and fame.
Love’s river tosses waves from which none escape,
The burning house sears deeper with each karmic deed.
Thus a whole life is idly spent—
Even rebirth cannot compare to the present.

To study the Dao, first clarify essence, qi, and spirit;
Only by perfecting these three does the Dao draw near.
To speak of "non-being" or "being" is all delusion—
Trace back to the source to grasp the real.
Hold to the central, unbiased thought,
Luminous and free, unstained by dust.
If you fathom this mystery within the profound,
The Three Teachings all return to this single self.

The Dao of nature is fundamentally non-action,
Yet clinging to non-action becomes action.
Forget words once meaning is grasped—only then is it complete;
Clinging to form and image leads to confusion.
When body and mind are still, they embrace heaven and earth,
Spirit and qi harmonize, uniting Kan and Li.
Who among men truly comprehends these wondrous secrets?
How many know them, how many perceive?

The Mysterious Pass is the hardest to illuminate—
Without mind-to-mind transmission, do not act rashly.
If you recognize where thoughts arise,
You will know the Dao is born within.
Before yin and yang divided, there was no form;
When sun and moon conjoin, where is there emotion?
If you seek the true meaning,
Midday is the third watch of the night.

All things arise within creation’s womb,
Yet once self and other divide, the Dao grows distant.
When spring returns to the valley, every home warms,
When the moon reaches the sky’s heart, every household shares its light.
Fish leaping and kites soaring follow this principle,
Cranes calling and children responding come from the depths.
My Dao, vast, embraces heaven and earth—
Yet to call it "mindless" is but emptiness.

Kan and Li together form one household,
The iron ox plows the river chariot day and night.
Nature returns to the primal sea, birthing golden nectar,
Life reverts to emptiness, yielding jade blossoms.
The four images harmonize into one earth,
The five phases cluster to forge the three flowers.
Silently circulating the fire of the celestial cycle,
Golden flowers burst forth in ninefold radiance.

Yin and yang, movement and stillness cannot be forced—
Wasting spirit in vain striving is folly.
The Dao lies before you, yet most fail to perceive it;
The pearl hidden in the belly is known by few.
Yan lived in a humble lane yet his heart was ever joyful,
Shun dwelled in deep mountains yet his resolve never wavered.
The principle is the same throughout the world—
To rigidly divide teachings is but fragmentation.

The Dao’s sprouts lie within the body—
Why seek herbs or burn thatch?
Heaven and earth, sun and moon turn with the heart,
Soul and spirit unite as the will commands.
Know fate by observing Qian’s unbroken line,
Rejoice in heaven by contemplating Fu’s first hexagram.
Fortune and misfortune, regret and shame arise from action—
Abide in stillness like a fool, delighting in the sage’s womb.

The supreme Dao has never been easily transmitted;
The true meaning lies in the center of creation.
Split open chaos to part heaven and earth,
Cleave the primordial mist to gather mercury and lead.
If desire is not extinguished, studying the Dao is futile;
If greed is not severed, seeking immortality is vain.
To know the place of returning to the source,
The fleeing hare and flying crow never leave the sky.

I earnestly urge you to forget words once meaning is grasped—
Yet students cling to them, carving thorns.
The clear sky and bright moon of mid-autumn,
The green willows and red blossoms of second-month spring—
Why seek Buddha on Putuo,
Or search for truth in grotto heavens?
If you know *this* true message,
You are a carefree being beyond the world.

No need to fixate on capturing the earthly soul,
Nor strive to restrain the celestial spirit.
Without the heart’s false thoughts, the Dao is hard to attain;
Cutting off intent and forgetting scheming is the return to the source.
What need is there to divine hexagrams or cast lots?
Even if you gain one, you have only met the origin.

Let me reveal the immortal’s principle to you—
It does not lie in the three thousand six hundred gates.
All the myriad forms reside within Kun,
Before your eyes, yet no words can discuss it.
Calm the mind, dispel desire—then spirit lives;
Nurture nature, forget form—then the Dao abides.
Always let the golden crow return to the moon’s cave,
Never let the jade hare leave the sky’s root.
With but a moment’s effort,
A grain of golden elixir enters the mouth and is swallowed.

The primordial One divides into two,
Formless and imageless, yet following thought it arises.
The common folk know not its daily use,
But the sage investigates and moves with the times.
Neither increasing nor diminishing, it dwells in the central Dao;
Neither coming nor going, it guards single sincerity.
All phenomena before you

Drool, spittle, essence, saliva, qi, blood, and fluids—
Disciple, do not grasp these as the foundation of the elixir.
Within the heart lies the natural medicine,
In daily use and constant practice, you must know it.

To refine the elixir, use only gold within water,
Seek it in the root of the primordial.
When the first yang stirs,
Act swiftly—do not hesitate.

If you do not recognize the yin essence, do not recklessly cultivate,
Vainly exhausting spirit and thought in futile pursuit.
Simply preserve Heaven’s principle, free from selfish bias—
No need to ride the ox in search of the ox.

To refine the returning elixir, first employ lead,
Withdraw and add fire with precise focus.
Hare and rooster bathe—beware danger,
Without movement, how can it accord with nature?

To study the Dao, first understand the moment of receiving qi,
When in the womb, a single breath dwells in chaos.
Following Kun’s body, return to Qian’s seed—
A single spark of spirit pierces the Great Void.

The golden crow in the sky, the crimson in the sea,
Yin demons vanish—now is the time to work.
Do not let qi grow turbid or spirit scatter,
Lest mercury flee, lead fly, and the elixir crucible empty.

Gather spirit, sit in stillness within the crystal palace,
Bone-chilling coolness, the heart’s earth empty.
Water, fire, wood, and metal return to one place,
No more south or north, west or east.

At leisure, scoop the bright moon from the pool’s depths,
When the hour comes, bind the clouds atop the peak.
In stillness, suddenly grasp the key to heaven and earth,
The myriad phenomena all fade into silence.

To refine cinnabar into living mercury,
Know that mercury is the spirit of cinnabar.
In truth, they are one—doubt not their duality,
The host sinks, the guest floats.

The generation of the Three Powers lies solely in this truth,
Forcibly named the Dao, the heart, the spirit.
Sitting or walking, they ever guard one another,
Yet foolish mortals, lost in delusion, refuse their kinship.

To refine the elixir, recognize the great returning heart,
Do not seek it in side doors or minor arts.
In thirty thousand moments, without interruption,
Turn tiles and stones into gold.

The medicine gathers the primordial true unity of qi,
The fire seeks the Supreme One’s chaos crystal.
To know where medicine and fire work,
Qi must be full, spirit complete—then the elixir forms.

Within the moon is the hare, the yang body,
Within the sun hides the rooster, the yin.
If you grasp hare and rooster returning to wu and ji,
Why enter the mountains to cultivate the Dao?

The Dao is formless, yet we force it a name,
Seen not, heard not, soundless and scentless.
It embraces heaven and earth in boundless wonder,
Yet those of shallow fortune find it hard to achieve.

Spirit loves life, yet people harm spirit,
Laboring the heart, wasting qi, ruining the body.
Alas! The world is thus—
How many attain the Dao and commune with spirit?

Life and death both arise from the thirteen,
Who awakens to delight in purity and leisure?
Originally empty, ever still,
When thought ceases and the heart is void, one transcends the world.

Cherish essence, treasure qi, nurture the primordial spirit,
But toil and strain the body—keep them apart.
In solitude, non-action, without attachment,
The true person appears, leaving the mortal form.

The Dao generates heaven and earth, dividing into Kan and Li,
Kan and Li give birth to the myriad beings.
Over years and ages, all return to dust,
Forget form—only then see the original truth.

In the world, humans are the spirit of the ten thousand things,
Yet all follow transformation without pause.
If you know where the ten thousand things return to their root,
You see how cold congeals water into ice.

To seek fish and hare, you must use traps and snares,
Without them, success is uncertain.
Yet do not cling to traps and snares as the true use—
Only then understand the state before chaos divided.

The medicine arises in the southwest, the path impassable,
The path opens—you must ask the master.
By the green willow embankment, ride the wind away,
Everywhere, yellow sprouts—endless to gather.

The great medicine is none other than heaven and earth’s essence,
Gather it with secret intent, refine it to completion.
For the work of return is no shallow task—
A moment’s error brings calamity.

Gather the medicine when gui is born,
Do not mistake heavenly gui for rouge.
If you say breath is cultivation,
How can other things serve as the medicine’s king?

The method of beginning is rarely known,
Once grasped, seal your lips lest others stray.
Now the celestial mechanism is revealed,
Examine closely the Kun and Fu hexagrams.

To form the embryo, bind the original truth,
Not apart from the body’s essence, qi, and spirit.
Gradually bind, gradually congeal—do not break the thread,
Ten months of work—then the true person is born.

Once true lead is used, discard it,
Like a hen brooding eggs, qi unbroken.
The jade crucible’s warmth nurtures for three full years—
Who says the mortal body cannot become immortal?

Begin with Fu, end with Qian—yang fire completes its cycle,
Yin tally flourishes, seeking Kun.
The boundless intent of ten thousand ages—
You must ever begin within.

In the twelve hours, only one hour,
Within that hour, few know.
When chaos first stirs at Qian’s inception,
The work of advancing fire cannot delay.

Count a hundred moments as one,
Medicine and fire must not part.
Utterly pure, without a speck of impurity,
Only then trust the child nurtured in nothingness.

Even if you know the body’s mercury and lead,
Without true earth, it is in vain.
If you say the yellow chamber is the earthen crucible,
How can you ascend to the ninth heaven?

Knowing true earth, receiving the correct transmission,
Yet without understanding fire timing, it is still futile.
Clinging to hexagrams, moving through lines,
Wasting spirit, never becoming immortal.

Fire timing is non-action, harmonizing with nature,
Beyond nature, there is no immortality.
Always preserve a single thought, dwelling in the central Dao,
Ask not of prior or posterior heaven.

Do not regard the embryo’s release as trivial,
This work demands precision.
When the season arrives, grasp it firmly,
Return to the root, restore life—ascend the celestial altar.

Completing life is not as good as first completing nature,
Only when nature is bright does life become free of demons.
To know where nature and life reside,
When intent has not yet arisen, unite with supreme harmony.

Life may be transmitted, but nature is hard to pass on,
The foolish, blindly cultivating, are truly pitiable.
Without the true person’s oral instructions,
Exhausting spirit and soul only invites transgression.

The subtlety of my Dao lies in sincerity,
Without sincerity, nothing exists—the Dao is hard to approach.
Still and unmoving, soundless and scentless,
In the midst of the indistinct, see the original truth.

The sage, without desire, is only pure unity,
Still—empty and bright; moving—impartial.
The slightest interruption,
And yin evil obscures, blocking the way.

Do not depart for even a moment—this is the Dao,
Is it not so in the twelve hours?

Guard the center and harmony without admixture,
Assisting heaven and aiding transformation—its wonder cannot be preempted.
Before human desire arises, heavenly principle abides;
The moment a thought stirs, spirits and gods already know.

Do not deceive in the slightest or conceal—hold reverent awe,
In daily conduct and constant practice, never transgress.
Good and evil both arise within a single thought;
A single misstep in thought separates one by a thousand barriers.

If you know there is no good and no evil,
You will stand serene and immovable as Mount Tai.
Human nature is born inherently natural,
Only swayed by objects and led astray by emotion.

If you comprehend the principle within the hexagrams of *Qian*,
You will ever resemble a hidden dragon seen in the fields.
The human heart is perilous, the Dao-heart subtle—
The noble one, at all times, aligns with the sage’s mechanism.

In darkness, do not deceive as if in broad daylight;
Always practice vigilant solitude, never stray.
When one curbs desire, one rests in peace;
A single thought, clarified and empty, turns inward in observation.

Neither impropriety nor unkindness—restrain reckless action,
And naturally, regrets and misfortunes will not concern you.
The Dao resides in daily conduct and constant practice,
Not in lofty discourse or emptiness.

Simply follow the human Dao with an unashamed heart,
And when you fully realize your nature, you will know heaven and earth as one.
Observe *Qian* before a single line is drawn—what form does it take?
With the first stroke, the myriad images arise.

Regrets, misfortunes, fortune, and calamity all stem from movement,
Yet *Qian* persists all day without departing from sincerity.
All affairs in the world arise from the heart,
But the heart, being formless, where can it be sought?

If you grasp it before a single thought arises,
Only then do you truly see the original heart.
To study the Dao, one must fathom the heart of heaven and earth,
Yet rarely does one hear of a kindred spirit in the world.

This principle is too profound to lightly disclose,
So most seek it along crooked byways and winding paths.
Between *Kun* and *Fu*, the principle is most subtle—
Even spirits and gods, though wondrous, cannot fathom it.

To know this true message,
Study thoroughly Shao Yong’s *Winter Solstice* poem.
When heaven and earth unite, the myriad things are born;
Only after spirit and thought arise does the Dao flourish.

Constantly observe the wondrous flow of the Supreme Polarity—
Nothing exists without sincerity, and nothing fails to reach completion.
The central One receives the heart’s transmission of creation;
Thirsty, drink; hungry, eat; weary, sleep.

Wherever you encounter circumstances, all are wondrous applications—
Once you understand the mandate of sincerity, it is not left to heaven.
The moment a thought turns deluded, affliction arises;
Only when the heart is empty does the realm become empty.

Empty yet not empty—it can illuminate all,
Perceiving without obstruction in the vastness of the Great Void.
Before you recognize true emptiness, do not speak of emptiness,
For clinging to emptiness easily loses the master.

If you wish to know the true message within emptiness,
It lies entirely in the undivided state of primordial chaos.
All things are empty, yet nature is not void—
Within emptiness, apply your effort.

When emptiness reaches the point where not even a speck of dust can stand,
A golden light fills the room, and the mysterious pearl appears.
To study the Dao, one must know the matter of life and death;
Without knowing life and death, one vainly seeks immortality.

Only by knowing life can one know death;
Coming and going without constraint, follow nature.
Originally, there is neither death nor life—
A single errant thought gives rise to the myriad forms.

If you recognize where thoughts arise and cease,
A bright moon shines in the central courtyard.
Before your eyes, no dharma can be sought—
Mountains remain green, waters flow on their own.

Within the twelve hours, maintain a single thought;
Within thought, no thought—this is true cultivation.
To shatter emptiness, no fists are needed;
A dead heart sitting in vain is futile.

The master’s wondrous art requires few words—
It only teaches one to refine mercury and lead.
In cultivation, one must recognize the master within;
Without recognition, all cultivation is in vain.

Only by awakening to the true and constant can one attain the Dao,
Exiting the Three Realms and manifesting spiritual powers.
All dharmas are empty, not even one remains—
Like a flake of snow melting in a red-hot furnace.

*Qian* and *Kun*, *Li* and *Kan*—all are of no use;
The Great Dao was ever a level path.

---

**Regulated Verse**

Wondrously merging with the true and constant,
Utterly without a trace of yin.
In profound obscurity, the supreme treasure is preserved;
In the indistinct, true gold is born.

To speak of the Dao is no longer the Dao;
Only when the heart is stilled is the heart seen.
The true creation of the primordial,
Is sought solely within the One.

---

**Twelve *Xijiangyue***

Before the Supreme Polarity divided, chaos reigned;
Once the Two Modes emerged, it was no longer within.
The moment the first yang stirred, primordial chaos was broken—
Creation began its workings from then on.

Water and fire rise and sink, north and south;
Wood and metal are separated, east and west.
Slightly shift the Dipper’s handle to point at *Kun*—
All five phases are interwoven.

Sun and moon conjoin at new and full moons,
Tortoise and snake are born in the void of *Xu* and *Wei*.
The *Xun* wind ever blows toward *Kan*—
Fire’s dryness must rely on the spirit-water.

Movement and stillness both arise from the heart’s intent,
Harmonizing with heaven’s virtue without transgression.
The wondrous principle is utterly clear—what doubt remains?
Why speak of the short and long, life and death?

A single speck of true yang resides in *Kan*;
Move it to transform the yin of *Li*.
This creation’s meaning is profound—
One must first clarify the heart and see nature.

The wonder lies in not being stained by a single speck of dust,
Naturally, one remains unmoved by circumstances.
Pitiable are those in the world who lack kindred spirits—
Those who grasp it transcend the ordinary and enter sagehood.

The Great Dao flows as one through ancient and modern,
Transmitted mouth to mouth by sages.
Alas, the common people do not know—
They are all lost in the pursuit of form and sound.

Near at hand, no need to seek afar;
Why wait to encounter immortals?
It is clearly before your very eyes,
In daily conduct and constant practice—yet unseen.

My Dao is most noble and precious;
Without the innate capacity, it is hard to know.
One must subdue the self to reach non-action,
Only then is the original heavenly principle seen.

The myriad transformations all arise from within;
From ancient times to now, nothing is lacking or in excess.
If one can ensure movement and stillness do not transgress,
How is one different from the immortals?

To study the Dao, one must be fierce and resolute,
Steadfastly guarding the original heart to the end.
Not even the slightest desire should intrude—
Only then can spirit congeal and qi settle.

Movement and stillness never depart from the center;
Yang arises, and all yin is exhausted.
Dragon descends, tiger submits—spirits and gods revere;
When the path is complete, one ascends to the immortal realm.

Once the golden elixir is attained, the task is done—
No need to seek the White Tiger or Green Dragon.
Clinging to written words and fixed images, the principle is hard to grasp;
The wonder lies in neither lead nor mercury.

Temper and nurture the body and heart without movement,
Filled with the harmonious qi of spring’s breeze.
Suddenly, deluded thoughts vanish, and effort is gone—
Yet one still relies on the Yellow Dame to guide.

Though you read a myriad alchemical classics,
If you do not understand true mercury and true lead,
And if the fire times have not been transmitted,
All is blind cultivation and reckless refinement.

A single phrase of true revelation is wondrously manifest—
Once grasped, the heart-ground becomes luminous.
Spirit returns, qi submits—no deviation;
Moment by moment, all is forged into one.

The Great Elixir has no weight or measure,
Who knows its endless abundance when gathered?
The southwest’s secluded path is hard to traverse—
Yet with intent, no need to strain mind or force.

Kun’s *gui* congeals into the true seed,
Transplanted to Qian’s palace to grow.
Though mountain rains lash and winds rage,
The deep roots stand firm, unshaken below.

True fire originally has no season,
Do not bind it to days, months, or years.
Ponder the time before chaos was riven—
What proof of years could then appear?

Leap beyond the Five Phases’ domain,
Not a thread of dust clings to your frame.
Only then is the wonder within wonders known—
A single pearl of treasure will brightly shine.

Bathing is not in *mao* or *you*,
Nor is the solstice sought at midnight’s hour.
Simply walk the central Way, no cultivation needed—
Then trust that being arises from non-being’s power.

The cosmos rests within my grasp,
I ride an iron horse at leisure’s pace.
Unfettered, unbound, I wander free,
Day and night, flowers in my hair, wine I embrace.

*Li* and *Kan* know no south or north,
Wood and Metal do not divide east from west.
Hold sincerely to the one thought at the center,
Let neither heart nor spirit stray or rest.

To recognize the true seed of past lives,
See through all things—self and other—empty, clear.
Abide in stillness, return to primordial chaos,
Where Four Images and Five Phases disappear.

**On the Subtleties of the Golden Elixir**

The Dao originally dwells in silence, beyond scent or sound,
Yet manifests in daily acts and constant motion.
Heaven and Earth, vast as they are, cannot exist beyond this Dao,
And the human heart, though subtle, holds it without exception.

The Dao resides in the human heart, unchanging through the ages,
Forgotten in the realm beyond words.
Yet when simplicity scattered and purity dissolved,
The human heart lost sight of the Dao.
The sages fell silent, and later generations had nothing to transmit.
Thus, the sages of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism arose in their time,
Adapting their teachings to the era,
All guiding the world back to the Dao.

Alas, with the division of teachings,
Scholars clung to their own doctrines,
Each exalting their views, private biases flourishing,
And the common truth gradually faded.
Did they not consider that the ancient sages established teachings to save their age,
Following different paths to the same goal,
Shaping change like the square and circle—
Not like the fixed vessels of which Zigong spoke?

Thus, when people fail to grasp the intent of our Master’s "no intent, no necessity, no rigidity, no self,"
The Buddha’s teaching of the Nature School cannot be realized—
For these are the very principles of the Master’s four "no’s."
The Nature School is not something the careless can attain,
Yet Laozi’s Way of the Golden Elixir flourished.
All these teachings arose to remedy the ills of their time.

Alas, the Way of the Golden Elixir thrives in a declining age.
Later cultivators of the Golden Elixir,
Not only fail to fathom its profound meaning,
But even in the *Wuzhen Pian* of Master Ziyang,
They misconstrue the fire times as "not bound to seasons,"
The solstice as "not at midnight,"
And the bathing method as "not in *mao* or *you*"—
All empty comparisons.

Master Bai of Hainan gathered medicinal substances in stillness,
And conducted fire times within non-action.
Though his words can be recited,
I have yet to see one who truly understands their meaning.

Many cling to lead and mercury as medicinal materials,
Using years, months, days, and hours to regulate *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*,
Drawing and adding according to seasonal nodes—
Such practices have not reached the true Way.

Some recognize that lead and mercury are alternate names for medicinal substances,
And that civil and martial forces govern the fire times,
While years, months, days, hours, *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*
Are but remnants of primordial chaos—
This is rare indeed.

Yet those who take the generation of medicinal substances as fire times—
How is this different from asking where the body was before parents were born,
Or where qi existed before heaven and earth?
Some remain ignorant and fail to comprehend,
How can they fully grasp the Dao?
Have they not observed the workings of creation?

The sun and moon adorn the heavens,
Grasses and trees cling to the earth,
Wind and thunder take form,
Rain and dew bring moisture—
These are not random occurrences.
What force makes them so?

There must be something—
Something that is not a thing, yet governs things,
That takes form yet is not confined by form.
Ah! Is it not the true earth?
Is it not the handle of the Dipper?

The true earth is the master of medicinal substances,
The handle of the Dipper is the pivot of fire times.
Profound indeed!
The Master’s *Xici* says: "Essence and qi become things, wandering souls bring change."
Master Pingshu’s *Dan Jing* states: "True earth captures true lead, true lead restrains true mercury,
The Dipper’s handle revolves through the celestial cycle—
One must understand the culmination of gathering."

Master Haiqiong’s *Shang Wuzhen Shu* says:
"Within form, spirit is sovereign, for spirit is the life of form.
Within spirit, nature is supreme, for nature is the life of spirit.
From the spirit within form, enter the nature within spirit—
This is called returning to the root and restoring life."
Scholars should seek beyond the words.

Those who cannot look beyond the words,
And merely say, "Medicinal substances are fire times,"
What makes the Way of the Golden Elixir different
From seeking a steed by following a picture,
Or tuning a zither by gluing its pegs?

In essence, the key to the Golden Elixir lies in:
Distancing oneself from sensual pleasures,
Conquering selfish desires,
Setting aside self and others,
Fulfilling loyalty and filial piety,
Rectifying the heart and making intentions sincere,
Like Yan’s simplicity, like Shen’s dullness.

Take the Great Void as the crucible,
The sun and moon as medicinal materials,
Non-action and spontaneity as fire times,
Purity, stillness, and harmonious emptiness as nurturing,
Having a body beyond the body as rebirth,
Shattering the void as completion—
Only then can one merge with the Dao.

As Master Hainan said:
"Unite the myriad transformations into the One Dao,
Then the world transforms itself, and all things follow naturally.
Gather all actions into the One Heart,
Then the sage acts without acting, and all things arise without attachment."

From this, we know that "from Non-Ultimate comes the Supreme Ultimate,
And the Supreme Ultimate is originally Non-Ultimate"—
This is Master Lianxi’s Dao.
"The wondrous, singular spirit pervades the Dharma Realm"—
This is the supreme vehicle of Master Ziyang.

At this point, what were once called the "true soil" and the "Big Dipper’s handle" are but fishing baskets and rabbit snares. My aim in awakening others to this Dao is not to indulge in florid words and distort the truth. Should I lead even a single person astray, Heaven above bears witness.

As for those heterodox paths that mislead with cunning defenses, let the earnest seeker know well how to choose.

Fellow aspirants of like mind, diligently practice this Way. With sincere accumulation and enduring effort, how could one’s attainment be limited to self-cultivation alone? Some may yet extend their virtue to benefit all under Heaven, partaking in the workings of Heaven and Earth, aiding transformation and nurturing life—how could this be a separate path?

**Song of Attaining the Dao**
The Dao is hard to enter, hard to find,
Spoken of with ease, yet who truly walks its path?
Heterodox ways bewilder the world in myriad forms,
Among ten thousand seekers, scarcely one attains the truth.

There are those who study the Dao today,
Yet refuse to humble themselves—how pitiful!
Deceiving Heaven, deceiving Earth, deceiving others,
Claiming tenfold mastery before even grasping one.

To become an immortal is not so difficult,
But one must possess the essence of an immortal.
Those without it should not act recklessly,
For every move invites karmic shadows and enmity.

This matter is no trifling art;
It rests entirely on virtue and hidden good deeds.
Sever deluded thoughts, still the greedy heart,
Step by step, act by act, with steadfast roots and sincere mind.
Only when you awaken to your original nature and align it with the heart
May I dare speak to you of its true essence.

Studying the Golden Elixir is easy to begin,
But first savor the *Zhongyong* and the *Book of Changes*.
All contrived effort and forced action are false,
Speaking of dragons and tigers brings no benefit—
For the body arises from the stirring of emotion.

Should one persist in deluded practice, the path becomes thorny.
Instead, contemplate the state before Heaven and Earth divided,
Where wondrous principle is ineffable, yet the heart knows naturally.
The body, above and below, is all yin,
While the one yang essence eludes recognition.
Round and complete, it abides ever near,
Neither empty nor form, yet pervading all things under Heaven.
Within each thing lies a Supreme Ultimate,
Withdrawn in secrecy, hidden within one’s nature,
Invisible to sight, untraceable in search.

My elixir method is distinct:
It requires no days, hours, months, or years,
No fire times, no withdrawal or addition,
No division of self and other, no judgment of beauty or clumsiness.
Neither born nor destroyed,
Neither cultivated nor spoken of,
Hungry—eat; tired—sleep;
Idle—sit in meditation; weary—rest.
Encounter things and adapt; meet wine and drink,
Without strict fasting, yet the heart remains ever pure.
Wealth and glory hold no concern,
Fame, profit, right, and wrong are all severed.
Serene and still, nurture the primordial spirit,
With not a single thought arising—this is the true realm.

The true realm is joyous,
Day and night, beholding the mid-autumn moon within,
Neither coming nor going, centered and upright,
All eight directions radiant and bright.
Neither full nor lacking,
Like a red furnace covered in snow.
Though this skill is attained,
Only by shattering the void is completion achieved.
Carefree and joyful, wandering at ease,
The troubles of the world no longer touch you.

Seekers of the Dao, seize the moment!
A hundred years of life pass like lightning.
To encounter this and not refine it is utter folly—
Do not wait until old age, when spirit and qi are exhausted.

Turn back swiftly, act with fierce resolve,
Sever the ties with a single stroke, draw blood.
To shed the mortal body and don the Dharma-body,
Cultivate the single thought with iron resolve.

These words are urgent,
For I have revealed the celestial mechanism in full.
If learners treat them as trivial,
They may come to regret it too late when their end draws near.
