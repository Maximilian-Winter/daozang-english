*The Scripture of the Mysterious Terrace of the Stellar Balance: Essential Secrets*

**Title:** *Scripture of the Mysterious Terrace of the Stellar Balance: Essential Secrets*. Author unknown. Base text from *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* section, *Zhongjie* category.

The natures of the Five Phases differ each from the other:
Wood is unyielding and upright,
Fire is fierce and vehement,
Earth is kind and harmonious,
Metal is stern and resolute,
Water is modest and retiring.

**Method for Dispelling Malevolent Stars**
The *Canon of Human Relations* states: The *shen* and *you* positions are the Eight Killing Directions; these positions must never be exposed to fire. Guo Jingchun observed that fire setting in the west portends misfortune, and thus devised this method to dispel it.

First, one must prepare a privy, where incense is to be burned constantly. No one else may enter—only oneself. When performing the rite, one must loosen the hair and grasp a sword, standing within the privy. If no one appears for the span of a single *qingke*, place the sword in the privy, and the dispelling may proceed. Should anyone witness the act, neither party will escape misfortune.

At one such time, Huan Xuan chanced to see it. [Guo] Pu said: "Neither you nor I shall escape." Later, events unfolded exactly as he foretold. This method was deemed inauspicious and concealed as closely as the *Golden Casket Scripture*.

Later, Yixing and Li Quan recorded it in brush within the scrolls of this scripture. Yet I feared that shamans and sorcerers might exploit it for profit, and so during the Qianning era, I examined its errors and removed it, omitting it from the record. Now, however, I worry that the passage of years may cause the text to vanish entirely, and so I have transcribed it separately.

**Dispelling Rite**

When the fire star’s celestial motion reaches the *yuan* guardian palace, align its degrees with those of your birth, matching the distance and degree to determine the corresponding day. First, abstain from desires, and from dawn remain in a quiet chamber. After breakfast, at noon, disrobe, grasp your sword, enter the privy to perform the rite, then exit weeping softly. Return to the quiet chamber, bathe, and lie down for an hour. Observe what appears in your dreams—this will surely avert disaster. The rite may be performed twice.

If the vision is vague, suggesting official misfortune or illness, use cypress wood to carve a likeness of yourself, dress it in your own clothes, and when the fire star appears, stand with unbound hair, sword in hand, call your own name, and invoke the wooden effigy beneath the star. Summon your servants, then burn the effigy. Afterward, enter the quiet chamber, sit upright, and visualize your body. Disburse wealth to the poor, aid the needy, and perform hidden acts of virtue. The wooden figure should be three feet and two inches tall. Pay the craftsman generously and ensure secrecy. The clothing should match the figure’s height. Avoid monks, nuns, chickens, and dogs—if the star reaches the *yuan* guardian, disaster will strike as before. If it afflicts parents, spouse, or children, illness, death, or financial loss will follow. For the noble, exile or ruin is certain. Assess whether the star’s influence was favorable at birth—if so, fortune precedes misfortune.

**Dispelling Rite**
The method aligns with the fire rite. If the affliction occurs in the current year or involves the *yuan* guardian, take your own hat and clothes, place them beneath a bamboo grove, and on the day of the star’s malevolence, have someone craft a bamboo effigy. Dress it in your hat and clothes, then stand beneath the star. If rain or overcast skies prevail, perform the rite in the privy: fashion a human shape, call your name, sever the bamboo, and cast it into the privy to dispel disaster. Avoid witnesses—if seen, misfortune is inescapable.

**Dispelling Fire (from the *Nine Planetary Scripture*)**
Use seven grains of red sesame, five grains of red rice, three grains of red adzuki beans, seven strands of red donkey tail hair, and a pinch of red copper filings. Place them in a vermilion bag and strike your arm with a *fei* branch—greatly auspicious. Alternatively, draw the star’s form and make offerings—also auspicious. Recite the *Sutra of Transforming the Dead*, the *Sutra of Disaster Dispelling*, and wear a vermilion headband with cinnabar. Perform the rite on a cloudless day.

The *Precious Life Scripture* states: Ride a red horse, wear red clothes, and draw blood from seven points on your body, as well as from a red donkey. When the fire star’s malevolent day arrives, construct an octagonal altar. At each of the four cardinal and intercardinal directions, place arrows tied with the corresponding colors. Mix your blood and the donkey’s blood with sandalwood powder, then sprinkle it on the altar. Light five lamps of red sesame oil at the five directions, using red lamp stands as previously described. Strike your arm with the *pai* rope and wear the headband—auspicious.

The *Nine Planetary Scripture* further advises: Offer five fruits and firewood matching your age, along with licorice equal to your age in taels, and burn them with previous merit offerings. Wear a red copper bracelet on your arm. Place a vat of water beneath the southern altar, raise a pole with a red banner at noon, and bury six catties of red charcoal.

**Dispelling Earth**
Take seven grains of black sesame and seven black beans, place them in a black silk bag, and bind it to your left arm with a black cord to dispel all demonic influences, curses, and malevolent spirits. On the first day of the lunar month, cook porridge with black sesame oil, consume a small portion, and distribute the rest to the poor and Daoist monks. Since earth governs all who cultivate the Dao or seek enlightenment through asceticism, almsgiving brings great fortune. Do not harm filial children or the elderly, nor indulge in excessive music—earth favors mourning and disdains revelry.

The *Nine Planetary Scripture* also states: Forge a plowshare into the true form of the earth star, seven inches long, and store it in a black porcelain jar at the head of your bed. On days when the rooster’s crow aligns with the hour, anoint your head with black sesame oil at dawn, and remove it after a year. Drawing and making offerings to the image is also effective. Offer fruits matching your age, especially black ones—most efficacious.

Recite the incantation: *"The rooster’s crow is my lord; I, your servant, beseech your protection. Next, dispel calamity."* Then bow in worship, consume the offering yourself, and favor sour and bitter foods. Carry the *Eight Yang Scripture* and realgar, burn benzoin, wear black clothes, avoid temples of malevolent spirits, refrain from beef, and shun horn vessels.

**Dispelling Dark Stars**
The scripture states: Forge a bracelet from slaughterhouse iron into a serpent shape, mouth clutching tail, and wear it on your left arm. Don black clothes, avoid eating at night or walking in *qi*-laden places. Take a *dou* of soil from a high ridge and place it under your bed. Boil another *dou* of yellow soil, feed it to long-lived geese and crows—greatly auspicious.

**Dispelling Wood**
Take seven strands of white *du* fur, place them in a white bag, and bind it to your left arm. Avoid eating *du* meat and taking lives. Cast a white silver ingot into the star’s true form, make offerings, and recite scriptures. Do not enter spirit temples, mourn the dead, or visit the sick. Making offerings to all Daoists brings fortune.

**The *Dongwei* Limit Song**
A person’s noble or base fate is decreed by the stars;
Limit numbers shift through palaces, each in its time.
If you encounter Rāhu, Venus, or Jupiter’s Thursday,
Or the sun, purple brilliance, or the moon’s company,
The limit brings official rank and emolument.
If the limit meets gold, wood, moon, or purple *qi* with Rāhu, joyous events arise.
But fire and earth stars bring peril.
For those born at night, earth’s descent on Tuesday
From three directions spells certain death.

For those born in daylight, fire is the ruling star.
If the limit number aligns with it, death is certain.
Should this star govern the three directions,
Though calamity strikes, life remains unsevered.
As night-born are ruled by earth and day-born by fire,
When the limit number meets them, disaster may come yet death does not.

Domestic strife arises when *Bo* arrives,
Coupled with dullness and confusion akin to stupor.
When the limit number encounters the moon’s *Bo*,
Households grow restless, minds and hearts grow sluggish.

Remember *Ketu*’s loss of office—
If it meets *Kui* or *Lou*, relocation follows.
When *Ketu* resides in *Double Fish* or *Wall* constellations,
And the limit number aligns, official promotion brings joy,
For these are auspicious celestial lodgings.
If it dwells only in *Room* or *Kui* constellations,
Joy still comes, for they too are favorable,
Though not as potent as *Wall* or *Lou*.

Head in the yang palace brings swift fortune,
Tail in the yin position spares few disasters.
*Rāhu* in the yang palace brings swift fortune,
In the yin palace, fortune comes more slowly.
*Ketu* in the yin palace brings swift fortune,
In the yang palace, fortune comes more slowly.

When the palace’s opposing three directions are now observed,
An empty limit bodes ill for all undertakings.
If one’s limit aligns and the primary entry and three harmonies are examined,
The absence of stars confirms it—
An empty limit brings dullness,
And affairs remain unresolved.

When the limit of official rank meets emptiness, death follows,
At forty-six or forty-seven, life must depart.
If this occurs in the realm of official emolument,
Though fifty is expected, forty-six or forty-seven is the true reckoning.

When a benevolent star’s limit meets calamity and taboo,
Death strikes at the height of contentment—this is the mechanism.
If a favorable limit encounters a baleful star,
Not as a taboo but as a harbinger,
Fortune and longevity become uncertain—
Discern the signs carefully.

Stripped of office, *Bo*, and *Ketu*—the limit still reveals.
Malevolent stars weigh upon each other at their appointed times,
When fate meets them, in which month does death arrive?
Loss of position and untimely death—ponder this well.
If one’s limit number meets *Bo* or *Ketu*,
And taboo stars converge, this person perishes amid ruin.

Day-earth and night-fire govern thus.
When the limit brings fulfillment and official rank ascends,
Fire in yin or yang, earth in its palace—exceedingly auspicious.

Where text is missing, stars align—rank flourishes and position rises,
Should hempen plaint arise, when one’s limit meets the Purple Qi,
Outshining all other stars, he assumes command of urgent pacification.

When two stars occupy a favorable temple within one limit,
Four years are added to his lifespan—let all take heed.
If within a single limit two baleful stars appear in harmonious conjunction,
Two years are extended, thus making four in total.

In determining fortune or calamity,
If the encounter is delayed, blessings come slowly;
When stars move in direct motion, blessings arrive swiftly.
Malevolent stars lingering in retrograde bring swift disaster,
While direct motion slows its onset.

When the limit meets two baleful stars in conjunction,
Disaster strikes with utmost severity, unyielding.
If within one limit two baleful stars converge, the calamity is profound—
All other cases follow this pattern.

Upon first entering a taboo star’s official or lodging limit,
With the body’s fate and annual stars also afflicted by baleful influences,
And the palace in one of the Five Weak positions—no doubt remains:
The month of lingering retrograde is the month of death,
No need to wait for the following year—
This is disaster at its worst.

If the limit, annual star, and body’s fate are favorable,
Yet a benevolent star’s influence wanes, peril soon appears.
When a star’s original palace surpasses all others,
In the Seven Strong palaces, fortune is amplified.
In the Five Weak, misfortune deepens and blessings diminish—
Scholars must carefully weigh good and ill.

This text, as it follows, holds no greater subtlety:
The ancient sages’ fixed determinations leave no room for doubt.
Life and death are settled without a single error,
Revealing at last the profound depths of this study.

*The Song of Fortune and Misfortune in the Profound Numbers*
At *mao*, fifteen; at *chen*, ten,
At *si*, eleven; *you* shares the same pattern.
At *wu*, fifteen—strongest of all,
At *shen*, seven; *wei*, eight—yet to be examined.
At *xu*, *hai*, and *zi*, four and a half years each,
At *chou* and *yin*, five years apiece.

For example, one born at day with Fire in *si*:
*Wu*, *wei*, *shen*, and *you* are all void.
At twenty-five years, life reaches its end—
Or else ruin befalls him in a foreign land.
Wood in *wu*, Fire in *you*:
At thirty-seven, fortune stands firm.
When exhaustion arrives before *you* at *shen*,
Sixty-six marks the onset of misfortune.

Human life is measured at one hundred years as the standard,
Yet with stars’ benevolent and baleful influences,
Adding or diminishing by half, few reach this span.
From the life palace, beginning at fifteen years,
Passing through benevolent stars, one attains the full count of their original palace.
When traversing baleful palaces, observe their direct oppositions and trines,
Adding or diminishing accordingly.
Encountering ill, halve the count; encountering good, add half—
Such is the method.
