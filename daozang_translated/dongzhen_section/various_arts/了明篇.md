Composed by Master Song

**Preface to The Illuminating Treatise**

It has often been said that to be born into this world is no easy matter. Clothed by heaven and treading upon earth, endowed with a spirit surpassing all things—yet most spend their days in the pursuit of fame and profit, chasing falsehoods and losing their true nature. Even unto death, they never hear of the Dao, wasting their lives without the slightest awakening. How lamentable!

Yet consider this: even the sage Confucius declared, *"If one could hear the Dao in the morning, one might die content that evening."* If even a sage of Confucius’ stature was so urgent in seeking the Dao, how much more should we?

The Dao I speak of is the Great Dao. Why? It is impartial, not self-serving; upright, not deviant. It emerges from the undivided state of primordial simplicity, predating the birth of the Three Luminaries. Silent and soundless, formless and beyond perception—yet if one approaches it with reverence, it is not distant from humankind. This is no mere side discipline or heterodox art that deludes the world.

The Dao, in truth, has no name. People, however, impose many names upon it by attaching it to things. Yet its wondrous essence stands alone, profound and unknowable, beyond the reach of words. By fortune, I encountered Master Song in the region of Yun. He recounted his own experience:

*"I received oral instructions from the lineage of Zhong and Lü, practicing the work of returning to the root and restoring life, cultivating the Dao of replenishing the brain and refining essence. Through the refinement of the Two Substances, the Great Elixir is formed. With a single dose, yin is exhausted and yang perfected. The Three Fields darken, and a body appears beyond the body. When merit is complete and conduct fulfilled, one sheds the mortal shell and ascends as an immortal."*

Master Song further said: *"The celestial mechanism is not far—it lies right before our eyes. If one can steadfastly guard the heart and sever all doubt, the Dao will surely be attained."*

I here present the songs and verses composed by Master Song, along with thirty poems by Langranzi in harmonious response—words plain yet profound in meaning, lines lucid yet complete in the Dao. With reverence, I received and bowed to receive them. Thus, I compiled them into a single collection, entitled *The Chapter of Clarity*. I dare not treasure it solely within my household, but wish to share it with all. May those gentlemen of discernment not begrudge a careful reading.

Respectfully inscribed on the first day of the tenth month, in the fourth year of the Qiandao era, by Mao Rixin of Sanqu.

**The Chapter of Clarity**
*Composed by Master Song*

**Song of the Encounter with the True**
In the yiyou year, the fourth month’s midst,
I met Lord Zhongli again in broad daylight.
Oral instructions conveyed the wondrous Dao,
Three thousand days and nights built the merit’s height.

Grateful to the patriarch for the secret transmission,
Never idly spoken to the unwise in vain.
Silent cultivation’s deeds are known to Heaven,
Careless leaks invite the underworld’s disdain.

Seal the Golden Gate, prevent all leakage,
Pierce the Twin Passes to set sun and moon in motion.
Holding light in silence, return to the Muddy Pellet,
Spirit and qi ascend to the Celestial Palace’s station.

The true fire in the crucible blazes fiercely,
Refining true gold white as snow.
Yin and yang harmonized, the yang spirit appears,
Seated beyond, its radiance pure and bright.

The Three Fields darken, essence and spirit whole,
One knows their name as an immortal’s role.
The work of undying is distinct in kind,
The unbreached elixir’s formula sworn not to unwind.

Within the gourd, immortal scenes unfold,
The cavern’s true one ever youthful, untold.
Purple mists and crimson light fill the chamber,
Wind and thunder, lightning flash before the timber.

One day, shedding the shell, leaving dust behind,
Leaping from the mortal cage to ascend on high.

**Song of Dispelling Delusion**
The Dao is not far—it dwells in the Muddy Pellet,
Heed not the idle words of those who prattle.
Though you peruse ten thousand scrolls of immortal lore,
Clearly they speak but of mercury and lead evermore.

To keep true essence from leaking away,
Still the numinous terrace like the bright moon’s ray.
If the numinous terrace is not still, the spirit stays dim,
Day and night, the work must never grow slim.

Never grow slim, but practice with diligence,
When the Three Fields are full, merit is complete in essence.
When merit is complete, the spirit is refined,
And once refined, long life is thine to find.

Practitioners of the true, heed these words,
Guard well the immortal’s wondrous transmission.
The secret celestial mechanism must not be revealed,
For leaks bring harm upon your ancestors’ field.

I urge all in the world to rouse their will,
For each has the share to become immortal still.

**Thirty Poems in Response to Langranzi on Advancing the Dao**

**I**
To learn the Dao, fifty years must be firm,
Through nights, sit upright, forsake sleep’s term.
Pierce the Twin Passes to Kunlun’s crest,
The nine orifices open, transformation’s behest.

The jade hare runs to the northern sea,
The golden crow flies into the cavern’s sky.
The knife’s edge is the elixir of life,
Consumed, the mortal womb yields to the immortal’s strife.

**II**
In quiet night, radiance and spring’s scene,
Perfect clarity, at ease, the original true within.
...

**III**
In profound darkness, within, observe the stars,
In fleeting visions, behold the Master’s form.
The golden crucible flames, suspending the crimson sun,
The Yellow River surges, drumming the dark ford.
Once the precious pearl is refined and work complete,
A radiant golden light renews atop the crown.

**IV**
In stillness sit, refine the mind within the chamber,
Let not the iron ox wander east or west.
The tiger’s roar on the mountain peak—none see,
The dragon’s chant beneath the sea—scenes unlike.
Qi ample, the form never ages,
Spirit whole, the visage returns to youth.
Pity those who covet profit and fame,
For in a moment, all turns to emptiness.

**V**
Before your eyes, white snow scatters in chaos,
Yellow blossoms transform into purple clouds.
Atop the crown, mountain springs echo anew,
In the ears, celestial music heard each day.
The cinnabar field holds the elixir of longevity,
Who on this body lacks the marks of kalpas past?
This truth few in the world comprehend,
Yet how many graves lie beyond the city walls.

**VI**
Do not envy glory, learn the immortal’s art,
For attaining the Dao begins here.
Within the crucible, lead births the great medicine,
In the furnace, mercury ripens into the sacred embryo.
Yang essence unspilled, the body knows no death,
True breath ever present, the black returns to white.
Blend with the world, harmonize your light,
Let others mock as fools and dullards.

**VII**
Once the mystery is grasped, all things cease,
Spring departs and returns, yet none constrain.
Drink the jade nectar, the form defies age,
Seize the golden essence, life is unbound.
Moon’s soul and sun’s spirit ever unite,
Infant boy and maiden girl in tender union.
Deep in night, seated where the elixir burns,
Ten thousand bright stars crown the canopy.

**VIII**
For ten springs, cultivate qi as it comes,
By the master’s guidance, the mystery’s gate attained.
Take wu and ji as crucible and cauldron,
Discerning the cyclical signs of dawn and dusk.
Primordial qi fills, the belly full,
True yang stirs, warming the body through.
Grateful for the master’s transmission of life and death,
How could eons repay such grace?

**IX**
Qi enters the cinnabar field, fire arises,
Between the brows, lightning’s brilliance glows.
The two qi circulate, heaven and earth unite,
The three palaces turn, sun and moon traverse.
Refining the yang spirit, life’s domain expands,
Cultivating the supreme treasure, primordial essence restored.
Though hair whitens and visage fades,
Consuming the golden elixir, youth returns.

**X**
Once work is done, names inscribed in celestial ranks,
Who realizes enlightenment was never hard?
Divine fire ascends, heaven and earth at peace,
Yin and yang harmonize, the valley spirit rests.
To restore youth, no common medicine needed,
To reverse age, no external elixir sought.
In stillness, gaze upon scenes beyond the dust,
In the world, none compare to these myriad forms.

**XI**
Dare not speak of heaven’s mechanism to others,
Refining the false into true, kalpas endure.
Red mercury, black lead—the alchemical base,
Golden crow, jade hare—the elixir’s root.
Work complete, one must return to Peng Isle,
Virtue perfected, audience with the Emperor sought.
A thunderclap strikes—gods and ghosts tremble,
Ten thousand rays of rosy light illuminate heaven and earth.

**XII**
In secret, cultivate amidst the world’s dust,
Labor diligently, never idle.
Often retreat in seclusion,
No need to wander into distant mountains.
Golden grains frequently consumed, bones and marrow firm,
Jade nectar sipped often, the countenance preserved.
Now I have grasped the elixir of immortality,
In the furnace, the nine-times-cycled pill refined.

**XIII**
The Dao’s subtlety delves deepest truth,
To cultivate the real, resolve must be firm.
The Yellow River’s course runs through the celestial path,
The vermilion towers melt into a crucible of gold.
To advance the fire, no quiet chamber needed,
To seek immortality, no secluded woods required.
Within the body lies the elixir of longevity,
How laughable the fool who seeks it without.

**XIV**
Free from greed, free from attachment—better than mountain dwelling,
Unburdened by idle sorrows, the mind at ease.
Having met the perfected one, received the oral transmission,
Why pore over ten thousand scrolls?
Time is limited, hastening like an arrow,
Each year added, one year less remains.
I urge the world to awaken early,
Those who neither cultivate nor refine are fools.

**XV**
The three fields’ yin exhausted, pure yang restored,
The two substances simmered, the true nurtured.
Virtue profound, gods and ghosts submit,
The Dao lofty, its verses astonish.
Deep in night, seated, observe the divine sword,
Countless yin demons flee far from the body.
Mercury refined into cinnabar, age undone,
Lifespan aligned with heaven and earth, the visage ever new.

**XVI**
In youth, indolent toward scholarly arts,
Two decades and more, years idly spent.
No intent to chase fame or profit,
Only the heart set on ascending the void.
Meeting the elixir’s measure, the face like jade,
Passing through golden essence, the visage at ease.
Unknowing of root, lineage, and ancestors,
Swallowing saliva, circulating qi—how trivial.

**XVII**
The twin passes flank the spine to the mud-pill palace,
Spirit and qi flow freely, the countenance preserved.
A myriad acres of gold unfold the cosmos,
Two wheels of sun and moon pierce the passes.
The river chariot’s conveyance must not halt,
The work of advancing fire must not rest.
Refine your own true great medicine,
Already your name emerges beyond the dust.

**XVIII**
Recognize the profound mystery, abandon delusion,
Work complete, conduct perfected, attain non-action.
Frequently swallow jade dew, nourishing form and substance,
Able to drink celestial nectar, quenching thirst and hunger.
The two qi unite, birthing the maiden girl,
The five phases match, nurturing the infant boy.
Knowing the truth of heaven’s mechanism,
Shedding the shell to ascend as immortal is certain.

**XIX**
To seek immortality, why search for external elixirs?
Better to preserve essence, return qi to its source.
Marrow full, naturally no aging or death,
Yang pure, surely the visage of youth.
Golden gate and jade door must be tightly sealed,
The crucible’s simmering work must not cease.
Once the luminous pearl stirs into motion,
Lightning’s radiance flashes between the brows.

**XX**
The great Dao is not difficult—seek with resolve,
Who would undertake cultivation in youth?
Human life’s illusions—what endures?
Wealth and honor—how many autumns gained?
A century’s span is but a dream,
Pity those who drift with the waves.
When will the craving for wealth and lust cease?
Not until the bones lie bare.

**XXI**
For twenty autumns, I have studied the Dao,
The world’s vulgar scenes now appear as straw.
Simply practice the seven returns, replenishing essence and marrow,
Ever making the Yellow River’s waters flow backward.
Ten thousand volumes of immortal scriptures—what need to read?
A single gourd of celestial wine—drunk to the full.

One dawn, with a sweep of the sleeve, I ascend into empty space,
Beyond the world’s bounds, carefree—what sorrow remains?

**XXI**
I speak of *Nanhua* yet bear a name,
Without a master’s guidance, the Dao is hard to attain.
Stealing the green of sun and moon to link heaven and earth,
Refining the returning elixir to transcend death and life.
Yin conceals yang’s birth—none understand,
From nothing, something arises—this is true essence.
The master teaches me the art of spirit’s departure,
Eyes closed, Penglai lies but a finger’s span away.

**XXII**
After swallowing the Jade Pool’s draught, I gaze toward Pengying,
Ten thousand miles shrink to a single league’s journey.
With the medicine complete, I ride clouds to the Jade Emperor’s court,
My work done, I mount a crane to bid farewell to the Three Pure Ones.
Only in practice is the truth revealed,
Returning to the primordial to settle the boundless void.
Such is the study of immortality—truly worth pursuing,
Through a hundred thousand kalpas, eternally flourishing.

**XXIII**
All cling to lust and wealth,
Unwilling to turn their hearts toward the Dao.
As the body decays and death nears,
They chase fleeting joys, laughing and jesting in doubt.
Once qi scatters, how can it be sought again?
When disaster strikes in a day, how can it be averted?
To be free of birth and death,
Clearly, creation lies within the spirit’s terrace.

**XXIV**
To study immortality, study the Three Maos,
Idle texts by the thousands—I grow weary of transcribing.
How much better to still the mind and refine the inner treasure,
Deep in the night, the golden crucible where tiger and dragon unite.
Boiling water and fire without cease,
Tempering cinnabar—how could it ever be set aside?
Already a guest of the Ten Isles and Three Mountains,
Soon I shall sweep my sleeves and leave the dusty nest.

**XXV**
The immortals know life without death,
Unmoved as the years transform.
Attaining the Dao, they return to heaven’s path,
While the deluded sink into mud and sand.
The road to immortality lies before us,
Yet men’s hearts remain like yakshas.
Unheeding, their lives end in the sea of suffering—
Reflecting, one can only sigh in sorrow.

**XXVI**
Countless seek the true yet know it not,
Reciting words they cannot put into practice.
A thousand visions—all in vain,
Wasting effort through the fifth watch of night.
If one knows the master of qi’s circulation,
And the root of essence’s movement,
Success will surely bring ascension,
For the immortal ledger already bears their name.

**XXVII**
Though you read all the world’s books,
Nature and life remain untouched.
How much better to turn the heart toward the supreme Dao,
Guarding the elixir furnace deep into the night without weariness.
When the great medicine is refined, return to Peng Island,
The numinous cinnabar congealed, enter the great void.
Do not say immortality is beyond reach—
Only because men’s hearts are too stubborn and dull.

**XXVIII**
Endlessly craving profit and fame,
All day indulging in reckless folly.
How much better to cultivate merit within,
Refining the yang spirit to banish doubt and worry.
Divine water frequently poured to nourish Dao-qi,
Naturally, the countenance will never decay.
One day, summoned to the Jade Pool’s assembly,
I shall keep company with immortals beyond the world’s bounds.

**XXIX**
The Dao resides within—seek it not without,
Cultivation depends entirely on one’s own heart.
Who recognizes dragon’s essence and tiger’s marrow?
The union of *Li* and *Kan*—profound is its principle.
Refining the medicine relies on heaven’s fire,
Tempering the elixir requires the crucible’s gold.
Fools fail to grasp the mystery’s truth,
Blindly poring over immortal scriptures—how can they fathom its sound?

**XXX**
The *Weilü* unseals the nine palaces’ gates,
Inhaling and exhaling the primordial root of heaven and earth.
The wondrous double pass illuminates the *Jiaji*,
The two wheels of sun and moon race high.
Yang complete, yin exhausted, the three fields full,
Qi refined into spirit—stored through eons.
When merit and practice are fulfilled, heaven’s decree arrives,
To become an immortal of the Ten Isles and Three Mountains.

Thirty poems, clear and resonant,
Exposing the Dao’s root in full.
Heaven’s mechanism revealed to awaken men—
Yet how many fools refuse to study immortality?

**Lyrics**
*Sumuzhe*

**Qi follows spirit, spirit follows qi,**
Spirit and qi in mutual pursuit,
Piercing through to the *Niwan* within.
Ever secure the Golden Gate with steadfast lock,
Seizing the golden essence—
In secret, joy wells deep.

Labor below with unflagging will,
Through all twelve hours,
Never abandon your work.
Yin spent, yang complete—spirit leaves the body,
When merit and practice are fulfilled,
Your name is inscribed among the immortals’ ranks.

**Chounuer**
A true person was once but mortal flesh—
What difficulty lies in awakening?
Yet fame and profit, like mountains,
Bar the path to and fro on the immortals’ road.
Grateful for the master’s guidance on matters of life and death,
Ever ponder it in the heart.
Ever ponder it in the heart,
Through all twelve hours, never a moment’s rest.

**Qinyuanchun**
Hasten, hasten to cultivate the Way,
Cherish the priceless treasure within your body.
Take the golden crow and jade hare,
Refine them in the crucible,
For yin and yang’s alchemy
Nurtures the yang spirit.
Tigers roar, dragons chant—
Within the *Dantian*,
Atop the crown, celestial music sounds without cease.
In the *Niwan*,
Water and fire refine,
Lead and mercury become true.

Night comes—sit upright,
Calm the heart and spirit,
Behold the true person’s visage renewed.
Use the *Heche* to bear the load,
Filling the *Niu* and *Dou* constellations.
Radiant light shines pure,
Clearly having ingested the *daogui*.
When merit is complete,
You will know your name is listed among the immortals’ ranks,
And all the immortals will invite you.
Awaiting the Jade Emperor’s summons,
You will pay homage to the Three Pure Ones.

**Wulingchun**
Who understands the sevenfold returning elixir?
Once understood, what difficulty remains?
In the stillness of night, preserve spirit and turn inward,
Divine water fills the *Niwan*.
Transporting golden essence day and night,
Breath never idle.
When merit and practice are fulfilled, transcend the world,
Your name and surname listed among the immortals’ ranks.

**Again**
Tiger strides, dragon coils—most wondrous work,
Their union lies within the *Dantian*.
In the crucible and furnace, fire refines naturally,
Sun and moon’s refinement comes first.
Recognize *Kan* and *Li* as the alchemy,
True qi must return to its source.
Turn inward, sit in stillness and clarity,
The ninefold refinement forges the elixir.

**Chounuer**
How dare the *Heche* pause in its course?
It bears into the *Niwan*.
Water and fire refine,
A single grain of cinnabar tempers mercury and lead.
The great joy of the golden elixir belongs to all—
Only require a steadfast heart.
Cease idle words,
Preserve yang essence, and you are an immortal.

**Again**
By the master’s transmission of the *Chaoyuan* principle,
Day and night, diligent in practice.
Refining and forging into truth,
Stealing half a catty of yin and yang.
In the gourd’s heaven and earth, night never falls,
Four seasons ever spring.
Within the cave, time’s light—
How can I speak of it to the world?

**Again**
In the night, after midnight, rise and sit robed,
Heart settled, spirit clear.
Behold the true person,
Face like rouge, body like silver.
In the crucible, flames blaze fiercely,
Purple qi surges.
A single elixir grain is formed—
Surely you will ascend to the Emperor’s capital.

**Taichangyin**
The golden elixir lies only within yourself,
True water and fire refine it to completion.
Having met Lord Lü,
You recognize the return to the original ancestral source.
Yang complete, yin spent,
Where spirit’s light appears,
Recognize your own true countenance.
Your name listed among the immortals’ ranks,
You have leapt beyond the world’s cage.

**Diangchun**
The work of the two qi,
The *Heche* bears into Kunlun’s peak.
Who among the world understands?
This is the mystery of the primordial Dao.
Preserve yang essence,
Though aged, the body does not age.
The three fields full,
Practice complete,
Sweep your sleeves and wander Peng Isle.

This work,
Through the master’s transmission, you know the primordial ancestor.
What need to discuss *zi* and *wu*,
To speak of dragon and tiger?
It lies right before your eyes—
The luminous path of immortals.
Hasten to cultivate,
One day you shall return,
And the ledgers of the underworld will be erased.

**Daolianzi**
True water and fire,
Thanks to the master’s transmission,
Black lead and red mercury simmer in the crucible.
Divine radiance fills the present moment.
The cinnabar elixir complete—
You are an immortal.
Golden essence grasped, your lifespan matches Heaven’s.
Await the Jade Emperor’s summons when the work is done.

**Linjiangxian**
Why speak of *kan* and *li*, dragon and tiger?
Cease talk of fire phases and the celestial cycle.
Yang essence unspent, your spirit becomes whole.
The twin passes gleam with a path,
Straight up to the *Niwan*.
Secure the golden gate and jade portal,
Refining the sun’s essence and moon’s marrow?
When the three palaces are full, the body stands firm.
The intestinal spirits ascend to the Emperor,
Eternally a celestial immortal.

**Chounuer**
The Golden Lord is originally the son of *Qian*,
Dwelling in the *Kun* palace.
True tiger, true dragon,
Devouring the Three Corpses and Nine Worms.
Cinnabar refined within the *Niwan*,
Resplendent and ever-red,
In a single day, the work is done—
You shall meet the Three Pure Ones, the Most High.

**Langtaosha**
I have a zither,
Carried wherever I sit or walk.
Stringless, yet its sound surpasses the strung.
Wishing to play a tune before others,
But no true listener appears.
In the stillness of night, its notes resound like thunder,
Startling gods and ghosts.
Shaking heaven and earth like rolling thunder,
Only when the work is complete and I return,
Shall I cast it toward Penglai and Yingzhou.

Again,
The master points to the refining of the golden elixir,
Secure the golden gate,
Advance the fire’s work without idleness.
Turn inward, settle the mind, and observe the inner landscape—
Lightning flashes between the brows.
The wondrous function lies in the *Niwan*,
Even spirits and ghosts cannot perceive it.
The foolish and deluded remain separated by a thousand mountains,
But awakening is as easy as turning the hand—
What difficulty is there in transcending the world?

Again,
Lead and mercury must be replenished,
The fire’s work ceaselessly applied.
When the body’s qi is full, yang is restored in full.
The infant and the crone are nurtured,
Sitting and sleeping together.
The marrow solidifies, the body becomes firm,
The three fields are filled.
Consuming the *daogui* pill, you attain immortality.
Only await the completion of the work and the fulfillment of the path,
To stride alone toward the court of the origin.

**Tangduoling**
Ferrying across the Yellow River,
The golden gate is firmly sealed.
The ninefold return requires abundant effort,
Light piercing the curtains, red as fire.
Golden coins appear—
Ten thousand blossoms.
Against the current, silver waves surge,
Overflowing the Ox and Dipper.
Advancing the work, time slips by,
Until you see the true person—yourself.
Inwardly delighted, laughing heartily.

**Taoyuan Yigu Ren**
Since the master revealed the celestial mechanism,
I have understood the myriad volumes of immortal scriptures.
If you can return essence to the brain,
Your countenance will never age.
True lead, true mercury—few know them,
The crow and hare refined into treasure.
When the body outside the body is complete,
The Jade Emperor’s golden writ shall summon you.

**Xi Huanghua**
The great Dao of the celestial mechanism,
Few attain it.
Circulating *wu* and *ji*,
Dragon coiling, tiger encircling.
This single grain of cinnabar—
The mortal world scarcely understands.
Ask of wood and metal, *kan* and *li* inverted.
Yang complete, yin spent,
The form never ages.
Refining with water and fire,
Naturally, the furnace glows.
Await the completion of the work,
To forge the priceless treasure,
And ascend to court the origin—
The seven ancestors all liberated.

**Ruanlangui**
A wheel of bright moon illuminates the three peaks,
Rosy clouds fill the sky.
Clearly, I see my master within,
A luminous pearl ascending to the upper palace.
The elixir refined,
Crimson in the crucible,
Diligently apply the work.
When the work is done, you shall surely escape the mortal cage,
Wandering leisurely among the immortal grottoes.

**Wulingchun**
Sevenfold return, yang complete, yin utterly spent,
Essence and marrow fill the three fields.
Cultivating to non-action, it must become natural—
What need to discuss before or after?
Recognize the true water and fire of the five phases,
You must know their root.
Deliberately observe the cinnabar within your own elixir,
Why seek the elixir outside?

The *Liaoming* chapter concludes.
