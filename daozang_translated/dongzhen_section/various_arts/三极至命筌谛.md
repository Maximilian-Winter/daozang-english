**The Three Ultimates of Destiny’s Net and Ladder**
*Scripture Title:* *The Three Ultimates of Destiny’s Net and Ladder*. One fascicle. Composed by Wang Qingsheng of the Southern Song. Base text from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* section, *Zhongshu* category.

**The Three Vehicles of the Five Carts**

**The Lesser Vehicle of the Goat Cart**
The Lesser Vehicle of the Goat Cart is the method of kindling fire with the Qin lock. Its practice: retract the external kidneys, causing the bladder’s lower *mingmin* fire to descend and merge with the external kidneys. The civil fire of the left and the martial fire of the right ascend from below, piercing the Three Passes. After practicing for forty-nine days, sweet dew will naturally descend into the Jade Pool. Sweet dew is also called *Yellow Center Wine*, *Stone Source*, or *ghee*. If one can practice this without laxity, one may reverse aging and return to youth, gradually entering the sagely Dao.

**The Middle Vehicle of the Deer Cart**
The Middle Vehicle of the Deer Cart is the method of guarding the center. Its practice: subdue the sovereign fire of the heart’s upper *mingjun*, entering between the two kidneys to pair with the ministerial fire of the central *mingchen*. They transform into a lotus, emerging from the depths of the abyssal waters. Visualize the Perfected One seated upon the flower, ceaselessly. After twenty days, combined with the previous Goat Cart practice—totaling sixty-nine days—the numinous medicine will spontaneously arise in the Mud Pill Heavenly Valley. This numinous medicine is called *Black Mercury*. Mercury is also named *Gold in Water*, the primordial essence. This is the method of replenishing the brain and returning essence. If one can constantly cultivate this, one may effortlessly enter the sagely realm.

Some take the windlass as the Deer Cart, which is a matter of following the true. Each day at the *yin* and *gen* hours, sit upright and visualize the Deer Cart’s Dao, without interruption, for forty-nine days. One must first practice the Goat Cart, then the Deer Cart, and after the Deer Cart, proceed to the Ox Cart. Practicing the three carts together is called the Great Vehicle.

Laozi’s governance of a great state was like cooking a small fish; Fuxi’s method involved weaving nets for hunting and fishing; Yao and Shun truly grasped the center; King Wen’s *gen* was his back; the Duke of Zhou’s *gen* was the barrier that fumigated the heart; Confucius’ withdrawal and concealment—all these embody the principle of guarding the center.

It is called *producing medicine* and *refining lead to fill the abdomen*. Lead is *Black Lead*, which is *Black Mercury*, also named *Black Turtle Essence* or *Black Turtle Liver*. When it descends into the Heavenly Valley, it is called *White Dragon Liver*—this is the name for guarding the center at the beginning. *Warm nurturing* and *spiritual earth-Kan fire* are names for guarding the center in the middle. *Guarding the city*, *wild warfare*, and *sealing the passes and locks* are names for guarding the center at the end. *Bathing* and *true qi’s indigo steaming* are names for guarding the center in terms of punishment and virtue.

It is said: In *guarding the One*, the spirit of the left kidney is the Great One, the spirit of the right kidney is the Mysterious One, and the spirit of the two kidneys merged is the Great One. It is said: In *guarding the true*, duality is false, unity is true. It is said: In *guarding the black*, manifesting it is white, concealing it is black. It is said: In *guarding the feminine*, soaring is masculine, concealment is feminine.

There is also *guarding the Yellow Chamber*, which is the secret gate residing directly in front of the navel’s center. The Yellow Chamber is also called the *Yellow Court* or *Cinnabar Field*. Explanations vary: some designate the *Mud Pill* as the Yellow Chamber—the *Mud Pill* is also called the *Heavenly Valley* or *Heavenly Grotto*. Others point to the *Crimson Palace*, the upper *Gate of Life*, also named *Joint Glory* or *Responsive Valley*. Still others refer to the heart, kidneys, spleen, and gallbladder—these are merely partial methods. If one wishes to subdue yin with yang, ensuring that *Gold in Water* and *Wood in Fire* are internally undivided, one cannot do so without guarding the center.

Yet this method of guarding the center is the esoteric teaching transmitted by successive sages, the true work of sagely cultivation. If one can truly grasp and hold to it, then generation after generation may become like Fuxi and Yao, and every person may become like Shun. With broad capacity, one may wander the Great Clarity; the golden ladder and jade steps begin here.

**The Great Vehicle of the Ox Cart**
The Great Vehicle of the Ox Cart is the Dao of restraining breath and revolving wind. *Restraining breath* means closing the nostrils and not exhaling. Expelling breath is called *exhalation*; drawing breath is called *inhalation*. *Revolving wind* means revolving the celestial wind to unite with the numinous spirit. The numinous spirit is the heart’s spirit, called the *Primordial Lord*, styled *Guardian of the Numinous*.

Those who practice this method must first complete the Goat Cart for forty-nine days, then the Deer Cart for twenty days—totaling sixty-nine days—before practicing this method for twelve days. The three carts together make eighty-one days. Naturally, the numinous medicine will flourish in the Heavenly Valley, enabling one to cultivate the true.

For those of superior mechanism and great wisdom, who comprehend upon a single hearing, practicing the three carts together may produce the numinous medicine in just ten days, without needing eighty-one. However, if one aims to undertake sagely work, one should proceed step by step, not hastily.

First, practice the Goat Cart for forty-nine days without regard to timing. Then, each day at the *yin* and *gen* hours, practice the Deer Cart for forty-nine days. Afterward, each day at the *zi*, *wu*, *gen*, and *yin* hours, practice the Ox Cart for forty-nine days. After a full one hundred forty-seven days, one may practice without regard to timing, ensuring ceaseless continuity.

The saying “The noble person ceaselessly strives for self-improvement” refers to exhaustively practicing this Dao without weariness. If ceaseless, one may overcome delusion and become a sage. If weary, one may lose the sagely mind and become deluded. Overcoming delusion to become a sage stabilizes the Dao-heart and pacifies the human heart. Losing the sagely mind to become deluded endangers the human heart and weakens the Dao-heart.

The Goat, Deer, and Ox Carts are essentially one Great Vehicle. However, people differ in sharpness and dullness, and natures vary in skill and clumsiness. Thus, the former sages established teachings with gradual and sudden distinctions.

Moreover, people of the world neglect diligent study under a master, prizing only superficial plunder. Seeing in the alchemical classics the teaching of "closing the Tail Gate," they take the Goat Cart to mean closing the Tail Gate and abandon it. Seeing the teaching of "blowing and breathing," they take the Ox Cart to mean blowing and breathing and abandon it. Seeing the teaching of "preserving the breath," they take the Deer Cart to mean preserving the breath and abandon it. They fail to consider that without practicing the Goat Cart, the earthly fire will not rise, the human heart will be imperiled, and peace will be lost; without practicing the Ox Cart, the heavenly wind will not return, the Dao-heart will grow faint, and stability will be lost; without practicing the Deer Cart, the hundred spirits will not merge, the human heart will remain merely human, the Dao-heart merely Dao, and unity will not be refined. Laozi’s bellows maintaining the center, the Jade Emperor’s revolving wind merging all, and Great Shun’s refining unity within—these are but the Great Vehicle, not two separate Ways.

The former sages’ criticism of "closing the Tail Gate" referred only to those who practice yin absorption, for such absorption is a way of killing. Their criticism of "blowing and breathing" referred only to those who practice the Six Qi, for the Six Qi drain the Triple Burner and Five Viscera. Their criticism of "preserving the breath" referred only to those who fix their thoughts on the navel, for the navel is but a channel for dregs and filth, fit only for moxibustion to attack illness, not a place for the heart to retreat and abide. To speak of dreams to a fool’s face—claiming to save others, yet only deluding them—how could this be the heart of a sagely teacher? Thus, I have clearly expounded the Great Vehicle’s Way to dispel the world’s confusions.

Should the Dao-seeker but turn their spirit inward, the realm of the sages lies well within reach. The man of the August Ultimate converges upon the "following one’s nature" of the *Doctrine of the Mean*; the three Changes’ central lines all culminate here. Press on!

An ancient formula says:
The human heart is perilous—when kidney deviance arises, the human heart follows it into peril.
The Dao-heart is subtle—when the heart is upright, the Dao-heart extends its subtlety.
Be only precise, be only one: precision fortified never fails; unity maintained never strays.
Faithfully hold to the center.
Trust Heaven, comply and abide—this is the domain of sage-making.

**The Great Ox-Cart: The Upper Vehicle**
The Great Ox-Cart’s Upper Vehicle is the method of inner refinement for cultivating the Real. Its method: takes primordial essence, qi, and mercury as the medicine; primordial qi and red lead as the fire; the yang of midnight and the yin of noon for drawing and adding by weight. Transmitted mouth-to-ear, never recorded in writing, three years bring accomplishment; nine years, perfection. Essence transforms into the black; qi changes into spirit. A thousand days of silent audience, twelve years to ascend to Heaven. This is inner elixir cultivation—by which one may attain longevity without death, may sit to depart or stand to vanish. Having realized True Emptiness, one strides beyond into Wondrous Being.

**The Great White Ox-Cart: The Supreme Vehicle**
The Great White Ox-Cart’s Supreme Vehicle is the art of immortal refinement using the external elixir of the Snow Mountain White Ox. What is called "Heaven and Earth as the crucible and vessel"—Heaven is the horse, its Way producing the male, termed the Great State and Great Image, all of the Heavenly Dao. Earth is the ox, its Way producing the female, the *Upāsikā* termed the Small State and Small Image, all of the Earthly Dao. The Lesser *Upāsikā* pertains to the *dui* trigram, *dui* belonging to metal and metal being white in color—hence the White Ox. Heaven transforms into the Earth trigram, presiding over the two qi of the Lesser Snow of the Beginning of Winter, occupying the position of the *gen* mountain in the Former Heaven—hence the Snow Mountain White Ox.

The *kan* and *li* trigrams are the medicinal substances.
*Kan* is the middle son, Earth receiving Heaven’s central qi to form it. *Kan* belongs to water and corresponds to lead; within water is metal, within lead is silver—termed Black Mercury, also called Quicksilver, this is *kan*’s medicinal substance.
*Li* is the middle daughter, the *Upāsikā*, Heaven receiving Earth’s central qi to form it. *Li* belongs to fire and corresponds to cinnabar; within fire is wood, within cinnabar is mercury—termed Red Lead, also called Vermilion Mercury, likewise named Quicksilver, this is *li*’s medicinal substance.
The *Five Thousand Words* calls them the Mysterious Female—Heaven and Earth; the nurturing of the *po*—*li* and *kan*. This is the Seven Returns and Nine Revolutions of Golden Liquor refining the form.

In one hour, essence is conceived; in one day, the embryo is formed; in ten months, the embryo is shed; in three years, yin is extinguished—this is called the Pure Yang Immortal. In six years, grains are renounced; the nose ceases to breathe—this is called the Utmost Real. With bones of white jade and sinews of yellow gold, one treads upon the void, penetrates metal and stone—this is the ultimate attainment of immortal refinement.

From Laozi and the Yellow Emperor onward, all those who soar and transform have cultivated this. Thus, Laozi composed the *Daode jing* to instruct later generations; the Yellow Emperor wrote the *Yinfu jing* to manifest its purport—its three chapters all transmitted mouth-to-ear by successive sages, without written text. Those who transmitted it in later times mostly erred and diverged. The Yellow Emperor received it in a stone chamber, the characters each a *zhang* in size. It is also said that the Old Mother of Mount Li once annotated its text—this is but a fabrication by meddlesome hands. The learner must possess true eyes and vision.

The Perfected Wei Boyang, drawing upon it, composed the *Zhouyi cantong qi* to exhaust its depths; Zhongli Quan of Zhengyang, following it, wrote the *Yunfang Thirty-Nine Chapters* to verify deceptive semblances; Lü Dongbin of Pure Yang, inheriting it, composed the *Qinyuan chun*, *Shuangtian xiaojiao*, and *Yaotou tuokong* songs to expand its meaning; Shi Jianwu of Huayang, cultivating it, wrote the *Huizhen ji* to guide and advance learners. Though all elucidate the essentials of the Dao and reveal its mechanisms, the fire phases, methods, and nurturing directives are never fully disclosed.

Master Yizhen of Tiantai, demoted from the enduring virtue of the Perfected of Ziyang, was moved by the Lady of Western Florescence to transmit the pivotal oral instructions. Upon attaining the Dao, he conferred upon Yaolin Shi Tai the *Wuzhen pian*; upon Yaolin’s attainment, he conferred upon Zixian Xue Daoguang the *Huanyuan pian*; upon Zixian’s attainment, he conferred upon the Perfected of Niuwan the *Fuming pian*; upon Niuwan’s attainment, he conferred upon the Perfected of Ziqing, Bai Yuchan, the *Cuixu pian*. Those who later heard the Dao were disciples of Ziqing.

In my foolish and long-standing nature, I yearned for the Dao and encountered Master Yao of Taoyuan, a disciple of the Perfected of Ziqing. Indeed, I saw his tortoise-like form and martial bearing and took him for an extraordinary man. I served him with the rites of a disciple for nearly twelve years, repeatedly inquiring about the Way of lead and mercury, yet each time he sternly declined with harsh words. In the *jiaxi* year of the Jiayou era, I followed the Dao at the Yousheng Abbey before the imperial throne, then briefly returned to guard my post. The following *gengzi* year, I was graciously permitted to memorialize the Dao Ancestor and receive the oral instructions of inner elixir cultivation. Practicing as taught, I indeed witnessed numinous verification. Soon after, affairs intervened, and twice my progress was disrupted.

Continuing my observations of *The Awakening to Reality*, it states:
*"If one speaks of nine years or three years,
All are but excuses to prolong the schedule."*
And further:
*"When frost flies in the tenth month, the elixir first ripens;
If one slackens, even spirits and ghosts must tremble."*
Thus I learned that the inner elixir succeeds in nine years,
while the outer elixir emerges in ten months.

Thereafter, with unkempt hair and straw-clad feet,
I wandered aimlessly through Taizhou and Wenzhou.
There I encountered Master Yang Shigu, the Recluse of Vegetable Patch,
who chanced upon the Hermit of Yongjia. At first sight, our hearts inclined toward one another,
and he imparted to me the essentials of medicinal substances and the crucible.
This was in the eleventh month of the *guimao* year of the Chunyou era.
On the third day of the third month of the following *jiachen* year,
he further instructed me in the fire phases and the retrospective examination of elixir classics,
and indeed, all matched perfectly.

Originally, this Way is the Dao of long life, deathlessness, transformation, and flight.
Yet today, people often speak only of methods that hasten death,
or else merely preserve the corpse.
I fear that those among later generations who earnestly seek it
may hear of such things and be misled by these sorts,
falling together into the sea of delusion—truly a cause for sorrow and grief.
Thus I briefly outline its general contours.

**Oral Instructions of the Perfected White of Purple Clarity on the Golden Liquor Great Return Outer Elixir**

To become an immortal,
refine the sacred treasure—this is called the *Dao of Refining the Sage*.
The medicinal substances have no fixed weight,
the fire phases no set time.
Twelve hours of the day, the fire never ceases;
twelve months of the year, the fire persists.
In a hundred days, success is achieved;
in one year, completion is attained.
The sacred embryo is nurtured—
this is called the *Golden Liquor Great Return Spirit Elixir*,
the *Great Vehicle of the Three Carts*,
the marrow of a thousand classics,
the foundation of ten thousand methods.

To refine the numinous treasure is called the *Method of Refining Qi*.
The medicinal substances have fixed weights,
the fire phases set times.
Twelve hours of the day, only two are used;
twelve months of the year, only ten are employed.
In three years, success is achieved;
in nine years, completion is attained.
The true embryo is nurtured—
this is called the *Golden Liquor Great Return Inner Elixir*,
the *Great Ox-Cart, the Supreme Vehicle*.
When the nine-year count is fulfilled,
concentrate the spirit in the Celestial Valley,
daily practice silent audience before the Emperor on High.
When essence stirs for a thousand days—
a full twelve-year cycle—
cast off the husk and ascend in spirit,
becoming neither born nor extinguished.

To refine the divine treasure is called the *Art of Refining Form*.
Though the medicinal substances have no fixed weight,
the fire phases have set times.
Twelve hours of the day, only one is used;
twelve months of the year, only nine are employed.
In ninety days, success is achieved;
in three hundred days, completion is attained.
The immortal embryo first emerges,
transmuting the mortal frame.
Not only is death averted,
but one gains renewed life.
After three years of ingestion, the body transforms into pure yang,
no longer troubled by cold or heat.
After six years of nurturing, the breath ceases through the nose,
hunger and thirst vanish.
When three thousand days are fulfilled,
one achieves transformation and flight—
this is called the *Golden Liquor Great Return Outer Elixir*,
the *Great White Ox-Cart, the Unsurpassed Vehicle*.

**On the Work of Elixir-Refinement**

There are three kinds of elixir-refinement:
First, the *Spirit Elixir*, achieved through preservation and nurturing—this is called *sitting in meditation*;
Second, the *True Elixir*, achieved through application and action—this is called *performing the work*;
Third, the *Immortal Elixir*, which unifies the Three Powers and requires two substances—this is called *the practice*.
What difficulty could there be?

The *Spirit Elixir* requires thirty-six thousand moments,
with the fire applied in every moment.
If the fire ceases for even a single moment, it becomes interrupted.
The *Inner Elixir* requires seven hundred and twenty hours or more,
with the fire applied in every hour.
If the fire ceases for even a single hour, it becomes interrupted.
The *Outer Elixir* requires only eighty-one hours of fire application—
how could this not be easy?

At the rumbling of thunder,
this refers to the month of *Earthly Thunder Return* (the eleventh month),
when the *First Yang* returns.
This is the day of *Seven-Day Return*.
The jade crucible blazes with fire—
the jade crucible is the *Recumbent Moon Crucible*;
the fire is the *Heavenly True Fire*.
When the golden tripod is obtained,
the *Primordial Cold Mist* responds to it, and the fire blazes.
The golden tripod emits cold mist—
the golden tripod is the *Cinnabar Tripod*;
the mist is the *Primordial Mist*.
When it receives the *Heavenly Fire* of the jade crucible, the mist is no longer cold.

The *Maiden of Mystery* rides the dragon—
the *Maiden of Mystery* is the *yin* line in *Zhen*;
*rides* means to be carried.
The *dragon* is the *Red Dragon* and the *Azure Dragon*.
The *Duke of Metal* straddles the tiger—
the *Duke of Metal* is the *yang* line in *Dui*;
*straddles* means to mount.
The *tiger* is the *Black Tiger* and the *White Tiger*.
In the space of a single meal, the *Great Return* is accomplished.

The *binding* refers to lead congealing and mercury coagulating. *Great* means so vast it has no bounds. *Return* means returning to the source and reverting to the root. This *Golden Liquor Great Return* external elixir, though it borrows external medicines, is not the coarse substances of gold, silver, herbs, or trees—it is nothing other than the *Primordial Unity Qi* before the Supreme Ultimate divided.

Once the Two Modes, Four Images, Eight Trigrams, and Five Phases emerge, the *Primordial Unity Qi* scatters and disperses into the myriad things. Now, by means of *gathering without gathering* and *taking without taking*, one takes it, causing Heaven’s *qi* to recombine into one—this is why it is called *return*.

Within the *Cinnabar Field*,
the *Cinnabar Field* is the *Yellow Chamber*, the *Secret Gate*.
It is also called the *Primordial Field*.
To its left lies the *Eight-Trigram Azure Dragon*,
to its right, the *Eight Might Red Serpent*;
at its center, the *Golden Essence Fierce Beast*.
When the *Three Worms* turn inward, the path to longevity opens;
when the *Three Worms* flee outward, the spirit-light gradually departs from the heart-mind.

The *Lord of Cinnabar Origin* uses *Li* as a net,
hunting and fishing here,
preventing the *Three Worms* from escaping,
to cultivate the Dao of *deep-rooted firm-stemmed* longevity and enduring vision.
The characters for *hunting* and *fishing* both contain *field*, hence it is called the *Cinnabar Field*.

Some take the *qi*-sea one *cun* and five *fen* below the navel as the *Cinnabar Field*;
some take the *Stone Gate* two *cun* below as the *Cinnabar Field*;
some take the *Pass of Origin* three *cun* below as the *Cinnabar Field*—
these are the upper, middle, and lower *Cinnabar Field* acupoints used by physicians for acupuncture and moxibustion.

Some take one *cun* and three *fen* as the *Cinnabar Field*—
this is the entry-level *Cinnabar Field* for beginners in the Dao.
Some take the heart as the *Cinnabar Field*—
this is the *Cinnabar Field* of Chan practitioners seeking to illuminate the mind and see the nature.
Some take the spleen on the left of the stomach as the *Cinnabar Field*—
this is the *Cinnabar Field* of gluttonous practitioners cultivating the *Central Yellow* and robust digestion.
Some take the liver and gallbladder on the right of the spleen as the *Cinnabar Field*—
these are vulgar teachers who, having never encountered true instructions, follow the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of Yunfang* and *Poemi Songs on Breaking Delusion*, attacking the spleen and diaphragm without certainty, yet never mentioning the gallbladder, thus clinging to the liver and gallbladder as the *Cinnabar Field*.
Some take the space between the brows as the *Cinnabar Field*—
this is the *Cinnabar Field* for entering samādhi and summoning yin spirits.
Some take the tip of the nose as the *Cinnabar Field*—
this is the *Cinnabar Field* of Chan practitioners practicing samādhi.
Some take arranging flowers and holding vegetables, grasping goods and carrying bowls as the *Cinnabar Field*—
this is the *Cinnabar Field* of street-corner Daoists using objects to lodge the spirit.
Some take the eyes of the *Infant Child* as the *Cinnabar Field*—
this is the *Cinnabar Field* for learning to gaze at the sun without blinking.
Some take the bladder as the *Cinnabar Field*—
this is the *Cinnabar Field* for sealing the *Weilü*.
Some take the *Jade Stem* as the *Cinnabar Field*—
this is the *Cinnabar Field* for practicing *Vajra Chan* and left-handed *Wei* methods of preventing leakage.
Some take *neither thinking of good nor thinking of evil*, calling it *suspended pressure and letting go*, as the *Cinnabar Field*—
this is the *Cinnabar Field* of blind Chan monks who misunderstand the principle of *no-thought*.
Some take the *Jade Maiden* of the stomach as the *Cinnabar Field*—
this is the *Cinnabar Field* for rinsing and swallowing saliva.
Some take the navel-heart as the *Cinnabar Field*—
this is the *Cinnabar Field* of side-door practitioners who visualize heart-fire while absorbing yin.
Some take the two eyes as the *Cinnabar Field*—
this is the *Cinnabar Field* for visualizing the left sun and right moon.
Some take the great frontal bone as the *Cinnabar Field*—
this is the *Cinnabar Field* for visualizing the nine-colored round image.
Some take the face, called the *foot-square dwelling*, as the *Cinnabar Field*—
this is the *Cinnabar Field* for cultivating the *Spirit Court*.
A thousand paths and ten thousand trails—
it is impossible to list them all.
In essence, none of these are the *true Cinnabar Field*.
The *true Cinnabar Field* is nothing other than the *Secret Gate*.

Some take the space between the seven apertures as the *Cinnabar Field*—
this is the *Cinnabar Field* for containing the eye-light, congealing the ear-tone, sealing the tongue-*qi*, regulating the nose-breath, and harmonizing the Four Images—
a practice all Dao cultivators must undertake and cannot neglect.

Some take the *mud altar* as the *Cinnabar Field*—
this is the *Cinnabar Field* for internal elixir practitioners after one year, when they shift the furnace and change the crucible—
beginners in true cultivation should not use it.

There is a *White Crow*,
the *White Crow* of the *Primordial Field*.
It is also called *Black Mercury* or *White Gold*—it is true mercury.
Its *qi* and whiteness blend, hence it is called the *White Crow*.
When hidden and invisible, it is called *gold in water* or *silver in lead*;
when manifest yet unusable, it is called *cold mountain white snow*.
Because it can run, it is called the *Golden Essence Fierce Beast*;
because it can fly, it is called the *White Crow*—
one thing with many names.
It flies into the *Mud Pill*.

Those that "fly in" employ the *Celestial Treasure* method of refining the spirit to merge with the primordial, the *Great Vehicle* path of the *Three Carts*, practiced without interruption for twenty days to multiply the true mercury of the *Primordial Field*. The so-called *true seed* is none other than this *White Crow* of the *Primordial Field*.

The *River Cart* conveys it to *Kun Mountain*—
the *River Cart* refers to the *Three River Carts*.
The first is the *Yellow River Cart*, which is the *double-pulley method of the twin passes*, the technique by which "three returns by day and night yield ten thousandfold the master’s effort."
The second is the *River Cart*, which is the *bellows-and-tuyere method of kindling fire*, the practice by which "the River Cart dares not pause even for a moment, conveying it to the summit of Kunlun Peak."
The third is the *Purple River Cart*, which is the *method of dragon-tiger coupling*, the secret by which "the well-sweep sings the *Song of No Birth*, and the mud-snake in the well dances the *Spreading Branches*."
*Kun Mountain* and *Kunlun Peak* are none other than the *mud altar*.

It passes through the *Jade Pass* without the slightest movement—
this means the *White Crow* of the *Primordial Field* requires not the slightest exertion to naturally penetrate the *Jade Pass*.
The *Jade Pass* is the *Gate of Wu and Ji*.
If even the faintest movement occurs, the elixir will not form.

Seize the *Tortoise and Serpent, Crow and Hare*—
"Seize" means to take hold.
The *Tortoise and Serpent, Crow and Hare* are water and fire, sun and moon; the *Mysterious Female’s* nurturing mass; lead-sand and mercury-silver; *Li* within *Kan* and *Kan* within *Li*.
Though their names are manifold, in truth they are but the two words *yin* and *yang*.

"Capture alive"—
to "capture alive" means that the *Tortoise and Serpent, Crow and Hare* are not beings of a single nature; they are arrayed in the four directions—east, west, south, and north—and the common folk use them daily, yet they remain divided.
The method of the *Returned Elixir* removes the worry of division and brings the joy of mutual attendance—is this not "capturing alive"?
In ancient times, Wang Guzi, failing to grasp the true principle of *yin* and *yang*, saw in the *Book of Changes* the lines "The Dao of Qian becomes male, the Dao of Kun becomes female," and "One yin and one yang are called the Dao," and so falsely established the *Three Peaks* doctrine, taking *female mystery* as the *Upper Peak*, *milk nourishment* as the *Middle Peak*, and *chamber youths* as the *Lower Peak*.
His disciples, aiding their master’s perversion, went so far as to extract heart’s blood and exhaustively absorb *yin* essence, mistaking these for medicinal substances in hopes of forming the *Returned Elixir*.
Thus, the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of Yunfang* contains the warning against "erroneous killing" and the admonition to "befriend the companions."

In an instant, *clouds and rain*—
"In an instant" means a fleeting moment, signifying swift response.
*Clouds and rain* refer to the meanings of "clouds and thunder gathering" and "thunder and rain arising."
What are clouds and rain?
They are but the *qi* of *Kan*-water.
Yet *Kan*-water pervades heaven and earth: when it responds to heavenly *qi*, it ascends as clouds; when it responds to earthly *qi*, it descends as rain.
The meaning of *clouds and rain* is the ascent and descent of *yin* and *yang* to form moistening and nourishment.

A single *point* forms the elixir—
the *point* is the *crimson water’s mysterious pearl*, as small as a grain of millet, hence called a *point*.
"Forms the elixir" means progressing from the subtle to the manifest.

*White snow* blankets the sky, *yellow sprouts* fill the courtyard—
"Sky" in other versions reads "heaven," and "courtyard" reads "earth."
*White snow* is the *white snow of the Six Voids*.
"Sky" refers to the *Six Voids*.
*Yellow sprouts* are the *yellow sprouts emerging from the soil*.
"Courtyard" is the *inner courtyard of the Six Desires*, also called the *Yellow Palace*, for within the two kidneys reside the *Six Gui Jade Maidens*, who govern vigor and whose edge is keen.
The *Scripture of Numinous Treasure* speaks of "severing the edge of the Six Gui," teaching one to restrain the keen edge of the *Six Gui Jade Maidens*’ vigor, so that the *yellow sprouts* may fill without overflowing.
Thus, the *True Person* warns: "Do not let the sprouts and shoots overflow the *Yellow Palace*."
*Yellow sprouts* and *white snow* have many names.
At first, when they circulate through the head, abdomen, and four limbs, they are called *white snow of the Six Voids*;
when they gather at the *Winding River*, they are called *Great Mystery’s divine water*;
when they converge in the *Cassia Sea*, they become the *bright moon of the azure pool*.
In their moistening virtue, they are *heavenly dew*;
when they penetrate the *Golden Crucible* and *Flowery Pond*, they are *fiery mercury’s flowing pearls*;
when they multiply the true mercury of the *Yellow Palace*, they are *emerging yellow sprouts*.
Though their names differ, in truth they are but the *crimson water’s mysterious pearl*.
The various immortal scriptures each record different names, and the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of Yunfang* states: "The true Dao is not found in books—striving to learn is not as good as striving to seek a master."

Take this *knife and jade* to forever preserve the countenance—
"Take this" refers to the *spiritual crow gazing at the moon and drinking sweet springs*.
The *knife* signifies that the superior practitioner, in cultivating this, can "cut and complete the Dao of heaven and earth," while the inferior practitioner will "exhaust himself to the end."
The *jade* refers to the *two soils of Wu and Ji*.
"Forever preserve the countenance" means *longevity without aging*.
There are one thousand two hundred methods of seated meditation and practice, each capable of preserving the countenance, yet none can confer *longevity without death*.
Only those who follow the Dao of the ancient sages—Laozi, Fuxi, King Wen, the Duke of Zhou, Confucius, Wei Boyang, Zhongli Quan, and Lü Dongbin—and, above them, the Yellow Emperor, or, below them, those who awaken to the Dao of the *Awakening to Reality*, can *forever preserve the countenance*.

Constantly *warm and nourish*—
*Warm and nourish* proceeds in six stages:
The first is *warm-nourishing when ingesting the medicine*, the time of refining internal lead into the *true seed*.
The second is *warm-nourishing in wild battle*, the time of advancing the fire.
The third is *warm-nourishing in guarding the city*, the time of retreating the fire.
The fourth is *warm-nourishing in bathing*, the time when fire is defeated and extinguished, requiring steaming.
The fifth is *warm-nourishing to supplement cold*, the time when fire is exhausted and one guards emptiness.
The sixth is *warm-nourishing when shifting the furnace and changing the crucible*, the time after *casting off the womb and entering the mouth*.
Though there are six names, only the single method of *ingesting the medicine* is employed.
Beginning with one and ending with five, it is called *constant*.

Thus, *casting off the womb* and *spirit-transformation* occur—
*Casting off the womb* has three stages:
The first is *casting off the womb and entering the mouth*, the time of "forcibly enduring ten months and casting off the womb."
The second is *casting off the womb and leaving the shell*, the time when "the chicken can brood, the heart constantly listens, and the cicada, upon maturing, naturally parts from its shell."

The third is *casting off the mortal womb*, the time when "form and spirit are both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth."

*Spirit* is that which arrives without moving, swift without haste.
*Transformation* is true non-being that pierces metal and stone, wondrous being that treads the void.
The body resides in the clouds.

There are three kinds of body:
The first is the *self-possessed body*, the "nurtured infant I myself have become," not born of father’s essence and mother’s blood.
The second is the *body of separation and union*, the state of "sitting in life, vanishing in death," where a body exists beyond the body.
The third is the *wondrously formless body*, that which "gathers into form, scatters into qi."

Having realized the *self-possessed body*, one becomes an *earthly immortal*—the immortal embryo flies into the Mud Pill, the Mud Pill being Kunlun Peak, which lies in one’s own cloud realm.
Next, having realized the *body of separation and union*, one becomes a *spirit immortal*—the embryo-immortal sheds its shell and treads the clouds, so that though the form remains on earth, the spirit dwells in the clouds.
Finally, having realized the *wondrously formless body*, one becomes a *celestial immortal*—spirit soars beyond the azure vault, form rests in the great void, so that both form and spirit abide together in the clouds.
The marvel of *golden liquid returning cinnabar* culminates in the body residing in the clouds—this is the *non-empty emptiness*.

**Eulogy in the Style of "Frosty Sky Dawn Horn" by Pure Yang True Man**

Before heaven and earth split, how could things be distinguished?
When nature clings, qi is born—yin and yang still blend as one.
The primordial chaos is the Supreme Ultimate, its body embracing both female and male.
Who can cleave this chaos asunder?

In the Dragon Han and Yan Kang kalpas, the Maiden of Primordial Chaos existed.
Once the Maiden was sundered, myriad forms emerged.
To speak is not to know; to know is not to speak.
Those who discourse at length, expounding grand theories, do naught but wag their tongues.
The immortals who cultivate life find it hard to open their mouths to others.
The wondrous method is truly difficult to fathom—
The wondrous Dao of spirit immortals was transmitted from the Great Clarity.
Without meeting a master’s guidance, vain conjecture only wounds the heart.
True kindred spirits are rare in this world.
Countless aspiring immortals vie to decipher words on paper.
Yet when the former master revealed the truth, the dull-eyed heard nothing.

**To recognize the inversion of yin and yang:**
Within the surging qi of heaven and earth, *Li* and *Kan* are the complete materials.
Grasp the image of the primordial, and the body faces the myriad transformations.

**The sun within the moon:**
The Great Yin originally belongs to *Kan*, within which the rabbit is yang.
The image in the Chamber of the Sun is like clouds—when nurtured, it transforms into utmost hardness.

**The moon within the sun:**
The Great Yang is *Li*, the second daughter, within which lies the crow of the osmanthus grove.
When the moon is full at Mount Dà, encountering it revives the po.

**Marvelous Method of Refining Spirit and Merging with the Primordial to Ingest the Medicine**

A leaf, a branch, a flower—
Within the five viscera, a body of jade and snow, though complex in joints, connects to the spirit.
When the moon shines bright in the wine, cinnabar clouds emerge—
Unstained by filth, unstained by dust.
The yin pit is my home.
On either side, cold cliffs lock in jade ice; between them, a stream flows clear.
Within the reflection of the Great Yang, the heart-flower appears—
This is the City of Hibiscus in the Paradise of Lang.

**Cinnabar dies when it sees me—**
The five spirits’ intent-steed is cinnabar, driving the mind-ape in all directions.
With wondrous fragrance and peerless allure, it seduces and transforms—
A true person sits in the Dao’s court.

**Mercury congeals into sand—**
Black mercury and red lead are mercury, kidney essence and heart qi splitting the celestial truth.
Reunited anew, they return to the limitless—
Gradually realizing the yin-yang body of self-possession.

**Song of Pointing to the True in Refining the Medicine**

What is the highest-grade medicinal material?
It is produced in the mundane world, neither distant nor near.
Forcibly named the Mysterious Female, mercury and lead—
Essence, qi, and spirit alone.

To refine essence is to refine primordial essence, not the essence aroused by lust.
Man does not indulge, woman does not seduce—far from the Three Peaks and Yellow Valley arts.
Within, brightness comes to unite nature and feeling; in emptiness without dust, wondrous substance is born.

To refine qi is to refine primordial qi, not the qi of mouth and nose breathing.
Nose does not exhale, mouth does not inhale—abandoning heaven and earth, breath gently stills.
In the cauldron, *Xun* wind and *Li* fire refine—
Only when the body is at peace is life established.

To refine spirit is to refine primordial spirit, not the spirit of heart’s thoughts and mind’s deliberations.
Heart does not think, mind does not deliberate—thoughts and deliberations are but cares and memories.
Forgetting cares, cutting off memories, silently preserving spirit—
Essence and qi ascend directly to the Heavenly Valley.

Essence, qi, and spirit—the medicine’s closest kin.
Yet cultivating the elixir with these is still not true.
To refine the elixir, one needs the marrow of heaven and earth—
The marrow of heaven and earth is the benevolence of *Kan* and *Li*.

The benevolence of *Kan* and *Li*, unknown to men—
A thousand books, ten thousand treatises are but vain seeking.
At the world’s edge, a teacher of immortals exists—
The immortal teacher blends with the mundane.
The mundane man conceals the perfected one,
Wearing summer linen in winter, winter furs like the ancients.
Honor and disgrace, poverty and success—he cares for none,
In profound obscurity, his heart holds pure essence.
In profound obscurity, his heart holds pure essence—
The wondrous Dao’s celestial mechanism is not lightly revealed.
When three thousand merits and eight hundred deeds are complete,
Why worry that no one will earnestly instruct you?

**Essentials of the Elixir Canon**

The elixir canon is easiest to begin with—
For ten thousand years, there were diagrams without words.
King Wen conferred office and meticulously hid the records;
Confucius inquired of ritual and broke the thongs of his bamboo slips.
The *Central Propagation* and *Dao and Virtue* both contain subtle pointers;
Later, the *Triple Concordance* also transmitted the true teaching.
Pengzu’s *Awakening to Reality* still reveals the Dao—
It never departs from what lies before your eyes.

**General Account of the Three Essentials**

The *bellows and piston* guarding the center—this is Laozi’s three essentials,
That which is "subtly continuous as though existing."
"Opening the door is called *Qian*, closing the door is called *Kun*—
The sage uses this to cleanse the heart and retreat into secrecy"—this is Confucius’s three essentials,
That which is "endless in its coming and going."
The *crown method*, *warming method*, and *endurance method*—these are the Buddha’s three essentials,
The "three carts of the burning house."
The differing accounts of the three essentials among various schools
Arise from not receiving the true transmission.
Abandoning the three sagely teachers to follow heterodox learning—
How can one escape the burning house and remain subtly continuous?

**General Account of the Three Passes**

Taking essence, qi, and spirit as the three passes—this is the three passes of internal alchemy.
Taking form, qi, and spirit as the three passes—this is the three passes of external alchemy.

Taking nose, hands, and feet as the three passes—this unites the three passes of internal and external alchemy.

**General Account of the Nine Cauldrons**

Taking the heart as the nine cauldrons—this is because the heart connects upward to the seven orifices and downward to the two yin, the so-called "embodying the ten thousand images yet untouched by a single thread."

Taking the Crimson Palace as the nine cauldrons—this is because the Crimson Palace connects upward to the seven vertebrae and downward to the two kidneys, the so-called "the Three Peng depart the yin abode, and the myriad realms pay homage to the Palace of the Red Emperor."

Taking the *Secret Gate* as the nine cauldrons—this is because it contains the Three Ones and the Six Guis.

Taking the *Mud Altar* as the nine cauldrons—this is because it contains the nine palaces of the Celestial Spirit.

These two refer to: "From this, transformation yields the firmness of *Qian*; whether hidden or soaring, all proceeds from the heart."

Taking the *zi* hour as the nine cauldrons—this is because *jia*, *ji*, *zi*, and *wu* all number nine, the so-called "the first yang stirs in true unity, and the midnight clepsydra flows long."

Taking one month as the nine cauldrons—this is because one month contains nine returns.

Taking one year as the nine cauldrons—this is because one year contains nine revolutions.

The so-called: "One return in one month makes one revolution; one year’s nine revolutions and nine returns are the same."

Taking three years as the nine cauldrons—this is because three years complete the three lineages, and three years complete the nine lineages.

The so-called: "Three leads yield but one lead refined; the golden fruit and immortal peach have already taken shape."

Taking nine years as the nine cauldrons—this is because one year refines one elixir, and nine years refine nine elixirs, the so-called "one year gives birth to a child, and each child can ride a crane."

**Eulogy on the *Yin Fu* for Dispelling Delusion**

The utmost joy abides in the nature’s surplus...

The benevolent know no sorrow—this is because their nature lacks nothing;
The wise abide in constant joy—this is because their nature has no surplus.
Though devoid of joy, joy arises of itself;
Supreme joy follows desire, and nature then has surplus.

Utmost stillness yields integrity.
Stillness perfects benevolence; movement follows wisdom.
If movement chases the trivial, nature’s stillness returns to the root.
When profound stillness fails to reach its depth, demands and cravings arise.
Sever the single source of profit—this is integrity.

Commentaries on the *Yin Fu Jing* are many, yet most falsely attribute them to sages and worthies to deceive the ignorant.
But views differ, each with its strengths and flaws, only misleading students.
Thus I have gathered the clearest insights and composed two eulogies to enlighten future seekers—those who read will surely grasp their meaning in silence.

**Collected Verses of Ancient Immortals’ Secrets**

Father and son cannot bear transmission;
The world’s sacred vessel, each cherishes—
Gold and jade, treasures most precious, are not cast aside lightly.
Yet still it is passed to sons and grandsons,
The Dao unwilling to transmit, the words unable to speak.

The work demands the Ox and Dipper’s peril.
The Great Dao, effortless, has been transmitted since ancient times—
Not in silent sitting, but in peaceful sleep.
Guarding against danger, wary as the Ox and Dipper contend—
Why does this saying feel unnatural?

Seeking within a painted jar’s surface,
Powdered and rouged, a painted jar,
A jade gourd’s form, truly numinous.
Within the crystal palace, Chang’e’s emerald hue,
A plum blossom, a pear—white as the hare’s grave.

The inferior scholar laughs at this;
The superior scholar, humble, understands creation’s workings—
A single word unravels the True One’s speech.
The dull horse, the foolish donkey, merit only the whip’s sting,
Loosen the reins and make them laughingstocks.

**Two Essential Steps in the Universal Horn**

Master Bai of Ziyang once gifted a poem to Temple Secretary Zhao:
*"Mercury and lead are not taken from within the body—
Dragon and Tiger must be sought beyond the mind.
Grasp these true workings of creation,
And what worry remains in refining the elixir’s head?"*
These words align perfectly with Master Ziyang’s teaching on solitary yin,
Thus I record them here.

I urge you: do not strive to slay the Three Corpses—
Simply sever greed, wrath, and delusion.
Dwell within the inner court of the Six Desires’ heaven,
Diligently nurture the infant for ten months.
After ten months, shed the womb and swallow it whole—
Piercing sinew and marrow, you will soar and roam.
Casually ascend to the Heaven of Primordial Beginning,
Your lifespan as enduring as heaven and earth.

Heaven and earth endure without end,
Transforming form and shifting substance—none perceive it.
Stars fall, dragons and serpents rise,
Yet within a single cosmos, not a thread stirs.
Alas, how people today see great distinctions—
All claim lofty purity in boundless discourse.
Seeking life, they meet death at every turn,
Clinging to grass, entering the womb, calling it extinction.
This mechanism was transmitted by the ancient sages—
Confucius thrice wore out the leather bindings of his books.
The Way of Qian and Kun is nothing more—
Seek it above and below.

The Way of Qian and Kun is no other thing,
Only the profound obscurity of the indistinct and vague.
True essence and images meet in darkness,
Congealing in the Yellow Palace into confusion.
From confusion, form arises—Shi Bohua—
All merit depends on the Purple River Chariot.
What is the Purple River Chariot’s form and hue?
A purple serpent in the well’s mud.

**Six Applications in Cultivating the True**

At midnight, the cold spring stirs like thunder beneath the earth,
Diminishing the odd to augment the even, nurturing the numinous embryo.
Drink daily from a flask of phoenix marrow,
Cultivate the red lotus at the ocean’s depths, plant it in fire’s heart.

At dusk, the hexagram *Gou* rouses the celestial winds,
Martial and civil arts refined in a single moment’s labor.
Boil eight ounces of tortoise liver until tender,
As mountain springs and hollow mud merge into twilight’s haze.

**Practice**
A lone cloud drifts from the warm earth, leaving its peak at ease,
A wild crane, weary of the boundless sky, returns to its nest.
Follow the straight path—come and go without hindrance,
Why must the fire city strike the gourd like a drum?

**Abiding**
The blazing sun rolls ceaselessly through the sky,
Its radiance scattering, finer than the smallest star.
Nurturing essence, golden water, and the cold earth of the mounds,
A thousand mountains bathed in dew—grasses and trees flourish green.

**Sitting**
Wash the heart, conceal its depths—not for ease,
Return to the work, fearing even a moment’s chill.
When water and earth are balanced, the divine tripod stands,
Seated upright within the land of hibiscus.

**Reclining**
Silent and dim, entering the ghost’s den,
Vigilant yet scattered, the round land incomplete.
As the sun sets on Western Mountain and crows nest in the cassia,
Dispel the ghosts, cease the war, and banish the sleep demons.

**Five Emptinesses Ode**

**Obdurate Emptiness**
Obdurate emptiness, withered to the root, severs life’s green,
Day’s affairs untangle, yet sleep flees the night.
Body like wood, heart like ash—what is achieved?
Hearing the Way and walking it, one hardens into rigidity.

**Nature’s Emptiness**
Nature’s emptiness, vast and serene by day,
Moving like floating clouds, still as mountains.
Too lazy to strike at obdurate emptiness, lacking a method,
Hearing the Way and walking it, one stumbles at every turn.

**Dharma’s Emptiness**
Dharma’s emptiness, in essence like obdurate emptiness,
Yet in motion, it abides still within quietude.
Follow the moon and the hours, practice the dark hexagrams,
Two thousand gates—all paths may yet be traversed.

**Non-Emptiness**
Non-emptiness holds work within its void,
Returning to primordial yang, it aligns with stillness.
When yang revives and yin dissipates, purity must be complete,
Leaving only a grain of millet—a luminous pearl.

**True Emptiness**
True emptiness, its wondrous workings beyond thought,
Vaguely akin to the turning of the seasons.
Night replaces day, cold and heat follow in order,
Yet who governs this ceaseless flow?

**Ten Precepts for Cultivating the Elixir**

**First Precept: Curb Evil**
Let no evil thoughts arise in the field of the heart,
Cut them away entirely—clarity and peace will follow.
Shun evil people and deeds, keep them far,
When qi settles and spirit calms, the bones become pure.

**Second Precept: Promote Good**
Nurture the sprouts of filial piety, friendship, benevolence, and kindness,
Uphold propriety, reward loyalty, and add to them.
Rescue the imperiled, aid the distressed, extol all virtues,
Ever honor the worthy and delight in the Daoist family.

**Third Precept: Restrain Anger**
The heart’s fire blazes, keen and bright,
Anger stirs the liver and gall, born of wood.
Without restraining wrath, heeding heaven’s lesson,
The Five Thieves run rampant, capsizing the Dao’s sea.

**Fourth Precept: Suppress Desire**
The palace of the kidneys is called "the strong,"
Six thorns and seductive women bring calamity.
If the earth’s root is not severed, craving life’s pleasures,
The sea of desire surges, sweeping one into the ghostly realm.

**Fifth Precept: Forbid Wine**
Wine, once it passes through the twelve towers,
Stirs spears and halberds in the gallbladder and heart’s chambers.
True yang leaks away through the skin,
Hair thins, essence withers—unceasingly it departs.

**Sixth Precept: Abstain from Tea**
The herb called "gut-piercer"—do not force its swallowing,
It only stirs turbidity and dullness.
If the spirit remains unperturbed, the will stays clear,
The body exudes sweet fragrance, like a white stone spring.

**Seventh Precept: Morning Substance**
Why insist on a hearty morning meal?
Wind, cold, heat, and dampness fear its assault.
When merit deepens and the Three Fields darken,
Excess food is but a waste of teeth.

**Eighth Precept: Evening Void**
Let the evening meal leave the belly slightly empty,
The six meridians harmonized, qi flowing freely.
One extra mouthful is but a puff of smoke,
Filling the ditches and gullies, it spills at the tailbone.

**Ninth Precept: Elevated Forest**
Sit or lie three feet above the ground in the forest,
Ensure it is soft yet firm and sturdy.
If too low, ghostly qi invades the bones,
Frequently air the mats—spare no effort.

**Tenth Precept: Low Pillow**
A pillow too high is most unfit,
A miserly three inches—too low is also wrong.
The true mechanism’s subtlety eludes all,
Only a celestial master’s whispered guidance reveals it.

**Exhortations on Good and Evil in Cultivating Immortality**

**Filial yet not Greedy**
Filial piety, the non-action that precedes all virtues,
The thread running through Tang and Yu’s lineage.
If greed for profit and rank leads to abandoning duty,
It strays from the Dao—heaven and abyss lie apart.

**Brotherly yet not Desirous**
Serve elders, extend filial piety to brotherly love,
Brotherly conduct stands as the world’s model.
If a single thread of desire intrudes,
Discord and contention erupt from liver and spleen.

**Forgiving yet not Envious**
The Way of forgiveness is inherently easy,
Simply let the heart’s ground lie level.
When the heart is level and qi settled, nothing else remains,
Harmony and darkness—spring winds arise daily.

**Loyal yet not Overbearing**
Be loyal to lord, teacher, husband, and master,
Repay even a grain of millet or a strand of silk to the end.
Knowing origin and gratitude, one aligns with the Dao,
Corrupt talent and virtue turn to calamity.

**Divine and Sage—Beyond Compare**
Filial piety, brotherly love, forgiveness, and loyalty—all supreme virtues,
Only the divine and sagely transcend all bounds.
These are the five great roots of the Dao,
Yet when bound by taboos, they cannot be practiced.

**Wise yet not Lewd**
Wisdom, the virtue that precedes the Five Virtues,
Only knowing the Dao makes one truly wise.
Once sunk in lewd desire, clarity fades,
Thus the root of lust is cast aside.

**Proper yet not Thieving**
Hierarchies of honor, age, worth, and foolishness are fixed,
Do not twist them.
Ever uphold reverence, guard the rites,
Or else, like stealing, one is judged by the law.

**Benevolent yet not Murderous**
Benevolence, foremost among the Five Virtues,
Goodness, compliance, kindness, and nurturance.
Called compassion, awareness, and yang’s strength,
Yet sorrow and rigidity bear murder’s likeness.

**Righteous yet not Harmful**
The Five Virtues’ balance rests in righteousness,
All affairs are fitting when righteousness brings profit.
If even a thread harms another,
The noble one deliberates before acting.

**Faithful and Trustworthy—Without Hatred**
Wisdom, propriety, benevolence, and righteousness—sprouts of the Dao,
Without faithfulness and trustworthiness, they are in vain.
Perfecting these Five Constants grasps the root,
The moment hatred or doubt stirs, one sinks into the lower realms.

**Words without Ornament**
The human way values ornament, the immortal way values substance,
Ornate words must not pass the lips.
Sweet-tongued and smooth-talking, they may please others,
Yet risk losing both the Dao and the path to immortality.

**Mouth without Evil Speech**
This mouth is the gateway of fortune and misfortune,
Inciting war or offering good—all in a single word.
Let no evil speech shape upon the lips,
For heaven’s way ever returns in kind.

**Eat without Seeking Fullness**
Though food and drink nourish qi,
Overindulgence in sustenance is not prized.

The foolish fill their bellies with flavors, the wise with learning,
A leaden stomach demands careful attention.

**Dwell Without Seeking Ease**
To seek comfort in dwelling is most unwise,
Unravel the tangled threads with diligent care.
In guarding the center, seek the key to unbroken practice—
This is when Master Xuan Ni mastered the art of qi.

**Do Not Spit Facing North**
In learning the Dao, one must cherish qi and essence,
For spittle scatters both when carelessly cast.
North is the origin of Heavenly One and the Five Phases,
To spit or snivel there is to forfeit a hundred spirits.

**Do Not Urinate Facing North**
Let not filth or urine expose the Three Lights,
To lean and relieve oneself while walking is greatly inauspicious.
Both acts are forbidden when facing north,
For the Celestial One resides in that direction.

**Do Not Kill Turtles Wantonly**
The turtle corresponds to the Dangerous Star and the Water Phase,
Linked to the left kidney, the root of life’s beginning.
To kill it without cause brings grave misfortune,
Especially for those who walk the Dao.

**Do Not Strike Snakes Wantonly**
The snake corresponds to the Void Star and the Fire within Water,
Linked to the right kidney, the gatekeeper of life.
To strike it without cause brings grave misfortune,
All the more forbidden for those who cultivate the Dao.

**Abstain from Beef**
The nature of cattle is not hard to fathom,
Records and texts make it plainly clear.
The law metes out severe punishment for their slaughter,
And heaven’s retribution for their consumption is manifest.
Blessings carved into the forehead extinguish divine light,
While calamity lingers, inscribing one in the ledgers of ghosts.
Even if one’s hidden virtues tower like mountains,
They are whittled away, ground down, sparing no sage.
The Heavenly Emperor grants but one feast in three frosts—
How can the common man dare entertain such thoughts?
Loss of reputation and fortune stem from this,
As do plagues and official entanglements.
Cherish karmic conditions to cultivate virtue and power,
Do not indulge the palate and deepen folly.
To dine on vegetables and drink plain water is joy enough,
Why suffer lifelong deception by the tongue?
Thus concludes the *Trap and Snare of the Three Ultimates and Supreme Destiny*.
