**Preface to the *Huangdi Longshou Jing***

As the Yellow Emperor prepared to ascend to Heaven, he summoned his three sons and said:

*"I once received this *Longshou Jing* from Xuan Nü. It contains twelve threads—*jing* (经), *zhang* (章), *zhuan* (传), and *yi* (义)—speaking of the Six *Rens* (六壬) and twelve *jing* (经). These are the oral teachings I have not passed down. They encompass the thirty-six applications of the *Longshou* (龙首).

Today, I impart them to you. Can you truly practice them?
Internally, use them to aid yourself; externally, cultivate the *qian shou* (黔首)—the people—alongside the virtuous and skilled.

If you cannot uphold them, bury this text beneath the three springs of a sacred mountain, and take care not to recklessly divulge it, lest its power be lost.

I shall now elucidate its core principles for you:
*'Qi yong'* (起用) refers to its activation.
*'San zhuan'* (三传) refers to its three transmissions.
*'Yao zheng zhi ben'* (要正之本) refers to rectifying the day and hour.
*'Tong yi zhi shou'* (同之一首) means that though yin and yang encompass the four seasons, their application is singular.

All things have their own principles—each matter has its own name, its own order, and does not interfere with others. Though myriad affairs converge, each follows its own sequence, never clashing in chaos.

Revere its sacred essence as Heaven’s treasure.

*Tian Yi* (天一) dwells eternally in the *Taiyuan* (太渊) Palace—Heaven’s supreme, unyielding force, governing the four seasons’ *qi* across the four directions. *Taiyuan* is the name of this Palace, located at the center of the Northern Dipper’s axis, directly beside the Goddess of the Rear.

In spring, it roams the *Yutang* (玉堂) Palace—great fortune, presiding over the four *zhong* (仲) times.
In summer, it roams the *Mingtang* (明堂) Palace, with the Goddess of the Rear augmenting the four spirits.
In autumn, it ascends the *Jiangtang* (绛堂) Palace, with the Goddess of the Rear adding the four *zhong* times.
In winter, it traverses the *Shengsi* (生死) Field—*He Kui* (河魁).

Its dwelling is singular—one *kan* (坎) number in the *gan* (干) stems.

To the right is *Xuanming* (玄冥), the *Shao Yin* (少阴)—facing southwest.
To the left is *Mingguang* (明光), the *Shao Yang* (少阳)—facing southeast.
Behind is *Taiyin* (太阴), the *zi* (子) and *hai* (亥) stems.
Before is *Zhengyang* (正阳), the *si* (巳) and *wu* (午) stems.

*Yihua* (翳华) is the name of the Dipper.
Westward, it rides the *Yuheng* (玉衡)—great fortune, lesser fortune.
*Huixuan* (回璇) and *Jing* (璇) are the seven stars of the Dipper, presiding over the eight directions—east, west, south, north, and the four *wei* (维).

It governs the twenty-eight *xiu* (宿) through the four *qi* (七).
It harmonizes the three luminaries—sun, moon, and stars.
It regulates the eight winds—those of the eight nodes.
It establishes the five phases—wood (east), fire (south), metal (west), water (north), and earth (central), shifting in season.

Thus, *Liu Ren* (六壬) leads fortune and calamity, determining the yin-yang of the day and hour, the governing and nurturing stems, and the three yins and three yangs.

Hence, it is called *Liu Ren*.

It aligns the *shunshi* (旬始) with the five peaks—referring to the commencement of the six *jia* (甲) stems.
The three yangs: whenever a *shun* (旬) begins, it must commence with the five *zi* (子) elements. For instance, if the *Long* (龙) is in the Goddess of the Rear during the *jiazi* (甲子) *shun*, it governs military affairs. Next comes *bingzi* (丙子), with the *Zhuque* (朱雀) in the Goddess of the Rear, overseeing legal matters. Next comes *gengzi* (庚子), with the *Bai Shou* (白兽) in the Goddess of the Rear, marking the enemy’s position. Next comes *renzi* (壬子), with *Xuanwu* (玄武) in the Goddess of the Rear, aiding soldiers and officials—this is the *Duanjia* (遁甲) of the five directions and their seasonal positions.

The two spirits receive *qi*—one in yin, one in yang—referring to *Kui* (魁) and *Gang* (罡). Each fulfills its proper role, meaning *Kui* and *Gang* preside over the five directions for twelve days, governing the five *xiang* (乡)—east, west, south, north, and center.

*Tian Gang* (天罡) presides over the east—wood, green—south—fire, red—west—metal, still—north—water, clear—center—earth, subdued.
*Tian Gang* governs yang, bringing life.
*Tian Kui* (天魁) governs yin, bringing death.

Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth correspond above and below—referring to the interactions between the spirits and the day’s *qi* in the four *ke* (课), where mutual assault or injury occurs.

Life and death are decided by what precedes and follows—referring to the *Tian Yi*’s shifting fortunes and misfortunes, pondered through the three transmissions.

My sons, memorize this. Reflect upon it ceaselessly, and practice diligently in your attire, diet, and conduct. Pass it orally only to the worthy; do not reveal its chapters to the unfit.

Do not transmit the *Longshou* to those unworthy.

The three sons bowed in reception, then rose. Suddenly, the Dragon ascended, and as they gazed upward, they still glimpsed its head. Thus, the text was named *Longshou Jing*.

**Scroll One of the *Huangdi Longshou Jing***

**First Section: Divining Annual Auspiciousness and Fortune/Calamity**

For *yang* years, if *Daji* (大吉) presides over the *Taisu* (太岁), and for *yin* years, if *Xiaoji* (小吉) presides, observe where *Jia* (甲) and *Geng* (庚) of Heaven govern to determine the *Tian Dao* (天道). Where *Bing* (丙) and *Ren* (壬) of Heaven govern determines the *Yi Dao* (一道). Where *Kui* (魁) and *Gang* (罡) preside determines *Jujian* (拘检).

Alternatively: *Bing* (丙) and *Ren* (壬) of Heaven govern the *Tian Dao*; *Yi* (乙) and *Xin* (辛) govern the *Bing Dao* (兵道); *Ding* (丁) and *Gui* (癸) govern the *Gui Dao* (鬼道).

When undertaking affairs, follow the *Tian Dao* for great fortune, the *Yi Dao* for secondary fortune—these are *Jia* (甲) and *Geng* (庚). Building houses, digging earth, buying/selling land or residences, or entering official dwellings—if aligned with the *Tian Dao*, success is a hundredfold; if with the *Yi Dao*, tenfold; if with *Jujian*, it is constrained. Serving as a county official brings great calamity.

For example, if the current year’s *Taisu* is in *Yin* (寅), and *Daji* presides over *Yin*, observe where *Jia* (甲) and *Geng* (庚) of Heaven govern *Yi* (乙) and *Xin* (辛) of Earth for the *Tian Dao*; where *Bing* (丙) and *Ren* (壬) of Heaven govern *Ding* (丁) and *Gui* (癸) of Earth for the *Yi Dao*; and where *Kui* (魁) and *Gang* (罡) preside over *Ji* (己) and *Hai* (亥) for *Jujian*—*Kui* as constraint, *Gang* as inspection.

Other years follow this pattern.

If the year falls on *Zi* (子), *Wu* (午), *Mao* (卯), or *You* (酉)—the four *zhong* (仲)—the *Tian Dao* and *Yi Dao* both lie in the four *wei* (维), making relocation difficult.

For *yang* years in *Zi* (子), *Yin* (寅), *Chen* (辰), *Wu* (午), *Shen* (申), or *Xu* (戌), *Daji* presides.
For *yin* years in *Chou* (丑), *Mao* (卯), *Wei* (巳), *You* (酉), or *Hai* (亥), *Xiaoji* presides.

**Second Section: Divining Monthly Auspiciousness and Fortune/Calamity**

**Second Section: Divining Monthly Auspiciousness and Fortune/Calamity (Continued)**

For *yang* months, when *Daji* presides over the month’s stem-branch, one examines the Heavenly *Jia-Geng* (甲庚) as *Tian Dao*, the Heavenly *Bing-Ren* (丙壬) as *Yi Dao*, and *Kui-Gang* (魁罡) as *Jujian*—*Kui* as constraint, *Gang* as inspection.
*Yang* months are odd-numbered, *yin* months even-numbered; their auspiciousness and calamity follow the same relocation principles as the *Taisui* (太岁).
Monthly prohibitions are strict—avoid transgressions at all costs.

For example, if the first month’s stem-branch is *Yin* (寅) and *Daji* presides, one examines Heavenly *Jia-Geng* governing Earthly *Yi-Xin* (乙辛) as *Tian Dao*, *Bing-Ren* governing *Ding-Gui* (丁癸) as *Yi Dao*, *Kui* governing *Hai* (亥) as constraint, and *Gang* governing *Wei* (巳) as inspection.

**Third Section: Divining Auspicious Days for Marriage, Ancestral Rites, and Burials**

To avert *Kui*’s malevolence upon the month, *Kui* is counted forward leftward to the *Ming-Shen* (明神) for great auspiciousness.
*Gong-Cao* (功曹) and *Tai-Chong* (太冲) as *Tian-Gang* (天罡) are *yang*—count *Kui* backward rightward from transmission for lesser auspiciousness.
*Sheng-Xian* (胜先) and *Tai-Yan* (太一天罡) are *yin*—the Five Stems (五干) govern *yang*, the Six Branches (六属) govern *yin*. The Five Stems are *Jia-Yi-Bing-Ding-Wu* (甲乙丙丁戊), also the day stems; the Six Branches are *Zi-Wu-Mao-You-Shen-Xu* (子午卯酉申戌), the hour branches.
When the day stem governs *yang* (killing *yang* males) or the hour branch governs *yin* (killing *yin* females), it is inauspicious. If neither governs, it is auspicious.
If the day stem aligns with a *yin*-governed hour or the hour branch with a *yang*-governed day stem, all undertakings bring fortune to descendants.

For example, if the first month’s prohibition is *Xu* (戌), *Kui* governs *Ren-Gui-Jia-Yi* (壬癸甲乙)—the Five Stems governing *yang* days. *You-Shen-Wei-Chen-Wei-Wu* (酉申未辰巳午) are the Six Branches governing *yin* hours.
Auspicious days like *Bing-Zi* (丙子), *Bing-Yin* (丙寅), *Geng-Zi* (庚子), *Geng-Yin* (庚寅), *Ding-Hai* (丁亥), *Ding-Chou* (丁丑), *Ding-Mao* (丁卯), *Xin-Hai* (辛亥), *Xin-Mao* (辛卯), *Xin-Chou* (辛丑) are free from such governance.
All twelve months follow this pattern.
When *Kui-Gang* descend upon the hour branch as prohibition, collision brings great calamity.
Monthly prohibitions cycle as follows: first month *Xu* (戌), second month *You* (酉), third month *Shen* (申), fourth month *Wei* (未), fifth month *Wu* (午), sixth month *Wei* (巳), and so on, reversing through the twelve branches.

**Fourth Section: Divining the Lunar Mansion Stars**

The month’s governing star is determined by adding *Mao* (卯) to the month’s stem-branch, then counting rightward from *Yi* (乙) on Earth. For example, if today’s count ends there, that is the lunar mansion star.
On the first day of the first month, the star is in *Shi* (室); the second day in *Bi* (壁); the third in *Kui* (奎); the fourth in *Lou* (娄), and so on, reversing until the month’s end, when it returns to *Bi*. The second month begins in *Kui*, ending in *Lou*; the third month begins in *Wei* (胃), the fourth in *Bi* (毕), the fifth in *Jing* (井), the sixth in *Liu* (柳), the seventh in *Zhang* (张), the eighth in *Jiao* (角), the ninth in *Zhi* (氏), the tenth in *Xin* (心), the eleventh in *Dou* (斗), and the twelfth in *Nü* (女). If a leap month begins, the star shifts one mansion forward.

For example, if the first month is leap *Bi* (壁), it follows this rule.
If on the fifth day of the second month, *Kui* governs *Mao* (卯), and *Yi* (乙) aligns with *Kui* (奎), one declares: *Kui* (1), *Lou* (2), *Wei* (3), *Xu* (4), *Bi* (5)—thus the lunar mansion star is *Bi* (毕).
All twelve months follow this method: the month’s stem-branch governs *Mao* (卯), taking the star from *Yi*’s position and counting rightward. Only the first month counts stars rightward from *Mao* itself, not *Yi*.

For example, if on the third day of the first month, *Ming* (明) governs *Mao* (卯), and *Mao* shows *Ying-Shi* (营室) counting rightward—*Ying-Shi* (1), *Dong-Bi* (2), *Kui* (3)—the lunar mansion star is *Kui* (奎).
All other months follow this pattern.

**Fifth Section: Divining the Auspiciousness of Stars and Mansions**

In spring’s three months, the seven mansions of the East are the *Sui-Wei* (岁位), the seven of the South are *Sui-Qian* (岁前). The *Shen-Shu* (神枢) states: "Transmission follows *Kui* below"—this is correct.
The seven mansions of the West are *Sui-Dui* (岁对), the seven of the North are *Sui-Hou* (岁后).
*Meng-Xia* (孟夏) two stars are *Fu-Chong* (负冲), *Li-Xia* (季夏) two stars are *Yan-Chong* (掩冲).
The first month, early spring, summer, autumn, and winter follow this rule.
*Sui-Wei*, *Fu-Chong*, *Zhe-Chong* (折冲), *Yan-Chong*, *Sui-Qian*, and *Jia-Bi* (挟毕) are all inauspicious years;
*Sui-Hou*, *Sui-Dui*, *Tian-Cang* (天仓), and *Tian-Fu* (天府) are great auspicious days.
Even if the hour is inauspicious, it cannot cause harm.

---
**Sixth Section: Divining *Tian-Cang* and *Tian-Fu***

When *Tian-Gang* (天罡) governs the month’s stem-branch, the two stars below are *Tian-Cang* (天仓); those below *Kui* are *Tian-Fu* (天府). The two stars below *Xiao-Ji* (小吉) are *Zhi-Si* (致死).
Mid-month lacks *Tian-Fu* and *Chong* stars; early-month lacks *Zhi-Si* and *Zhe-Chong*; late-month lacks *Tian-Cang* and *Ying* stars.
When *Tian-Cang* and *Tian-Fu* preside over undertakings, virtue extends to three generations—great auspiciousness.
*Zhi-Si*, *Fu-Chong*, *Yan-Ju* (奄句), and *Mang* stars bring death—great calamity.

**Seventh Section: Ancient Method for Avoiding *Tian-Ri*’s Wandering and Childbirth Taboos**

*Tian-Ri* (天日) wanders: on the *Wu-Xu* (戊戌) day, it ascends to Heaven; on the sixth day, *Jia-Chen* (甲辰), it descends to Earth. It resides in the East Chamber for five days, then moves to the East-North on the sixth day via *Yi-Mao* (乙卯), to the East-South on the fifth day via *Geng-Shen* (庚申).
It resides in the East for six days via *Bing-Yin* (丙寅), then moves to the West-North on the fifth day via *Xin-Wei* (辛未).
It resides in the South for six days via *Wu-Zi* (戊子), then enters the West Chamber on the fifth day via *Gui-Si* (癸巳).
Five days later, it ascends to Heaven again on *Wu-Xu* (戊戌), not residing in the Chamber.
Nursing mothers must avoid the direction where *Tian-Ri* lingers—do not face it.

General childbirth taboos: when the month’s governing hour is *Xian-Chi* (咸池), *Shen-Hou* (神后) is *Feng-Long* (丰隆), *Daji* is the *Ri-Da-Jiang* (日大将), *Gong-Cao* is *Nü-Bao* (女薄), *Tai-Chong* is *Gong-Xing* (宫星), *Tian-Gang* is *Tian-Hou* (天侯), *Tai-Yi* is *Zhao-Yao* (招摇), *Sheng-Xian* is *Xuan-Yuan* (轩辕), *Xiao-Ji* is *Nü-Yao* (女夭), *Chuan-Song* is *Lei-Gong* (雷公), *Cong-Kui* is *Yue-Yin* (月饮), and *He-Kui* is *Ri-Xing* (日刑).

「占神月空剧乳妇庐法第八
When the *Xuan-Ji* (璇玑) is combined with the Three Five Mends (三五孟), the taboos for nursing mothers are as follows:
If the month’s governing hour is *Yin-Wei* (寅午戌), add *Yin* (寅);
If it is *Shen-Zi* (申子辰), add *Shen* (申);
If it is *Wei-You-Chou* (巳酉丑), add *Wei* (巳);
If it is *Hai-Mao-Wu* (亥卯未), add *Hai* (亥).

The *Tian-Gang* (天罡) corresponds to *Tian-Hou* (天侯),
The *Tai-Yi* (太一) corresponds to *Xuan-Yuan* (轩辕),
The *Xiao-Ji* (小吉) corresponds to *Zhao-Yao* (招摇),
The *Cong-Kui* (从魁) corresponds to *Yue-Yin* (月饮),
The *He-Kui* (河魁) corresponds to *Lei-Gong* (雷公),
The *Deng-Ming* (登明) corresponds to *Cheng-Chi* (成池),
And the *Shen-Hou* (神后) corresponds to *Feng-Long* (丰隆).

The *Hao-Shi* (昊时) is also the *Shi-Xing* (时刑):
*Yin* (寅) is *En-Xing* (恩刑, the "Graceful Penalty"),
*Wei* (巳) is *Wei-Wei-Xing* (巳巳刑, the "Wei Penalty"),
*Shen* (申) is *Shen-Shen-Xing* (申申刑, the "Shen Penalty").

*Chou* (丑) is *Ni-Xing* (逆刑, the "Inverted Penalty"),
*Xu* (戌) is *Xu-Xu-Xing* (戌戌刑, the "Xu Penalty"),
*Wu* (未) is *Wu-Wu-Xing* (未未刑, the "Wu Penalty").

*Zi* (子) is *Hu-Xing* (互刑, the "Reciprocal Penalty"),
*Mao* (卯) is *Mao-Mao-Xing* (卯卯刑, the "Mao Penalty").

For the first month, use the *Gong-Cao* (功曹);
For the second month, use the *Shen-Hou* (神后);
For the third month, use the *Kui* (魁).
The month’s governing hour is determined by the *Tian-Shang* (天上) *Bing-Ren* (丙壬).
Wherever *Bing-Ren* (丙壬) descends upon the earth,
those places are all *Kong-Ji* (空吉, "Empty Auspiciousness") and may be occupied.

All must avoid the *Lei-Gong* (雷公), *Zhao-Yao* (招摇), *Xuan-Yuan* (轩辕), *Cheng-Chi* (成池), *Ju-Shi* (具时), *Feng-Long* (丰隆), *Tian-Hou* (天侯), and *Shi-Xing* (时刑).

占知臣吏心善恶法第九
To determine the benevolence or malevolence of officials and ministers:
When inquiring about affairs of the time,
the method is as follows:
If *Tian-Gang* (天罡) is combined with the month’s governing hour, it is *Chong-Yang* (重阳, "Double Yang");
If *Tian-Kui* (天魁) is combined with the *Tai-Sui* (太岁), it is *Chong-Yin* (重阴, "Double Yin").

If *Tian-Gang* (天罡) descends upon the *Tai-Sui* (太岁), it is *Yang-Fu-Yin* (阳覆阴, "Yang Over Yin"),
indicating that ministers deceive their superiors.

If *Tian-Kui* (天魁) is combined with the month’s governing hour, it is *Yin-Fu-Yang* (阴覆阳, "Yin Over Yang"),
indicating that superiors deceive their ministers.

When the *Shen* (神) is upon the day’s hour,
if the Yin receives *Ji* (吉, auspiciousness),
and the *Shen* (神) has *Wang-Xiang-Qi* (王相气, "Royal Ministerial Qi") or *Xiu-Qi* (休气, "Restorative Qi"),
with the upper and lower harmoniously generating,
and the day’s hour’s Yang *Shen* (神) does not clash with it,
then the ministers are loyal and filial,
constantly cherishing their superiors and respecting their teachings.

If the day’s hour’s Yin *Shen* (神) receives *Xiang* (凶, inauspiciousness),
and the *Shen* (神) has *Wang-Xiang-Qi* (王相气) or *Xiu-Qi* (休气),
then the ministers disrespect their superiors.

Furthermore, if the day’s hour itself harms its own governing hour,
and the Yin *Shen* (神) above the day’s hour harms the *Shen* (神) above,
this indicates that ministers are not loyal and obedient,
deceitful and difficult to discipline,
ever harboring treasonous and regicidal intentions.

Suppose the Yin *Shen* (神) above ascends to *Deng-Ming* (登明) in Heaven,
coveting and oppressing the *Zhu-Que* (朱雀),
using flattery and deceitful words,
while *Tian-Gang* (天罡) is *Gou-Chen* (勾陈),
holding the superiors accountable for their crimes.
If *Kui* (魁) resides in the *Bai-Shou* (白兽),
it will cause great chaos.

Suppose in the ninth month on a *Bing-Wu* (丙午) day at midday,
how should one interpret the ministers’ intentions?
*Gong-Cao* (功曹) descends upon *Bing* (丙),
and the *Bing* (丙) hour receives the *Shen* (神) of the first three months.
*Tai-Chong* (太冲) descends upon *Wu* (午),
and the *Wu* (午) hour receives the *Shen* (神) of the first four months.
If *Gong-Cao* (功曹) receives the Yin *Shen* (神) of *Deng-Ming* (登明),
it will become the *Tian-Yi* (天一, "Heavenly Unity").
*Tian-Yi* (天一) resides in the Yin *Shen* (神) of the day’s hour *Tai-Chong* (太冲),
and the *Shen* (神) above receives *Shen-Hou* (神后),
becoming the *Teng-She* (腾蛇, "Soaring Serpent").
The hour of *Teng-She* (腾蛇) is upon the hour of *Chen* (辰),
and the Yin *Shen* (神) of *Chen* (辰) is the *Fa-Yong* (发用, "Manifestation").

All upper and lower qi harmoniously generate and align,
while the Yang *Shen* (神) of the day’s hour is upon *Gong-Cao* (功曹) and *Tai-Chong* (太冲).
This indicates that ministers are loyal and filial,
peaceful and loving toward their superiors.

This is also the case when the *Yu-Shen* (雨神, "Rain God") subdues the day,
as the day’s hour corresponds to its use.
Hence, the *Shen-Hou* (神后) is upon *Zi* (子),
and the *Zi* (子) hour has two auspicious comparisons,
indicating worries arising from external matters.

Suppose in the sixth month on a *Ren-Chen* (壬辰) day,
when the sun sets and enters the hour,
*Sheng-Xian* (胜先) descends upon *You* (酉),
and the *You* (酉) hour receives the *Shen* (神) of the last month,
thus the *Tian-Yi* (天一) rides upon *Tai-Chong* (太冲).

*Chuan-Song* (传送) is the governing hour,
and the Yang *Shen* (神) of the *Ren* (壬) day is auspicious.
*Chuan-Song* (传送) descends upon *Chen* (辰),
and the Yang *Shen* (神) of the *Chen* (辰) hour is the governing hour.
The Yin *Shen* (神) of *Chuan-Song* (传送) receives the Yin *Shen* (神) of *Tai-Yi* (太一),
which is the *Fa-Yong* (发用, "Manifestation").

The upper qi subdues the lower.
Furthermore, if the Yang *Shen* (神) of the day’s hour is auspicious,
and the *Shen* (神) is upon *Chuan-Song* (传送),
then the Yin *Shen* (神) above sees the *Chuan-Song* (传送),
which is the *Kui* (魁), the inauspicious god.
The Yin *Shen* (神) of the *Chen* (辰) hour is the *Shen* (神) of the fifth month.
The hour of this day again harms the hour of the day,
meaning the *Chen* (辰) earth harms the *Ren* (壬) water.
This indicates that ministers are not loyal and filial,
plotting to overthrow their superiors,
often involving matters of money and wealth.
Other cases follow this pattern.

占人君欲拜署五官法第十
When a ruler intends to appoint officials:
At the time of the official’s appointment,
ensure that the governing hour of the official’s office is not harmed.
If the *Shen* (神) of the ruler’s year descends upon the *Wang-Xiang* (王相) hour,
it will bring worries and troubles to the ruler.
The *Shen* (神) of the ruler’s year forms the appearance of the concern,
and the official should be appointed to a water office;
Do not allow the Fire *Shen* (神) to descend upon the ruler’s year,
and appoint the official to a wood office;
Do not allow the Earth *Shen* (神) to descend upon the ruler’s year,
and appoint the official to a metal office;
Do not allow the Wood *Shen* (神) to descend upon the ruler’s year.

Suppose the ruler’s year is *Wei* (巳),
and the official is to be appointed to a metal office.
At this time, *Gong-Cao* (功曹) descends upon *Wei* (巳),
becoming the *Zhu-Que* (朱雀),
harming the *Shen* (神) of the ruler’s year.
Metal subdues Wood, hence the harm.
*Zhu-Que* (朱雀) indicates matters of speech and litigation.
It is advantageous to appoint in the autumn when Metal is in power,
as the official’s words will be heard in the higher echelons.
All cases follow this pattern.

*Gong-Cao* (功曹) officials include:
*Ting-Yan* (庭掾) for Earth offices,
*Kou-Li* (库吏) for *Gong-Cao* (功曹) Earth offices,
*Jing-Cao* (狱曹), *Zei-Cao* (贼曹), and *Cang-Bu-Cao* (仓部曹) for Metal offices;
All are also for Water offices,
*Hu-Cao* (户曹) for Wood offices,
and *Wai-Bu-Li* (外部吏) for Fire offices.
Those not affiliated with the five offices are all under *Gong-Cao* (功曹),
serving as Earth officials.

占诸君吏吉凶法第十一
To determine the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of all officials and ministers:
When the ruler and ministers begin their official duties,
be cautious that the *Shen* (神) of the ruler’s year does not harm the officials.
If the *Shen* (神) harms the officials upon their first appointment,
or if the *Shen* (神) of the hour where they exit harms the *Shen* (神) of the ruler’s year,
then for civil officials, seek *Qing-Long* (青龙, "Azure Dragon"),
and for military officials, seek *Tai-Chang* (太常, "Grand Minister").
The governing hour should harmonize with the day’s hour,
and avoid mutual harm or subjugation.

The *Shen-Shu* (神枢) states:
To enter civil or military offices,
the day’s hour must either be Yin-Yang balanced,
or the *Yong-Shen* (用神, "functional deity") must include *Qing-Long* (青龙) or *Tai-Chang* (太常) for auspiciousness.

Suppose the ruler’s year is *Chou* (丑),
and on *Jia-Yi* (甲乙) days, they are appointed to office and begin their duties.
If *Cong-Kui* (从魁) descends upon *Chou* (丑) at the start,
this indicates that the *Shen* (神) of the ruler’s year harms the officials on their first appointment.

Suppose the ruler’s year is *Hai* (亥),
and *Xiao-Ji* (小吉) descends upon it,
while in the southern *Wu* (午) land they begin their duties,
and *Gong-Cao* (功曹) descends upon *Wu* (午).
This indicates that the *Shen* (神) of the hour where they exit harms the *Shen* (神) of the ruler’s year.

For civil officials, *Qing-Long* (青龙) is upon *Sheng-Xian* (胜先).
This indicates that it harmonizes with the day’s hour,
and one must shift the day’s hour and Yin-Yang *Yong-Shen* (用神),
observing the governing hour’s statements.

「To determine official transfers, the month’s *Yong-Shen* (用神) and the hour’s *Yong-Shen* are set as the critical period, with the hour where *Qing-Long* (青龙) descends marking the timing. Suppose *Cong-Kui* (从魁) descends upon *Wei* (未), and a civil official seeks to enter office and begin duties, while *Sheng-Xian* (胜先) is the hour where *Qing-Long* (青龙) descends; if *Jia-Geng* (甲庚) generates the hour, then the transfer is favorable.

The auspicious day is three hours away from *Qing-Long* (青龙) for a three-year transfer, and seven hours away for a seven-month *Qing-Long* (青龙). The *Yong-Shen* (用神) governing their residence is the Earthly Branch, and the hour where *Qiu-Wei* (戌) and *Si* (巳) meet with *Qing-Long* (青ong) is the critical time. After three years and seven months, on the *Wu-Yi* (戊己) day and hour, the transfer of *Tai-Chang* (太常) follows *Qing-Long* (青龙).

When the month generates *Qing-Long* (青龙) and *Tai-Chang* (太常), the transfer occurs externally. If *Qing-Long* (青ong) and *Tai-Chang* (太常) are generated on the same day, the transfer occurs internally—meaning an official promotion while seated. If this method is not fully observed, be cautious: do not allow *Cong-Kui* (从魁) to be misaligned, nor *Sheng-She* (剩蛇), *Bai-Hu* (白虎), or *Xuan-Wu* (玄武) to descend upon the day’s hour. If the *Yong-Shen* (用神) of the ruler’s year is *Xing* (行) and *E* (恶) aligns with its grave, it cannot be used.

The graves of *Jia-Yi* (甲乙) are in *Wei* (未), *Bing-Ding* (丙丁) in *Xu* (戌), *Geng-Xin* (庚辛) in *Chou* (丑), and those of *Ren-Gui* (壬癸) and *Wu-Yi* (戊己) all lie in *Zhen* (辰). The *Shen-Shu* (神枢) critical day is marked by calamity, and the period of concern is when *Qing-Long* (青龙) and *Tai-Chang* (太常) are in fear. The severity of being seated is determined by the Four Seasons’ *Qi* (气) of *Rest* (休), *Old* (老), *Imprisonment* (囚), and *Death* (死).

**Divination of Officials’ Auspiciousness and Transfers (Method XII):**
When the month’s *Yong-Shen* (用神) aligns with the day’s hour and the ruler’s year receives auspiciousness, if the *Yong-Shen* (用神) above and below harmonize, it is a great auspice. If the *Yong-Shen* (用神) also possesses *Wang-Xiang* (王相) *Qi* (气) and aligns with the direction of *Wang-Xiang* (王相), it indicates a transfer. Otherwise, it is inauspicious. If there is *Rest* (休) *Qi* (气), they may be spared from office; if *Bai* (退) and *Qiu* (罢) *Qi* (气) are present and the *Yong-Shen* (用神) above and below harm each other, there will be guilt and misfortune. If a guilty or fatal *Qi* (气) and an inauspicious *Yong-Shen* (用神) are encountered, but an auspicious *Yong-Shen* (用神) follows, it may bring salvation—this is a concern for external matters. If the day’s *Yong-Shen* (用神) possesses *Wang-Xiang* (王相) auspice, it indicates a transfer. If the ruler’s year’s *Yong-Shen* (用神) also possesses *Wang-Xiang* (王相) auspice, it also indicates a transfer. If both the day’s and the ruler’s year’s *Yong-Shen* (用神) are inauspicious, even if the hour’s *Yong-Shen* (用神) is benevolent, it still means no transfer. If the day’s hour, the ruler’s year, and the *Yong-Shen* (用神) are all auspicious, it confirms a transfer without doubt.

To determine the timing of a transfer, calculate the distance between *Cong-Kui* (从魁) and the day’s hour as the period. Suppose today’s hour is *Yin* (寅), and *Cong-Kui* (从魁) aligns with *Wu* (午); this means the transfer occurs five days later, or in the fifth month if applicable. *Jin-Gui* (金柜) states: "Does the transfer occur in this office?" meaning whether it pertains to civil or military officials. The *Shuo* (说) states: If both the day’s and the hour’s *Yong-Shen* (用神) possess *Wang-Xiang* (王相) *Qi* (气), it indicates a transfer for civil officials. If the *Yong-Shen* (用神) above the hour is inauspicious but possesses *Wang-Xiang* (王相) *Qi* (气), it indicates a transfer for military officials. If the *Yong-Shen* (用神) of the day, hour, and inauspicious hour all align, it means a double transfer. If the *Yong-Shen* (用神) aligns with *Meng-Zhong* (孟仲), the transfer occurs internally, and if it aligns with *Ji* (季), the transfer occurs externally.

**Divination of Officials’ Stability in Their Posts and Auspiciousness (Method XIII):**
If the *Yong-Shen* (用神) of the day’s hour and the ruler’s year receives auspiciousness and possesses *Wang-Xiang* (王相) *Qi* (气), it is auspicious. If *Rest* (休) or *Imprisonment* (囚) *Qi* (气) are present, it is inauspicious. The secondary *Yong-Shen* (用神) describes their appearance. Suppose they receive *Tian-Kui* (天魁) as *Bai-Hu* (白虎), indicating death and mourning; or *Xuan-Wu* (玄武), indicating loss and abandonment.

To determine who is auspicious or inauspicious, refer to the *Yong-Shen* (用神) of the ruler’s year: a Yang *Yong-Shen* (用神) represents the father, and a Yin *Yong-Shen* (用神) represents the mother. The *Shen-Shu* (神枢) principle states: Stability or instability is determined by the *Yong-Shen* (用神) of the officials and their direction, following this rule.

**Divination of Officials’ Stability in Their Posts (Method XIV):**
If the *Yong-Shen* (用神) of the day’s hour and the ruler’s year receive auspiciousness and the *Qi* (气) of *Rest* (休) or *Imprisonment* (囚) are absent, with the *Yong-Shen* (用神) above and below harmonizing, it indicates stability in office. If the *Yong-Shen* (用神) possesses *Wang-Xiang* (王相) *Qi* (气), it indicates a transfer. If the *Yong-Shen* (用神) is inauspicious but possesses *Wang-Xiang* (王相) *Qi* (气), and the *Yong-Shen* (用神) above and below harmonize, it still indicates stability in office. If the *Yong-Shen* (用神) above and below harm each other, it means instability in office. If both auspicious *Yong-Shen* (用神) and inauspicious *Yong-Shen* (用神) possess *Qi* (气) and the *Yong-Shen* (用神) above and below harm each other, it is even more inauspicious.

If there is *Passing* (传送), it indicates matters of travel and arrival; if there is *Zhu-Que* (朱雀), it indicates matters of speech and litigation; if there is *Xuan-Wu* (玄武), it indicates loss, abandonment, robbery, and suspicion.

*Guang-Ming-Fu* (光明符) states: If the month’s *Yong-Shen* (用神) aligns with the month’s *Jian* (建) and the ruler’s year exhibits *Rest* (休) or *Old* (老) *Qi* (气), it indicates dismissal from office. *Shen-Shu* (神枢) states: If both the day’s hour’s Yin-Yang and the *Yong-Shen* (用神) are in *Imprisonment* (囚), *Rest* (休), or *Decay* (废), they will lose their position.

**Divination of Officials’ Punishment, Execution, or Promotion (Method XV):**
If a ruler or their subordinates wish to carry out punishments or executions, they must first consult the timing. Do not allow *Tian-Yi* (天一) auspicious *Yong-Shen* (用神) or *Wang-Xiang* (王相) *Qi* (气) to descend upon the day’s hour. Auspicious *Yong-Shen* (用神) include *Gong-Cao* (功曹), *Sheng-Guang* (胜光), *Chuan-Song* (传送), *Shen-Hou* (神后), and *Da-Xiao-Ji* (大小吉). Auspicious *Yong-Shen* (用神) include *Tian-Yi* (天一), *Liu-He* (六合), *Qing-Long* (青龙), *Tai-Chang* (太常), *Tai-Yin* (太阴), and *Tian-Hou* (天后). None of these should be allowed to descend upon the day’s hour or the Yin of the hour. Additionally, the *Yong-Shen* (用神) of the hour’s Yin should not be allowed to harm.

If the *Yong-Shen* (用神) of the ruler’s year harms the *Yong-Shen* (用神) of the ruler’s year itself, it will inevitably bring harm to the body. Suppose the ruler’s year is *Wei* (未), and *Tai-Chong* (太冲) descends upon it, while today’s hour is *Si* (巳). If *Da-Ji* (大吉) descends upon *Si* (巳), it is a great auspice. If Yin is in *Chou* (丑) and *Cong-Kui* (从魁) descends upon *Chou* (丑), this means the Yin *Yong-Shen* (用神) harms the *Yong-Shen* (用神) of the ruler’s year. If this method is applied to such matters, and an auspicious *Yong-Shen* (用神) or *Wang-Xiang* (王相) *Qi* (气) descends upon the day’s hour, while the Yin *Yong-Shen* (用神) of the hour harms the *Yong-Shen* (用神) of the ruler’s year—such as *Cong-Kui* (从魁) harming *Tai-Chong* (太冲)—it will bring misfortune to the ruler’s descendants and harm their children and grandchildren. The ruler’s year refers to the ruler and their subordinates’ gathering. Similar cases apply here.

**Divination of Theft or Robbery in Districts and Counties (Method XVI):**

**Divination of Theft or Robbery in Districts and Counties (Method XVII):**
In the *Chen* (辰) hour of the first month, the *Teng-She* (腾蛇) descends upon the day’s hour. If *Xuan-Wu* (玄武) is present in the day’s hour—whether in yin or yang—it signifies the presence of thieves.

To determine which faction the thieves belong to, observe the *Yong-Shen* (用神) of the *Shang-Jiang* (上将). If *Bai-Hu* (白虎) is used, it indicates murderous thieves; if *Zhu-Que* (朱雀), arsonists; if *Xuan-Wu*, petty thieves. If the *Yong-Shen* is both in yang and yin, and *Liu-He* (六合) is transmitted, the theft will not occur. If the *Yong-Shen* is *Qiu-Qi* (囚气), the thieves will be captured and executed.

If the ruler schemes to harm officials, observe where the *Yong-Shen* aligns with *Fu-Qi* (福奇). For instance, if *Gou-Chen* (勾陈) is used, thieves will be found in the northeast corner. Apply this method accordingly.

---

**Divination of Murder and Fugitives (Method XVIII):**
If the killing occurs during an auspicious hour, in the first month’s *Chen* (辰) hour, *Xuan-Wu* (玄武) governs the day’s hour. If the *Shang-Shen* (上神) restrains *Xuan-Wu*, it confirms the hour of the day. If neither restrains the other, *Xuan-Wu*’s descent signifies a fugitive.

For example, on a *Ren-Shen* (壬申) day in the second month at the *Ren-Ding* (人定) hour, if *He-Kui* (河魁) descends upon *Hai* (亥), a murderer will be present. *Deng-Ming* (登明) ascends as *Xuan-Wu* in yin upon *Zi* (子), placing the fugitive in the north. *Ren* (壬) above obtains *Tian-Gang* (天罡), *Shen* (申) above obtains *Xiao-Ji* (小吉)—both are earth deities, jointly restraining the north. If the method to restrain *Deng-Ming* is applied, it succeeds on *Wu-Ji* (戊己) days.

---

**Divination of Nameless Theft (Method XIX):**
Use the hour of the theft for divination. If the hour is unknown, use the *Ren-Wu* (人未) hour instead. In the first month, *Xuan-Wu* (玄武) and the yin *Shang-Shen* (上神) are the thief deities. If the day’s hour or the year’s *Shang-Shen* restrains the thief deity, the thief may be captured.

For example, on a *Jia-Zi* (甲子) day in the tenth month at the *Ren-Ding* (人定) hour, if *Gong-Cao* (功曹) descends upon *Hai* (亥) and obtains *Hou-Wu-Jiang* (后五将), this is the hour to shoot the thief. *Tai-Yi* (太一) is *Tai-Yin* (太阴) upon *Jia* (甲), *Tai-Chong* (太冲) is *Tai-Chang* (太常) upon *Zi* (子), and *Tian-Shi* (天市) is *Xuan-Wu* (玄武) upon *Chou* (丑). According to the method, *Xuan-Wu*’s yin *Shang-Shen* is the thief, while *Xiao-Ji* (小吉) is the *Tian-Gang* (天罡) yin *Shang-Shen*—thus, *Xiao-Ji* is the thief. The thief’s residence is in the southwest, with the thief described as yellow-skinned, with sheep-like eyes, a receding hairline, and fond of traveling. Today is *Jia-Mu* (甲木), restraining the thief deity. The *Shang-Shen* of *Zi* (子) obtains *Tai-Chong* (太冲), which is also wood and restrains the thief deity. The thief will not escape punishment and will be captured. If the day’s hour or the year’s *Shang-Shen* does not restrain the thief deity or *Xuan-Wu*, the thief cannot be captured.

---
**Divination of Hearing of Theft: Auspicious or Inauspicious, and the Fugitive’s Whereabouts (Method XX):**
Use the time when the theft is reported to shoot the thief today. If the day’s hour or its *Shang-Shen* restrains the deity residing where *Xuan-Wu* descends, the thief will be captured. If neither restrains the deity where *Xuan-Wu* resides, the thief will not be caught.

For example, on a *Jia-Wu* (甲午) day in the ninth month at the *Ri-Yi* (日昳) hour in *Wei* (未), if *Tai-Chong* (太冲) descends upon *Wei* and thieves are reported in their home, *Kui* (魁) is *Liu-He* (六合) upon *Jia* (甲), *Gong-Cao* (功曹) is *Tian-Hou* (天后) upon *Wu* (午), and *Tian-Gang* (天罡) is *Xuan-Wu* (玄武) upon *Shen* (申)—*Tian-Gang* is an earth deity, and *Jia* (甲) is a wood day. *Gong-Cao* upon *Wu* (午) is also a wood deity, jointly restraining the deity where *Xuan-Wu* resides, ensuring capture. The thief will not dare to resist; instead, surround the thief’s home with troops. The general commanding the troops should reside behind the deity’s position, striking first to ensure victory.

For example, upon arriving at the thief’s home, if a deity descends upon *You* (酉), it is auspicious to reside there. Facing east and striking the *Mao* (卯) direction will guarantee victory and capture.

For instance, on a *Jia-Yin* (甲寅) day in the fifth month at the *Si* (巳) hour, if *Xiao-Ji* (小吉) descends upon *Si* and *Kui* (魁) is present, *Xuan-Wu* is upon *Jia-Yin* (甲寅), a wood day and hour, jointly restraining *Xuan-Wu*—the thief will not dare to fight. The method advises attacking fire from behind water, and establishing the day’s hour, then advancing two positions behind and striking four positions ahead. For example, if today is *Jia-Zi* (甲子) and the two positions behind are in *Xu* (戌), attack from *Xu* toward *Chen* (辰).

Additionally, avoid positioning prisoners opposite the *Wang-Xiang* (王相) when attacking, as this is forbidden during summer for *Ren-Yi* (壬癸) days when attacking the four cardinal directions. Follow this principle accordingly. For prisoners facing execution, it is forbidden to attack westward during autumn for *Jia-Yi* (甲乙) days. Attack yin with yang, facing *Shen-Hou* (神后) and *Deng-Ming* (登明) from behind, and striking *Tai-Yi* (太一) and *Xing-Xian* (行先) first. Proceed with caution.

From the fifth month onward, all methods follow the *Shi-Jing Zheng-Wen* (式经正文).

**Divination for Interrogating Prisoners to Determine True Circumstances – Method Twenty**

In the first month, arrange seats on all four sides. Suspect that the prisoner will be compelled to reveal the truth by today’s heavenly stem-branch.

For example, if today is *Jia-Chen* (甲辰), *Ding-You* (丁酉), *Yi-Chou* (乙丑), *Jia-Xu* (甲戌), *Wu-Zi* (戊子), *Gui-Si* (癸巳), or *Bing-Shen* (丙申), follow these precedents.

When interrogating, the official should occupy the *Qing-Long* (青龙) and *Gong-Cao* (功曹) positions, while the prisoner is placed beneath *Gou-Chen* (勾陈), *Tian-Gang* (天罡), and *Bai-Hu* (白虎). Ensure that *Xuan-Wu* (玄武) rests upon a *wu-qi* (无气) deity.

The deity where *Xuan-Wu* resides will fear today’s stem-branch, and the deity where *Qing-Long* resides will cause the prisoner to confess, even if falsely. For instance:
- If the deity above captures a *Tian-Kong* (天空) prisoner, the prisoner will endure pain but remain silent.
- If it captures a *Zhu-Que* (朱雀) prisoner, the prisoner will falsely confess.
- If it captures a *Sheng-She* (胜蛇) prisoner, the prisoner will tremble and submit.
- If it captures a *Bai-Hu* prisoner, the prisoner will commit suicide.

For example, in the first month on *Jia-Chen* (甲辰), with *Deng-Ming* (登明) added to *Yin* (寅). If the official wishes to interrogate the prisoner, today’s *Jia-Mu* (甲木) subdues *Chen-Tu* (辰土). The *Gong-Cao* is in *Si* (巳), *Qing-Long* resides in *Sheng-Guang* (胜光), facing *You* (酉), and the prisoner is questioned.

At this time, the official should occupy *Si* and *You*. *Tian-Gang* is in *Wei* (未), and *Liu-He* (六合) is above *Wei*, with *Gou-Chen* in *Shen* (申). The prisoner should be placed in *Wei*.

If the prisoner is transferred to *Shen*, then *Bai-Hu* is in *Hai* (亥), and the interrogation should proceed in *Hai*.

Above, *Xuan-Wu* faces *Chou* (丑), and *Jia* subdues *Tu* (土). The earth deity fears today’s *Jia-Che* (甲车). If there is *Wang-qi* (王气) present, the prisoner will not dare deceive.

Follow this method accordingly.

Divination for the Six Livestock and Pasture Escape into the Unknown—Method Twenty-One

In the first month (正月), horses are held accountable in *Sheng-She* (胜蛇), cattle in *Da-Ji* (大吉) or *Da-Zui* (大罪). *He-Kui* (河魁) and chickens are held accountable in *Cong-Kui* (从魁), sheep in *Xiao-Ji* (小吉), and donkeys in *Deng-Ming* (登明).

To determine east, west, south, or north, follow the deity’s position. If in the *Sheng-She* (所胜) position, it indicates unrestrained grazing; if in the *Suo-Wei* (所畏) position, it means confinement. If in the *Sheng-Sheng* (所生) or *Suo-Xi* (所喜) positions, it signifies where humans will hide or lose them.

*Tian-Yi* (天一) aligns with *Shun-Zhi* (顺治) by holding *Sheng-She* (胜蛇) accountable, and opposes *Xuan-Wu* (玄武) by holding it accountable instead. This is done by following the deity’s position, the *Shen-Chen* (神辰), and the upper deity (*Shang-Shen* 上神), and determining which holds *Sheng-She* (胜蛇) or *Xuan-Wu* (玄武) accountable, or which deity is held accountable by them.

If no deity holds another accountable, the livestock will not be found. Deities that align with their respective *Shen-Chen* (神辰) indicate they have returned home.

If a deity coincides with *Bai-Hu* (白虎), and both align with the position of a prisoner’s death, it signifies death. If a deity coincides with *Liu-He* (六合) or *Tai-Yin* (太阴), it signifies where humans will conceal or hide them.

To determine distance, observe the deity’s position and upper deity (*Shang-Shen* 上神). If they do not conflict with each other, it is a straightforward path. If the *Shen-Chen* (神辰) and upper deity hold the deity accountable, it indicates the time of retrieval.

For example, on a *Ren-Shen* (壬申) day at noon (日中时), *Cong-Kui* (从魁) is added to *Wu* (午). Horses, having escaped, are held accountable in *Sheng-She* (胜先), which aligns with *Mao* (卯). As the *Shi-Jing* (式经) states: "Each direction returns to its own world," meaning the horses are in the east.

*Sheng-She* (胜先) corresponds to *Wu* (午) in the nine *Tian-Gan* (天罡) system, while *Mao* (卯) corresponds to six. Multiplying nine by six gives fifty-four *li* (里). Today’s *Shen-Chen* (神辰) and upper deity (*Shang-Shen* 上神) hold *Deng-Ming* (登明), which means they subdue *Sheng-She* (胜先). On *Ren-Gui* (壬癸) or *Hai-Zi* (亥子) days, the horses will be found. If *Sheng-She* (胜先) aligns with *Ren-Gui* (壬癸), they will be found on *Ren-Gui* days; if it aligns with *Hai-Zi* (亥子), they will be found on *Hai-Zi* days.

Another method: multiply the deity’s position by the distance to determine the *Dao-Li* (道里) count. If the deity aligns with *Zi-Wu* (子午) at nine, *Chou-Wei* (丑未) at eight, *Yin-Shen* (寅申) at seven, *Mao-You* (卯酉) at six, *Chen-Xu* (辰戌) at five, down to *Wei-Hai* (未亥) at four, these are the distance counts.

For example, if today’s *Shen-Chen* (神辰) and upper deity (*Shang-Shen* 上神) only hold *Xuan-Wu* (玄武) and *Sheng-She* (剩蛇) accountable, and do not hold the deity of the livestock accountable, it also means they will be found. If they hold *Xuan-Wu* (玄武) and *Teng-She* (腾蛇) accountable, those deities will also be found. When two deities hold others accountable, ten will definitely be found—no doubt.

If the livestock are mules or donkeys, hold *Tai-Chong* (太冲) accountable. Another saying: *Cong-Kui* (从魁) is the "knife," *Tai-Chong* (太冲) is the "neck," the deity behind is the "butcher," and *Tai-Yi* (太一) is the "axe." If the knife aligns with the neck, death occurs; if the head aligns with the neck, no death occurs. If the butcher aligns with the "cauldron" (*Fu* 釜), death occurs; if the cauldron aligns with the butcher, no death occurs.

For example, on a *Ren-Yin* (壬寅) day at *Si* (巳) hour, divining a lost donkey: *Tian-Yi* (天一) aligns with *Tai-Yi* (太一) and adds to *Chen* (辰), indicating *Shun-Zhi* (顺治); *He-Kui* (合) holds *Sheng-She* (胜蛇) accountable, aligning with *Tian-Gang* (天罡), and adds to *Mao* (卯). *Tai-Chong* (太冲) is the *Yang* (阳) deity of *Chen* (辰) and subdues *Tian-Gang* (天罡). This means the upper deity (*Shang-Shen* 上神) of today’s *Shen-Chen* (神辰) holds *Sheng-She* (胜蛇) accountable, and the lost donkey will indeed return. *Deng-Ming* (登明) adds to *Xu* (戌), which is close to *Hai* (亥), hence the retrieval.

---

Divination for Determining the Life or Death of Ill Patients—Method Twenty-Two

Always use the patient’s initial illness day and hour for divination. For example, if *Sheng-She* (胜蛇), *Bai-Hu* (白虎), or *Kui-Gang* (魁罡) hold the initial illness day and hour accountable, or if the divination day’s upper deity (*Shang-Shen* 上神) holds the patient’s birth *Shen-Chen* (神辰) or its upper deity accountable, it signifies death.

If *Bai-Hu* (白虎) aligns with the deity of the divination day and holds the initial illness day accountable, or if the patient’s birth year, *Bai-Hu* (白虎), and the *Yin* (阴) upper deity align, and there is *Qi* (气) assisting *Bai-Hu* (白虎), collectively holding the patient’s birth year accountable, urgently summon the patient’s wife and children—the patient will not recover and will die immediately.

If the *Qi* (气) of death is *Bai-Hu* (白虎) holding the patient’s birth year and initial illness day accountable, it signifies death. Additionally, if *Kui-Wai* (魁歪) adds to the patient’s birth *Shen-Chen* (元辰), it also signifies immediate death.

*Bai-Hu* (白虎) is not necessarily bound by *Yin-Yang* (阴阳) positions; observe its direct alignment with the deity and whether it holds the patient’s birth year or initial illness day accountable.

If the initial illness day and hour are unknown, use today’s upper deity (*Shang-Shen* 上神) to determine by three transmissions, concluding at *Bai-Hu* (白虎). If the day enters the *Mu* (墓), it indicates knowing the period of good or bad fortune, determined by the deity in use.

For example, if *Gong-Cao* (功曹) is directly in use, recovery will occur on *Bing-Ding* (丙丁) days, and death on *Geng-Xin* (庚辛) days.

If *Bai-Hu* (白虎) aligns with the deity of the patient’s birth year or today’s upper deity (*Shang-Shen* 上神), it also signifies death. If *Bai-Hu* (白虎) only holds the initial illness day’s *Shen-Chen* (神辰) accountable and does not subdue it, today indicates recovery.

Some say: If *Bai-Hu* (白虎) aligns with the initial illness day or the initial illness day aligns with *Bai-Hu* (白虎), it signifies recovery from illness. If *Bai-Hu* (白虎) holds the patient’s birth year and initial illness day accountable, it signifies death. If *Bai-Hu* (白虎) aligns with the patient’s birth year or day and *Shen-Chen* (神辰) in harmony, it signifies recovery; if it aligns with the same category as the illness day, it signifies prolonged illness.

For example, if divining on a *Jia-Zi* (甲子) day for an illness, *Deng-Ming* (登明) and *Shen-Hou* (神后) align with *Bai-Hu* (白虎), this means *Bai-Hu* (白虎) aligns with the illness day, and the patient will not die in spring. If *Sheng-She* (胜先) and *Tai-Yi* (太一) align with *Bai-Hu* (白虎), this means the illness day aligns with *Bai-Hu* (白虎), and the patient will recover. If *Gong-Cao* (功曹) and *Tai-Chong* (太冲) align with *Bai-Hu* (白虎), this means they are of the same category, indicating prolonged illness.

*Bai-Hu* (白虎) and *Yin-Yang* (阴阳) both have *Qi* (气). If they collectively harm the day, the patient will die immediately; if they do not harm the day, the patient will recover immediately.

If *Bai-Hu* (白虎) lacks *Qi* (气), the patient will recover. For example, if *Bai-Hu* (白虎) aligns with a deity of *Jin* (金), and it is autumn with *Qi* (气) present, even if the year and *Jia* (甲) upper deity hold a deity of *Huo* (火), the fire deity will fear death. This is because fire in autumn lacks *Qi* (气) and cannot save the deity with *Qi* (气). These are all from the *Shi-Jing* (式经).

If the patient’s birth year and initial illness day’s *Shen-Chen* (神辰) are unknown, use today’s deity in use to determine by three transmissions, concluding at *Bai-Hu* (白虎).

When *Tian-Yi* (天一) is in use, its vital *qi* (气) lies in *Chou* (丑) and *Wei* (未). On days of *Chen* (辰) and *Xu* (戌), *Teng-She* (腾蛇) is in use, and death occurs on days of *Si* (巳) and *Hai* (亥). Other cases follow this pattern.

Another method: if the initial illness day and time are unknown, determine by the time the patient arrives for consultation. If the patient’s birth year, current day, and hour all fall into the *Mu* (墓) of the deity in use, it is a death day. If the *Yin-Yang* (阴阳) deity of the patient’s birth year’s *Shen-Chen* (神辰) enters its *Mu* (墓), it is also a death day. If the *Mu* (墓) returns to the patient’s birth year’s *Shen-Chen*, it is also a death year. If the *Mu* (墓) returns to the patient’s birth year, it is also a death.

For example, if illness occurs on *Jia* (甲) or *Yi* (乙) days, and *Tian-Shang* (天上) *Jia* (甲) or *Yi* (乙) aligns with *Wei* (未), it means the day has entered its *Mu* (墓). If *Xiao-Ji* (小吉) aligns with *Jia* (甲) or *Yi* (乙), it means the day is in *Mu* (墓). If a patient’s birth year is established on *Zi* (子) and is being consulted, and the deity *Hou* (后) aligns with *Chen* (辰), it means the *Shen-Chen* (神辰) of the birth year’s *Yin-Yang* (阴阳) deity has entered its *Mu* (墓). If *Tian-Gang* (天罡) aligns with *Zi* (子) as the *Mu* (墓) of the birth year, it is also a death day. The *Mu* (墓) follows the same sequence as the day’s *Mu* (墓).

Another method: if the deity in use begins and ends with the day’s *Mu* (墓), it is ominous. If *Tian-Gang* (天罡) strikes the day’s *Mu* (墓), it means the *Mu* (墓) gate is open—also a death omen. The *Mu* (墓) of *Jia* (甲) and *Yi* (乙) *Le-Mao* (寅卯) wood is in *Wei* (未); the *Mu* (墓) of *Bing* (丙) and *Ding* (丁) *Si-Wu* (巳午) fire is in *Xu* (戌). The remaining branches follow this pattern. *Xiao-Ji* (小吉) is the *Mu* (墓) of wood, *He-Kui* (河魁) is the *Mu* (墓) of fire, *Da-Ji* (大吉) is the *Mu* (墓) of metal, and *Tian-Gang* (天罡) is the *Mu* (墓) of water and earth.

*The Shi-Jing* (式经) states:
If *Bai-Hu* (白虎) and *Yin-Yang* (阴阳) have *qi* (气) and harm the patient, death occurs. If the day enters the patient’s birth year, death follows. If the upper deities of the birth year and the patient’s *Shen-Chen* (神辰) restrain *Bai-Hu* (白虎), recovery occurs. If *Bai-Hu* (白虎) is born on the illness day, death follows. If *Bai-Hu* (白虎) and the illness day share the same element, the patient will be stable for a long time.

**Method Twenty-Three: Determining the Severity of Imprisonment and Crime**
*The Shi-Jing* (式经) states: First, establish the day and hour of imprisonment, along with *Yin-Tu* (阴惕). Use *Feng* (风) to determine the corresponding deity and trace its beginning and end. If it ends in *Xiu* (休), the crime is severe. If it ends in *Yin* (因), additional punishment is added. If it ends in *Si* (死), the crime is severe but later mitigated. If it ends in *Teng-She* (腾蛇), the crime is severe, and death is certain. If it ends in *Zhu-Que* (朱雀), repeated beatings occur. If it ends in *Gou-Chen* (勾陈), there are entanglements. If it ends in *Xuan-Wu* (玄武), the accused will perish after a trial. If it ends in *Tian-Kong* (天空), there is no substance—only emptiness. If it ends in *Bai-Hu* (白虎), the accused will face charges leading to death. If it ends in *Ji-Jiang* (吉将), if the transmission reaches their child, salvation is possible, and the crime is pardoned. If it enters prison, the accused is guilty. If it reaches another prison, the case is transferred. The so-called "prison" refers to *Mu* (墓).

For example, if *Gong-Cao* (功曹) or *Tai-Chong* (太冲) *Xiao-Ji* (小吉) is the prison, *Deng-Ming* (登明) or *Shen-Hou* (神后) is the *Tian-Gang* (天罡) prison. Other cases follow this pattern. The "transfer of prison" means, for instance, beginning with *Gong-Cao* (功曹) and ending with *He-Kui* (河魁)—this is a transfer of prison.

One method involves using the initial day of imprisonment to determine the charge. For example, if a fight occurs, *Gou-Chen* (勾陈) is responsible for homicide; *Bai-Hu* (白虎) for theft; *Xuan-Wu* (玄武) for slander; and *Zhu-Que* (朱雀) for false accusations. If the accused is charged with assault, the deity residing in *Gou-Chen* (勾陈) is the culprit, and judgment follows. If the culprit is *Gou-Chen* (勾陈) on the day of imprisonment, no judgment is passed. If *Gou-Chen* (勾陈) shares the same element as the day, imprisonment will be prolonged. If the transmitted deity reaches its prison, judgment is certain.

For example, if imprisonment occurs on *Jia* (甲) or *Yi* (乙) days, *Tian-Yi* (天一) resides in *Xiao-Ji* (小吉) and aligns with *Wei* (未); if imprisonment occurs on *Bing* (丙) or *Ding* (丁) days, *Tian-Yi* (天一) aligns with *Xu* (戌); if imprisonment occurs on *Geng* (庚) or *Xin* (辛) days, *Tian-Yi* (天一) aligns with *Chou* (丑); if imprisonment occurs on *Ren* (壬) or *Gui* (癸) days, *Tian-Yi* (天一) aligns with *Chen* (辰); if imprisonment occurs on *Wu* (戊) or *Ji* (己) days, *Tian-Yi* (天一) also aligns with *Chen* (辰). This means the accused will inevitably face litigation, and if *Gou-Chen* (勾陈) transmits its *Yin* (阴) to *Bai-Hu* (白虎), and the deity residing in *Bai-Hu* (白虎) aligns with *Gou-Chen* (勾陈) and the culprit, the accused on the imprisonment day will die.

*The Shi-Jing* (式经) states: If imprisonment occurs on *Jia* (甲) or *Yi* (乙) days and *Gou-Chen* (勾陈) resides on a metal deity, this means *Gou-Chen* (勾陈) overpowers the imprisonment day, and the accused will be convicted. If *Gou-Chen* (勾陈) resides on an earth deity, this means the imprisonment day overpowers *Gou-Chen* (勾陈), and the accused will be acquitted. If *Gou-Chen* (勾陈) transmits its *Yin* (阴) and reaches *Tian-Yi* (天一), and *Tian-Yi* (天一) generates the imprisonment day’s *Shen-Chen* (神辰), this means a noble saves the accused. If *Gou-Chen* (勾陈) transmits to the imprisonment day’s *Zi* (子), the mother will grieve, and a petition can be made.

For example, on the seventh month’s *Ji-Wei* (己未) day during a solar eclipse, if *Tai-Chang* (太常) aligns with *Si* (巳), it means the day’s *Shen-Chen* (神辰) collectively obtains the later four deities. The deities do not clash, and there is *Wang-Xiang* (王相) *qi* (气), meaning metal and jade. *Tian-Gang* (天罡) aligns with *Mao* (卯) as *Gou-Chen* (勾陈), and its transmission reaches its mother—meaning *Tai-Yi* (太一) is obtained on *Chen* (辰). If *Gou-Chen* (勾陈) shares the same element as the day, by law, imprisonment will be prolonged. Otherwise, the accused will be pardoned. To know the period of fortune or misfortune, trace the deity in use. If it ends with a deity of salvation, that is the period.

For example, on the seventh month’s *Ji-Wei* (己未) day at *You* (酉) hour, *Tian-Yi* (天一) governs *Shen-Hou* (神后) and aligns with *Chen* (辰), while *Tai-Chong* (太冲) also aligns with the day’s *Shen-Chen* (神辰). The deities do not clash, and there is *Wang* (王) *qi* (气) in transmission, reaching its mother because *Deng-Ming* (登明) aligns with *Mao* (卯). *Gou-Chen* (勾陈) shares the same element as the day, and by law, imprisonment should be prolonged. However, if *Tian-Yi* (天一) is transmitted, it means the prison is transferred.

**Method Twenty-Four: Determining Auspicious Departure Gates for Travel**
At the start of a journey, if the day’s *Shen-Chen* (神辰), the traveler’s birth year, and the deity in use obtain a *Ji* (吉) deity, with *Wang-Xiang* (王相) and *Xiu* (休) *qi* (气), and *Xiao-Ji* (小吉) is transmitted downward, it becomes *Da-Ji* (大吉). Be cautious not to have *Kui-Gang* (魁罡) align with the departure gate. The deity of the departure gate must not harm the traveler’s birth year deity. The "gate deity" refers to the deity of the entrance and exit.

For example, on the eighth month’s *Jia-Shen* (甲申) day at *Mao* (卯) hour, the traveler’s birth year is established on *Xu* (戌), and *Xu* (戌) obtains *Deng-Ming* (登明). If it harms the traveler’s *Wu* (午), and *Wu* (午) obtains *Xiao-Ji* (小吉), while *Xiao-Ji* (小吉) harms *Deng-Ming* (登明), this means the gate deity harms the traveler’s birth year deity.

If the gate harms the traveler’s birth year, the Dao will bring misfortune.
If the birth year harms the gate, the traveler will be restless, and illness will surely cause their return.
This is what is called the birth year deity harming the gate deity.

Moreover, do not arrive at the time when the *Zei* (贼) first emerges.
For example, if the departure day falls on *Jia-Yi* (甲乙) hours added to *Yin-Mao* (寅卯), be cautious not to arrive on *Geng-Xin* (庚辛) days during *Shen-You* (申酉) hours.
If arrival occurs then, the *Zei*’s initial emergence will bring blame upon the traveler’s ancestors.

Do not allow *yin-yang* to sever their kindred.
That is, when one wishes to travel, the day’s *Shen-Chen* (神辰) *yin-yang* must have transmission.
If the transmission encounters a *Ji* (吉) deity, the traveler will be fortunate;
If it encounters a *Xiang* (凶) deity, the traveler will be ill-fated.

For example, if at the time of travel the transmission is not within the *yin-yang* of the day’s *Shen-Chen*, but the transmission deity itself is *Ji*, it is still fortunate—only avoid evil deities.

If the transmission deity is *Teng-She* (腾蛇), there will be alarm and dread;
*Zhu-Que* (朱雀), disputes and detention;
*Gou-Chen* (勾陈), battles and strife;
*Xuan-Wu* (玄武), loss and misplacement;
*Tian-Kong* (天空), illness and depletion;
If the sought-after matter lies with *Bai-Hu* (白虎), there will be death and mourning.
Others follow this pattern.

When leading an expedition, one must ensure that the **Celestial Ganges (天罡)** aligns with the four seasons as the **Divine Pivot (神枢)**, making all external matters auspicious. The **Divine Pivot** further states: If the direction of travel harms the year of the traveler’s birth, there will be joy.

For example, if one wishes to travel and the traveler’s birth-year aligns with the season of the destination, this is when the direction of travel harms their birth-year. Others follow this pattern.

**Divination for those seeking matters while traveling (25th method):**
At the start of the journey, on the exact day and hour, if the **Divine Pivot (神)** of today’s *Chen* (辰) harms the birth-year’s *Chen* of the traveler’s birthplace, or if the birthplace’s *Chen* harms the *Chen*’s **Divine Pivot**, this is called **mutual assault (相刑)**, and the matter will not succeed.

For example, if the traveler’s birth-year aligns with *Wei* (巳), and today is *Bing-Yin* (丙寅), with the **Divine Pivot** descending upon *Yin* (寅), this is when the *Chen*’s **Divine Pivot** harms the birth-year’s *Chen* of the traveler’s birthplace.
If today’s hour has the **Divine Pivot** descending upon *Yin* (寅), and the birth-year’s *Chen* is *Wei* (巳), this is when the birthplace’s *Chen* harms the *Chen*’s **Divine Pivot**.

For those who seek matters, one must ensure that today’s *yin-yang* of the *Chen* and the **transmission (传送)** align with the category of the matter sought.
The **category of the matter (事类)** refers to seeking wealth:
- To obtain **Small Auspiciousness (青龙小吉)**, seek **silk fabrics (缯彩)**;
- To obtain **Grand Harmony (太常)**, seek **silkworms (蚕)**;
- To obtain **Victorious Light (胜光)** and its comparisons.

Thus, the *Shi Li Jing* states: If the **Divine Pivot** harms the land of the birth-year’s sought matter, it will be difficult to obtain, and loss will follow.

**Divination for the auspiciousness or ill-fortune of distant travelers (26th method):**
One must observe the **yang deity (阳神)** of the destination. For the **East and South**, set *You* (酉) as the limit, with the **Deity of Child (子上神)** as the arrival period.
For the **West and North**, set *Mao* (卯) as the limit, with the **Deity of Noon (午上神)** as the arrival period.

For example, if traveling to a place marked by *You* (酉), the traveler departs when *Kui* (魁) aligns with *Xu* (戌) as *Wei* (巳), aligns with *Zi* (子) as halfway, and aligns with *Mao* (卯) as the limit. The arrival is determined by the **Deity of Noon (午上神)**, reaching its peak on *Ren-Gui* (壬癸) days of *Hai-Zi* (亥子).

If traveling to a place marked by *Wei* (巳), the traveler departs when *Tai-Yi* (太一) aligns with *Wu* (午) as *Wei* (巳), aligns with *You* (酉) as the limit. The arrival is determined by the **Deity of Child (子上神)**, reaching its peak on *Geng-Xin* (庚辛) days of *Shen-You* (申酉).

If traveling to a place marked by *Yin* (寅), the traveler arrives when *Gong-Cao* (功曹) aligns with *You* (酉).
If traveling to a place marked by *Shen* (申), the traveler arrives when **transmission (传送)** aligns with *Mao* (卯).
If traveling to a place marked by *Zi* (子), the traveler arrives when **Divine Pivot (神后)** aligns with *Mao* (卯).
If traveling to a place marked by *Wu* (午), the traveler arrives when *Sheng-Xian* (胜先) aligns with *You* (酉).
All arrivals are determined by the **Deity of Child (子上神)** and **Deity of Noon (午上神)** as the peak periods.

If travelers exceed the limit, it is considered as if they were heard of but did not arrive. The **category of the matter (事类)** is also deemed not to arrive.

The **categories of matters (事类)** are as follows:
- Seeking a noble person or one’s father: **Celestial Deity (天)**;
- Seeking parents: **Grand Harmony (太常)**;
- Seeking siblings: **Great Yin (太阴)**;
- Seeking women: **Empress Mother (天后)**;
- Seeking children and grandchildren: **Six Harmonies (六合)**;
- Seeking friends, husbands, money, or officials of the second rank: **Azure Dragon (青龙)**;
- Seeking thieves: **Dark Turtle (玄武)**;
- Seeking death or mourning: **White Tiger (白虎)**;
- Seeking slaves: **Celestial Void (天空)**;
- Seeking officials to capture a person: **Vermilion Bird (朱雀)**;
- Seeking safe return from travel: **Victorious Serpent (胜蛇)**;
- Seeking battles: **Hooked Array (勾陈)**, determined by the alignment with today’s *Chen* and hour, comparing for arrival;
- **Transmission (传)** marks the arrival, while exceeding the limit marks non-arrival.

The *Ji Ling Ji* states: For those awaiting travelers, if divined on *Jia-Yi* (甲乙) days and the **Deities of Wei-Wu (巳午)** are obtained, it means they are approaching. If the **Deities of Hai-Zi (亥子)** are obtained, it means they are turning back, and turning back means they will not arrive.

The *Golden Cabinet (金匮)* states: For questions of arrival or non-arrival, observe the four deities before the day. If on a *Jia-Wu* (甲午) day, the deity seen on *Xu* (戌) four days prior is *Gong-Cao* (功曹), then arrival will be upon *Yin* (寅).

Another saying states: If one should arrive but does not, this method applies. It further states: For divining travelers, use the **Birth King (生王)** as the arrival period. For example, if the **Water God (起水神)** is used, arrival will be on *Jia-Zi* (甲子) days. If encountering a **grave (墓)**, they will not come. For example, on *Ren-Gui* (壬癸) days, if the **Celestial Deity (天是)** is used, it means encountering a grave, and they will not arrive.

The *Shi Su Jing* states: Divining outsiders with the **Birth King (生王)** means they will arrive; divining family members encountering a grave also means they will arrive.

In general, divining auspiciousness, ill-fortune, delays, or the distance of travel is all determined by calculating the **River Marshal (河魁)**.

The *Golden Cabinet (金匮)* states: Count the days from *Kui* (魁). For example, if *Kui* aligns with *Wei* (未), *Wei* is eight, and *Kui* is five; five multiplied by eight equals forty, which is auspicious. Ill-fortune lies within forty days. The traveler’s journey will be four hundred *li*.

Others follow this pattern. Another saying states: The **River Marshal (魁罡)** departs from the initial day of travel as the period day. If it aligns with the departure day, arrival will be immediate.

Another method states: For those residing outside awaiting someone inside, use the **yin deity (阴神)** of the *Chen* at the Summer Solstice. For those residing inside awaiting someone outside, use the **yang deity (阳神)** of the *Chen* at the Winter Solstice aligning with today’s *Chen*. If the *Chen* and **Tai-Chong (太冲)** align with *Wei* (未), they will arrive.

For example, if the Summer Solstice is at *Mao* (卯), the **yang deity (阳神)** *Tai-Chong* (太冲) of *Mao* (卯) is the root, today’s *Bing-Ding* (丙丁) *Tai-Chong* (太冲) descending upon *Yin* (寅) is the root, descending upon *Wu* (午) is the middle, descending upon *Xu* (戌) is the end—all mean arrival.

If *Tai-Chong* (太冲) descends upon *Wu* (午), it will arrive on *Bing-Ding* (丙丁) days of *Wei-Wu* (巳午), reaching the monthly period in five months.

If the Winter Solstice is at *Wu* (午), the **yang deity (阳神)** is *Sheng-Xian* (胜先). Today’s *Jia-Yi* (甲乙), with *Sheng-Xian* (胜先) descending upon *Hai* (亥) as the root, descending upon *Mao* (卯) as the middle, descending upon *Wei* (未) as the end—all mean arrival.

If *Sheng-Xian* (胜先) descends upon *Hai* (亥), it will arrive on *Ren-Gui* (壬癸) days of *Hai-Zi* (亥子), reaching the monthly period in ten months.

Another method states: For awaiting travelers, if the **Celestial Ganges (天罡)** aligns with today’s *Chen* as the arrival day, and if it aligns in reverse with the *Chen*, they will not arrive.

The **reverse and forward (逆顺)** refers to this: For example, if awaiting someone from the West, the **Celestial Ganges (天罡)** aligns with the North. The *Chen* of the East is forward, meaning they will arrive; aligning with the South is reverse, meaning they will not arrive; aligning with the West is forward, meaning they will arrive; aligning with the North is reverse, meaning they will not arrive.

「If the **Celestial Ganges (天罡)** aligns in reverse, they will not arrive.

The **Dao of Heaven (天道)** moves leftward—when the **Celestial Ganges (天罡)** descends upon the monthly period, the traveler’s year is suspended at the gate of their destination. When awaiting someone from the West or North, *Mao* (卯) is the gate, and the arrival is marked by the **Yang spirit (阳神)** ascending at *Chen* (午). When awaiting someone from the South or East, *You* (酉) is the gate, and the arrival is marked by the **Yang spirit (阳神)** ascending at *Zi* (子).

In all cases, if the **spirit (神)** of the traveler enters the gate, they will arrive. If they do not arrive, it is said that the **Celestial Ganges (天罡)** is a **criminal (刑人)**, and the traveler is likewise **criminal (刑)**.

For example, if awaiting someone from *Yin* (寅) land, and if there is a **malevolent general (凶将)** above *Yin*, they will be delayed by misfortune; if there is a **benevolent general (吉将)**, they will be delayed by good fortune; if there is **Qinglong Taichang (青龙太常)**, it signifies wealth, food, and drink—this is auspicious. The same applies elsewhere.

If **Baihu (白虎)** appears, it signifies death or mourning; if **Gouchen (勾陈)** appears, it signifies battle; if **Zhuque (朱雀)** appears, it signifies quarrels or litigation. When awaiting an official, if a **benevolent person (吉人)** encounters a **benevolent general (吉将)**, or if a **malevolent person (凶人)** encounters a **malevolent general (凶将)**, they will arrive. The same applies elsewhere.

**Method 27: Determining Auspiciousness or Inauspiciousness for Travelers**
Examine the traveler’s year and the **Yang spirit (阳神)** of the hour they were born, along with the **benevolent general (吉将)**. If these align with a location possessing **qi (气)**, and if the upper and lower positions mutually generate, it is auspicious. If they encounter **no excess (无过)** or **harmful spirits (恶神)**, but align with a location of **imprisonment or death (囚死之乡)**, and if the upper and lower positions mutually destroy, or if they also align with the **yearly tomb (年墓)** or **daily tomb (日墓)**, it is inauspicious.

For example, if the traveler was born in the year of *Yin* (寅), and at the time of divination, the **Gongcao (功曹)** aligns with **Baihu (白虎)**, while also descending upon *Wei* (未), this means they are encountering a **malevolent general (凶将)** and aligning with their **yearly tomb (年墓)**—this is a great calamity. This applies when the hour is near *Chen* (午) as well.

Another method: If the traveler’s year is unknown, take the hour as their body and the **hourly stem-branch (辰阴阳)** as their birth hour. If the **hourly spirit (辰之神)** is **yin (阴)**, and it aligns with a **benevolent general (吉神将)**, this is like encountering a **benevolent general (吉将)**—it is auspicious; if it aligns with a **malevolent general (凶神将)**, it is inauspicious.

**Method 28: Determining Auspiciousness or Inauspiciousness for Travelers Within the Home**
Examine the **hourly stem-branch (正日时辰)** and the **yin spirit (阴神)** of the upper position. If it aligns with a **benevolent general (吉神将)**, or if **Wangxiang (王相)** and **resting qi (休气)** are present, and if the upper and lower positions mutually generate, it is auspicious. If it aligns with a **malevolent or harmful general (凶神恶将)**, it is inauspicious.

To judge by extremes: If **Baihu (白虎)** is encountered, it signifies matters of death or mourning; if **great benevolence (大吉)** or **resting qi (休气)** is encountered, it signifies **wasting illness (耗病)**. Each is determined by the nature of the **benevolent or malevolent general (善恶将)**. The same applies elsewhere.

**Method 29: Determining Auspiciousness or Inauspiciousness for Construction and All Matters**

Examine the **hourly stem-branch (正日时)**—ensure that the **current year’s Tai Sui (太岁) yang spirit (阳神)** does not govern the **hourly stem-branch of the day** or the **land to be treated**. If it does, the household will be **annihilated within twelve years**.

Further, ensure that **Kui Gang (魁罡), Teng She (腾蛇), or Bai Hu (白虎)** do not govern the **hourly stem-branch of the day**, for this is **greatly inauspicious**.

If **Da Ji (大吉), Sheng Xian (胜先), or Gong Cao (功曹)** align with the **yin-yang of the hourly stem-branch** and harmonize with it, then it is **greatly auspicious**. Otherwise, it is inauspicious.

For entering dwellings, apply the same method.

By examining the **upper generals (上神将)**, one determines the nature of the **auspicious or inauspicious generals (吉凶将)**:
- If **Bai Hu (白虎)** is encountered, there will be **many deaths and mourning**.
- If **Xuan Wu (玄武)** is encountered, there will be **many losses and abandonment**.
- If **Gou Chen (勾陈)** is encountered, there will be **many lawsuits**.
- If **Zhu Que (朱雀)** is encountered, there will be **quarrels, litigation, and official troubles**.
- If **Teng She (腾蛇)** is encountered, there will be **strange occurrences**.
- If **Tian Kong (天空)** is encountered, there will be **decline and depletion**, failed ventures, and livestock will not thrive.
- If **Zhu Que (朱雀)** aligns with **Deng Ming (登明) or Tian Yi (天一)** in conjunction with the dwelling, it will bring **punishment**. If using the **Zhi Yong Shen (直用神)** from the *Zhongshu* transmission, there is salvation. For those who come afterward, they must **avoid it**.

For example, if the **Tai Sui is in Mao (卯)** this year, and on the **eighth month, Jia Xū day (甲戌)**, during **daybreak (日出时)**, **Tian Gang (天罡)** governs **Mao (卯)**. If one constructs or covers a house, **Tai Chong (太冲)**, as the **Tai Sui yang spirit**, governs **Jia (甲)**, encountering **Zhu Que (朱雀)**. **Kui (魁)**, as **Xuan Wu (玄武)**, governs **You (酉)**, while the **yin-yang of the hourly stem-branch** lacks **Da Ji (大吉), Sheng Xian (胜先), or Gong Cao (功曹)**. Moreover, the **Tai Sui yang spirit** governs the **hourly stem-branch of the day**, making all matters **greatly inauspicious**. If, on that day, one intends to treat **Yin (寅) land for residence**, it falls under the **Tai Sui yang spirit’s governance**, and thus is also **greatly inauspicious**. Apply the same method elsewhere.

**Method 30: Determining Whether a Dwelling is Habitable**

Examine the **hourly stem-branch (正日时)** and the **yin spirit of the upper general (上神神阴)**. If an **auspicious general (吉神将)** is present, with **Wang Xiang (王相) and resting qi (休气)**, and the upper position **generates (相生)**, then it is **auspicious to reside**. If a **malevolent general (凶神)** is present, with **prison or death qi (囚死气)**, and the upper and lower positions **harm (相贼)**, then it is **inauspicious and uninhabitable**.

By examining the **extremes (尤者)**, one discerns their manifestations:
- If **Bai Hu (白虎)** is present, there will be **death and mourning**.
- If **Tian Kong (天空)** is present, there will be **emptiness and depletion**.
Apply the same method elsewhere.

**Method 31: Determining the Auspiciousness of Cultivating Sericulture and the Five Grains**

Examine the **hourly stem-branch (正日时)**. If the **upper general (上神)** of the day’s branch contains abundant **Wang Xiang (王相) qi**, and the **general of the kind (类神)** aligns with it in **generating (相生)**, then it is **auspicious**.

If the **general of the Heavenly One (天一所居神)** also **generates (相生)** the same kind of general as the **upper general of the Great Year (太岁上神)**, then it is **greatly auspicious**.

If the **day’s branch (日辰)** and its **yin-yang (阴阳)** and **transmitted general (用传)** contain the kind’s general, then the crop will **bear fruit**.

If **Kui (魁), Gang (罡), Sheng She (剩蛇), Bai Hu (白虎), or prison-death qi (囚死之气)** are present in the day’s branch, then it is **inauspicious**.

The **kind’s general (物类者)** refers to:
- **Silkworms (蚕)** with **Sheng Qian (胜先)**
- **Grain (禾)** with **Gong Cao (功曹), Tai Chong (太冲)**
- **Millet (黍) and small beans (小豆)** with **Tian Yi (天一), Sheng Qian (胜先)**
- **Wheat (麦)** with **Chuan Song (传送), Cong Kui (从魁)**
- **Rice (稻) and large beans (大豆)** with **Deng Ming (登明), Shen Hou (神后)**
- **Hemp (麻)** with **Da Ji (大吉), Xiao Ji (小吉)**

For example, if one examines **silkworms (蚕)**, and the day’s branch contains **Sheng Qian (胜先)**, with **three transmitted Sheng Qian (胜先)**, all obtaining **auspicious generals (吉神将)**, and the **general of the Heavenly One (天一所居神)** and the **upper general of the Great Year (太岁上神)** both **generate (相生) Sheng Qian (胜先)**, then it is **greatly auspicious**.

For instance, if the **Great Year (太岁)** is in **Chen (辰)**, on a **fourth-month wu Chen (戊辰)** day at **midday (午)**, **Chuan Song (传送)** is present, and one inquires about the auspiciousness of **silkworms (蚕)**, then:
As **Sheng Qian (胜先)** is present in **Chen (辰)**, this signifies the kind’s general is present.
The **Great Year’s upper general (太岁上神)** naturally obtains **Sheng Qian (胜先)**, and the **general of the Azure Dragon (青龙神将)** will **generate (相生)** it.
**Tian Yi (天一)** is in **Da Ji (大吉)**, not **harming (相克)** **Sheng Qian (胜先)**, making it **greatly auspicious**.
All the **upper generals of the day’s branch (日辰上神)** contain **Wang Xiang (王相) qi**, with no calamities.
For all kinds of crops, apply the same method.

If the **kind’s general (物类神)** **harms (相贼)** the **upper general of the Great Year (太岁上神)**, the **general of the Heavenly One (天一所居神)** **harms (克)** the day’s branch, and there is no alignment of the kind’s general in **yin-yang (阴阳)**, then it is **greatly inauspicious and will fail**.

**Method 32: Determining the Auspiciousness of General Affairs, Trade, and Sericulture for the Current Year**

Examine the **day’s branch (日辰)** and the **upper general of the family head’s year (家长年上神将)**.

If one obtains **Chuan Song (传送)** and **Azure Dragon (青龙)**, along with **Wang Xiang (王相) qi**, then it is **auspicious for trade and commerce**.
If one obtains **Sheng Qian (胜先)** and **Da Ji (大吉) generals**, then it is **suitable for sericulture and farming**.
If the **kind’s general of the desired pursuit (所欲为类神)** is **auspicious**, yet the **upper general is malevolent**, then it is **inauspicious**.
If **Azure Dragon (青龙)** is in the **general’s position (所居)**, yet **herds and livestock (遗)** are present, then it is **inauspicious**.
Apply the same method elsewhere.

**Method 33: Determining the Auspiciousness of Market Trading and Seeking Profit**

Examine the **hourly stem-branch (正日时)**. If the **upper general of the day’s branch (今日之时辰上神)** and the **general of the person’s year (人年上神)** both **generate (相生)** the kind’s general of the desired **market purchase (市买)**, then it is **auspicious**.

If the **day’s branch (今日日辰)** contains **Xiao Ji (小吉)** or **Azure Dragon (青龙)**, and the **general of the Azure Dragon’s position (青龙所居神)** **generates (相生)** the **upper general of the day’s branch (今日日辰上神)**, then it is **auspicious**.

If the **upper general of the Great Year (太岁上神)** does not **harm (克)** the **general of the person’s year (人年上神)**, and the **general of the person’s year (人年上神)** does not **restrain (制)** the **Azure Dragon (青龙)**, then it is **auspicious**.

If the **desired location (所往至之地)** has **auspicious generals (吉神将)** with **Wang Xiang (王相) qi**, and the **general of the person’s year (人年上神)** does not **harm (相贼)** it, then the **market transaction (估市)** will be **profitable**.

For example, on a **ninth-month wu Zi (戊子)** day at **the hour of the day’s branch (日映时)**, with **Tai Chong (太冲)** added to **Wei (未)**, and one wishes to **engage in market transactions (估市)**, the **person’s year (人年)** is **Shen (申)**, and the **Great Year (太岁)** is in **Chen (辰)**.
**Da Ji (大吉)** is **Tian Yi (天一)** in **Wu (戊)**, with **Wu (戊)** borrowing the position of **Ji (己)**, and **Ji (己)** being the **day’s branch (日辰)**.
**Chuan Song (传送)** is **Azure Dragon (青龙)** in **Zi (子)**, signifying the presence of the kind’s general.
The **day’s branch (日辰)** and the **general of the person’s year (人年上神)**, along with the **general of the Azure Dragon’s position (青龙所居神)**, all **generate (相生)** one another.
**Da Ji (大吉)** is present in the **person’s year (人年)**, and **Kui (魁)** is present in the **Great Year (太岁)**, not **harming (相贼)** the **general of the person’s year (人年上神)**.
Since **Chuan Song (传送)** is in the **northern direction (北出)**, and **Da Ji (大吉)** is **profitable**, though there are **two auspicious and one inauspicious** factors, it is **still favorable**.
Ensure that the **upper generals of the day’s branch and the person’s year (日辰人年上神)** **generate (相生)** the kind’s general, then it is **suitable for use**.

The *Shi Jing (式经)* states:
*"Carefully inquire about the four directions—east, west, south, north—of the place you intend to go.
If the place **generates (相生)** the **year** and contains abundant **Wang Xiang (王相) qi**, then there will be **fortune (福)**, and the **market transaction (估市)** will be **profitable**.
If it does not encounter **harming or thieving generals (贼盗所居)**, and aligns with what is desired, then all will be obtained.
Only if the **Azure Dragon (青龙)** is in a **general’s position with qi (有气之神)**, and the place also has **qi (有气之乡)**, then **wealth (财)** will be obtained.
If the **Azure Dragon (青龙)** **restrains (制)** the **person’s year (人年)**, then nothing will be gained."*

**Method 34: Determining Which Livestock or Grain to Raise for Auspicious Harvest**

Examine the **hourly stem-branch (正日时)**. For each desired kind, if the **kind’s general (其事类)** is present in the **day’s branch (日辰)**, **yin-yang (阴阳)**, and **transmitted general (用传)**, and the **kind’s general (类)** also **generates (相生)** the **general of the person’s year (人年上神)**, then it is **auspicious and profitable**, and **suitable for raising**.

If the **transmitted general (用神)** begins at **no-qi (无气)** and ends at **Wang Xiang (王相)**, then **earlier factors are less profitable, while later ones are more profitable**.
If it does not follow this pattern, then it is **inauspicious**.

The **kind’s general (物类者)** refers to:
- **Millet (粟)** with **Wood general (木神)**
- **Millet (黍) and small beans (小豆)** with **Fire general (火神)**
- **Wheat (麦)** with **Metal general (金神)**
- **Hemp (麻)** with **Earth general (土神)**
- **Rice (稻) and large beans (大豆)** with **Water general (水神)**
- **Silk floss (丝绵)** with **Tai Chang (太常)**
- **Cloth and silk (布帛)** with **Shen Hou (神后)**
- **Leather and hides (皮革)** with **Bai Hu (白虎)**
- **Sericulture and grain (田蚕)** with **Sheng Qian (胜先)**

For example, on a **seventh-month jia Zi (甲子)** day at **the hour of the rooster’s crow (鸡呜时)**, with **Tian Yi (天一)** added to **Chou (丑)**, and one plans to **harvest wheat (收麦)**, **Tian Gang (天罡)** is added to **Zi (子)**.
The **yin upper general (阴上神)** obtains **Chuan Song (传送)**, and **Chuan Song (传送)**—the **Metal general (金神)**—is the kind’s general for **wheat (麦)**.
In the **yin-yang of the transmitted general (用神阴阳)**, the **person’s year (人年)** is in **Shen (申)**, and **Shen (申)** obtains **Shen Hou (神后)**, which **generates (相生)** **Chuan Song (传送)** as the kind’s general.
Since it **generates (相生)** the **general of the person’s year (人年上神)**, it is **suitable for harvest**.
The **transmitted general (用神)** begins with **Tian Gang (天罡)**, whose **qi is resting (休)** and **aging (老)** before the **transmission ends (传终)**.
All obtain **Wang Xiang (王相) qi**, making the **later factors more profitable**.
Apply the same method elsewhere.

**Method 35: Determining Whether Raising a Particular Kind of Livestock or Grain Will Succeed**

Examine the **hourly stem-branch (正日时)**. If the **day’s branch (日辰)** contains no **Kui (魁), Gang (罡), Teng She (腾蛇), or Bai Hu (白虎)**, then it is **auspicious and suitable for raising and harvesting**.

If the **kind’s general (物类神)** is **Wang Xiang (王相)** in a **qi-bearing direction (有气之乡)**, then it is **auspicious and highly profitable**.
If **Kui (魁)** or **Gang (罡)** are present, then it is **unfavorable for raising**.

For example, if **Kui (魁)** or **Gang (罡)** are added to **Wei (未)**, then **sheep (羊)** should not be raised.
If added to **Hai (亥)**, then **pigs (堵)** should not be raised.
Apply the same method elsewhere.

**Method 36: Determining the Auspiciousness of Purchasing Vehicles or Boats**

Examine the **hourly stem-branch (正日时)**. If the **day’s branch (日辰)** and its **yin-yang (阴阳)**, along with the **transmitted general (用传)**, contain **Liu He (六合)** or **Tai Chong (太冲)**, and these **align (并合)** with **auspicious generals (吉将)** and **harmonize (相合)** with the day, then it is **auspicious**.

If it is **auspicious for riding**—beneficial for **messengers and journeys**—but **aligns with malevolent generals** and **harms the day**, it **harms the master**; do not ride.

For example, if **Tai Chong (太冲)** aligns with **Xuan Wu (玄武)**, riding will result in **loss**.
If it aligns with **Bai Hu (白虎)**, it will **kill after several years**, suitable for **funeral affairs**.
Apply the same method elsewhere.

**Method 37: Determining the Auspiciousness of Horses**

Examine the **hourly stem-branch (正日时)** by first assessing the **victorious general (胜先)**.
If the **victorious general** aligns with **auspicious generals** in the **generating direction (所生之乡)**, it is **auspicious**.
If it aligns with **malevolent generals** in the **harmful direction (所贼之乡)**, it is **unfavorable**.
The **depth of auspiciousness or misfortune** depends on the **victorious general’s position** and the **direction it governs**.

For example, if the **victorious general** aligns with **Qing Long (青龙)** and **Tai Chang (太常)**, appearing together in the **wood-fire directions (木火辰)**—such as **Wei (未)**—it is **auspicious**, indicating a **fine horse**.
If it appears in the **metal direction (金乡)**, it will **bite**.
If it appears in **Xū (戌)**, it will **stumble and be rebellious**.

**On Divination of Horses (吉凶法第三十七)**
If the **victorious general** aligns with **auspicious generals** in the **water direction**, it signifies **sickness**.
If it aligns with **Chou (丑)**, the horse will **love to run**.
If it aligns with **Xuan Wu (玄武)**, it will **escape and perish on its own**.
If it aligns with **Bai Hu (白虎)**, it will **die**.
If it aligns with **Sheng She (胜蛇)**, it will **cause alarm and ruin affairs**.
All other cases follow this pattern.

---

**On Divination of Oxen (善恶法第三十八)**
By **hourly stem-branch (正日时)**, assess with the **Great Auspicious (大吉)**.
If the **Great Auspicious** aligns with **wood**, it signifies **sickness**.
If it aligns with **fire**, it will **startle**, and the ox will be **sold**.
If it aligns with **metal**, it will **desire to be sold**.
If it aligns with **water**, it is a **field ox**.
If it aligns with **earth**, it is **livestock**.
If **Heaven and Earth are in darkness (天地昤)**, and the **auspicious star (用神)** aligns with **Tian Yi (天一)** in a **qi-bearing direction**, it will **enter state service**.
If it aligns with **Bai Hu (白虎)**, it will **die on its own**.
If it aligns with **Gou Chen (勾陈)**, it will **butt and harm people**.
If it aligns with **Sheng She (胜蛇)**, it will **frequently suffer alarm**.
If it aligns with **Xuan Wu (玄武)**, it will **be lost or abandoned**.
All other cases follow this pattern.
**Loss or abandonment** is attributed to the **Great Auspicious**, which is also the **Lake Star (湖神)**.
Another method attributes it to **Ji Xing (辑星)** below or **Tai Chong (太冲)**.

---

**On Divination of Sheep (可养得否法第三十九)**
By **hourly stem-branch (正日时)**, assess with the **Lesser Auspicious (小吉)**.
Adding **metal** indicates a desire to **keep it**.
Adding **wood** indicates a desire to **slaughter it**.
Adding **fire** allows it to be **kept**.
Adding **water** leads to **decline and waste**.
If it aligns with **auspicious generals** in a **qi-bearing direction**, it is **auspicious**.
If it aligns with **malevolent generals**, it is **unfavorable**.
Encountering **Bai Hu (白虎)** leads to **death**.
Adding **Yin (寅)** and **Xū (戌)** and meeting **Lang (狼)** also leads to **death**.
Adding **Chen (辰)** and entering the **grave** also leads to **death**.

---

**On Divination of Pigs (善恶法第四十)**
If **Deng Ming (登明)** is added to **Si (巳)** and **Wu (午)**, the pig will **escape**.
Adding a **water direction** makes it **filthy**.
Adding **metal or wood** allows it to be **kept**.
Adding **earth** leads to **sickness and death**.
Adding **Wang Xiang (王相)** directions, if **Tian Yi (天一)** and **Tai Yin (太阴)** align, it is for **sacrificial use**.
If it aligns with **malevolent generals** in **imprisonment or death directions**, it is **unfavorable**.
If **Deng Ming (登明)** aligns with **Bai Hu (白虎)**, it will **run away and be lost**.
To know **life or death**, observe the **qi**.
If there is **life qi**, it lives; if there is **death qi**, it dies.
If it aligns with **self-destruction** and **Sheng She (胜蛇)**, it will **flee in alarm**.
Adding **hourly stems, human years, or human graves** also leads to **death**.
For **lost or missing pigs**, if **Deng Ming (登明)** adds **You (酉)**, it is **unrecoverable**.
If **Wei (未)** is above and follows **Kui (魁)**, it is **unrecoverable**.
If **Si (巳)** is above and the **Lesser Auspicious (小吉)** aligns with **yin-yang controlling**, it can be **recovered**.

---

**On Divination of Dogs (可畜否法第四十一)**
By **hourly stem-branch (正日时)**, assess with the **He Kui (河魁)**.
**Zi (子)** can **catch mice**.
Adding **Mao (卯)** allows it to **run and hunt**.
Adding **Si (巳)** and **Wu (午)** makes it **good at barking**.
Adding **Wei (未)** makes it **good at fighting**.
Adding **Chen (辰)** leads to **self-destruction**.
Adding **Hai (亥)** means it will be **sold**.
Adding **Yin (寅)** makes it **mad and run wild**.
Adding **Xū (戌)** makes it **spray people**.
If it aligns with **Tai Yin (太阴)**, it is for **ritual use and sacrifice**.

---

**On Divination of Chickens (可畜否法第四十二)**
By **hourly stem-branch (正日时)**, assess with **Cong Kui (从魁)**.
Adding **Wei (未)** makes it **good for the household**.
Adding **metal or water** allows it to be **kept**.
Adding **Chou (丑)** leads to **self-destruction or being killed**.
Adding **Chen (辰)** makes it a **chick**.
Adding **Wei (未)** indicates it will be **used for sacrifice**.
If it aligns with **auspicious generals** in a **qi-bearing direction**, it is **auspicious**.
If it aligns with **malevolent generals** and also in **imprisonment or death directions**, it is **unfavorable**.
For example, if it aligns with **Sheng She (胜蛇)**, it will **be easily startled and act strangely**.
If it aligns with **Zhu Que (朱雀)**, it will **crow at inappropriate times**.
If it aligns with **Gou Chen (勾陈)**, a **hen will crow**.
If it aligns with **Xuan Wu (玄武)**, it will **flee and be lost**.
If it aligns with **Bai Hu (白虎)**, it will be **eaten by a weasel**.

---

**On Divination of Servants and Lowly Attendants (利主否法第四十三)**
By **hourly stem-branch (正日时)**, observe the **hourly stem’s yin-intestines (阴肠)**, the **auspicious star (用神)**, **Zhuan Zhong (传中)**, and **Cong Kui (从魁)**.
If it aligns with **auspicious generals** and has **Wang Xiang (王相)** or **restorative qi (休气)**, and harmonizes with the **hourly stem**, it is **suitable for the master**.
If the **auspicious star** is above and **malevolent** is below, it is **auspicious**, deeply beneficial for **loyalty and prosperity**.
If **Cong Kui (从魁)** is not in **yin-yang harmony** with the **hourly stem**, and the **auspicious star** and **Zhuan Zhong (传中)** align with **malevolent generals**, while also harming the **hourly stem**, and the **auspicious star** is below while **malevolent** is above, the servant will be **arrogant and flattering**, desiring to **harm the master**.

For example, in **August, on a Ren Zi (壬子) day during the fall**, if **Tian Gang (天罡)** adds **Wei (未)**, divining the **fortune of a servant**:
**Zhuan Song (传送)** is **Xuan Wu (玄武)** aligning with **Ren (壬)**, while **Cong Kui (从魁)** is **Tai Chang (太常)** aligning with **Zi (子)**. Since **Cong Kui (从魁)** harmonizes with **Ren (壬)** and **Wang Xiang (王相)**, and is within **yin-yang harmony**, while the **victorious general** is the **auspicious star** aligning with **You (酉)**, above harming below, at this time, **lowly attendants** will all be **favorable**.

For example, in **October, on a Yi Mao (乙卯) day at dusk**, if **Gong Cao (功曹)** adds **Xū (戌)**, above harming below, while **Cong Kui (从魁)** is **Liu He (六合)** aligning with **Si (巳)**, not within **yin-yang harmony**, and also harms the **Lesser Auspicious (小吉)** as the **auspicious star** aligning with **Mao (卯)**, below harming above, all indicate **arrogance and deceit**, desiring to **harm the master**.
It can still be **kept**.

---

**On Divination of Buying and Selling Goods and Livestock (知售否法第四十四)**
For **sellers**, the **hourly stem** should have **Wang Xiang (王相)**.
For **buyers**, the **hourly stem** should have **imprisonment or death**.
If the **animal’s corresponding star** is within **yin-yang harmony** and **Zhuan Zhong (传中)**, and harmonizes with the **hourly stem**, it is **auspicious**—**sellers** can **sell**, and **buyers** can **acquire**.
If the **animal’s corresponding star** is not within **yin-yang harmony** or **Zhuan Zhong (传中)**, and also harms the **hourly stem’s star**, both **buying and selling** will be **unsuccessful**.

For example, in **October, on a Gui Hai (癸亥) day during the fall**, if **Gong Cao (功曹)** adds **Wei (未)**, divining the **buying of an ox**:
The **Lesser Auspicious (小吉)** aligns with **water**, and the **yin star** obtains **Gong Cao (功曹)**.
The **victorious general** aligns with **Hai (亥)**, and the **yin star** obtains the **Great Auspicious (大吉)**.
Since it is within the **yin-intestines**, and does not harm the **hourly stem’s star**, both **seller and buyer** will be **satisfied**.

For example, on a **Geng Chen (庚辰) day**, divining the **selling of an ox**:
**Tai Chong (太冲)** aligns with **Geng (庚)**, and the **yin star** obtains **He Kui (河魁)**.
**Deng Ming (登明)** aligns with **Chen (辰)**, and the **yin star** obtains the **victorious general**.
The **Great Auspicious (大吉)** is not within **yin-yang harmony**, meaning **its kind is absent**.
The **hourly stem’s stars** all harm the **Great Auspicious (大吉)**, so both **buying and selling** will be **unsuccessful**.
For example, if the **hourly stem’s star** harms the **Great Auspicious (大吉)**, the **buyer will refuse**.
If the **hourly stem’s star** harms the **Great Auspicious (大吉)**, the **seller will refuse**.
If both **hourly stem’s stars** harm the **Great Auspicious (大吉)**, there will be **empty words**.
All other cases follow this pattern.

---
**On Divination of a Missing Person’s Whereabouts (吉凶法第四十五)**

**On Divination of a Missing Person’s Whereabouts (吉凶法第四十五)**
*(Continued)*

At the **proper hour and day**, examine the **native star** of the person being inquired about and compare it to the **current day’s stem**. If they match, the person is present; if not, they are absent.

For example, if today is **Jia (甲)**, and one asks whether a person from **Wu (午)** is present: if the **Wu star** obtains **Chuansong (传送)**, which aligns with **Jia**, then—since **Jia** and **Shen (申)** are analogous—the person is present. If instead the **Wu star** obtains **Daji (大吉)** without **Jia-Chou (甲丑)**, they do not align, and the person is absent.

Another method: To determine whether a person is at home before visiting, observe the **star’s position** relative to the **day and hour**:
- If the **star follows** the **day and hour**, a woman in the household will wish to drink.
- If **Tian Gang (天罡)** governs the **day and hour**, there will be a dispute over money in the next household.
- If **Tai Yi (太一)** governs the **day and hour**, they will be crafting a small cart or wooden goods.
- Some say: *"Recently departed, soon to return."*
- If **Xiao Ji (小吉)** governs the **day and hour**, the person is in the woods or outside, not yet risen.
- If **Chuansong (传送)** governs the **day and hour**, they are away.
- If **Cong Kui (从魁)** governs the **day and hour**, they are in the next household.
- If **Tian Kui (天魁)** governs **Bai (白)**, the person is ill.
- If **Deng Ming (登明)** governs the **day and hour**, they are indoors counting money.
- If **Daji (大吉)** governs the **day and hour**, they are in an official’s home and will return shortly.
- Some say: *"In a tavern, about to leave."*
- If **Gong Cao (功曹)** governs the **day and hour**, they are in an official’s home conversing with an elder guest.
- Some say: *"At home, working with wood, not leaving."*
- If **Tai Chong (太冲)** governs the **day and hour**, they are seen at the gate.
- Some say: *"In the courtyard north, crafting a red cart or chopping wood."*

---
**On Divination for Petitioning, Memorials, and Meeting Noblemen (占欲上书奏记见贵人法第四十六)**

To petition, submit memorials, or meet noblemen, one must ensure that the **affair aligns with the celestial general’s nature**, that the **upper and lower stars harmonize**, and that the **governing star nurtures** the one it oversees. Only then will **Daji (大吉)** bring fortune; otherwise, misfortune follows.

For example, if petitioning to see the **King**, **Tian Yi (天一)** must govern **Metal, Fire, or Earth**, while the **hourly stem** aligns with **Metal, Fire, or Earth**.
To see a **Marquis**, use **Tai Chang (太常)**;
To see a **General**, use **Gou Chen (勾陈)**.

To see a **Count of Two Thousand Stone (二千石)**, use **Qinglong (青龙)**;
To see a **Magistrate or Prefect (令长)**, use **Zhuque (朱雀)**.
This method need not strictly adhere to the **day and hour’s yin-yang alignment**; instead, observe whether the matter aligns with the **celestial general’s nature**, and examine what they favor or dislike.
If the matter aligns with their preference, it is auspicious—**return to the mother-child relationship** (归母子).

---
**On Divining Whether Petitions, Memorials, or Reports Will Succeed and When Responses Will Arrive (占人奏文书劾事解否及何时来报法第四十七)**
If the **day’s governing star** is auspicious and harmonizes with **Royal Stars (王相)**, fortune follows.
If **Gongcao (功曹)** aligns with an auspicious star, or **Qinglong (青龙)** with an auspicious star, all are favorable.
If the **direct-use star** appears before its **child star**, and a **rescue star** is present, the matter will resolve; if no rescue star appears, it will not resolve.
For example: If one inquires where the **petition’s destination** lies—whether in the **south**—and **Gongcao (功曹), Dengming (登明), or Qinglong (青龙)** are in the **northern sector**, it will arrive soon.
If **Gongcao (功曹) or Dengming (登明)** governs the **day’s hour**, the arrival is imminent.
The method relies on the **transmission star’s end** and the **rescue star** to confirm arrival.

---
**On Divining the Outcome of Lawsuits and Disputes (占词讼吉凶事胜负法第四十八)**
Let the **day’s governing star** represent the **plaintiff or defendant**—if the **upper star attacks the lower**, the first party wins; if the **lower star attacks the upper**, the second party wins.
The victor must not have their **yearly stem and hourly stem in mutual assault**; if they do, though they win initially, they will later suffer misfortune.
If the **day and hour stars** do not assault each other, both parties will reconcile without conflict.
For example: On an **eighth-month Dingwei day**, with the hour also **Wei**, and the yearly stem **Mao**, **Gongcao** attacks first, while the **yang star of Ding day** aligns harmoniously—this indicates reconciliation. Follow this principle accordingly.
If determining victory by **age hierarchy**, consider the **day’s age relative to the yearly stem**—the younger prevails.
If the **day star overpowers the hour star**, the elder wins—meaning the **day star’s governing star** prevails.
If the **hour star overpowers the day star**, the younger wins—meaning the **hour star’s governing star** prevails.
By examining the **day and hour’s governing generals**, one discerns victory or defeat.
For example: If the general is **Gouchuan (勾陈)**, it signals a dispute over **fighting or contention**.
If **Goulian (勾连)** governs, it indicates **fierce conflict to the death**.
If **Tengshe (腾蛇)** governs, fear of death or punishment—**punishment refers to flogging**.
If **Tiankong (天空)** governs, the words spoken are false—**referring to disputes over trivial matters**.
If **Zhuque (朱雀)** governs, it involves **litigation or verbal altercations**.
If **Xuanwu (玄武)** governs, the case is lost through **false testimony or slander**.

For example: If the plaintiff’s yearly stem is **Mao**, and the **transmission star** governs, their **yearly and hourly stems assault each other**; the first party is the **guest**, the second the **host**.

---
**On Divining Whether Officials Will Approve or Disapprove of Plans and Documents When Meeting Superiors (占诸吏谋对计簿当见上官知喜怒法第四十九)**
At the **proper day and hour**, observe if the **day’s governing star** is auspicious, with **Royal Stars (王相)** and **auspicious qi (休气)** present, and if it harmonizes with the **celestial general** of the matter at hand—then it is favorable.
For example: If one seeks to see the **King**, use **Tianyi (天一)**;
If one seeks to see a **Marquis**, use **Taichang (太常)**;

**On Divining Whether Officials Will Approve or Disapprove of Plans and Documents When Meeting Superiors (Continued)**

The **General** is governed by **Gouchen (勾陈)**;
The **Ministers and high-ranking officials (二千石)** by **Qinglong (青龙)**;
The **Magistrates (令长)** by **Zhūquè (朱雀)**.

If these stars harmonize with the **hourly, daily, and yearly stems**, the superior will be pleased, and all spoken words will be granted.
If not, it is ominous.

For example: If one seeks to see the **General**, and **Gouchen** assaults the **hourly, daily, or yearly stems**, the General will be angry.
If the **hourly, daily, or yearly stems** assault **Gouchen**, the General will refuse to see the petitioner.
Even if they do not harmonize, they must not assault each other.

---
**On Divining Whether Attacks or Retaliatory Plans Will Succeed (占欲攻条报隙法第五十)**

Do not let the **celestial general** of the matter assault the **yearly stems** of the conspirators or the **hourly stems**—all such cases are ominous.

For example: If one seeks retaliation, and the conspirator’s yearly stem is **Yin (寅)**, while **Baihu (白虎)** governs the **transmission star**, this **Baihu** assaults the **yearly and hourly stems**—it is ominous.

If the conspirator’s yearly stem is **Chen (辰)**, and **Gongcao (功曹)** governs the transmission star, while **Baihu** assaults **Gongcao**, this means **Baihu** assaults the **yearly stems**—all such cases are ominous and cannot proceed.

If multiple conspirators are involved, each must have their **yearly stems** and the **hourly stems** not assault **Baihu**—if they do, it is ominous.
If they do not assault, and there is **Royal Stars (王相)** and auspicious **qi**, it is favorable.

The **Royal Stars (王相)** refer to the **celestial generals** of the conspirators’ yearly stems.

For **murder**, use **Gouchen (勾陈)**;
For **theft**, use **Xuanwu (玄武)**.

「For plotting to burn someone’s house, use **Zhuhuang (朱雀)**;
To harbor a criminal, use **Taiyin (太阴)** and **Liuhe (六合)**;
For plotting to wed a woman, use **Houwang (后王)**.

All these matters one undertakes—these are **theft stars (贼事)**.
**Theft stars (事)** refer to the **yearly stems’ celestial generals (年上神)**.
Each must take their respective **theft star (事类神)** and observe it through three successive transmissions, concluding at **Royal Stars (王相)**—this is favorable.
If it concludes at **the prison star (囚死)**, this is ominous.

Other cases follow this principle.

**Divination for victory or defeat in battles where one is besieged, encircled, or trapped in an ambush—Method Fifty**—
When the **day and hour stems (正日时)** align with **the Four Seasons (斗加四季)**, it is advantageous to be the **guest (客)**—one may initiate military action first.
When the **day and hour stems** align with **the Four Beginnings (斗加四孟)**, it is advantageous to be the **host (主)**—one should delay military action.
For military action, the host’s fortunes are always reversed: striking first is unfavorable, while striking later is favorable—this is most auspicious.

When the **day and hour stems** align with **the Four Midpoints (斗加四仲)**, military action should not be taken—both host and guest will suffer defeat.
If circumstances compel battle, then strike the **small auspicious (小吉)** to defeat the **great auspicious (大吉)**—this is **reverse military action (逆兵)**.

When **Heaven and Earth’s lament (天地吟)** is present, no military action should be taken—if done, one will surely be besieged.
If one wishes to rest their troops at dusk, the generals should be stationed in today’s **small auspicious hour (今日小吉)**—the first three **hourly stems (前三辰)** are suitable.

For a great battle in the **midmonth (正月中)**, if one desires to halt the troops at dusk, the generals should be stationed in **Mao (卯), Chen (辰), and Si (巳)**—they must not be seated in **Kuan (寬)** for an assault.
The **hourly stems (小时)** should also align with the **monthly stem (月建)**.

Other cases follow this pattern accordingly.

**Divination for presenting treasures to honor the noble and determine victory or defeat—Method Fifty-Two**—

The **hourly stem of today’s Ruler and Minister (今日之辰王相)** must also align with the **favorable hour of the deity (神)** being honored, as well as the **deity of the offered item (所奉物类神)**—then the recipient will take joy and show reverence.

For instance:
- If presenting to a **king**, use **Tianyi (天一)**;
- To a **marquis**, use **Taichang (太常)**;
- To an **orderly officer (令长)** or **sheriff (丞尉)**, use **Zhūquè (朱雀)**;
- To an **empress or noblewoman (皇后、夫人)**, use **Hou Tian (天后)**;
- To a **commoner or woman (庶人、妇女)**, use **Shen Hou (神后)**.

These are the deities to be honored.

If one wishes to present items of a **woman’s category (妇女物类)**, such as:
- **Fields and residences (田宅)**, use **Shèngxiān (胜先)**;
- **Grain and rice (谷、米)**, **cattle (牛)**, use **Dàjí (大吉)**;
- **Chickens (鸡)**, **foxes (狐)**, **dogs (犬)**, use **Tiānkuí (天魁)**;
- **Pigs (豕)**, use **Dēngmíng (登明)**;
- **Sheep (羊)**, **wildfowl (雁)**, **alcohol and food (酒食)**, use **Xiǎojí (小吉)**;
- **Slaves (奴婢)**, **flying birds (飞乌)**, **silkworms (虫蚕)**, use **Cóngkuí (从魁)**;
- **Tigers and wolves (虎狼)**, **wild birds (野禽)**, use **Gōngcāo (功曹)**;
- **Boats and carts (船车)**, **badgers and hares (貉兔)**, use **Tàichōng (太冲)**;
- **Weapons (刀兵)**, **jades (璧玉)**, use **Chuánsòng (传送)**;
- **Crocodiles (蛟鱼)**, **aquatic creatures (水虫)**, use **Tiāngāng (天罡)**;
- **Silks and fabrics (布帛、衣服)**, use **Taichang (太常)**;
- **Money and treasures (钱财、宝物)**, use **Qīnglóng (青龙)**;
- **Silk (丝帛)**, use **Taichang (太常)**;
- **Cloth (布物)**, use **Shen Hou (神后)**;
- **Leather (皮革)**, use **Bái Hǔ (白虎)**;
- **Fields and silkworms (田蚕)**, follow the category of **Shèngxiān (胜先)**.

One must ensure that the **deity of the offering (所遗神)** and the **hourly deity (辰上神)** do not clash with **voidness (天空)**—otherwise, the item will be damaged and rejected. If they harmonize, the recipient will receive blessings.

For example, on the **third month, a *xīn* day (辛)**, *mǎo* hour (卯), at mealtime (*shí*), if **Cóngkuí (从魁)** aligns with the hour, and one wishes to present **jades (璧玉)** to a **ranked official (二千石)**, while **Gōngcāo (功曹)** governs as **Taichang (太常)** in *yǒu* (酉), **Chuánsòng (传送)** governs as **Zhūquè (朱雀)** in *mǎo* (卯), and **Dēngmíng (登明)** aligns with **Qīnglóng (青龙)** at *wǔ* (午), since **Qīnglóng (青龙)** is the deity of the offering, **Chuánsòng (传送)** governs both the item and the hourly deity, and **Qīnglóng (青龙)** harmonizes with it, the **ranked official (二千石)** will surely delight in the gift and receive blessings.

**Divination for selecting a woman (占求妇女法第五十三)**—
On the **main day and hour**, if **Hou Tian (天后)** appears in the **yin** and harmonizes above and below, and the **hourly deity (日上神)** and **hourly stem deity (辰上神)** do not clash or harm each other, then the selection will succeed.

If the **day deity (日神)** lacks **Hou Tian (天后)** in *yin* or *yang*, or if **Hou Tian (天后)** clashes with the **hourly stem deity (辰上神)**, then the selection will fail.

**Divination for choosing among two or three women (占求妇女有两三处此妇女可取谁者为良相宜法第五十四)**—
To select, examine the **native deities of their hometowns (乡上神)**. If they harmonize with **Hou Tian (天后)** or **Shen Hou (神后)**, then they may be chosen.

For example, on the **ninth month, a *jiǎ* day (甲)**, *zǐ* hour (子), at dawn (*píngdàn*), if **Tàichōng (太冲)** aligns with *yín* (寅), and one seeks women from:
- The **shēn direction (申乡)**, the **yǔ direction (午乡)**, and the **chén direction (辰乡)**,
while **Shen Hou (神后)** governs as **Hou Tian (天后)** in *hài* (亥), the **shēn direction’s deity (申乡上神)** aligns with **Cóngkuí (从魁)**, the **yǔ direction’s deity (午乡上神)** aligns with **Xiǎojí (小吉)**, and the **chén direction’s deity (辰乡上神)** aligns with **Tàiyī (太一)** and **Xiǎojí (小吉)**—with **Tàiyī (太一)** being *fire* and clashing with **Hou Tian (天后)**, while **Cóngkuí (从魁)**—*metal*—harmonizes with **Hou Tian (天后)** and **Shen Hou (神后)**, then the woman from the **shēn direction (申乡)** is the most auspicious to choose.

To determine a woman’s **beauty or ugliness**, if **Hou Tian (天后)** governs as **Ruler or Minister (王相)**, she is beautiful; if **imprisoned or deceased (囚死)**, she is ugly.

To determine her **complexion**, refer to the **yearly stem deity (年上神)**.

**Divination for marital harmony (占夫妇相便安否法第五十五)**—
Each examines their **yearly stem deity (年上神)**. If they harmonize, it is auspicious; if they clash, it is inauspicious.
If the **husband’s yearly stem deity (夫年上神)** clashes with the **wife’s yearly stem deity (妻年上神)**, the wife will suffer misfortune.
If the **wife’s yearly stem deity (妻年上神)** clashes with the **husband’s yearly stem deity (夫年上神)**, the husband will suffer misfortune.

**Divination for pregnancy—male or female (占怀孕为男为女法第五十六)**—
On the **main day and hour**, if the **hourly stem (时下之辰)** matches the **day stem (今日)**, it indicates a male child.

For example, on a *jiǎ* day (甲), if the hour is *wǔ* (午), then *jiǎ-wǔ* (甲午) is a **comparison (比)**, and **comparison (比)** signifies a male child.

**Divination for Pregnancy—Male or Female (占怀孕为男为女法第五十六)**—
For example, if today is a *jiǎ* hour (甲) and the *wǔ* moment (未) is added, then *wǔ* is the **hourly stem (时下之辰)**, and since *jiǎ-wǔ* (甲午) is not a **comparison (比)**, a female child is certain.

Another method: use the **Heavenly Gangs (天罡)** for divination. If the **Heavenly Gang (天罡)** aligns with **yang (阳)**, it indicates a male child; if it aligns with **yin (阴)**, it indicates a female child.
The old saying states: If the **transmission (传送)** aligns with the **husband’s natal stem (夫本命)**, then the wife will **wander in years (游年)** and encounter a **yang deity (阳神)**—this signifies a male child. If she encounters a **yin deity (阴神)**, it signifies a female child.

---

**Divination for Noble Persons Seeking to Rescue a Criminal (占诸贵人欲救罪人得否法第五十七)**—
On the **main day and hour**, if the **direct deity (直神)** is spoken of, and the **transmission (传)** obtains its **child (子)**, then rescue is certain.

For example, if the **Wood deity (木神)** is in direct use, and the **transmission (传)** obtains the **Water deity (水神)** as its **child (子)**, while **Fire** is above it—this follows the same principle.
If the **transmission (传)** obtains its **victor (胜)**, then its **child (子)** becomes the **victor (将)**, but this is merely a **permissive (许)** indication. The **Heart (心)**, however, seeks to **deceive (赚)**.

For example, if the **Wood deity (木神)** is in direct use, and the **transmission (传)** obtains the **Earth deity (土神)**, while **Fire** is above it—this is called the **transmission (传)** obtaining the **child (子)** of its **deity (神)**.

For instance, on a *bǐngzǐ* day (丙子) of the first month, if the **transmission (传)** aligns with **Xīn (辛)** (the **Heavenly Gang’s (天罡) child (子)**), and the **moment of *hài* (亥)** is added, then **Brightness (明)** is in **comparison (比)** with *hài* (亥), the **victor (胜)** first arrives at *hài* (亥), and the **deity (神)** below the **moment of *hài* (亥)** is the **useful (用)** one. If the **transmission (传)** obtains its **child (子)** as the **rescue (救)**, then it is indeed a rescue.

For example, on a *bǐngzǐ* day (丙子) of the first month, if the **transmission (传)** aligns with **Shēn (申)**, and the **Great Auspicious (大吉)** deity’s **child (子)** is the **moment of *shēn* (申)**, with the **deity (神)** above and the **moment (贼)** below as the **useful (用)** one, then the **child (子)**—**Water**—holds **anxiety (忧)**. If the **Great Auspicious (大吉)** deity’s **transmission (传)** obtains the **Functionary (功曹)**, then it secures the **child (子)** of the anxious one as a **rescue (救助)**.

If the **useful deity (用神)** never appears, then the anxious one’s **child (子)** remains in **anxiety (忧)** and is not resolved. Follow these principles accordingly.

「Divination for Determining Whether One Should Depart or Remain in a Residence (Method 58)
Observe the day’s **hour (辰)** and its **auspicious deity (上神) and general (将)**. If the **auspicious deity (王)** and **resting qi (休气)** above and below are in mutual **defeat (克)**, then departure is auspicious. If the **auspicious deity (吉神) and general (将)** of the **yin (阴)** hour are obtained, and the **auspicious deity (王)** and **resting qi (休气)** above and below are in mutual **harmony (生)**, then remaining is auspicious.

This is determined by the **yin (阴) and yang (阳) auspicious deities and generals (神将)** and their forms. For instance, if **Bái Hǔ (White Tiger, 白虎)** is in the **yang (阳)**, then departure is auspicious; if **death and mourning (死丧)** are not in the **yang**, then remaining is permissible. Apply this principle accordingly.

**Divination for Determining the Fate of News About a Person of Rank (Method 59)**
Observe the **yin (阴) and yang (阳)** of the day’s **hour (辰)** and whether the reported matter aligns with it. If it aligns, then it is true; if not, then it is false. For example, if one hears that someone is a **thief (盗)**, and today’s **hour (甲)** is the **hour of the thief**. If **Shèngxiān (胜先)** is **Xuánwǔ (玄武, Black Tortoise)**, present in the **yin (阴) and yang (阳)** of the day’s **hour**, then it aligns. If **Shèngxiān (胜先)** is at **wǔ (noon, 午)**, then **wǔ** is the aligning hour. If **Tàiyī (太一)** is **Xuánwǔ (玄武, Black Tortoise)** without the **hour of the thief (甲)**, then **wèi (巳)** is non-aligning.

It is said: If one hears of a **death (死)** under discussion, and the **auspicious deity (神)** borne by the **White Tiger (白虎)** aligns with today’s hour, then death will occur. If it aligns with today’s **hour (辰)**, death will also occur. For instance, if today’s **hour (子)** is **zǐ (子)**, and **zǐ** aligns with **chǒu (丑)**, then **White Tiger (白虎)** is present—this is true. Otherwise, all such news is false.

The same principle applies to **divination for descendants (子孙)** regarding **auspicious (吉)** or **inauspicious (凶)** matters. If one hears of an **auspicious matter (吉事)**, observe whether **Qīnglóng (青龙, Azure Dragon)** and **Liùhé (六合, Six Harmonies)** are present in the day’s **hour (辰)**—this is true. Otherwise, it is false.

If one hears of an **inauspicious matter (凶事)**, observe the **White Tiger (白虎)** in the **hour (辰)** and the **auspicious deity (上神)** of the day’s divination. If **Qīnglóng (青龙)** and **Liùhé (六合)** align with today’s hour, then the reported matter is not auspicious—this is true.

However, these examples cannot be fully enumerated; they depend on the **pivot of the deities (神枢)**.

□ (Divination for) the **Truth or Falsehood of Reported Matters (所闻虚实篇)**.

**Divination for Determining Whether a Person’s Undertaking Will Succeed (Method 60)**
Observe the category of the matter in the **yin (阴) and yang (阳)** of the day’s **hour (辰)**. If it harmonizes with the **auspicious deity (上神)** of the day, then it is auspicious. If the matter’s category is not present in the **yin (阴) and yang (阳)** of the day’s **hour**, and it further conflicts with the **auspicious deity (上神)**, then the undertaking will not succeed. For instance, if one wishes to construct a residence, and the **auspicious deities (大吉)** and **Shèngxiān (胜先)** are present in the **yin (阴) and yang (阳)**, harmonizing with the **auspicious deity (上神)** of the day, then it is auspicious and will succeed. Otherwise, it will not succeed.

**Divination for Determining Whether a Person’s Worries Will Be Resolved (Method 61)**
At the time of inquiry, observe the **hour (辰)** of the day and the **auspicious deity (上神)** of the person’s **year (年)**. If there is a **resting qi (王相气)** or **directly useful deity (直用神)**, and the **transmission (传)** obtains its **child (子)**, then the worries will be resolved.

If the **useful deity (用神)** is the **resting qi (王相气)**, and the **transmission (传)** obtains its **child (子)**, but the **child** lacks **qi (气)**, then even if resolved, it remains difficult. Without **qi (气)**, it cannot overcome the presence of **qi (气)**; if the **useful deity (用神)** is **imprisoned (囚)** or **killed (死)**, and the **transmission (传)** obtains its **child (子)**, then the **child** is **imprisoned (囚)** or **killed (死)**. If both have **qi (气)**, it is resolvable; if the **child (子)** is **resting qi (王相)**, then the worries are doubly resolved.

For example, if in the **10th month (十月)**, on a **dīnghài (丁亥)** hour with **wèi (未)** added, one divines worries with uncertainty. If **Shèngxiān (胜先)** is at **hài (亥)**, with the **defeating (贼)** below and **auspicious deity (上)** above, it is **defeated (克)** by **resting qi (王相)**. If the **transmission (传)** obtains **Dàjí (大吉)**, then it obtains the **child (子)** of the **defeated (贼)**, and the **child** is the **imprisoned (囚)** or **killed (死)** **qi (气)** of the worries, indicating a **resolution (解)** of the worries, though it remains difficult.

For instance, in the **4th month (四月)**, on a **bīngyín (丙寅)** day at the **chǒu (丑)** hour, if **Shénhòu (神后, Deity of the Later Heaven)** is at **bīng (丙)**, with the **auspicious deity (上)** defeating the **defeating (下)**, then the **defeating (贼)** is the **useful (用)** one. **Fire (火)** holds **worries (忧)**, and if the **transmission (传)** obtains **Xiǎojí (小吉)**, the **child (子)** of **Fire (火)** in **Xiǎojí (小吉)** has **royal qi (王气)**, thus doubly resolving the worries.

To know the **period of resolution (解期)**, observe the **auspicious deity (用神)** that **generates (生)** the **auspicious period (吉期)** and that which **fears (畏)** the **inauspicious period (凶期)**.

The **auspicious period (吉期)** is determined by the **hour (地辰)** of the **auspicious deity (用神)**, and the **inauspicious period (凶期)** by that which it **fears (畏)**. For example, if **Shèngxiān (胜先)** is at **water (水)** as the **useful deity (用)**, then **wùjǐ (戊己)** are the **auspicious periods (吉期)**, and **rén guǐ (壬癸)** are the **inauspicious periods (凶期)**. If **Shèngxiān (胜先)** is at **metal (金)** as the **useful deity (用)**, then **rén guǐ (壬癸)** are the **auspicious periods (吉期)**, and **bǐngdīng (丙丁)** are the **inauspicious periods (凶期)**. Apply this principle accordingly.

**Ancient Method for Divining Whether Prior Matters Will Be Captured (Method 62)**」

**Method 63: Divining the Auspiciousness of Wearing New Clothing at the Start of an Undertaking**

At the proper hour, seek that the **auspicious deity (吉神)** of the **hour (地辰)** harmonizes with the **deity of the wearer’s birth year (人年上神)** and the **deity of the object (物神)**—thus, the request will be fulfilled that very day.

If the **object’s category deity (物类神)** harms the **hour’s deity (日辰上神)** and also injures the **deity of the wearer’s birth year (人年上神)**, it is inauspicious, and the request will not be granted.

The **object’s category deities (物类)** are as follows:
- **Tigers and leopards (虎豹)** → **Gōngcāo (功曹)**
- **Deer and rabbits (鹿兔)** → **Tàichōng (太冲)**
- **Wild beasts and pigs (野兽、豕)** → **Dēngmíng (登明)**
- **Crows (乌)** → **Cóngkuí (从魁)**
- **Horses (马)** → **Shèngxiān (胜先)**

**Method 64: Divining Whether a Disciple’s Study Will Succeed Under a Teacher**

Observe the **hour (辰)** of the present day. Let the **day (日)** represent the **disciple’s body (弟子身)**, the **hour (辰)** represent the **time of study (所学者时)**, and the **hour’s deity (辰上神)** represent the **teacher (师)**. If the **child (子)** aspect of the hour’s deity **adds to the mother (母)**, the disciple will certainly receive the **Dao (道)** from the teacher.

This also aligns with the **Heavenly Way (天道)**. Seek that the **hour’s deity (日辰上神)** be an **auspicious general deity (吉将神)** with **royal presence (王相气)**, and that **Qīnglóng (青龙)** and **Tàicháng (太常)** reside within the **yin-yang polarity (阴阳)** of the hour. The deities residing in the **yin-yang polarity** that **harmonize (相生)** with the **hour’s deity (今日日辰)** are auspicious. If not, it is inauspicious.

Even if **Qīnglóng (青龙)** and **Tàicháng (太常)** do not reside within the **yin-yang polarity** of the hour, examine whether the deities they occupy **harmonize (相生)** with the **hour’s deity (今日日辰)**—this too is auspicious.

**Example:** On a **January *Dīngmǎo* (丁卯) day**, at **daybreak (日出时)**, **Dēngmíng (登明)** adds to **Mǎo (卯)**. **Dīng (丁)** represents the **disciple’s body (弟子身)**, and **Mǎo (卯)** represents the **time of study (所学者时)**—the **teacher (师)**. Since **Dīng (丁)** adds to **Mǎo (卯)**, it is the **child following the mother (子从母)**. The **hour’s deity (卯上神)** harmonizes above and below, and its **useful deity (用)** terminates at **Gōngcāo (功曹)**, encountering a **metal deity (金神)** without mutual assault (**不相刑**), and bearing **royal presence (王相之气)**—this indicates the scholar’s success.

---

**Method 65: Divining Auspiciousness for Lodging Internally**

For those lodging internally (**内寄**), ensure that the **Five Phases (五行)** do not **add to their worries (加其所忧)**, nor that the **yang deity (阳神)** of the **hour’s branch (今日之辰)** harm the **hour’s deity (今日日辰)**—all such cases harm the host.

**Example:** On a **September *Jiǎyín* (甲寅) day**, if **Yǒu (酉)** is added, this is the **Five Phases adding to their worries (五行加其所忧)**. Additionally, the **yang deity (阳神), Gōngcāo (功曹)**, occupies **Shēn (申)**—**Shēn (申)** is **metal (金)**, which harms today’s **Jiǎyín (甲寅) wood (木)**. This is the **hour’s branch deity (临地辰)** harming today’s **hour’s deity (今日日辰)**.

As the *Shìjīng (式经)* states:
*"For any dwelling, if one seeks to lodge another inside, be cautious that the **yang deity (阳神)** of the **hour’s branch (时下辰)** does not occupy the **hour’s deity (日辰)**—this is the **harmful hour (害辰)**."*

**Example:** On a **October *Jiǎyín* (甲寅) day**, if **Gōngcāo (功曹)** adds to **Shēn (申)**, this is the **hour’s branch deity (时下之神)** harming today’s **hour (今日之辰)**. This means the deity of **Shēn (申)** transmits and adds to the **Yín (寅)** above and below, assaulting the **hour’s deity (日辰)**, which in turn is assaulted by the deity of **Shēn (申)**.

The **hour’s branch (时下)** refers to the **twelve branches (十二辰)** added to each day. The **yang deity of the branch (辰之阳神)** is the **deity occupying the current hour’s branch (今日时下支上神)**. This means one must not allow this **branch’s deity (此支上神)** to **add to the deity of the day it occupies (所临日辰)**, thereby harming today’s **hour (今日辰)**.

Moreover, lodging near the **Pàowěi (豹尾)** is also inadvisable—all objects follow this rule.

**Example:** On a **October *Dīngsì* (丁巳) day**, at **Shēn hour (申时)**, if the **monthly general (月将) Gōngcāo (功曹)** adds to **Shēn (申)**, and **Tàiyī (太一)** occupies **Hài (亥)**, then:
- **Tàiyī (太一)** is the **yang deity of Sì (巳)**, which is **fire (火)**.
- **Hài (亥)** is **water (水)**.
If **Hài (亥)** encounters **Dīngsì (丁巳)**, it harms the host—this is the **deity of the occupied hour (所临日辰)** harming today’s **hour’s deity (今日日辰)**.

If the **Five Phases harmonize (合)**, it indicates **one robber entering the home (主一贼入家)**.

**Example:** On a **July *Guǐwù* (癸巳) day**, if **Tàiyī (太一)** adds to the **harmonizing deity (此合仿之神)**.

The *Shìjīng (式经)* further states:
*"If one seeks to lodge in another’s home and the **deity of the year (行年)** is occupied by **Shénhòu (神后)**, the host intends to harm the guest. If **Tiānkuí (天魁)** and **Báihǔ (白虎)** appear on the **hour’s deity (日辰)**, the host intends to kill the guest. If **Dēngmíng (登明)** and **Tiānkōng (天空)** appear, the host intends to seduce the guest—all cases require immediate departure. If **auspicious general deities (吉将)** and **royal presence (王相)** harmonize above and below, it is auspicious without other cause."*

---

**Method 66: Divining Ominous Portents and Evil Dreams**

At the proper hour, observe the **hour’s deity (日辰上神)** and the **deity of the dreamer’s birth year (人年上神)**. If they are **general deities (将)** bearing **royal presence (王相)** and **auspicious qi (休气)**, harmonizing above and below, it is auspicious. Otherwise, it is inauspicious.

If **Kuí (魁)**, **Gāng (罡)**, **Shèngshé (胜蛇)**, or **Báihǔ (白虎)** occupy the **hour’s deity (日辰)** or the **deity of the dreamer’s birth year (人年)**, it is inauspicious. Such deities portend:
- **Royal affairs (忧王事)**,
- **Death, mourning, or imprisonment (死丧囚气)**,
- **Loss of property (主亡遗)**,
- **Illness, hidden dangers, or livestock misfortune (病伏废忧六畜)**.

If the **useful deity (用神)** is in **yang**, it portends **external affairs (忧外事)**; if in **yin**, it portends **internal affairs (忧内事)**—each case is determined by the **deities of the household members’ birth years (各以其家人年上神言之)**.

**Example:** If both the **year (年)** and the **day (日)** are **evil (立)**, and the **evil general deity (恶将)** is below **Wèi (未)**, both will be evil. The **Tiāngāng (天罡)**’s occupation determines:
- **Yang (阳)** → worries for **sons (忧男)**,
- **Yin (阴)** → worries for **daughters (忧女)**,
- **Mèng (孟)** → concerns for the **eldest (长)**,
- **Zhòng (仲)** → harm to the **mother (伤家母)**,
- **Jì (季)** → worries for the **youngest (小口)**.

The *Shìjīng (式经)* states:
*"If the deity is **external (在外)**, neighboring families suffer.
If it is **at the door (在门)**, the household suffers.
If it is **internal (在内)**, the body suffers."*

It further enumerates:
*"If **Shēn (申)** appears on the **hour’s deity (日辰)**, there are **dog omens (犬怪)**.
If **Yǒu (酉)** appears, there is **cauldron wailing (釜呜)**.
If **Shēn (申)** appears, there are **weapons, knives, and unburied ghosts (兵刀不葬，鬼怪)**.
If **Mù (木)** appears, there are **tomb ghosts wailing (墓鬼呼怪)**.
If **Wǔ (午)** appears, there are **horse blood omens (马血怪)**.
If **Chén (辰)** or **Sì (巳)** appears, there are **dragon and serpent omens (龙蛇怪)**.
If **Yín (寅)** appears, there are **crow and beast omens (乌兽怪)**.
If **Chǒu (丑)** appears, there are **cattle and dust-storm omens (牛畜风尘怪)**.
If **Hài (亥)** appears, there are **child and pig wind omens (子猪风怪)**."*

**Method 67: Divining Whether the Soul of the Deceased Has Departed**

At the proper hour, let the **hour’s branch (时下辰)** represent the **deceased (死)**. If the **hour’s deity (辰上神)** **overcomes (胜)** the **day’s deity (日上神)**, and the **day’s deity (日上神)** **overcomes** both the **hour’s deity (辰上神)** and the **hour’s branch (时下辰)**, it indicates **reviving murder (复杀)**.

The *Shìjīng (式经)* states:
*"If the **family elder’s birth year (家长行年)** adds to the **child (子)**, or if the **Tai Sui (太岁)**, **birth year (人年)**, or **birth day (命日)**’s deity encounters **Kuí (魁)**, **Gāng (罡)**, **Xiǎojí (小吉)**, **Shèngshé (剩蛇)**, or **Báihǔ (白虎)**, there are **ghosts (有鬼)**."*

**Method 68: Divining Funeral Matters**

When **Tian Gang (天罡)** adds to **yang (阳)**, let the male be the one seated; when adding to **yin (阴)**, let the female be seated. If added to **Meng (孟)**, it pertains to the **family elder (家长)**; if added to **Zhong (仲)**, it harms the **family mother (家母)**; if added to **Ji (季)**, it brings worry for the **young (小口)**.

If **Tian Di (天地)** is in **Fùyin (伏吟)**, the murder will not depart; if **Tian Di (天地)** is in **fǎn yīn (反吟)**, though it departs, it will return.

When **Kuí (魁)** and **Gāng (罡)** encounter the **day’s hour (日辰)**, it signifies **reviving murder (复)**. If they do not, it is **departure (出)**—even if it is **double murder (重杀)**.

To know what it drags along: **Kuí (魁)** is the **hero (雄)**, **Gāng (罡)** is the **mighty (罡)**.

To know the location of **malevolent ghosts (凶鬼)** within the home, observe which **ghost star (鬼星)** from the **celestial canopy (天上)** is present—this is where the ghost resides.

The *Shìjīng (式经)* states:
*"If **Kuí (魁)** and **Gāng (罡)** encounter **Jiǎ (甲)**, the ghost is at the **door (门)**;
if **Yǐ (乙)**, it is at the **gate (户)**;
if **Bǐng (丙)**, it is in the **hall (堂屋)**;
if **Dīng (丁)**, it is at the **favored place (宠)**;
if **Wù (戊)**, it is in the **courtyard and rooms (庭及房)**;
if **Jǐ (己)**, it is on the **stairs (确磴)**;
if **Gēng (庚)**, it is at the **chicken coop (鸡柄)**;
if **Rén (壬)**, it is at the **walled enclosure (堵圈)**;
if **Guǐ (癸)**, it is at the **latrine (厕)**."*

Another method: To know if a deceased person’s family has lingering **retribution (余殃)**?
In the **first month (正月)**, add the **hour’s branch (将)** to the **time of death (死时)**.
If **Kuí (魁)** or **Gāng (罡)** add to the **day’s hour (日辰)**, there is a **deceased person (死者)** present.

To know on what **day and month (日月)** the calamity will arrive, observe the **day and month (日月)** to which the addition is made as **yang (阳)**.
Take the **male (男)** as **yin (阴)**, or the **female (女)** as [yin] (if the text is incomplete, assume **yin** here).

Another method: To know the **origin (所起)** of **malevolent (雄)** and **feminine (雌)** forces—**feminine (雌)** follows **wǔ (午)**, **malevolent (雄)** follows **Gāng (罡)**.

**Method 69: Divining Whether Wind or Rain Will Occur at the Start of an Undertaking**

At the moment of beginning an undertaking, if **Fùngcáo (功曹)** of the **proper hour (正日辰)** encounters the **day’s hour (今日日辰)** before **Tian Yi (天一)**, then **wind (风)** will arise.

If **Fùngcáo (功曹)** encounters the **day’s hour (今日日辰)** after **Tian Yi (天一)**, then **rain (雨)** will come.

Another method: If one encounters **yang evil (阳凶)**, there will be **wind (风)**; if one encounters **yin evil (阴凶)**, there will be **rain (雨)**.
If the **hour’s deity (日辰上)** encounters **yang energy (阳神)**, it will become **yang evil (阳凶)**; if it encounters **yin energy (阴神)**, it will become **yin evil (阴凶)**.

If the **heavens are dry (天旱)**, and one wishes to know on what day **rain (雨)** will arrive?
Divine by **questioning the hour (问时)**. If the **deity of transmission (传神)** ends with a **water deity (有水神)**, then there will be **rain (雨)**.
If the **qi (气)** is not a **water deity (水神)**, there will be no **rain (雨)**.

If one wishes to know **when (何时)** the **rain (雨)** will come:
For instance, if **transmission (传)** yields **Dēngmíng (登明)** or **Shèngshé (神后)**, then **rain (雨)** will come.
If **transmission (传)** yields **yin (阴)**, observe which **deity (神)** it encounters to determine the time.

For example, if it encounters **Shèngxiān (胜先)**, then **rain (雨)** will come on **Bǐng (丙)** or **Dīng (丁)** days;
if it encounters **Jīnshén (金神)**, then on **Gēng (庚)** or **Xīn (辛)** days;
if it encounters **Mùshén (木神)**, then on **Jiǎ (甲)** or **Yǐ (乙)** days;
if it encounters **Tǔshén (土神)**, then on **Wù (戊)** or **Jǐ (己)** days.
Yet even if it encounters **Tǔshén (土神)**, though **rain (雨)** will come, it will still be **drought-like (犹旱)**.

If it encounters **Shuǐshén (水神)**, then **rain (雨)** will come on **Rén (壬)** or **Guǐ (癸)** days.
If **transmission (传)** ends without a **water deity (水神)**, or if it encounters **Tǔshén (土神)**, it will be **early (早)**—meaning **rain (雨)** will not come as expected.

To know **how many days (几时)** until **rain (雨)** arrives, use the **nine-nine calculation (九九算)**.
For example, if **transmission (传)** yields **Dàjí (大吉)**, and **Dàjí (大吉)** encounters **Zǐ (子)**, then **Zǐ (子)** is **nine (九)**, **Chǒu (丑)** is **eight (八)**—**eight-nine (八九)** equals **72 (七十二)**, so **rain (雨)** will come.
If **Dàjí (大吉)** encounters **Yǐ (巳)**, then **Yǐ (巳)** is **four (四)**—**four-eight (四八)** equals **32 (三十二)**, plus **two days (二日)**, so **rain (雨)** will come.

To know **how much rain (雨多少)** this month will have, divine by **questioning the hour (问时)**.
If **transmission (传)** ends with a **water deity (有水神)**, then **rain (雨)** will be **much (多)**; if there is no **water deity (水神)**, then **rain (雨)** will be **little (少)**.

Another method: Add the **month’s branch (月将)** to the **hour (时)**.
If **Lóng (龙)** is in the **first three (前三)** or **first five (前五)**, there will be **rain (雨)**;
if **Lóng (龙)** is in the **last two (后二)** or **last four (后四)**, there will be **wind and rain (风雨)**;
if **Gāo (蒿)** or **Lǐ (旱)** **Tiger (虎)** is in the **front (前)**, there will be **wind (风)**.
**Fùngcáo (功曹)** is the **Dragon (龙)**, **transmission (传送)** is the **Tiger (虎)**.

**Mǎo (卯)** is **thunder (雷)**, **Zǐ (子)** is **clouds (云)**—**clouds follow the Dragon (云从龙)**, **wind follows the Tiger (风从虎)**.
The **deity (神)** upon which the **Tiger (虎)** or **Dragon (龙)** rides—if it has **qi (气)**, there will surely be **wind (风)**.
If the **Tiger (虎)** or **Dragon (龙)** **arises (兴)** with **clouds (云)** and **thunder (雷)** together, there will surely be **great wind and rain (大风雨)**.

It is also said: If **transmission (传送)** adds to the **day’s hour (日辰)** after **Tian Yi (天一)**, then **rain (雨)** will come.
If **Fùngcáo (功曹)** encounters the **day’s hour (日辰)** after **Tian Yi (天一)**, it is the same.

Another method: To know on what day **rain (雨)** will come, add **Dàjí (大吉)** to the **new moon (月朔)**.
If **Shèngshé (神后)** is below, there will be **great rain (大雨)**;
if **Tài Chōng (太冲)** is below, there will be **slight rain (小雨)**.

Another method: To divine when **rain (雨)** will cease, add the **month’s branch (月将)** to the **hour (时)**.
If **Kuí (魁)** adds to **four seasons (四季)**, there will be **no rain (不雨)**;
if **Shēn (申)**, the **rain (雨)** will stop;
if **Zǐ (子)**, it is **yin (阴)**;
if **Yǐ (巳)** or **Wǔ (午)**, it is **drought (旱)**;
if **Shèngshé (神后)**, there will be **wind after rain (雨后有风)**;
if **Yín (寅)** or **Mǎo (卯)**, there will be **bright daylight (见白日)**.

Another method: Add the **month’s branch (月将)** to the **month’s stem (月建)**.
If **Xīn (辛)** or **Guǐ (癸)** add to the **hour’s branch (地下辰)**, it is a **clear day (晴)**.
The same applies when **seeking rain (求雨)**.

Another method: If **Kuí (魁)** and **Gāng (罡)** add to **Ji (季)**, the **rain (雨)** will stop;
if they add to **Meng (孟)**, it will not stop;
if they add to **Zhong (仲)** or **Yǐ (巳)**, it will **not cease (不已)**.

Another method: Add the **month’s branch (月将)** to the **month’s stem (月建)**.
If **Rén (壬)** or **Guǐ (癸)** from the **celestial canopy (天上)** add to the **hour’s branch (地辰)**, it is a **clear day (晴)**.

「When **Rén-Zǐ (壬子)** governs, it also signifies rain.

**Method 70: Divination for entering a mountain to obtain things**
At the proper day and hour, observe whether the **celestial deity (神)** or **yin (阴)** of the **day’s branch (日辰)** aligns with a **auspicious qi (吉神)** of the **hour’s branch (将)**. If **royal stars (王相)** or **resting qi (休气)** above and below mutually generate, it is auspicious—you will obtain much.

If **yin (阴)** aligns with an **inauspicious qi (凶神)** of the **hour’s branch (将)**, or if **prison (囚)** and **death (死)** above and below mutually harm, it is inauspicious—you will be trapped in muddy rain, and your mission will fail.
This is called **yin encountering an inauspicious qi with rain imminent (阴凶逢雨将)**—you will meet the **White Tiger (白虎)**;
if you meet **evil beasts (恶禽兽)**, you will meet the **Black Tortoise (玄武)**.
You will face **bandits (寇盗)**; if the **celestial deity (神)** of the day is inauspicious, it is especially severe. If the **celestial deity (神)** of the hour is yin or inauspicious, it can be tolerated, but if both are inauspicious, it is a great calamity.
For instance, on the **7th month, Gēng-Yín (庚寅) day**, at dawn (**平旦**), **Tài Yī (太一)** adds to **Yín (寅)**, **Dēngmíng (登明)** becomes the **Vermilion Bird (朱雀)** governing **Gēng (庚)**, **Tài Yī** is the **Grand Official (太常)** governing **Yín**, **Gōngcáo (功曹)** is the **Heavenly Mother (天后)**, **Dēngmíng** is yin, **Chuánsòng (传送)** is the **Green Dragon (青龙)**, and **Tài Yī** is yin. All these align with your desired outcome, which will be fulfilled.

If both the **day’s branch (日)** and **hour’s branch (辰)** are auspicious, it is especially auspicious; if both are inauspicious, it is a great disaster.

**Method 71: Divination for crossing deep waters or rivers**
At the proper day and hour, observe whether the **day’s branch (日辰)** aligns with an **auspicious qi (吉神)** of the **hour’s branch (将)**. If **royal stars (王相)** or **resting qi (休气)** above and below mutually generate, it is auspicious.
If not, it is a great disaster, with **wind and waves (风波)** as the cause—this refers to **yin and yang (阴阳)**.
For example, on the **8th month, Jiā-Zǐ (甲子) day**, **Heavenly Trident (天罡)** adds to **Wèi (未)**, **Dēngmíng (登明)** becomes the **Great Yin (太阴)** governing **Jiā (甲)**, **Cóngkuí (从魁)** is the **Grand Official (太常)** governing **Zǐ (子)**, **Chuánsòng (传送)** is the **White Tiger (白虎)** and **Dēngmíng (登明)**, **Shèngxiān (胜先)** is the **Green Dragon (青龙)** and **Cóngkuí (从魁)**—this is yin.
The **Divine Pivot (神枢)** states: If the **branches (支)** harm the **stems (干)** while the **stems** are auspicious, the outcome will be prolonged; if the **stems** harm the **branches** while the **branches** are auspicious, the outcome will be delayed. If both **branches** and **stems** harm each other, the outcome will be diminished. If all are auspicious, it is especially so.

**Method 72: Divination for verifying the truthfulness of messengers or travelers**
Divine by observing the messenger’s arrival time, whether the **hour’s qi (时)** overcomes the **day’s qi (日)**, and whether their words align with the **celestial deity (神)**.

If the **day’s qi (日)** overcomes the **hour’s qi (时)** and the **celestial deity (神)** is ascendant, their words are false.
If the **hour’s star (辰)** is ascendant and the **celestial deity (神)** aligns as spoken, the words are true.
When the **hour’s qi (时)** and the **day’s qi (日)** and the **hour’s star (辰)** all harmonize, it signifies a coming accord.
It is also said: If the **hour’s star (辰)** and the **celestial deity (神)** harmonize with the **day’s qi (日)**, it likewise indicates that their words will be true.

If **Tàiyīn (太阴, Dark Moon)** or **Tiāngāng (天罡, Celestial Ganger)** aligns with the **day’s qi (日)** or the **hour’s star (辰)**, or if the **general’s year (将军年)** is ascendant, their words are untrustworthy.
**Chuánsòng (传送)** is the **Vermilion Bird (朱雀)**; if **Tiānkōng (天空, Celestial Void)** aligns with the **day’s qi (日)** or the **hour’s star (辰)**, their words will be contradictory, and **litigious disputes (口舌)** will arise—this indicates deceit, though not necessarily from themselves. The **left and right attendants (左右边)** will be the deceitful ones.

Again, if one seeks to flee or engage in battle, they must avoid **Tàiyī (太一, Supreme One)**—its alignment portends defeat.
**Tàiyī (太一)** is in **Zǐ (子)** in January, **Chǒu (丑)** in February, **Yín (寅)** in March, and **Mǎo (卯)** in April. This is used to verify if bandits will come.
If **Tàiyī (太一)**, **Shénhòu (神后, Celestial Deity’s Follower)**, and **jiānrén (奸人, deceitful ones)** or **dàozéi (盗贼, thieves/bandits)** all align with the **day’s stem (今日干)**, and **Tiāngāng (天罡)** and **Xiǎojí (小吉, Minor Auspice)** are before it, then bandits will arrive today.
If no such **celestial deity (神)** appears in the **branches (支)** or **stems (干)**, they will not come.
When observing a suspicious figure on the road, if the **branches (支)** harm the **path (径)**, one may proceed, but if the **stems (干)** harm the **path (径)**, one must not proceed.

Again, when observing a suspicious figure on the road, check if the **month’s star (月将)** aligns with the **hour (时)** and if the **day’s qi (日)** harmonizes with **Gōngcāo (功曹, Official Star)** while **Chuánsòng (传送)** and **Dēngmíng (登明)** appear with **officials (吏)**.
If **Shénhòu (神后)** or **Tàiyī (太一)** aligns, it indicates deceitful ones or thieves;
If **Kuí (魁)** or **Gāng (罡)** aligns, it foretells misfortune or death.
For the sick, if the **month’s star (月将)** aligns with the **hour (时)** and the **day’s qi (日)** harmonizes with **Gōngcāo (功曹)**, while **Chuánsòng (传送)**, **Dēngmíng (登明)**, and **officials (吏)** appear, then:
If **Shénhòu (神后)** or **Tàiyī (太一)** aligns, it signals deceitful ones or thieves;
If **Kuí (魁)** or **Gāng (罡)** aligns, it foretells misfortune or death.
If the sick person is seen under **Cóngkuí (从魁)** or **Shèngxiān (胜先)**, or if **Tàichōng (太冲, Supreme Surge)** and **Xiǎojí (小吉)** appear as a **white-clad person (白衣人)**, then:
If **Shénhòu (神后)** aligns with **Mǎo (卯)**, it marks a **grudge enemy (冤家)**.

**Method of the Guest (次客)**:
1. **Shénhòu (神后)**,
2. **Cóngkuí (从魁)**,
3. **Gōngcāo (功曹)**,
4. **Dēngmíng (登明)**,
5. **Tiāngāng (天罡)**,
6. **Dàijí (大吉, Major Auspice)**,
7. **Shèngxiān (胜先)**,
8. **Tàichōng (太冲)**,
9. **Chuánsòng (传送)**,
10. **Tàiyī (太一)**,
11. **Tàiyī (太一)** again (or **Tàiyīn (太阴)**),
12. **Xiǎojí (小吉)**.

Take the **last three** for yang and the **first five** for yin.
