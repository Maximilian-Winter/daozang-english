**Scripture of the Numinous Terrace**

**Scripture Title:** *Scripture of Numinous Gold*. Author unknown. Base text from *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Zhongjie* Category.

[Original text lacks chapters 1 through 8.]

**Three Dominant Palaces, Chapter 9**

*Yin-Wu-Xu* [Tiger-Horse-Dog]:
- Day birth: Sun in Wood, Jupiter in Earth;
- Night birth: Jupiter in Wood, Sun in Earth.

*Shen-Zi-Chen* [Monkey-Rat-Dragon]:
- Day birth: Earth in Water, Wood;
- Night birth: Water in Earth, Wood.

*Hai-Mao-Wei* [Pig-Rabbit-Goat]:
- Day birth: Metal in Fire, Moon;
- Night birth: Fire in Metal, Moon.

*Si-You-Chou* [Snake-Rooster-Ox]:
- Day birth: Metal in Moon, Fire;
- Night birth: Moon in Metal, Fire.

For all day births, observe the palace where the Sun resides to determine the dominant palace. For night births, observe the palace where the Moon resides to determine the dominant palace.

The Scripture states: For those born by day, if the Sun is in a yang palace; for those born by night, if the Moon is in a yin palace—such persons do not oppose the Three Dominant Palaces and are destined to be powerful, greatly wealthy, and noble. If born by day with the Sun in a yin palace, or by night with the Moon in a yang palace, this opposes the Three Dominant Palaces, and such persons are fated to live in poverty and lowliness.

Yet, upon examination, this may not fully penetrate the profound mystery. The *Scripture of the Four Gates* further states: Even if one does not oppose the Three Dominant Palaces, observe the three palaces. If they reside in powerless positions, or are hidden, stationary, or retrograde, one cannot be considered a person of fortune. Conversely, even if one opposes the Three Dominant Palaces, observe the Three Dominant Palaces. If they reside in powerful positions or occupy the palace of a ruling deity, one cannot be deemed a person without fortune.

However, with these theories, no definitive judgment is established. Therefore, I have here extracted the essential principles and set them as standards, that they may prove effective.

In assessing human fortune and misfortune, the hours of *mao* (卯), *chen* (辰), and *si* (巳) correspond to youth; *wu* (午) and *wei* (未) to middle age; and *shen* (申) and *you* (酉) to old age. If the initial ruler resides in youth, the middle ruler in middle age, and the final ruler in old age, this constitutes non-opposition to the Three Rulers—a person of great nobility. If the initial ruler resides in old age and the final ruler in youth, this constitutes opposition to the Three Rulers.

If the initial directional ruler lies in the north, then the west (戌 and 亥) represents early years; the north (子) represents middle age; and the east (丑 and 寅) represents old age. When discussing orientation and opposition, one speaks in terms of the south to discern alignment or conflict. Even if a directional ruler retrogrades, remains stationary, or resides in the palace of a ruling deity, one must still apply the principles of augmentation and diminution to ascertain accuracy.

If the initial and middle rulers occupy their proper positions while the final ruler precedes the middle ruler, the Three Rulers are assessed with half their power. If the final ruler precedes the initial ruler and lies north of *mao*, its influence on fortune and misfortune is disregarded entirely. If it lies south of *mao*, its full power is considered. In such cases, both the initial and final rulers are disregarded.

If the middle ruler precedes the initial ruler and lies north of *mao*, the middle ruler is entirely disregarded, while the initial ruler is assessed with diminished power. If it lies south of *mao*, the initial ruler is entirely disregarded, and the middle ruler determines the outcome, corresponding to middle age. If the initial ruler follows the middle ruler, it is assessed with half its power. If the initial ruler follows the final ruler’s position, it is entirely disregarded.

Further, one must observe the moment of birth, examining the ruler of the Life Palace and the strength of all stars to determine wealth, poverty, nobility, or lowliness, as well as the relative power of the stellar configurations. Their divisions and numerical values must be established accordingly.

To determine the proximity of the Three Directional Rulers, first calculate the lifespan and divide it into three periods. This will establish the timing of fortune and misfortune, as well as the periods in which they manifest.

**Allocation of the Palaces (Tenth Section)**
The ancient scriptures state: Use the twenty-eight lunar mansions to define the twelve months. Beginning from the first day of the lunar month, count to determine the Life Palace. Since the motion of the Moon varies—sometimes swift, sometimes slow, sometimes stationary—it is difficult to establish a fixed rule. However, using the calendar, first determine the palace in which the Moon resides, which becomes the Life Palace. The mansion reached at the hour of birth becomes the natal mansion. Upon this mansion, there are three "severed" mansions: count seven mansions for the first severance, ten for the second, and another ten for the third, totaling twenty-five mansions.

For example, if *Bi* (毕) is the natal mansion, count seven from *Bi* to *Xing* (星) for the first severance; then ten from *Xing* to *Wei* (尾) for the second; and another ten from *Wei* to *Kui* (奎) for the third. If illness occurs on one of these three severed days, it is difficult to cure.

**Life Palace**
At birth, if any star falls into a debilitated palace or one of the five weak positions, yet shares the same palace as the Moon, it is not considered debilitated, for the Sun and Moon have no debilitated palaces. If in opposition, trine, or sextile aspect, its power is assessed as diminished by two-thirds. If in its own ruling palace, its full power is considered.

If the Sun and Jupiter are in the ruling position, the person will be greatly noble, wealthy, and long-lived. If Mars is present, it harms the mother. If Mars is ahead, it damages the Sun and Moon, but if diminished, this effect is mitigated. If Saturn is present, affairs will often be obstructed, and Daoist cultivation is advisable. If Venus is present, the person will have a fine appearance, many desires, and be beloved by women. If Mercury is present, the person will be literary, clever, and wise. If the Ascendant is present, official position is favorable. If Tianyi is present, in youth one will be close to nobility. If Taiyi is present, there will be much poison, harm, and misfortune. If there are scars, insect injuries, or burns, these correspond to Mars, indicating auspiciousness. The same applies if the Ascendant is present.

**Fortune and Misfortune of the Life Palace**
The *Purple Palace Scripture* states: The palace and mansion in which the Sun resides become the Destiny Palace and natal mansion. Upon this mansion, there are six "harmful" mansions. Taking the Sun’s mansion as the first Destiny Mansion, count four mansions ahead for the second (Intent Mansion), seven for the third (Affair Mansion), four for the fourth (Conquest Mansion), and so on for the fifth (Assembly Mansion) and sixth (Union Mansion). If malevolent stars aspect these six mansions, misfortune will arise.

In terms of stellar power: if afflicting the Destiny Mansion, there will be much misfortune; if afflicting the Intent Mansion, much dissatisfaction; if afflicting the Affair Mansion, sudden calamities; if afflicting the Conquest Mansion, much harm from bandits; if afflicting the Assembly Mansion, much death; if afflicting the Union Mansion, much separation.

For example, if the Sun is in *Lou* (娄), then *Lou* is the first Destiny Mansion. Count four to *Bi* (毕) for the second Intent Mansion; seven from *Bi* to *Xing* (星) for the third Affair Mansion; four from *Xing* to *Zhen* (轸) for the fourth Conquest Mansion; four from *Zhen* to *Di* (氏) for the fifth Assembly Mansion; and five from *Di* to *Ji* (箕) for the sixth Union Mansion. All other cases follow this pattern.

The *General Principles Scripture* states: When the celestial wheel first emerges above the horizon, the stars at *mao* (卯) become the Destiny Palace. The twelve positions are then determined in sequence, and all fortune and misfortune lie within the seven strong palaces.

**Destiny Palace**
For those born during the day, follow the Sun; for those born at night, follow the Moon. Allocate from the eastern rising to the end. If the allocation falls within the seven strong positions, fortune and emolument will be extraordinary. If it falls within the five weak positions, fortune will be meager. One must also consider the retrogression or direct motion of the stars, as well as their ruling palaces, to determine their numerical power. Observe whether any stars aspect or conjoin the allocated position to assess the degree of fortune.

Additionally, examine the strength of the Wealth Position for support. For those born during the day, if the three nocturnal directional rulers are weak, [the assessment of fortune and virtue follows accordingly].

Regardless of day or night, count from the ruler of the Wealth Palace to the Wealth Palace itself, then allocate from the eastern rising to the end. Assess the position’s elevation and whether any stars aspect or conjoin it to determine its ruler. The causes are as follows: the Sun pertains to ancestral legacy, the Moon to maternal kin, Jupiter to officials and superiors, Mars to soldiers and bandits, Saturn to servants, fields, and estates, Mercury to documents and writings, and Venus to wives. If auspicious stars reside in the aforementioned palaces, success will come through these matters; if inauspicious stars reside there, ruin will follow. If Mars appears at both the beginning and end, it portends destruction by soldiers or bandits. If Taiyi aligns with Tianyi, success will come through noble patrons.

**Wealth Position**
For those born during the day, count from Jupiter to the Moon; for those born at night, reverse the order, allocating from the eastern rising. If auspicious stars guard this position, longevity is assured; if inauspicious stars appear, early death follows. The presence of Jupiter and the Moon alone ensures longevity. If Jupiter is retrograde while the Moon occupies the same palace as Wei, life will be short. Further affliction by malefic stars brings premature death. For those born during the day, if Mars conjoins the Moon, early death also follows. If Saturn afflicts the Sun, Mars afflicts the Moon, or Taiyi afflicts Jupiter, each diminishes vitality by one degree. If Jupiter and the Moon are in weak positions, vitality is further reduced by one degree. If Mars resides at the western setting, vitality is diminished by four degrees. If Mars occupies the Eight Destructive Positions, a violent death ensues. However, the presence of Jupiter and the Moon mitigates one degree of harm. Regularly tally the cumulative effects of auspicious and inauspicious influences to determine the length of life.

Life’s span is measured by cycles: the *Yin Fan Ce* marks the *Bailiu* conjunction, while the *Yi Zhou* encompasses the *Bai Ba* count. Each *ji* (cycle) represents one degree of life, totaling nine degrees for one hundred and eight years. If virtue extends life by one *ji*, longevity reaches one hundred and twenty years. Once the degree of life is determined, to calculate remaining years, months, and days, take the remaining days of Jupiter and multiply them by the remaining days of the Sun. Divide the product by the total degrees of the celestial sphere to derive the number of years, discarding any remainder. For the remainder of the celestial division, divide by thirty for alternative calculations or by ten for years. Here, divide by twelve for months, with the remainder as days, yielding the remaining years, months, and days of the cycle. Each *ji* spans twelve years; this method is most refined. Another method is recorded in the section on Annual Palaces.

Additionally, for a male child, observe the Moon’s position three and nine days after birth; if it aligns with Mars, the child may suffer from *cuokou* (infantile convulsions). For a female child, observe seven days after birth; if the Moon aligns with Saturn, the same affliction arises, especially for those born at night.

**Life Palace**
For those born during the day, count from Saturn to Mars; for those born at night, reverse the order, allocating from the eastern rising. The manner of death is determined as follows: the Sun, Moon, Jupiter, and Mercury bring peaceful deaths; eclipsing stars, Mars, and comets cause violent deaths; Venus leads to death through women; Saturn to death through Daoist practices; Jupiter to sudden death; Mercury to death from cold illnesses; Saturn to death from abdominal diseases; Mars to death by bloodshed; eclipsing stars to death by fright; comets to death by robbery; Tianyi, when conjoined with malefic stars, to death by pleasure.

Moreover, the positions of Shen and You must always be examined, regardless of wealth or status. These two positions should never be afflicted by Mars, which invariably portends a violent death, even for the highly noble. As Master Li stated: If Mars enters a palace from one to three degrees, death comes by flogging; at eight degrees, by the sword; at eleven degrees, by hanging; at fourteen degrees, by drowning; at seventeen degrees, by curses; at twenty degrees, by fright or robbery; at twenty-three degrees, by insect bites, punishment, or harm; at twenty-six degrees, by misfortune; at twenty-eight degrees, by falls; at thirty degrees, by execution.

If Mars occupies the Eight Destructive Positions: in Jiao and Kang, death by drowning; in Di, Fang, Xin, and Wei, by fox spirits; in Wei and Ji, by insect bites; in Dou, Niu, and Nü, by goring; in Xu and Wei, by nightmares; in Shi and Bi, by drowning; in Kui and Lou, by insect bites; in Wei and Mao, by bone diseases; in Bi, Zui, and Shen, by horse accidents; in Jing and Gui, by pursuit; in Liu, by horse falls; in Zhang, by snake or boar attacks. At fifteen degrees, execution is certain.

It is also said: In the six southern palaces from Qian, death comes by insect bites or execution. In the six northern degrees, death comes by water, fire, or conspiracy. If Mars is concealed here and the Life or Destiny Palace contains Jupiter, one may be noble yet die young. Without Venus or Jupiter, early death or midlife demise follows.

Another method: To predict the year, month, and day of death, observe Mars’ position and the stars in the Life and Destiny Palaces to determine the cause of death.

**Yang Palaces**
Count sequentially from the constellation of the Lion, through Zhang, Yi, Zhen, Jiao, Kang, Di, Fang, Xin, Wei, Ji, Dou, Niu, Nü, to six degrees before Xu, all are Yang positions.

**Yin Palaces**
Count in reverse from the constellation of the Crab and Liu, through Gui, Jing, Shen, Zui, Bi, Wei, Mao, Lou, Kui, Bi, Shi, Wei, to seven degrees before Xu, all are Yin palaces.

**Death and Imprisonment Palace**
Count from the Moon to the eighth position, allocating from the eastern rising, and assess the palace, celestial stems, constellations, and stars therein.

The manner of death is further detailed: the Sun, Moon, and Jupiter bring death by illness; Mars by bloodshed; Saturn by falls; Venus by women; Mercury by writings; the Ascendant by friends; Tianyi by noble patrons; Taiyi by soldiers or bandits, or otherwise by warfare.

**Calamity Palace**
When Fire or Earth arrive at this palace, they bring disaster. If Fire or Earth are the ruling stars, however, they do not cause disaster. Should an eclipse occur, the celestial spirit Tianyi will bring calamity. Further examine the palace beneath it: what palace does it conjoin, and what position does it occupy? This reveals the nature of the harm. Since the ruling star resides here, it does not bring personal misfortune but instead affects others. If the stars of one’s current year reach this palace, the same principles apply as at birth. At birth, this governs one’s entire life; in the current year, the stars’ influence in this palace is limited to the month and day.

**Affliction Palace**
Count by day and night from the Sun to the sixth palace, allocating from the eastern rising, and interpret based on the constellations therein. The Sun and Moon govern eye ailments; Wood governs wind illnesses; Fire governs sores and wounds; Earth governs swelling and pain; Water governs cold illnesses; Metal governs coughing ailments; the Ascendant governs internal illnesses; Tianyi governs heart ailments; Taiyi governs sudden afflictions. At birth, this determines one’s lifelong condition; in the current year, it applies for that year.

**Siblings Palace**
Count by day and night from Earth to Wood, allocating from the eastern rising, and interpret based on the palace and constellations therein, assessing the strength or weakness of the stars in aspect to determine fortune or misfortune. If one’s life palace aligns with this position and falls in the constellations of the Lion, Archer, Capricorn, Aquarius, or Maiden, one will have few siblings. If it falls in the Fish, Ram, or Crab, one will have many siblings. If in the Fish, Ram, or Archer, one’s spouse will have siblings of a different lineage. Further, count from Water to Wood, allocating from the eastern rising—if the person is restrained, it is auspicious. If aligned with the palace of fortune and appearance, siblings will be harmonious. If Fire guards the three directions and occupies an Earth position, it is best if malevolent stars do not restrain. The stars traversed in this sequence indicate the number of siblings. Examine this position as above to determine the strength of sisters. To know the number of siblings: by day, observe the southern palace for the number of stars; by night, observe the northern palace. These indicate the number of siblings, with Yang stars as brothers and Yin stars as sisters. To discern whether they are supportive or not, judge by the benevolence or malevolence of the stars.

**Wife Palace**
Count by day and night from Earth to Metal, allocating from the eastern rising, and assess the stars to determine fortune or misfortune. If the wife palace or wife position encounters Metal, it is inauspicious to see Fire, which brings misfortune. Even with benevolent stars aiding, harm may still occur. If malevolent stars restrain, it leads to licentiousness, ill repute, and the ruin of family morals. If Metal resides in the Mane, it also indicates licentiousness; if Fire is also present, she will be a prostitute. If Wood appears, there will be two wives, and she will bring wealth. If the Sun and Moon appear, one gains a virtuous wife. If Earth appears, marriage will be difficult, with disparities in age. If Water appears, one gains a refined wife skilled in literature and music. If an eclipse spirit is present, the wife is wicked and brings harm. If Tianyi appears, one marries a woman of noble lineage; if Taiyi appears, the wife is ugly. The palace’s elevation must also be considered. Further, count to the Sun and Moon, allocating from Metal to the void position, and correlate with the current year to its end.

**Union Palace**
This is the year of marriage. This palace particularly abhors Earth and Fire; their presence ensures difficulty in marriage, or taking a base woman as wife, and few children. If Earth sees Metal and also the wife palace, the wife will be sickly or incomplete. If Fire sees Metal, the wife is unvirtuous. Fire in the Metal palace or Metal degree is the same. If Wood appears, there will be two wives, and she will bring wealth.

**Husband Palace**
Count by day and night from Metal to Earth, allocating from the eastern rising. If stars are present within, interpret as above, following the same principles as the wife palace.

**Children Palace**
Count by day and night from Wood to Earth, allocating from the eastern rising. If benevolent stars are present, one will bear fine sons and daughters; if malevolent stars are present, they will bring harm. From the eastern rising to the palace it overlays, the stars traversed indicate the number of daughters. If the first star seen is Yin, the firstborn is a daughter; if Yang, the firstborn is a son. Benevolent stars signify virtuous sons; malevolent stars signify violent children. Retrograde or contrary motion indicates harm, while Yin and Yang stars determine the strength of sons and daughters.

**Procreation Palace**
Count by day and night from Fire to Wood, allocating from the eastern rising. If Metal and Wood arrive in the current year, one will certainly have children. If Wood reaches Fire while Metal guards the origin, there will be sons. If in the current year Wood reaches Metal guarding the origin, and Fire reaches its own origin, there will also be sons. If Earth opposes Metal and Water, there will be few children. If Metal and the Moon conjoin malevolent stars in reversal, the palace will be barren. If stars reside in a Yang palace at birth but one’s life is Yin, and the life palace is in the Maiden, it indicates twins. If the cultivation palace is elevated and the Moon is present, sons and daughters will be easily raised. If Metal resides in the second division of a Yin or Yang palace, it severs progeny, preventing childbirth.

**Sons Palace**
Count by day and night from the Sun to Wood, allocating from the eastern rising. If in a strong position with benevolent stars in aspect, one will have fine sons and daughters. If afflicted by malevolent stars, one will have few children, and those born will be difficult to raise or will bring harm.

**Daughters Palace**
Count by day and night from the Moon to Metal, allocating from the eastern rising, interpreting fortune or misfortune by benevolent or malevolent stars as before. To know their number, observe the palace reached from the eastern rising and count the stars therein—this is their number. Benevolent stars bring fortune; malevolent stars bring misfortune. Yin and Yang stars determine whether they are sons or daughters.

**Father Palace**
By day, count from the Sun to Earth; by night, reverse this, allocating from the eastern rising. If benevolent stars are present, the father is noble.

**Father Palace**
If born by day, the Sun meets Fire; if born by night, Earth meets the Sun. If the Sun conjoins with an eclipse spirit, it portends harm to the father.

**Mother Palace**
By day, count from Metal to the Moon; by night, reverse this, allocating from the eastern rising. Observe whether the stars are benevolent or malevolent to determine fortune or misfortune. If born by day, Fire meets the Moon; if born by night, Earth meets the Moon; or if the Moon resides in the palace beneath Earth—all portend harm to the mother. If the Sun and Moon occupy the same inverted palace and reside in the eastern quadrant, this person’s parents are of different kinds. If the three directions of the Sun are exalted, the father is strong; if the three directions of the Moon, the mother is strong. Whenever the Sun and Moon oppose the eastern rising palace and are afflicted by malevolent stars, this person’s parents are destined for separation. If Metal and the Moon reside in the palace beneath Earth, the mother is base and of ill repute. If the lord of the Sun’s palace and its three directional lords occupy the palace of servants and misfortune, the father is base and without emolument. If the lord of the Moon’s palace and its three directional lords occupy the sixty-second palace, the mother is base and short-lived.

**Official Emolument Palace**
By day and night, count from the lord of the official palace to the official palace, allocating from the eastern rising. Observe its exaltation or debasement: if in a high position, one holds a great and noble office; if in a low position, one holds a petty office. Even if in a high position, if the ruling star does not shine and malevolent stars do not afflict, one holds office without emolument. If in a low position yet the ruling star shines or resides in a royal abode, one holds a great office, though not of pure nobility. If Wood, the Sun, Water, or Tianyi conjoin and occupy a high position, one is a civil official. If Earth, Fire, Metal, Tail, or Comet occupy a high position, one is a military official. Always determine rank by the depth, strength, or weakness of the stars, and whether they are ruling stars or reside in royal abodes. Furthermore, count from Earth to the Moon, allocating from the eastern rising, for military officials; from Wood to Water, allocating from the eastern rising, for civil officials. Their exaltation or debasement is determined as above.

**Friends and Acquaintances Palace**
If born by day, count from the Moon to Water; if born by night, reverse this, allocating from the eastern rising. It is especially inauspicious if eclipse spirits, Taiyi, Earth, or Fire conjoin, for they become enemies to the self, bestowing harm in return for kindness. If these stars aspect one another in opposition or conjunction, the same applies. If these stars reside in royal abodes, misfortune reverses to fortune, and one should associate with martial and courageous people to gain their support. If Fire resides in the tenth minor palace, one is plotted against. If the Sun is afflicted by Fire or the Moon by Earth, one should not trust confidants.

**Spiritual Cultivation Palace**
By day, count from the Moon to the Sun; by night, reverse this, allocating from the eastern rising. The stars governing this palace signify: benevolent stars bring refinement; the Sun, devotion to the Dao; Wood, alchemy; the Moon, Buddhism; Fire, propriety; Earth, longevity practices; Metal, fondness for women; Water, literature; Fire, martial valor; Tianyi, association with nobility; Taiyi, deceit and thievery. If these stars aspect one another in opposition or conjunction, the same applies.

**Passions and Desires Palace**
By day, count from the appearance palace to the spiritual cultivation palace; by night, reverse this, allocating from the eastern rising. If one obtains the palaces of Ox, Sheep, Fish, or Musk Deer, one is lustful—especially if Metal is present. If Water resides in the Sheep’s Exhaustion, Fire in the Flowering Tree, or Mandarin Ducks, one favors male lovers. If Metal and the Moon occupy the fourth palace, both men and women are licentious, becoming shamans or mediums. If Metal lingers, one engages with many. If Earth and Wood afflict, one is lewd with livestock. If Fire and Metal conjoin, lust is never sated. If Metal resides in the eighth palace, one favors sensuality. If Fire resides in the ninth, the same applies. If Metal resides in the Lion, one usurps others’ wives and concubines. If Metal resides in the Crab or Musk Deer, one has depraved conduct. The Moon in Zhang 9, Di 12, 13, 14, Tail 12, Stomach 14, or Well 24; Metal in Kui 2, Shen 1, Well 19, Willow 13, Di 5, Dipper 13, or Rooftop 11; the Sun in Chamber 13 or Wings 13; Water in Well 15, Wings 3, or Di 4; Fire in Well 15, Wings 15, Horn 6, Neck 4, or Di 5—all portend lewdness, taking base women as wives or accepting others’ wives. If this palace conjoins with the children’s palace, one is fortunate in matters of sons and daughters. If it conjoins with the servants’ palace, one is fortunate with servants.

Wherever conjunction occurs, it invariably signifies clandestine relations. Furthermore, if Metal resides in the seventh position while Earth and Fire share the same palace, one is frivolous and malicious, engaging in illicit affairs with outsiders without regard for their quality. If Metal resides in the palace of office and the Moon in the palace of fields and dwellings, one marries a relative, and if the position is lofty and strong, it is auspicious.

**Palace of Passions and Desires**
From Water to the Moon by day, and from the eastern emergence by night, match accordingly. If favorable stars appear in a high position, one gains the support of servants. If malevolent stars occupy a low position, one lacks such support, and careful assessment is required. Should malevolent stars guard or shine upon this palace, servants will surely rebel and act as thieves; if Fire and Earth appear at the head and tail, they constantly harbor intentions to harm their master.

**Palace of Servants**
By day, proceed from the Palace of Passions and Desires to Water; by night, reverse the order, and match from the eastern emergence. Observe the palace it occupies, for it invariably portends many hardships and constraints. For instance, if it occupies the palace of sons and daughters, hardships will arise in matters concerning them.

**Palace of Hardships and Constraints**
From the Palace of Celestial Thoughts to the Sun by day, and from the Palace of Terrestrial Thoughts to the Moon by night, these two palaces pertain to the sequence of one’s endeavors. Each palace is divided into three parts, each comprising ten degrees. The determination of these matters is exceedingly complex, all derived from the *Canon of the Five Phases’ Determined Divisions*, and thus will not be recorded here in full.

**Palace of Celestial Thoughts**

**Section Eleven: The Distribution of Stellar Influences**
To determine a person’s fortune or misfortune, first examine the palace of body and life, then the three directional rulers. If the ruler of the body and life palace lacks strength but the three directional rulers reside in favorable positions, one may still attain middling wealth and nobility. If the three directional rulers all lack strength but the ruler of the body and life palace occupies a favorable position, one may still achieve minor wealth and nobility.

If Wood resides in the third palace and is not in detriment alongside the Moon, and if neither the Sun nor Moon occupy a detrimental palace, wherever they travel will be auspicious. If the stars appear in the five weak positions alongside the Sun and Moon, they are not considered in detriment and may still be assessed for their strength. If the head and tail reside in the four cardinal palaces, one is suited to officialdom. A predominance of auspicious stars at the head portends fortune, while a predominance of inauspicious stars at the tail portends misfortune. If Taiyi, Earth, or Fire govern officialdom, one will surely suffer from malignant sores and die.

If the ruler of the body palace and the directional rulers all occupy low positions while the remaining stars reside in high positions, they gain one-third of their strength. If they occupy the ruling mansion, they gain six-tenths of their strength. If the ruler of the body and life palace and the directional rulers all occupy low positions but reside in the ruling mansion, while the remaining stars occupy high positions, they gain seven-tenths of their strength. If the stars lack strength, they gain four-tenths of their strength.

If the ruler of the body and life palace and the directional rulers occupy low positions but reside in the ruling mansion, while the remaining stars occupy high positions and also reside in the ruling mansion, they gain eight-tenths of their strength. If the ruler of the body and life palace occupies a high position while the remaining stars occupy low positions but reside in the ruling mansion, they gain nine-tenths of their strength. If the ruler of the body and life palace resides in the ruling mansion and occupies a high position, it gains six-tenths of its strength.

If the ruler of the body and life palace is not in a favorable position but the three rulers reside in the ruling mansion in favorable positions, and the directional ruler’s ruling mansion occupies a low position, they gain six-tenths of their strength. If in a position of strength, and if either the body ruler or life ruler conjoins with a directional ruler, the fortune or misfortune remains undetermined; however, if the Sun and Moon are frequently visible, they gain full strength.

Whenever a star appears alongside the Sun or Moon, it gains two-tenths of its strength; if not, its strength may be reduced by two-tenths. The strength of stars in their ruling mansions or places of joy varies. Wood in *Shi* gains eight-tenths of its strength; in *Ghost*, full strength; in *Human Horse*, four-tenths. Fire in *Heart* gains full strength; in *Dipper*, six-tenths. Earth in *Dipper* gains full strength; in *Neck*, eight-tenths; in *Void*, four-tenths. Metal in *Neck* gains full strength; in *Stomach*, nine-tenths; in *Mao*, eight-tenths; in *Net*, six-tenths; in *Shi*, five-tenths. Water in *Wings* gains full strength; in *Chariot*, nine-tenths. The Sun in *Star* gains full strength; in *Lou*, eight-tenths. The Moon in *Stomach* gains eight-tenths; in *Mao*, seven-tenths; in *Net*, six-tenths; in the *Crab* palace, four-tenths. The Head in *Star* gains six-tenths; in *Chariot*, eight-tenths. The Tail in *Wall* gains eight-tenths. Taiyi in *Woman* gains full strength; Yueyi in *Willow* gains six-tenths.

If the ruler of the body and life palace and the directional rulers reside in the ruling mansion, occupy strong positions, and are visible alongside the Sun and Moon, they gain full strength. If they occupy their own elemental positions, their strength is doubled. If stationary, it is doubled again, yielding thirty-tenths of their strength. If in a low position, they gain seven-tenths of their strength; if visible alongside the Sun and Moon, they gain seven-tenths. If the remaining stars do not reside in the ruling mansion but occupy strong positions and are visible alongside the Sun and Moon, they gain eight-tenths of their strength; if not visible, they lack strength. If the remaining stars occupy high positions but do not reside in the ruling mansion, they gain eight-tenths of their strength; if not visible alongside the Sun and Moon, five-tenths. In such cases, their strength is reduced by two-tenths.

Whenever a star enters the palace of its ruling mansion but does not occupy the exact degree of the ruling mansion, whether it reaches or falls short, approaches or recedes, adjustments must be made accordingly. Whether it faces toward or turns away from the ruling mansion’s degree also requires augmentation or reduction in assessment.

Facing the ruling mansion’s degree occurs when a star moves direct, and the ruling mansion’s degree lies ahead. If the star moves retrograde, the ruling mansion’s degree lies behind, which also constitutes facing. Turning away from the ruling mansion’s degree occurs when a star moves direct, and the ruling mansion’s degree lies behind. If the star moves retrograde and the ruling mansion’s degree lies ahead, this also constitutes turning away.

Furthermore, "reaching" or "falling short" refers to whether the ruling mansion’s degree lies ahead, and the star’s movement attains it, which is termed "reaching."

Falling short occurs when the ruling mansion’s degree lies ahead, yet the star’s movement does not attain it, causing the degree to remain stationary. This stationary state then turns retrograde, collectively termed "falling short." Not attaining occurs when a star moves retrograde, the ruling mansion’s degree lies behind, and though the star seeks to reach that degree, it instead halts, and this halt then turns direct—this is termed "not attaining." Attaining occurs when the ruling mansion’s degree lies behind, the star moves retrograde, and enters that degree.

For cases of facing where attainment or reaching occurs, assess with a two-part division of strength. For cases of turning away, falling short, or not attaining, assess with a four-part reduction in strength. If near, when the ruling mansion’s degree is attained within three days, assess with a one-part reduction in strength. If within the ruling mansion’s lunar lodge degree, assess with ten parts. If positioned in its own inherent place, double the assessment. If stationary and guarding its lodge, double it again.

When direct, it signifies civil matters; when retrograde, it signifies military affairs. If situated in one of the seven strong positions, it portends great nobility. If the life or fate ruler resides in one of the five weak positions, it signifies a person of extreme poverty.

Whenever a benefic star is afflicted by a malefic star, even if they occupy the same palace, only when there is encroachment or violation does it constitute affliction. If a malefic star lies ahead, and the Sun, Moon, or five planets do not depart its palace but instead move, halt, or violate it, this brings misfortune. If a malefic star lies behind and the stars retrograde to assail, the misfortune is severe. If a benefic star lies ahead and a malefic star retrogrades to violate it, the misfortune is also grave. If stars lie behind and a malefic star retrogrades to encroach, the misfortune is even greater. If a benefic star lies ahead and a malefic star behind, and the malefic star moves swiftly, it neither encroaches nor violates, thus bringing no misfortune.

If encroachment or violation occurs within seven days, it does not escape the state of infancy. If the Sun or Moon occupies a high position and a malefic star from a lower position afflicts them, it does not bring misfortune. If a benefic star and the Sun or Moon occupy a low position and a malefic star from a high position afflicts them, it necessarily brings misfortune. If all occupy high positions, the affliction is not severe. If all occupy low positions, the violation is necessarily grave.

If at birth the Sun and Moon undergo an eclipse, the person will not be whole. If Mars retrogrades to encounter the Sun or Moon, and a benefic star rescues them, the person will suffer eye damage. Without rescue, they will die from a contorted mouth. Jupiter governs high rank, Saturn governs heavy responsibilities, Venus governs women and feminine occupations, Mercury governs literary talent, Mars governs military strategy, the Node governs military authority, Tianyi governs noble attire, Taiyi governs punishment and killing, the Sun governs the Son of Heaven, and the Moon governs the empress and consorts.

When the Moon is in the fifth palace, there will be many children. When Mercury sets in the west, the person fears their wife. When Mars retrogrades, death is unnatural. When Saturn afflicts, the person is orphaned young and suited to become a Daoist monk or Buddhist clergy. When Mars afflicts, the person is brave and fond of killing. When Jupiter afflicts, the person enjoys longevity. When Venus afflicts, the person suffers calamities related to women. When Mercury afflicts, the person possesses inferior skills. When the Sun afflicts, the person is noble.

When multiple comets afflict, the person’s wife is harmed. Venus is quick-tempered and self-willed. Mars is impatient and difficult to offend. Saturn is steadfast and benevolent. Mercury is intelligent and perceptive. Jupiter is kind and upright. The Sun governs ancestors, the Moon governs maternal relatives, Jupiter brings blessings, Mars governs official position, Saturn governs fields and dwellings, Venus governs wives, and Mercury governs arts and occupations.

Saturn governs abdominal illnesses, Mercury governs cold illnesses, Mars governs legal troubles and insect injuries, Venus governs women’s sensual desires, Jupiter governs wind illnesses, and Mercury governs literary and verbal matters.

**Annual Fortune and Misfortune (Chapter Twelve)**
Begin with the palace of the eastern emergence, moving one palace per year, and only shift after the birthday has passed. Always use the annual palace to determine fortune or misfortune. If the Sun serves as the ruler, await its arrival at the ruling mansion’s palace and lodge to find auspicious occasions for approaching nobility. If the annual ruler is the ruler, then when the Moon or Mercury moves swiftly, assess based on the life ruler and the native’s ruling star. If the hour serves as the ruler, there will be extraordinary joy.

During direct motion, if in a position of strength, Jupiter reaching the life ruler first brings calamity and sorrow, followed by great joy. If Mars serves as the ruler, calamity occurs when it is retrograde, hidden, or afflicting the life or annual palace. If it is the ruling star, observe when it reaches the official or life palace, as well as the third and ninth palaces, all of which are times of joy.

If Saturn serves as the ruler, matters proceed sluggishly, with frequent financial losses, and illness occurs during retrograde or hidden phases. If it is the ruling star, it signifies authority over land, but only when in a position of strength. For commoners, it brings wealth. If Venus serves as the ruler, observe when it reaches its ruling mansion—all such times are auspicious.

Additionally, always use the lodges of the three severances and six harms at birth to determine annual fortune or misfortune, as this method is highly accurate and should be employed.

Fire arriving at the third, sixth, or eleventh [positions] is always auspicious. Wood arriving at the second, fifth, seventh, or ninth [positions] is always auspicious.
