The method of fire timing is neither the insubstantial *qi* of mental visualization nor the true *qi* of breath held above the waist. Its transmission comprises three aspects:
The heart governs the sovereign fire, called the *Upper Darkness*.
The kidneys govern the ministerial fire, called the *Middle Darkness*.
The bladder governs the popular fire, called the *Lower Darkness*.
When the three *qi* converge, they form fire; when dispersed, they become *qi*. Thus, it is called the *True Fire of the Three Darknesses*.
Its ascent and descent circulate like the Dao of Heaven: fifteen taels and three hundred sixty *zhu* constitute the measure of the *Cinnabar Heaven*, for the celestial *qi* advances every five days in its cyclical timing.

In human cultivation, the fire advances and retreats with every fivefold progression.
Master Lü said: "First transmit the fire to internally nourish the Yellow Dame."
Master Haichan said: "When refining the elixir, do not let the Fire Dragon take flight. Begin at the hours of *xu* and *hai*, and cease at the hour of *zi*."

Secluded in a quiet chamber, sit in stillness, repeatedly dispelling thoughts. Gently rest the hands upon the table, lightly pressing the face and abdomen. Let the breath flow softly through the nose, employing it without strain. Silently visualize the *dantian* as an unceasingly turning wheel of fire. The flanks remain unmoving, as if fatigued; when briefly resting, gather again at the flanks. Through the alternation of gathering and dispersing, direct the fire to subdue the lower heart.

When the fire-*qi* enters the *Yellow Court Palace*, first a faint ache in the abdomen is felt, followed by a gradual warmth. If one ceases at this method alone, it naturally replenishes deficiency and augments *qi*, ensuring stability, peace, and longevity.

When combined with the copulation of Dragon and Tiger and practiced for a hundred days, apply five taels of fire from *xu* to *zi*, refining the essence into *quicksilver*, leaving residual potency in the medicine.
After two hundred days, apply ten taels of fire from *you* to *zi*, refining cinnabar into *golden cinnabar*, and the *Sacred Embryo* becomes complete.
After three hundred days, apply fifteen taels of fire from *shen* to *zi*, refining cinnabar into gold, and the pure yang *qi* is born.
Counting three hundred days and thirty taels of fire, this is called *three thousand days of fulfilled merit*.

With one jin and eight liang of golden cinnabar, regulate the breath and count the cycles.
Two feet make one *zhu*; twenty-four *zhu* make one tael.
Employ the *Elbow-Behind Flying Gold Essence*—this refers to the fire phase of the *Elbow-Behind Gold Essence*.

**Jade Capital Mountain**
It is said: When refining the Golden Elixir and kindling the fire, begin on the *jiazi* day of the eleventh month, as the *First Yang* contends with the *Five Yins*—this is the hexagram *Earth Thunder Fu* (*Return*).
Why? *Kun* (Earth) is the mother of *Zhen* (Thunder). When one line of *Kun* transforms, it becomes *Zhen*, wherein wood generates yang. *Kun* is the palace of yin; the five earths can nurture the one yang. The one yang is mercury, akin to lead containing silver.
Thus, the *Cantong Qi* establishes its foundation by transforming from *Kun* into yang. Therefore, the *Fu* hexagram—*Kun* above and *Zhen* below—illuminates the initial nurturing of the *Yellow Sprout* in its nascent state, the gradual process of transformation.

After the initial day, from the *zi* hour to the fifth day (sixty hours) constitutes one *hou* (phase). Three *hou* make one *qi* cycle for firing. When firing, one must inhale through the nose, hold the breath, sit upright, and direct the heart-fire upward. The fire ascends to the crown and descends to the *dantian*, circulating eight hundred ten *zhang* day and night.
Thus, a *chi* is divided into *cun*. If one knows the *cun*, then guards the *fen* and *liang*, harmonizing the hundred *ke*. Hence, observing the Dao of Heaven lies within the palm.

For all people, each breath moves the pulse six *cun*; four breaths make two *chi* and four *cun* (one *dao*); twenty-four *chi* make one *gui*; two hundred forty *chi* make one *zhu*; two thousand four hundred *chi* make one tael.
Moreover, one *jin* is sixteen taels, totaling three hundred eighty-four *zhu*—how does this differ from the tight reckoning of yin and yang, corresponding to the three hundred sixty days and twenty-four *qi* of a year?
Thus, the half in the *Yi* aligns with the counting of stalks, while in humans, it aligns with the counting of breaths.

When refining the medicine, change the crucible at each stage, gradually increasing the fire to nine stages—no further addition is needed. Gradually, with the fire, add the *qi* of the *Yellow Sprout* and *White Snow*, rotating them into the crucible to refine the Golden Elixir.
When the elixir is refined for nine months, the crucible is changed—this is called the *Nine-Turn Golden Elixir*.

**Martial Fire for Sixty-Four Hours, Middle Fire Timing**
Though lead and mercury may congeal, they cannot yet be subdued. One must rely on the power of fire to refine and guard the original essence, establishing the foundation of life.
In the *Xishan Huizhen Ji*, the method of firing between the hours of *zi* and *wu* causes the kidney-*qi* to ascend and the heart-fluid to descend. On the day of ingesting the elixir, the fire should be applied during the hours of *zi*, *wu*, *yin*, and *shen*.
At *zi*, apply the martial fire with one hundred sixty-one cycles of withdrawal and addition.
At *yin*, apply the civil fire with one hundred eight breaths.
At *wu* and *ji*, apply the fire for sixty-four cycles.
At *jia* and *bing*, apply the fire for seventy-two cycles.
For the intermediate hours of *mao* and *you*, use the *yin* and *shen* methods.
Men are born in *bingyin*; women in *renshen*. When ingesting the elixir, perform the *ji* fire. Visualize the spirit while sitting upright, embracing the external kidneys, and eliminating all thoughts. Embrace the origin and guard the One.
Then, regulate the breath to seventy-two counts. From this point, one must not indulge in joy, anger, or impatience, lest the elixir flee—this is no small matter.

**Practice of Water**

Hold the crucible within the embrace, yet the spirit does not commune with it—close the breath for seventy-two counts. When passions surge and thoughts scatter, grasp firmly and never falter. Carefully gather martial might, arrayed yet not engaged in battle. At the time of refinement and union, one must practice the *zi* and *wu* methods.

The Nine Crucibles and Five-Word Formula: *Store, Contract, Inhale, Close, Exhale*—also called the Five Seals Method.

**The Revealed Fire Mechanism of the Accommodating Perfected One**

When I first entered the Dao, I heard the immortal formula: *"The secret of immortality is easy to conceal but hard to reveal; the sages transmit the medicine but not the fire."* The medicine may be known, but the fire cannot be heard.

Thereafter, seeking teachers and visiting friends, I came to recognize the South *Li* and North *Kan*, the East Wood and West Metal, the ascent and descent of Dragon and Tiger, the *hun* and *po* of Sun and Moon. As for the crucible, the medicine, the unimpeded Three Passes, and the principle of *"following death and reversing life,"* only the fire timing remained unclear, and the elixir could not form. Having perused thousands of classics and myriad treatises, I probed their depths, yet wisdom could not fathom them—nothing but self-realization would suffice.

Moreover, when true immortals speak of fire timing at its subtlest, they all say it must be transmitted orally by a perfected one. No student of the Dao has not, for this reason, faltered and abandoned the path midway—their number is as countless as ox hairs.

Reflecting on my good fortune to have encountered this supreme opportunity, I realized that without the fire timing formula, I too would have joined their ranks. Thus, day and night, I forgot meals and sleep, exhaustively studying all the immortal classics and secret texts I had acquired. Though I felt I had gained some insight, doubt still lingered.

After several years of diligent effort, I suddenly met a perfected one who transmitted this wondrous formula. Upon hearing my teacher’s words, I understood: *"After receiving my master’s instructions, I studied the immortal classics and found not a single discrepancy. Only then did I grasp the meaning of the saying: 'Seeking the text will never hit the mark; the meaning emerges from within the text. Without a true teacher, the classics become empty words.' Was this not spoken in earnest?"*

Having received my teacher’s instructions, I immediately set to practice. When the *yang* nine cycles completed the celestial revolution, the Great Elixir was achieved—how marvelous!

The immortal classics’ saying—*"The secret is easy to conceal but hard to reveal; the medicine is transmitted, but not the fire"*—exists precisely because if the ignorant or base were to easily learn it, they might trifle with the celestial mechanism and grow careless. It also prevents those devoted to the Dao from fixating on the elixir classics, for without encountering a perfected one, the fire timing remains obscure. Thus, the sages had no choice but to employ the imagery of the *Yi*, likening it to the waxing and waning of the Sun and Moon, the ascent and descent of *yin* and *yang*, using these as the framework for withdrawal and addition.

The essentials of elixir refinement lie in true Lead and true Mercury as the foundation, with fire timing as the root. At the outset of Daoist practice, essence, *qi*, and spirit are the foundation, while fire timing is secondary.

The classics say: *"Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; Man attains the One and becomes numinous."* Of man’s numinosity, nothing is more numinous than the spirit; of his treasures, nothing is more precious than *qi*; of his affections, nothing is more cherished than essence.

Man’s eyes and ears reside below the Kunlun, serving as the gates of the spirit; the mouth and nose are the portals of *qi*; the *weilu* is the path of essence. Speaking of the spirit, it possesses *yin* and *yang*; discussing *qi*, it has purity and turbidity; examining essence, it flows both reversely and sequentially. The wondrous workings of the celestial mechanism are all concealed herein. Thus, the sage must first enter stillness, empty the spirit, refine the *qi*, reverse the essence, and congeal them within the Yellow Chamber. Unlock the Golden Lock, penetrate the Jade Gate, turn the celestial pivot—then silver waves surge to the heavens, and golden essence flies to the crown.

Thereafter, one must move the celestial tally, emulate the Sun and Moon’s cycles, align with the shifting of the five phases’ mutual generation and conquest, and never err in withdrawal and addition—then the hexagrams become mere tools.

Regarding fire: the body has the *zhou tian* fire, the boundless fire, the *fanshen samadhi* fire, and the *kalpa*-destroying fire that vanquishes the *yin* spirit-turtle. In the alchemical process of forging the tally and moving the fire, there are civil and martial fires, *yin* and *yang* fires. The tallies include celestial, terrestrial, solar, lunar, *yang*, and *yin* tallies. The civil and martial tally-fires are the fires of reversing the Three Passes, advancing and retreating, withdrawing and adding to congeal the elixir.

The *kalpa*-destroying fire that vanquishes the *yin* spirit-turtle is the fire of *yin-yang* intercourse, penetrating the Three Passes. If it flows downward through the *weilu*, it gives birth to a human. The classics say: *"Following the flow creates man; reversing it achieves ascension."*

Nurture the *yin* turtle with civil fire; tightly guard the Mysterious Pass with martial fire. Harmonize with the celestial tally’s movement of Sun and Moon. When male and female spirits unite, the *kalpa* fire erupts. Whoever comprehends this formula has more than enough mastery of fire timing.

In detail, the essentials of tally and fire: day and night, two hexagrams are practiced, mutually employing *Qian* and *Kun*’s upper and lower exchanges—this is the language of tally usage. Fire is born of *Zhen* and *Xun*, the parents of the returned elixir. Advancing is the *po* giving birth to the *hun*, with fire and wood in action; retreating is the *hun* giving birth to the *po*, with metal and water in command.

Ahead lies the white Sun’s *yang* tally; behind, the black Moon’s *yin* image. Shelter the body, connect the *qi*, employ the Three Origins’ reverse and forward withdrawal and addition. The four seasons reside in the day and night’s two hexagrams; the twelve lines correspond to the *zhou tian*’s numbers, compressing the three hundred sixty days of creation. How could the ignorant and benighted dare to idly speculate?

The true immortals say: *"The year is an image, the month is an image, the day and hour are real."* The formula states: *"Use the hexagrams without using them; one must act within the hexagrams. If fixated on using them, their use becomes incorrect."*

Examining this formula, do the true immortals truly conceal anything? Having thus illuminated the celestial mechanism, I wished to transmit it to later students and respectfully presented this celestial secret to my teacher. My teacher nodded in approval, saying, *"You have indeed attained this accommodation."* Thus, it was titled *The Revealed Fire Mechanism of the Accommodating Perfected One*.

**Eulogy:**
Six hundred chapters on fire,
Hidden depths, principles hard to discern.
From former sages to later sages,
Who would dare speak plainly of the truth?

The Perfected One’s great expedient method
Has expounded the true message in full.
This alone is the supreme mechanism—
Why trouble oneself with further seeking?

The Fire Timing Formula states: A year has twelve months. Excluding the two months of the third and eighth, and the two months of the fourth and tenth (when fire is not applied), there remain ten months. Each day, two hexagrams are practiced, so one month practices sixty hexagrams. Over ten months, six hundred cycles are completed, and the fire is applied six hundred times. The fire congeals and nurtures the returning elixir, then one circulates the fire within one’s own breath.

There is also the fire of the nine transformations of elixir refinement, which requires the union of true yin and true yang for the firing process. For the congealing, nurturing, and returning of the elixir, and the cessation of fire, each day between the hour of *zi* (after midnight) and before the hour of *wu* (noon), one practices the hexagrams *Fu* (Return) and *Gou* (Encounter), circulating the fire within one’s own breath. After obtaining the seed, though the elixir has not yet formed, one may proceed with the cessation of fire to allow the elixir to congeal. If the seed has not been obtained, efforts are in vain.

For the movement of talismans and the application of fire: after *zi* and before *wu*, from the first quarter of *zi* to the fourth quarter of *zi*, and from the first quarter of *wu* to the fourth quarter of *wu*. One sits upright, concentrating the spirit, each hand forming the *zi* mudra. Thoughts are stilled, the primordial is embraced, and the One is guarded. The breath is held, the external kidneys are gathered, and the perineum is contracted. The breath is counted to seventy-two, then the back is arched and the neck extended, awaiting the qi to rise naturally from the *weilu* (coccyx) to the *jiaji* (between the shoulder blades), and to the point below the *Caoxi* (the third vertebra from the bottom). The head is turned to the left, and the shoulders are gently shaken. Next, the right hand’s middle finger, without releasing the mudra, presses the right nostril. One inhales a breath of qi, then immediately uses the middle fingers of both hands to seal the ears, again without releasing the mudra, and tightly closes the "marketplace" (mouth). If the qi surges past the *Caoxi* and rises to the brain, turning to the forehead, then descends from between the eyebrows, a slight sweat appears at the midpoint, and the breath responds. When the mouth tastes sweet, the tongue tip presses the upper palate, awaiting the fullness of saliva, which is then slowly swallowed. One visualizes it descending from the lungs into the elixir field. After a brief pause to steady the qi, the method is repeated. If the breath cannot be held, one inhales through the nose, and all is naturally settled.

After *zi*, one practices for half an hour—when yin is at its extreme and yang begins to arise. Before *wu*, one practices for half an hour—when yang is at its extreme and yin begins to arise. The immortal classics say: *"Once* Fu *and* Gou *are mastered in application, who can say the golden elixir will not succeed?"* After *zi* is the hexagram *Fu* (Return), and after *wu* is the hexagram *Gou* (Encounter). This is also the method of returning essence to replenish the brain, striking through the three barriers, and constantly causing the qi to surge. When the joints are naturally unobstructed, essence is full, and the valley spirit is preserved.

For the fire of the nine transformations of elixir refinement, true yin and true yang generate the spirit’s creative transformation. Aligned with the great yin, the fire circulates once a month. Every five days, metal is born within water—first sinking and turbid, then after three days, floating and clear. One may proceed at the hours of *xu* and *hai*, with the crucible held in the embrace. The spirit does not engage in intercourse. One sits in perfect stillness, embracing the primordial and guarding the One. The back is arched, the neck extended, the ten fingers hooked, forming the two *zi* mudras. The external kidneys are gathered, the breath is held in a pattern of nine shallow and one deep, the perineum is contracted, and the count proceeds to seventy-two. After a brief pause, the method is repeated, without fixed repetitions—sometimes three, five, or seven cycles, each cycle counting seventy-two. One also directs the qi to surge from the *jiaji* upward through the three barriers to the crown, then downward. When the great yin’s passion is aroused and the tongue turns cold, one ceases. After a month, within three days, one practices at the hours of *xu* and *hai*. All depends on precise control—no missteps are allowed. One cautiously accumulates power: every three cycles constitute the lesser yang civil fire, while seven cycles constitute the martial fire for refinement.

The hexagrams *Qian* (Heaven) and *Kun* (Earth) converge between *xu* and *hai*. The sun and moon unite in conjunction, yin and yang intertwine in encounter. Thus, all things perceive qi at *hai*, making it the proper time for practice. Refining the elixir for nine months, practicing nine times, constitutes the nine transformations. Hence it is said: *"When the golden elixir is refined through nine transformations, it becomes as large as a gold pellet, its color like a red tangerine, enduring as long as heaven and earth."* Once the elixir is matured, fire need not be applied further. Thus it is said: *"The fire timing of a full year has been completed."*

Here ends the Perfected One’s secret transmission of the fire timing method.
