**Preface to the *Disquisition on Resolving Doubts and Guiding the Lost***

Master Shenfeng Xiaoyao presented two profound treatises, entitled *Disquisition on Resolving Doubts and Guiding the Lost*. In them, his pure discourse flows freely from the heart, and abstruse mysteries are expounded through brush and ink—here, the cultivation of his entire life is revealed. By the good fortune of a single reading, I was left standing alone in the thoroughfare, so utterly absorbed that I forgot the very existence of my limbs. Thus may it serve as a ladder and ferry for later learners to scale the walls and moats of the Mysterious Gate.

Respectfully inscribed by Liu Daozhen of Runan, Master of Double Mystery, on the first day of the second lunar month in the *wuxu* year of the Dade era.

The fire passes from prior flame to later flame; though the kindling differs, the blaze is the same. The sagely successors of today follow the ancient sages; though the times change, the Dao remains one. Thus it is fitting that since the days of Ma, Tan, Liu, and Qiu, true persons who propagate the subtle wind and spread the wondrous transformation have emerged in unbroken succession.

Master Shenfeng Xiaoyao, the Perfected Lord Niu, has newly produced two volumes of extraordinary discourse, titled *Disquisition on Resolving Doubts and Guiding the Lost*. He entrusted me with composing an introductory text, and upon reading it once, I forgot both self and world, as if riding a pure breeze through the azure vault. In guiding others, his method is measured and orderly, never disordered, dissolving the confusions of the mind and bringing clarity. In advancing others, a single utterance of his solemn words sets them forth on a boundless journey, never to linger.

Its words are concise, its principles subtle; its instruction profound, its intent earnest—this may truly be called the transmission of the flame and the succession of the sagely. Fearing that these subtle teachings might fade into obscurity, his disciples have gathered and recorded them to aid those who come after. Such is the magnanimity of a master’s Way, and this too may be called the depth of devoted care.

Written on the third day before the Mid-Autumn Festival in the third year of the Dade era by Wang Daoheng, the Recluse of Serene Emptiness.

The Master of Carefree Wandering, in leisurely seclusion within his quiet chamber, sat alone by the window, leaning against his desk in forgetfulness. Just then, Wu Zhenzi Li Zhiheng rose from his seat, respectfully stood, and with paper in hand, bowed and said: "Dare I ask of the wondrous principles of the Perfect Realization, the subtleties of the supreme Dao, the meaning of nature and destiny, and the sequence of cultivation? I wish for the Master to expound and resolve these doubts."

The Master of Carefree Wandering replied: "The supreme Dao is subtle indeed—formless and nameless, difficult to expound, difficult to speak of, and not something that can be grasped through acceptance or rejection. Thus the mind is confounded and cannot know it; the mouth opens yet cannot express it. It lies in the empty treasury of the self to be realized. Yet as you persist in inquiry and your resolve grows ever more sincere, I cannot but respond to your request."

Thereupon, he set forth this discourse, titled *Disquisition on Resolving Doubts and Guiding the Lost*, in the hope that it might serve as a gradual awakening for beginners.

Composed on the Lantern Festival of the second year of the Yuanzhen era.

*Disquisition on Resolving Doubts and Guiding the Lost*

*Resolving Doubts*

Should one ask, "What is *quanzhen* (Perfect Realization)?" I would reply: It is that which precedes the arising of even a single thought within you. Before a single thought stirs, it is equal to the Great Void—seen yet without color, heard yet without sound, grasped yet without form. Above, it has no covering; below, no base; at its sides, no gate; at its center, no substance. Vast, it has no exterior; minute, it has no interior. Dim and unfathomable, elusive and obscure, it is not a thing to be embodied, yet in function it is never absent. Concealing the boundless, it harbors the subtlest in abundance. Still and unmoving, it responds when stimulated and pervades all. It embraces the ten thousand images yet clings not to a single thread. I know not its name, so I style it *quanzhen*. The Buddhist teachings call it *perfect enlightenment* or *perfect emptiness*; the Most High speaks of it as *the undifferentiated* or *perfect penetration*. Thus the *Nanhua Sutra* says: "That which has never yet given rise to things—this is the ultimate, the exhaustive, beyond which nothing can be added." This is what is meant.

Should one ask, "What are *mind* and *nature*?" I would reply: The relationship of mind and nature is like that of waves and water. Water is fundamentally pure, but when stirred by sensation, waves arise and wind-driven waves muddy it so that it cannot reflect principles. When the wind and waves subside, the water clears and the waves cease. Thus, water is waves, and waves are water. By this analogy, mind is the function of nature, and nature is the substance of mind. When both substance and function are forgotten, there is only *quanzhen*.

Should one ask, "What are *nature* and *life*?" I would reply: The principle of nature and life is but another name for the interplay of *yin-yang* and *spirit-qi*. The terms *spirit* and *qi* are invoked endlessly, so let me briefly outline their general meaning. They may be called *movement and stillness*, *dragon and tiger*, *water and fire*, *Kan and Li*, *east and west*, *south and north*, *spring and autumn*, *warmth and coolness*, *winter and summer*, *cold and heat*, *adversity and prosperity*, *rise and fall*, *ascent and descent*, *coming and going*, *being and non-being*, *void and full*, *above and below*, *floating and sinking*, *high and low*, *deep and shallow*, *metal and wood*, *firm and yielding*, *heaven and earth*, *sun and moon*, *Zhen and Dui*, *dusk and dawn*, *husband and wife*, *infant and maiden*, *Golden Elder and Yellow Dame*, *crimson snow and dark frost*, *purple sprout and red powder*, *true lead and true mercury*. Other names and designations are innumerable, and all such forms and appearances must not be clung to—they are but *spirit* and *qi* in sum. To fully nurture spirit and cultivate qi, one must clarify substance and function, host and guest, banish all entanglements, remain unstained by even a speck of dust, and maintain purity within and without. Through long and sincere practice, qi will coalesce and spirit congeal, nature will settle and life abide. When nature and life are both preserved, qi and spirit become one, and that oneness merges with the Dao. Then the work of cultivation is complete.

Should one ask, "What are *substance and function, host and guest*?" I would reply: If one seeks to cultivate the Real, one must first understand what is meant by *substance and function, host and guest*. Without clarity on substance and function, the passions and desires cannot be dispelled. Without discerning yin-yang and the roles of host and guest, one cannot unite with the supreme spirit of emptiness and non-being. What, then, are *substance and function*? Emptiness and stillness are the substance; awareness and illumination are the function. When substance and function are both complete, they merge with the origin of the Dao. And what are *host and guest*? The preceding thought is the guest; the succeeding thought is the host. When a thought arises, do not cling to it, for it has no root or origin. Thus Master Dongming said: "When a thought arises, awaken and let it rest." This single phrase encompasses both substance and function, host and guest. What does it mean to *encompass* them? The arising thought is the guest; awareness is the host. The host’s rectitude is the function; rest is the substance. Thus, substance is function, and function is substance. When both substance and function dissolve, there is only *quanzhen*.

Should one ask, "Many speak of *transmitting the foundation of life*—what does this mean?" I would reply: *Life* is qi; *foundation* is origin. The origin of the single qi is the Dao. The Dao is formless and nameless, not something that can be grasped through acceptance or rejection. If it cannot be accepted or rejected, how can it be transmitted? Thus Master Guanyin said: "The sage cannot go beyond the Dao to reveal it to others." And Master Liezi said: "That which is so without knowing why it is so is called *life*." This is what is meant.

Should one ask, "The patriarchs speak of *where the five phases do not reach, before the single qi arises*—what does this mean?" I would reply: The *five phases* are our five senses; the *single qi* is but a single thought within you. Where the five senses do not stir and before a single thought arises—that is the same as the earlier meaning of *that which has never yet given rise to things*. Since it has never yet given rise to things, it is forcibly named the Dao.

Should one ask, "If *that which has never yet given rise to things* is called the Dao, then once things exist, is the Dao present within them?" I would reply: Things arise from the Dao, so things *are* the Dao—just as mind arises from nature, so mind *is* nature. Or as waves arise from water, so waves *are* water. Thus Master Dongming said: "The master transmits secret words, the mind awakens; the family style beyond things is cultivated within things." And Master Guanyin said: "The principles of heaven and earth are contained within a single thing." And again: "Within a single thing, one may know heaven and exhaust spirit, align with life and enter the mysterious." If this is so for things, how could it not be so for humans? The Most High also said: "There is a thing, undifferentiated, born before heaven and earth. Silent and empty, it stands alone and does not change; it circulates without cease and may be called the Mother of all under heaven. I know not its name, so I style it the Dao." This is precisely what is meant.

Someone asked: "Qinghe the Perfected once said: 'To stop thoughts and subdue the mind—yet the more you subdue, the more thoughts arise; if you neither subdue nor stop, you drift with the waves and follow the current.' What does this mean?"

I replied: "For those who first embark on the Dao, they must first awaken to their true mind. This true mind is originally without a single thing, equal to the great emptiness, inherently pure. Within this purity, if a single thought suddenly arises, one must instantly turn the light inward, return to the root and revert to the origin—then clarity and purity will naturally abide. Thus the scripture says: 'When the mind is settled, the spirit becomes clear of itself; naturally, the six desires do not arise, and the three poisons vanish.' Once the three poisons are extinguished, one merges with the Dao. If one does not understand this principle, when a thought arises, one generates another thought to suppress it; if suppression fails, one uses the mind to dispel it. Yet suppression and dispelling never cease, and one becomes further entangled. If one does not suppress or dispel, indulging in delusion, one drifts ever further from alignment. Thus, if one constantly knows and constantly awakens, one grasps at oneself; if one neither knows nor awakens, one slips into another shell—just like being reborn. Only when one’s karmic retribution is exhausted does one return, weary as a spent horse and exhausted traveler, yet still failing to awaken. Is this not lamentable?"

Someone asked: "How can one attain perfect communion with the myriad dharmas?"

I replied: "Those who cultivate the Dao must first clarify the mind and awaken to their nature, then sever all doubts before they can nurture the Dao. The mind is the source of the myriad dharmas, and nature is the essence of all scriptures. Thus, when the mind arises, the myriad dharmas arise; when the mind ceases, the myriad dharmas cease. If not a single thought arises, one transcends birth and death. In this state of thoughtlessness, one sees one’s original face. With long and deep cultivation, roundness, luminosity, and vastness grow—then no dharma is unpenetrated, no scripture is ungrasped. This is called the perfection of the Dharma-eye. All the vast scriptures of the canon merely expound these principles. What the sages and worthies of past and present attained, they attained this alone. What the past masters and perfected ones taught, they taught this alone. What the Five Patriarchs and Seven Perfected Ones realized, they realized this alone. I exhort fellow seekers: if you can awaken to this, cast aside all doubt—this is the pivotal mechanism of Dao-cultivation, the secret essence of immortal practice."

Someone asked: "Long ago, Master Shen’guang sought the method of pacifying the mind before Bodhidharma. The Patriarch replied: 'Bring me your mind, and I will pacify it for you.' After a long pause, Shen’guang said: 'I have searched for my mind but cannot find it.' The Patriarch said: 'I have already pacified it for you.' At these words, Shen’guang instantly awakened and severed all doubt. What is the principle here?"

I replied: "The mind is originally no-mind; it appears only when stimulated by things. Thus, Master Ziyang said: 'When you see a thing, you see the mind; without things, the mind is not seen. Throughout the ten directions, in all that is open or obstructed, the true mind pervades everywhere.' The true mind has no form—it is like a precious mirror holding radiance: when an object comes, it reflects the object; when a person comes, it reflects the person. When both person and object vanish, the mirror becomes perfectly luminous and transparent. Thus, when one searches for the mind, nothing is found. As Master Guanyin said: 'The power of ordinary people lies in evil; the power of the worthy lies in goodness; the power of the sage lies in having nothing to attain.' Only those who attain nothing thereby attain the Dao. If one has awakened to the Dao, how could doubt not be severed?"

Someone asked: "Master Changchun said: 'Without the fortune of immortals, it is difficult to fathom the mechanism of creation.' What is the mechanism of creation?"

I replied: "Creation is another name for the alternation of yin and yang, blockage and openness. The pivotal mechanism of yin and yang is another designation for the Dao. Blockage means obstruction; openness means flow. Thus, the *Book of Transformations* says: 'Therefore, the ancient sages thoroughly investigated the ends of obstruction and flow and grasped the source of creation.' This source of creation is none other than the wondrous Dao. Since this is the principle, without the fortune of immortals, how could one fathom the Dao?"

Someone asked: "Though the Dao is without direction, learning it follows an order. What is this order?"

I replied: "For those who first embark on the Dao, they must first cast aside worldly entanglements, eliminate love and desire, seek out enlightened teachers, and delve deeply into the wondrous principles. Once the wondrous principles are thoroughly understood, one must further establish firm resolve. Next, one must cultivate the three practices of precepts, concentration, and wisdom—this is the essential sequence of progress. Precepts are the ladder to heaven, the boat that crosses the sea of suffering, the foundation of the Dao-path, and the gradual road to immortal practice. Without precepts, one cannot enter the gate of concentration; without entering the gate of concentration, one cannot give rise to wisdom. Thus, *Zhuangzi* says: 'When the chamber is empty, brightness arises; auspiciousness abides where it abides.' And again: 'When the dwelling is at peace and settled, celestial radiance is emitted.' When celestial radiance is emitted, one shares the same source as the Dao. Sharing the same source as the Dao, even spirits and gods cannot fathom one; yin and yang cannot mold one. One whom molding cannot reach—how perfect the person! How perfect the person!"

Someone asked: "Those who leave home to cultivate the Dao speak of the Dao as having no cultivation. What does this mean?"

I replied: "Though the Dao itself requires no cultivation, the mind must be refined. The Dao within a person is like gold within ore. The ore contains gold, but if it is not refined, it remains stone; when the stone is refined away, it becomes gold. Once it is gold, it is no longer ore. The person contains the Dao, but if it is not refined, one remains ordinary; when the ordinary mind is refined away, one becomes an immortal. Once one is an immortal, one is no longer ordinary. If it is already gold, no further forging is needed; once the immortal Dao is attained, what further cultivation is required?"

Someone asked: "Master Danyang said: 'Quickly cast me into the mountains and lay me flat; urgently break open the dragon-tiger cave.' What does this mean?"

I replied: "If 'me' is cast into the mountains and laid flat, the dragon-tiger cave naturally opens. What does this mean? 'Me' refers to the mind..."

The person is the realm. When both mind and realm are forgotten, then the person and the self, the mountain, are overturned. The dragon and tiger are the mind of arising and ceasing in movement and stillness. The mind of arising and ceasing begins in the nature of true emptiness. The nature of true emptiness is vast, empty, and still—hence it is called the "cave." It is also called the "palace of emptiness." The Most High spoke of it as the "gate of all wonders," and also as the "gate of the mysterious female." *Zhuangzi* calls it the "celestial palace"—this is the meaning of the dragon-tiger cave. "Breaking it open" describes the state of having no obstructions. Once there are no obstructions, the Dao is contained therein.

Someone asked: "What is the Golden Elixir?"
I replied: "The 'gold' is like something that has undergone forging—truly firm, hard, sharp, clear, and pure. The 'elixir' is like something perfectly round and luminous, its axis responding to change, revolving endlessly from beginning to end without limit. The meaning of the elixir is that if one ingests it, one will surely transcend the illness of life and death. Thus, it is called the Golden Elixir."

Someone asked: "At the beginning of cultivation, one must reduce meals, eliminate desires, and combat sleep. Yet it is also said: 'When hungry, eat; when tired, sleep.' What is the principle here?"
I replied: "The principle has two explanations."

First, for the beginner entering the Dao, familiar realms are hard to forget, and the mind’s horse and monkey stir easily—thus, clothing, food, sleep, and desires cannot be as one wishes. The ancients said: *"To learn the Dao, do not expect things to go as you wish; if things go as you wish, do not expect to learn the Dao."* They also said: *"Warmth and fullness breed lust; hunger and cold preserve naturalness."* If the dusty mind is utterly extinguished and the Dao-eye suddenly opens, then one acts without acting, yet nothing is left undone. When one acts without acting yet nothing is left undone, how could eating, sleeping, and rest be impediments?

Someone asked: *"Master Li Feng said: 'Having form is illness; lacking form is illness. Neither having nor lacking—where then to settle body and life?' What is the principle here?"*
I replied: *"Having form is attachment to appearances; lacking form is fixation on empty nothingness. Neither having nor lacking—this falls into reckless agitation."*
He asked: *"How then to transcend these three layers of obstruction?"*
I replied: *"Neither side is established; the Middle Way is also not a refuge. Turn your gaze beyond the Two Vehicles—spiritual light shines upon the vast cold moon."*

**Guiding the Lost**
Master Guangmo was at leisure in his chamber, sitting in tranquil repose, his mind serene and carefree, at ease and content, following nature’s course in carefree wandering, freely indulging in the realm of self-attainment. At that moment, Zhaoranzi rose from his seat, bowed respectfully, and stood before him, saying: *"Your disciple has long served you, yet has not received the transmission of the wondrous Dao. Today, in this moment of leisure, I dare ask: what is the Dao like?"*

Master Guangmo shifted closer, remained silent for a long while, then changed his expression and, looking up to the sky, laughed: *"What Dao is there to transmit?"*
Zhaoranzi said: *"Master, do not delay—your disciple earnestly wishes to hear it."*
Master Guangmo said: *"The Dao originally has no questions; questions also have no answers. As soon as words are uttered, one falls into secondary meaning. Thus it is said: 'The Dao cannot be transmitted; to transmit it is not the Dao.' It cannot be seen, cannot be heard, cannot be grasped, cannot be known through thought. Gazing ahead, it is suddenly behind—this is called the form of the formless, the image of the imageless, what is called 'dim and indistinct.' Dim and indistinct, yet within it there is something; deep and obscure, yet within it there is essence. Its essence is utterly true, and within it there is reliability. From ancient times to the present, it stands alone and does not change, circulating without cease—it may be called the Mother of all under heaven. I do not know its name, so I style it the Dao. Thus, the mind is confounded and cannot know it; the mouth is at a loss and cannot describe it. It resides in the spirit’s abode—one must awaken to it oneself."*

Zhaoranzi said: *"If the Dao cannot be transmitted, then what do Daoist patriarchs pass down through successive generations, and what do masters and disciples transmit to one another?"*
He replied: *"They transmit the mysterious teaching, passing down the wondrous Dharma."*
Zhaoranzi asked: *"Does the mysterious teaching and wondrous Dharma also contain the Dao?"*
He replied: *"It is neither identical nor separate—it is like the fish-trap and rabbit-snare. The trap is for catching fish; once the fish is caught, the trap is forgotten. The snare is for catching rabbits; once the rabbit is caught, the snare is forgotten. Words are for conveying meaning; once the meaning is grasped, the words are forgotten. How can one speak with those who have forgotten words? Those who have forgotten words speak without speaking, speaking all day yet never having spoken; they act without acting, acting all day yet never having acted. Thus it is said: 'Without speaking, nothing is left unspoken; without acting, nothing is left undone.'"*

Zhaoranzi said: *"Before catching the fish or rabbit, one must use the trap and snare. Before grasping the meaning, one must rely on verbal teachings. I only hope the Master, in his compassion, will offer a few words to lift the veil from my understanding."* Thereupon, he bowed again, prostrating himself and standing with bent back.

Master Guangmo said: *"Sit. I will tell you. The Dao has no before or after, yet teaching has sudden and gradual approaches. Human natures differ in sharpness and dullness, and awakening varies in depth. Endowed with different qi, the wise and foolish differ—yet tracing back to the source, all begin with the Dao. Thus it is said: 'Different paths lead to the same destination.' Those who attain sudden awakening do not rely on cultivation—they directly transcend to the other shore and immediately realize non-arising. Thereafter, the eye is like the ear, the ear like the nose, the nose like the mouth—all are the same. The mind congeals, the form dissolves, bones and flesh completely merge. They can reverse mountains and rivers, move cities and towns, tread upon water and fire, enter metal and stone, move freely without obstruction, and transform without limit.*

*Those who attain gradual awakening must first clarify the mind and awaken to their nature, and only then nurture their life. Next, they must accumulate merit, amass practice, and seek it through years and months. Over long years and many months, in haste or turmoil, in movement or stillness, in sitting or lying down, they must preserve it continuously, as if it were always present yet not forced. Without interruption, their cultivation bears fruit. Their form becomes like withered wood, their mind like cold ashes. In the profound depths, they alone perceive the dawn; in the dark obscurity, they alone hear the harmony. They attain unity of body and mind, mind and qi, qi and spirit, spirit and nothingness. They can hold heaven and earth in their palm, carry the sun and moon before their lapel, roll up and unfurl the eight directions, gather and disperse the three luminaries, enter existence and non-existence, control life and death at will—yin and yang cannot fathom them."*

Zhaoranzi said: *"I have respectfully heard the principle of sudden and gradual awakening. May I ask: what is the meaning of mind and nature? Your disciple is dull—may the Master explain it in detail."*
Master Guangmo said: *"Alas, how foolish you are in your difficulty to awaken! Consider this: when you ask me, it is the mind. When I answer you, it is also the mind. What difference is there between mind and mind?"*

And what need is there to ask? What need is there to explain? Your question and my answer—both belong to the deluded mind. When the deluded mind is extinguished, one does not know who or what remains. Thus it is said: *"It has never departed from our宗."* 宗 is nature. Nature is endowed by the Dao, and the Dao is endowed by spontaneity.

Zhaoranzi said: *"I have respectfully heard the meaning of mind and nature. May I ask: in the principle of nurturing life, should one act or refrain from acting? Which is better?"*
Master Guangmo answered: *"Refrain from acting—yet in refraining from acting, nothing is left undone. Thus it is said: 'Those who act fail; those who grasp lose.' Therefore the sage refrains from acting and so does not fail, refrains from grasping and so does not lose."*

Zhaoranzi said: *"If this is so, why did the past perfected masters speak of reducing meals, battling sleep, restraining the ape and seizing the horse, moderating flavors and guarding speech—as if these were acts?"*
Master Guangmo answered: *"The Dao is fundamentally non-action, yet the mind must be refined. Refinement is reduction—shedding old habits to renew one’s nature. Reduce and reduce again, until one reaches non-action, and in non-action, nothing is left undone. Thus it is said: 'Act through non-action, and nothing will be ungoverned.' Non-action is how one nurtures life."*

Zhaoranzi asked: *"What is life?"*
Master Guangmo answered: *"It is the primordial true qi. Thus it is said: 'What beings receive is called life; what heaven bestows is called nature; following nature is called the Dao.' It is also said: 'That which is so without knowing why is called life.' Is this not the same?"*

Zhaoranzi said: *"The ancients said, 'One who does not understand life cannot be a noble person.' Yet here it is said, 'That which is so without knowing why is called life.' Are these two statements not different?"*
Master Guangmo answered: *"The words differ, but the principle is the same. 'One who does not understand life cannot be a noble person' means one does not know how to preserve one’s allotted life. Those who covet beyond their portion and lose their root are not noble. For humans, essence is the root, life is the foundation, and nature is the宗. Life is qi; nature is spirit. Spirit, qi, and essence all originate from the One and are never separate. Those who separate them transgress their portion."*

Zhaoranzi asked: *"What does it mean to transgress one’s portion?"*
Master Guangmo answered: *"Human nature and allotment lack nothing and have no excess—they are originally complete. All methods of nurturing life are but last resorts. Such measures should be undertaken without attachment. Without attachment, one may nurture life. Those who do not understand this principle chase after deluded conditions, scheming and accumulating as if for eternity, indulging in excess and dissipation, drifting in the realm of fame and profit, never returning, never awakening—how can they be noble?"*

Zhaoranzi said: *"When essence, qi, and spirit are undivided, there is no question. But once divided, how can they be reunited?"*
Master Guangmo answered: *"Their division arises from the mind. Where the mind goes, qi follows; where qi goes, the body responds. Thus, when the mind is stirred by externals—grief brings tears, pungency brings mucus, dryness brings sweat, sourness brings saliva, and lust brings essence. If one can still the mind in the realm of utter emptiness and quiet the thoughts in the domain of non-action, then it remains unmoved. Though responsive, it does not stir—thus essence is preserved. Essence transforms into qi, qi into spirit, spirit into emptiness. Emptiness and reality interpenetrate—this is called Great Unity. In Great Unity, there is nothing to unite, yet nothing is not united."*

Zhaoranzi said: *"I have respectfully heard the principle of nurturing life. May I ask: what are the essentials of internal alchemy?"*
Master Guangmo said: *"The essential methods of internal alchemy are many, with distinctions between orthodoxy and heterodoxy, as well as differences in scale."*

Zhaoranzi asked: *"What is heterodoxy?"*
Master Guangmo answered: *"Some refine the five metals or eight minerals; some gather solar essence and lunar radiance; some swallow mist and ingest qi; some practice sexual arts to retain essence; some use water and fire to return to the origin; some exhale the old and inhale the new; some practice massage and breath-counting; some imitate the bear’s climb and the bird’s stretch; some shake the sinews and sway the marrow; some swallow saliva and absorb qi; some guard the lower dantian or the Hall of Light; some silently pay homage to the Celestial Emperor while circulating qi; some invert Kunlun or lie atop the Yellow River; some fly golden essence behind the elbow or engage in visualization; some fast to avoid grains; some ingest elixirs to prolong form. The so-called methods are countless—I cannot enumerate them all. These few examples are but minor heterodox practices. Alas! Many are misled by side doors and fail to awaken to the true Dao."*

Thus, those who study the Dao are as numerous as ox hairs, yet those who attain the Dao are as rare as unicorn horns.

One asks: Why are they so few?
One answers: It is because they do not encounter the true teacher’s secret transmission but are instead deluded by false masters, leading them to cling stubbornly to their errors without awakening.

Hence it is said: The deeply deluded never turn back in their lifetimes; the profoundly foolish never awaken in their lifetimes. As ice cannot be carved and the foolish cannot become wise, so it is indeed.

The *Hymn of the True Yang* states:
*"Three thousand six hundred gates of wondrous methods—
each learner clings to one as their root.
Pitiable are these scraps of immortal arts,
for none lie within the three thousand six hundred gates."*

It further says:
*"The immortals see you as too stubborn and dull,
leaving behind ten thousand volumes of alchemical scriptures.
Every line and chapter is but metaphor—
the true Dao was never bound to books."*

This is precisely what is meant.

Thereupon, Master Zhaoran bowed again, rose, and stood with hands reverently clasped.
He asked: What is the proper method of refining the elixir?

The master replied: The proper method of refining the elixir has three gates, divided into nine grades: three superior, three middle, and three inferior. The spirits, too, have three names: the Supreme is the spirit of emptiness and non-being; the Heaven and Earth are the spirits of yin and yang; and humans and creatures are the spirits of blood and flesh.

The immortals likewise have nine grades: the immortals of emptiness and non-being, celestial immortals, terrestrial immortals, divine immortals, ghost immortals, mountain immortals, water immortals, human immortals, and object immortals—these are the nine grades.

The immortals of emptiness and non-being cannot be discussed. Thus, celestial immortals do not depart from Heaven, terrestrial immortals do not depart from Earth, divine immortals do not depart from the divine, ghost immortals do not depart from ghosts, mountain immortals do not depart from mountains, water immortals do not depart from water, human immortals do not depart from humans, and object immortals do not depart from objects.

Tracing their origins, there was originally no division into three or nine. Yet because awakening varies in depth, endowment varies in purity, and effort varies in abundance, such differences arise.

One asks: What is the superior-grade elixir refinement?
One answers: The superior-grade refinement of the superior elixir uses the Great Void as the crucible, true emptiness as the cauldron, perfect clarity as the medicinal ingredients, celestial light as the firing process, deluded emotions as leakage, non-contention as safeguard, purity and stillness as bathing, non-action as external protection, vagueness and indistinctness as withdrawal and replenishment, and non-defilement as purification. It is attained in a single breath and completed within a hundred days.

One asks: What is the middle-grade elixir refinement?
One answers: The superior-grade refinement of the middle elixir uses Qian and Kun as the furnace, yin and yang as the cauldron, true lead and true mercury as the medicinal ingredients, pure yang as the firing process, desire and thoughts as leakage, non-delusion as safeguard, sobriety as bathing, gentleness and weakness as external protection, concentration and wisdom as withdrawal and replenishment, and forgetfulness of scheming as purification. It is attained within a hundred days and completed beyond three years.

One asks: What is the inferior-grade elixir refinement?
One answers: The superior-grade refinement of the inferior elixir uses the body as the furnace, the heart as the cauldron, spirit and qi as the medicinal ingredients, awareness and illumination as the firing process, pursuit of external realms as leakage, sleeplessness as safeguard, cleansing of thoughts as bathing, modesty and harmony as external protection, ascent and descent as withdrawal and replenishment, and purity and simplicity as purification. It is attained within three years and completed within nine.

As for the inferior-grade refinement of the inferior elixir, it also uses the body as the furnace, the five viscera and six bowels as the cauldron, essence and blood as the medicinal ingredients, qi circulation as the firing process, essence leakage as leakage, moderation in drink as safeguard, saliva rinsing as bathing, cultivation of goodness as external protection, daoyin as withdrawal and replenishment, and abstention from lust as purification. Yet after a full year, no achievement is made, and cultivation must span successive lifetimes. This can prolong life but cannot transcend the cycle of rebirth.

Yet compared to those who feign virtue, this still marks a distinction as vast as mud and sky.

Master Zhaoran said: "The principles of elixir refinement—I have reverently received your instruction. May I ask: as the *Qingjing Jing* states, 'Those who awaken to this may transmit the sagely Dao'—is this so?"

Thereupon, Master Guangmo set down his whisk, composed himself, and lay down. After a long while, he said: "Do you grasp it?"

At these words, Master Zhaoran experienced a great awakening. Leaping with joy, he smiled radiantly, then bowed three times, prostrating himself and standing respectfully beside him.

Master Guangmo rose with a frown and asked: "What principle have you seen that makes you bow thus?"

Master Zhaoran replied: "What principle could you, Master, possess?"

Master Guangmo said: "Just so, just so. Safeguard this well."

A verse says:
Originally there was no teaching, no transmission—
Only for learners clinging stubbornly to the snare.
Should you fathom its true meaning,
A cold pool’s autumn moon sinks deep into still waters.
