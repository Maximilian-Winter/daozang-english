### **On Daoist Breathing and Physical Exercises**
The limbs and joints fundamentally rely on movement for their function, while the meridians and *qi* of *ying* and *wei* depend on free circulation. Now, in seclusion with no laborious tasks, one must practice *daoyin* to achieve harmony and smoothness. The principle that "the door hinge does not rot" is indeed true.

The blood, *qi*, essence, and spirit of humans serve to nourish life and sustain destiny. The meridians conduct blood and *qi*. Thus, *ying-qi* circulates fluids, strengthens sinews and bones, and benefits the joints and diaphragm; *wei-qi* warms the muscles, fills the skin, nourishes the interstices, and governs opening and closing. Moreover, the floating *qi* that courses through the meridians is *wei-qi*, while the refined *qi* that flows within them is *ying-qi*. Yin and yang follow one another, interior and exterior interconnect, like a ring without end.

The head is the mansion of essence and clarity;
The back is the mansion of the chest;
The waist is the mansion of the kidneys;
The knees are the mansion of the sinews;
The marrow is the mansion of the bones.
Furthermore, all bones pertain to the eyes, all marrow to the brain, all sinews to the joints, all blood to the heart, and all *qi* to the lungs—this is the daily cycle of the four limbs and eight joints.

Thus, the five labors cause harm through prolonged stillness or motion. The *daoyin* of the Five Animals stirs the joints, yet the human body’s upper and lower parts support one another, and the *qi*’s source and flow ascend and descend in order. I have observed that many *daoyin* texts lack sequence, but the method I transmit here has a clear principle.

For those whose five bodily parts are balanced, follow the standard count. If one area suffers from imbalance or illness, increase the repetitions and apply force there.

Generally, *daoyin* should be practiced between the *chou* (1–3 a.m.) and *mao* (5–7 a.m.) hours, when the *qi* of heaven is clear and harmonious. First, loosen the hair and comb it thoroughly, reaching the crown 365 times. Let the hair hang loose behind, or loosely tie it into a topknot. Burn incense, face east, sit upright with hands clenched, close the eyes to visualize the spirit, and click the teeth 365 times. Then relax the body, regulate the breath, and proceed in order.

First, hold the breath. Interlace the fingers, turn the palms outward, and extend the arms fully, pushing forward for a long while. Then raise the hands, turn the palms upward, and stretch the arms fully. Lower the left hand and forcefully raise the right elbow, pressing the left elbow and arm against the back of the neck while the left hand pulls downward with force. Lean slightly left, open the right armpit, and strain the ribs. Repeat the same on the right side. Then lower the hands to hook the neck, raise both elbows, arch the chest, and tilt the head back, competing the strength of head and hands forward and backward. Next, lower the hands to hook the neck, swing the elbows, and twist the body left and right. Then rest the hands on the knees, exhale slightly to regulate the breath, and repeat the sequence three times.

Next, extend the left hand with palm up and fingers upright, bend the right hand, raise the elbow with palm up and fingers upright, and open the arms and chest as if drawing a bow. Turn the head to the left, applying force to the neck, chest, bosom, arms, and elbows. Repeat three times on each side.

Next, make fists with both hands, thrust the arms forward forcefully, then strain the elbows backward, contracting tightly with effort. Repeat three times forward and backward.

Next, swing the left fist backward with force three times, then downward three times. Repeat with the right.

Next, cross the arms before the chest, grasp the shoulders with the fingers, tilt the head back, arch the chest, and strain the abdomen and waist. Then lower the head, bend the waist, hunch the shoulders, and pull downward with force. Alternate lifting and lowering three times each.

Next, place the wrists beneath the armpits, press the elbows forward, lower the head, and strain the back. Then tilt the head back, strain the chest and bosom, and press the elbows backward. Repeat three times forward and backward.

Next, sit with knees bent, place both hands on the waist, and lean the body backward with force. Shake the body, then sit upright and relax. Repeat three times.

Next, cross the legs and sit. Place the left hand near the body to support the left side, turn the wrist outward with fingers pointing inward, and grasp the left knee with the right hand. Turn the head left, look upward, and strain both arms with force. Repeat three times on each side.

Next, straighten the knees and cross the legs. Interlace the fingers, turn the palms outward, and embrace the knees. Lower the head, strain the waist and back, and open the knees to press them with the arms. Then turn the palms inward, grasp the knees tightly, raise the body, tilt the face upward, stretch the throat and bosom, and apply force backward. Alternate lifting and lowering three times each.

Next, cross the legs and sit. From the knees, extend the legs outward, grasp the toes with the hands, hunch the shoulders, and pull upward with force. Strain the waist and abdomen forward, sway left and right, and when the breath is exhausted, relax. Repeat three times.

Next, grasp the left toes with the left hand, reaching the sole, and the toes with the wrist. Gradually extend the leg, then raise the heel. Place the right hand on the right knee, turn the head left and right, and compete the strength like a bird. Then bend the left leg, cradle the heel with both hands, and raise it high before lowering it. Press the knee with the left hand, grasp the foot with the right, press downward with the left hand, and pull upward with the right. Turn the head to the right rear and strain the shoulders. Repeat three times on each side.

Next, extend both legs fully, lie supine, and support the back with the hands reversed. Bend the right leg and thrust forward with force as if treading, three times on each side.

Then extend the right leg, bend the left leg, and place the left heel upon the right calf. Let the left knee hang downward until nearly touching, then alternate by extending the left and bending the right, three times on each side.

Next, lie supine and reverse the hands to support the back. Raise the left knee, drawing the heel close to the buttocks. Lift the right heel to hook the left knee, then gradually press downward until the left knee nearly touches the ground, three times on each side.

Then bend the left leg outward, grasp the left ankle with the left hand, and support the right knee with the right hand. Turn the head to the right, lower the left knee to nearly touch the ground, extend the foot outward, and pull inward with the hand, straining with force, three times on each side.

Next, spread the knees apart and bring the heels together. Grasp the soles of the feet with both hands, tilt the head back, and lift with all one’s strength. When the breath is exhausted, relax the body, repeating three times.

Then extend the legs and interlock the fingers to hook the insteps. Lie supine and pull backward with force, gradually raising the legs high. Strain the sinews and press the toes, three times on each side.

Next, extend both legs fully, keeping the toes upright. Grasp the toes with both hands, lift the head, and exert force, repeating three times.

The Daoist exercises complete, sit upright and relax the body. Rub the palms together until warm, then raise them to the forehead, passing upward twenty-seven times.

After rubbing the palms, wipe the eyes twenty-seven times. Then press the nose with the middle and ring fingers of both hands, moving up and down fourteen times. Interlace the index and middle fingers to lift the ears upward three to five times, then hook the ears with the tiger’s mouth and rotate the earlobes backward three to five times.

Rub the palms until hot, then wipe the face until it feels warm. Massage the neck, chest, and breasts several dozen times. Then massage the arms from the shoulders down to the backs of the hands, moving up and down several dozen times. Interlock the hands and twist them back and forth as if washing, exerting force several dozen times. Finally, massage and press the heart, abdomen, waist, and spleen until finished. Wait until the breath is regulated, then sit calmly and ingest qi according to the method.

The palm-rubbing, forehead-raising, and face-wiping should be done frequently for the best results. These are not limited to times of qi ingestion. The various Daoist exercises need not all be performed at once to avoid fatigue; do as is convenient. However, they should ultimately proceed from head to foot in sequence to ensure thorough circulation. They may also be done once every three to five days in full. There are also standing and reclining methods, which cannot all be described here; do as one sees fit.

**On Talismanic Water**

Talismanic script consists of cloud-seal characters, luminous and divine writing. Its strokes bear resemblance, thus divine qi resides within; its characters have origins, thus cinnabar is used in their application. Water is the essence of primordial qi, the moisture of latent yang, upon which all things with form depend. Thus, water is the mother of qi, and when water is pure, qi is clear. Qi is the root of form, and when qi is harmonious, the body is at peace. Though the body’s constructive and defensive energies have their own internal fluids, the viscera and bowels of the abdomen also rely on external nourishment. Water can unblock the stomach and intestines, replenish fluids and qi, and guide the efficacy of talismans to assist incantations and defenses. Here, I compile methods for talismanic water to prepare for use; one may follow them accordingly.

For the above talisman, face the monthly branch on a full moon day, burn incense, and write in cinnabar on paper. Hold the water vessel in the left hand and the talisman in the right. Use one *sheng* of water to swallow it, or more or less as desired. Well-flower water is best, though spring water will suffice; take it at dawn. Recite the incantation:

*"Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—the qi of the Five Stars, the essence of the Six Jia. The three true celestial foods, ever filling the turbid qi. Yellow Father and Red Child, guard the center without deviation."*

Recite this three times, all in one breath. Then knock the teeth three times, click the teeth three times, and spray the water with the talisman held in the mouth. Burn the talisman over the water and place the ashes into it, ensuring they do not scatter. Face north, bow twice, and ingest the water. Subsequent methods follow separate procedures, though they are variations of this one.

For the preceding talisman, on an *jiazi* day, write eight in cinnabar. On the full moon day, at dawn, take well-flower water. At sunrise, bow twice and declare: *"I request to ingest this talismanic script, wishing for divine qi to fill me."* Ingest two talismans, then ingest two more at midday and on the day of the ruling branch. For the five *jia* days, one may write and ingest more as needed.

The six yang and yin talismans of the Six Jia are written according to their respective day-stems and branches within the square. Yang talismans bear *jiazi* below, and yin talismans bear *yichou*. Here, *jiazi* and *yichou* are given as examples. On *bingyin*, *dingmao*, and other days, write according to the day’s stem and branch. Those who do not understand this principle should note the text: *"Write according to the respective stem and branch within the square."* This is akin to the Six Spirits’ master talisman, where the day’s stem is written within. Write yang talismans in red and yin talismans in black. One may also prepare talismans for an entire ten-day period in advance and ingest them at dawn. Each morning, face east, burn incense, hold the talisman in the left hand, and the water vessel in the right. Take well-flower water and ingest as much as desired. Recite the incantation:

*"True person so-and-so delights in the true Dao, ingesting the qi of central harmony. On *jiazi*, the Jade Maiden of Great Mystery assists. For a full ten-day period, recite this together. For other *jia* days, adjust accordingly. May the attendants of so-and-so’s traveling kitchen ensure no hunger or thirst."*

The original text also states: *"Whether the cinnabar is large or small, whether the person is many or few, all shall be sated."* Since this is for self-ingestion, such words are omitted. Alternatively, it may be said: *"Do not reduce the days."* The incantation may be recited at any time, day or night, to ensure satiety.

Upon completion, bow twice, place the talisman in the mouth, and swallow it with water.

During the *jiazi* ten-day period, the Jade Maiden of Great Harmony assists.
During the *jiaxu* ten-day period, the Yellow-Silk Jade Maiden Feilian attends.
During the *jiashen* ten-day period, the Great-Silk Jade Maiden Qiongshi attends.
During the *jiawu* ten-day period, the Crimson Palace Jade Maiden Yunling attends.
During the *jiachen* ten-day period, the Essence-Worship Jade Maiden Lingsu attends.
During the *jiayin* ten-day period, the Azure-Waisted Jade Maiden Huijing attends.

The two talismans above are to be cinnabar-inscribed on the full day and ingested.
Daoist Zhang Zideng ingested these.
The above talisman is to be cinnabar-inscribed on the full day and swallowed.
Daoist Chen Shuping ingested these and has not eaten for five years.
The above ingestion method involves cinnabar-inscribing on the full day and swallowing; Daoist Xu Guang ingested these.
The following is the Master Anqi’s grain-cessation talisman: cinnabar-inscribed, three inches in crimson, sealed in a small tube, and struck against the right arm to prevent hunger and strengthen the body. The three talismans below belong to this category.

**Method for Cessation of Grain Through Water Ingestion**
Each morning, take well-flower water and store it in a vessel as usual. Use another fine vessel, for the water will become turbid over time, and prolonged ingestion of such is not ideal. Prepare it early, allow it to settle, and then take the clear portion to ingest. Face the king, burn incense, hold the water vessel in the left hand and an object in the right. Though the object is unnamed, any will suffice—preferably a segment of green bamboo, intact at both ends, for regular use in knocking. Recite the incantation:

*"By the grace of the Historian of Destiny and the root of divine beings, may the true red and yellow traverse without error, and may all physicians below guard themselves."*

Upon completion, knock the teeth three times, swallow qi three times, and ensure the teeth and qi resonate in unison. Recite this thrice, then drink as much as desired until sated. After this morning ingestion, when hungry, take water and recite the incantation before drinking. Regardless of time, ingesting thrice daily will prevent hunger.

Initially, water ingestion for several tens of days may cause extreme emaciation, dizziness, and weakness in the legs. After this period, gradual improvement occurs. If combined with medicinal substances, one may avoid such depletion. Avoid excessive speech and laughter, as careless movement dissipates essence and qi—these are to be avoided.

**On the Ingestion of Medicinal Substances**
The five viscera circulate the qi of construction and defense, while the six bowels rely on the flavors of water and grain. Now, having ingested qi, the viscera’s qi becomes surplus; having ceased grain, the bowels’ flavors become deficient. The *Suwen* states: *"If grain is not consumed for half a day, qi declines; if for a full day, qi diminishes."* Thus, various medicinal substances must substitute for grain, ensuring qi reaches both viscera and bowels to preserve wholeness.

The clear yang is heaven; the turbid yin is earth.
The clear yang emerges from the upper orifices; the turbid yin emerges from the lower orifices.
The clear yang activates the interstices; the turbid yin courses through the five viscera.
The clear yang fills the four limbs; the turbid yin returns to the six bowels.
The clear yang is qi; the turbid yin is flavor.
Flavor returns to form; form returns to qi; qi returns to essence.
Essence feeds on qi; form feeds on flavor.
Qi is yang; flavor is yin.
When yin prevails, yang ails; when yang prevails, yin ails.
Thus, yin is for unobstructing, and flavor is for replenishing.
Unobstructing prevents exhaustion; replenishing prevents emaciation.

Now, with herbs and woods, their natures and flavors suit the viscera and bowels. Thus, the *Anzang Pill* and *Liqi Paste* are prepared. For those previously free of illness, with harmonious viscera and bowels, these pills and pastes may be taken regularly, along with single-ingredient medicines such as poria and sesame. If the viscera are afflicted, adjust the ingredients accordingly. For preexisting phlegm disorders or other ailments, seek separate medical treatment—these are not cured by this method. The Shangqing formulas and medicines should be followed as per their original texts, and those who receive them should adhere to their prescribed ingestion.

**Formula for the Harmonizing and Peaceful Viscera Pill**
- Poria (2 liang)
- Cinnamon bark (2 liang)
- Prepared licorice (2 liang)
- Ginseng (2 liang)
- Arborvitae seed (2 liang)
- Dioscorea (2 liang)
- Ophiopogon (2 liang)
- Asparagus (4 liang)

Grind into powder, mix with white honey, and form into pills the size of firmiana seeds. Ingest thirty pills twice daily, taken with medicinal beverages such as pine needles or lycium.

**Formula for the Qi-Moistening and Fluid-Regulating Paste**
- Asparagus (5 sheng)
- Solomon’s seal (5 sheng)
- Rehmannia (5 sheng)
- Atractylodes (5 sheng)

Boil the above, then combine evenly with:
- Poria (2 liang)
- Cinnamon bark (3 liang)
- Prepared licorice (3 liang)
- Dioscorea (5 liang)
- Alisma (5 liang)

Grind all into fine powder using fine silk, add to the decoction, then incorporate:
- Prepared sesame (3 sheng)
- Apricot kernel powder (3 sheng)
- White honey (2 sheng)

Stir continuously over a double boiler until it forms a thick paste. Cool, pound several thousand times, and store in a sealed vessel. Remove a small portion to form pills. Each morning, take one pill the size of a plum pit, hold it in the mouth, and swallow gradually, two to three times daily. This medicine is best prepared in the eighth or ninth month and ingested from the third month onward. If reheated and thickened in the second or third month, it will not spoil through summer.

**Formula for Expelling Yin Phlegm and Rheum**
- Raw licorice (2 liang)
- Poria (2 liang)

Boil strong tea (5–6 sheng) and decoct the above ingredients to yield 6 sheng. Strain, then ingest 3 sheng warm in one dose. Use an object to stimulate the throat to induce vomiting. After vomiting, ingest another 3 sheng warm, then vigorously induce vomiting again to expel phlegm and drool. Boil 3 sheng of plain tea, add a small amount of fresh ginger and tangerine peel, and sip warm. Lie supine, massage the chest and abdomen downward to the heart and belly, cover with warm clothing, and rest for a long while. Thereafter, avoid sour, salty, and other such foods.

**Formula for Purging Yin and Eliminating Stagnation**
- Rhubarb (2 liang)
- White atractylodes (2 liang)
- Red poria (2 liang)
- Fresh ginger (2 liang)
- Areca nut (3 pieces, peeled, sliced, soaked, and simmered)
- Evodia (quantity not specified)
- Prepared licorice (quantity not specified)
- Prepared bitter orange peel (quantity not specified)

Grind the simmered areca nut into powder separately.

Grind the above ingredients, each weighing one liang, into coarse pieces. Boil in five sheng of water until reduced to two sheng. When the decoction is nearly done, add rhubarb and boil for one more bubbling. Strain out the dregs, divide into two portions, and take warm. Add half of the areca nut powder to the first dose. After the time it takes to walk five or six li, take the second dose. The treatment is deemed effective when three or four bouts of smooth purgation occur. If the first dose fails to induce bowel movement, add half a liang of refined mirabilite to the subsequent dose.

Afterward, avoid raw, cold, hard, and slippery foods. Rest and recuperate for over ten days until fully recovered, then proceed to ingest qi-nourishing medicinals.

For all vomiting and purging therapies, the optimal time is between the third and fifteenth day of the lunar month, preferably on clear and mild days. Avoid such therapies on windy, rainy, or overcast days, as well as after the fifteenth day of the month.

**On Caution and Prohibitions**
The nature of qi is such that it is difficult to secure once taken in but easily depleted when expelled. To preserve what is hard to retain, one must guard it diligently; to prevent what is prone to exhaustion, one must cherish it and avoid dissipation.

The Perfected One said: *"Those who practice the Dao as if recalling their morning meal shall never fail to attain it. Those who cherish qi as they cherish the skin of their face shall never fail to preserve it whole."* He also said: *"If one cherished qi as if it were the foremost priority of the body, I would seldom see them wither and emaciate."*

In matters of sexual intercourse, speech, and laughter, one must exercise restraint. In movement and vocalization, moderation and gentleness are essential. By being cautious in all such matters, one may avoid harm.

Human nature is such that the body aligns with Heaven and Earth, its yin-yang and sevenfold qi, skin and bones, marrow and viscera, constructive and defensive qi, breath and movement, all subject to the transformations of cold and heat—none of which do not correspond to the Two Modes and resonate with the Five Phases. Thus, when Heaven and Earth are in disharmony, yin and yang fall into chaos; when the viscera are imbalanced, the signs of the meridians manifest as illness.

Illnesses arising from external causes originate from wind, while those stemming from internal factors are born of qi. As it is said: *"When the mind is tranquil and the spirit serene, true qi resides within. When essence and spirit are guarded internally, whence can illness arise?"* Truly, these words hold wisdom.

One must understand the nature of form and spirit, nurturing and preserving them; one must fear and be cautious of internal and external ailments.

*The Plain Questions* states: *"Heaven has its celestial markers, Earth its watercourses, and humans their meridians. When Heaven and Earth are harmonious, the watercourses remain calm. In cold, they freeze and congeal; in heat, they boil and overflow. When violent winds arise, the watercourses surge and ripple. If pernicious qi invades, it is like watercourses encountering wind. When the weather is warm and the sun bright, human blood and qi flow smoothly, and defensive qi rises. When the weather is cold and the sky overcast, human blood congeals, and defensive qi sinks. Blood and qi prefer warmth and detest cold; cold causes them to congeal and stagnate, while warmth encourages their movement and dispersal."*

When the qi of the azure Heaven is clear and tranquil, the will is ordered, and yang qi is secure. Pernicious qi cannot take hold—this is the harmony born of timely accord.

When the moon begins to wax, human blood and qi begin to flourish, and defensive qi begins to circulate. When the moon is full, blood and qi are abundant, and muscles are firm. When the moon wanes, muscles weaken, meridians empty, defensive qi departs, and only the form remains. Thus, one must regulate blood and qi in accordance with the seasons.

If one encounters pernicious qi at such times, the body’s emptiness meets Heaven’s emptiness, and the two voids resonate, penetrating to the bones and injuring the five viscera. Hence, the celestial taboos must not be ignored.

The Eight Cardinal Directions serve to observe the arrival of the eight winds and pernicious qi. One must avoid the pernicious qi of the Eight Cardinal Directions as one would evade an arrow’s flight—never allow oneself to be afflicted by them. For instance, in the month of the Winter Solstice, if wind comes from the south, it is a thieving wind that causes harm, for it arrives from the direction of pernicious emptiness and thus can sicken a person. Other seasons follow this principle.

Yang qi undergoes three transformations each day: at dawn, yang qi begins to rise; at noon, it reaches its peak; by dusk, it wanes, and the pores close. Thus, in the evening, one must withdraw and rest, avoiding strain on the sinews and bones, and exposure to mist and dew. To act contrary to these three periods is to invite bodily debility.

Prolonged use of the eyes injures the blood; prolonged exposure to the elements injures qi; prolonged standing injures the bones; prolonged walking injures the sinews; prolonged sitting injures the flesh—these are the Five Taxations.

Grief, sorrow, and excessive thought injure the heart; cold body and cold drinks injure the lungs; anger and qi counterflow that rises without descending injure the liver; immoderate eating and fatigue injure the spleen; prolonged sitting on damp ground, overexertion, or entering water injure the kidneys.

Humans possess five qi: joy, anger, sorrow, worry, and fear.
- Anger causes qi to rise.
- Joy causes qi to relax.
- Sorrow causes qi to dissipate.
- Fear causes qi to descend.
- Cold causes qi to gather.
- Heat causes qi to disperse.
- Worry causes qi to scatter.
- Fatigue causes qi to deplete.
- Thought causes qi to bind.

Joy and anger injure yin; cold and heat injure yang. When joy and anger are unchecked and cold and heat excessive, life is no longer secure.

The Five Flavors enter the following organs:
- Bitter enters the heart.
- Acrid enters the lungs.
- Sour enters the liver.
- Sweet enters the spleen.
- Salty enters the kidneys.

The generation of yin originates in the Five Flavors. Thus:
- Excessive sourness causes liver qi to overflow, and lung qi to expire.
- Excessive saltiness causes bone qi to labor, shortens the breath, and breaks qi.
- Excessive sweetness causes heart qi to pant and become full, the complexion to darken, and the kidneys to lose balance.
- Excessive bitterness causes spleen qi to lose moisture, and stomach qi to thicken.
- Excessive acridity causes sinews and vessels to slacken, and essence and spirit to perish.

Therefore, by harmonizing the Five Flavors with care, bones become upright, sinews supple, qi and blood flow freely, interstices close tightly, and qi and bones become refined. By diligently following the Dao in accordance with its principles, one may long preserve the Mandate of Heaven.

Excessive consumption of salt causes the vessels to congeal and the complexion to alter. Excessive consumption of bitter causes the skin to wither and hair to fall out. Excessive consumption of acridity causes the sinews to contract and the nails to wither.

Excessive consumption of sour causes the flesh to thicken and chap, and the lips to curl back. Excessive consumption of sweet causes the bones to ache and the hair to fall out. These are the harms wrought by the Five Flavors.

This discourse concerns the Five Flavors in food and drink, yet medicinal properties also possess Five Flavors. When taking pills or powders, one must exercise particular caution.

Those who practice qi absorption should avoid acrid flavors. Why? Because acridity disperses qi, and those with qi disorders must not consume it.

**On the Five Viscera**
When life takes form, it necessarily relies upon the Five Viscera. Though the body may become impaired, the viscera cannot be lacking. As for the nature of spirit, it necessarily derives from the Five Viscera. Though dispositions may differ, qi cannot be depleted.

Thus, heaven has Five Stars, whose advance and retreat weave its warp and weft; earth has Five Peaks, which in stillness secure its directions; qi has Five Phases, whose transformations broadly govern its domains; and humans have Five Viscera, which nurture and harbor their essence and spirit.

Therefore:
- The heart stores the spirit,
- The lungs store qi,
- The liver stores blood,
- The spleen stores flesh,
- The kidneys store the will.

The will and intent penetrate inward to connect with the bone marrow, thereby completing the bodily form.

Moreover:
- The heart is the root of life and the abode of the spirit;
- The lungs are the root of qi and the abode of the corporeal soul;
- The liver is the root of toil and exhaustion and the abode of the ethereal soul;
- The spleen is the root of food and drink and the abode of nourishment;
- The kidneys are the root of storage and sealing and the abode of essence.

As for the nine orifices’ functions, the four limbs’ movements, the firmness of bones and flesh, and the circulation of the meridians—none do not originate from the Five Viscera, branching forth into the hundred parts of the body. By harmonizing with cold and heat to prolong harmony and preserving essence and qi to enjoy longevity—

The heart governs all viscera. When the ruler is enlightened, functions flow smoothly. How can one who possesses a heart fail to comprehend the principles of its spirit?

The viscera have vital points that must not be overlooked:
- The liver arises on the left,
- The lungs arise on the right,
- The heart governs the exterior,
- The kidneys occupy the interior,
- The spleen serves as their messenger,
- The stomach serves as their marketplace.

The heart governs sweat, the lungs govern nasal mucus, the liver governs tears, the spleen governs drool, and the kidneys govern spittle—these are the Five Fluids.

The heart governs belching, the lungs govern coughing, the liver governs speech, the spleen governs laughter, and the kidneys govern sneezing.

Heavenly qi communicates with the lungs, earthly qi with the liver, thunderous qi with the heart, grain qi with the spleen, and rain qi with the kidneys.

Each of the Five Viscera has its corresponding union:
- The heart unites with the vessels, its luster in the complexion;
- The lungs unite with the skin, their luster in the body hair;
- The liver unites with the sinews, its luster in the nails;
- The spleen unites with the flesh, its luster in the lips;
- The kidneys unite with the bones, their luster in the hair.

Each of the Five Viscera has its associated bowel. The viscera pertain to yang, the bowels to yin.

The Five Viscera store essence and spirit without discharging them, thus they become full but cannot be replete. The Six Bowels receive water and grain without retaining them, thus they become replete yet can be full.

- The small intestine is the bowel of the heart,
- The large intestine is the bowel of the lungs,
- The gallbladder is the bowel of the liver,
- The stomach is the bowel of the spleen,
- The bladder is the bowel of the kidneys.

The Six Bowels each have their correspondences:
- The small intestine corresponds to the vessels,
- The large intestine corresponds to the skin,
- The gallbladder corresponds to the sinews,
- The stomach corresponds to the flesh,
- The Triple Burner and bladder correspond to the interstices and fine body hair.

The mutual employment of the Twelve Viscera:
- The heart is the official of the monarch, from which spirit and brightness emanate;
- The lungs are the official of the minister and mentor, from which governance and regulation emanate;
- The liver is the official of the general, from which strategy and deliberation emanate;
- The gallbladder is the official of central integrity, from which decision and judgment emanate;
- The *danzhong* (chest center) is the official of the minister and envoy, from which joy and happiness emanate;
- The chest is the gateway of the Upper Burner;
- The spleen and stomach are the officials of granaries and storehouses, from which the Five Flavors emanate;
- The large intestine is the official of transmission, from which transformation and change emanate;
- The small intestine is the official of reception and containment, from which the transformation of substances emanates;
- The kidneys are the officials of labor and strength, from which skill and ingenuity emanate;
- The Triple Burner is the official of drainage and dredging, from which the waterways emanate;
- The bladder is the official of prefectures and commanderies, which stores fluids; when qi transforms, they can be discharged.

None of these twelve officials may lose their mutual coordination. Thus, when the ruler is enlightened, those below are at peace. Cultivating life in this manner leads to longevity, and one will not perish throughout one’s allotted span. When the ruler is unenlightened, the twelve officials are endangered, the pathways of communication become obstructed and impassable, and the body suffers great harm. Cultivating life in this manner leads to peril.

**On Treating Illness**
The efficacy of qi is vast and wondrous. Thus, when heavenly qi descends, cold and heat manifest the changes of the four seasons; when earthly qi ascends, wind and clouds display the variations of the eight directions. Combining the Two Modes (heaven and earth) into one body, they collectively govern the form and qi of the person.

If one can preserve this within the household, the spirit will be solemnly present; if one can wield it with mastery, its effects will be manifest.

Directing my mind, employing my qi, adapting to my body, and attacking my illness—where could one not be cured?

Through practiced absorption in leisure, it becomes easy to preserve. For all those suffering from pain or illness, one may press and treat them accordingly.

Whenever one wishes to treat illness, one may do so after sunrise, when the weather is mild and calm. Face the sun, or if indoors, face toward the sun. Sit upright, close the eyes, clench the fists, and click the teeth nine times. Visualize the sun’s crimson radiance and purple rays, then draw a long breath and swallow it, directing it into the afflicted viscus or bowel. If the illness does not pertain to the viscera or bowels but rather to the limbs, sinews, or bones, one should first direct it into the governing viscus.

Hold the breath to its utmost, then draw another. After nine swallows, sense the qi within the viscus, then direct that qi to attack the afflicted area. Hold the breath to its utmost, exhale gently, and once the breath has settled, inhale again to attack. When the afflicted area feels warm and perspiration appears, this is optimal.

If the affliction lies in the four limbs and can be addressed through *daoyin*, first guide the qi to that area before attacking it. Even for afflictions in the upper body, pressing and kneading may be applied to facilitate the flow of qi.

If the affliction is in the head, let the hair down and comb the scalp several hundred times. Shake the head left and right dozens of times, then inhale deeply. Once the breath is held, grasp the crown of the head firmly with both hands and pull upward while resisting with the head. Simultaneously, visualize the qi ascending into the brain and bursting forth through the pores of the scalp. When the breath is held to its utmost, release the hands and exhale fully. Repeat this until sweat appears on the neck and the painful area feels eased and unconstrained.

For afflictions in the viscera or bowels, lie supine and inhale, directing the qi to the afflicted area. After five or six swallows, hold the breath once to attack the affliction, adjusting the method as needed.

If the illness is a long-standing *shan*-affliction or involves accumulations such as concretions, sores, or stagnations, it cannot be fully cured by qi alone, though some relief may be felt. Combining this with medicinal treatment poses no harm and may enhance efficacy.

Though the qi may disperse through the skin when attacking the afflicted area, it is even better to identify the corresponding acupoint using the *Mingtang Tu* and visualize drawing the illness away.

Once the acupoint is known, apply the appropriate *lü*-pipe according to the month, pressing it firmly over the point while visualizing the expulsion of the illness. This ensures the mind has a focus and the qi flows to its proper destination.

The *lü*-pipes are as follows:
- **Huangzhong** (eleventh month): pipe length nine *cun*, hollow, circumference nine *fen*;
- **Dalü** (twelfth month): pipe length eight *cun*, hollow, circumference nine *fen*;
- **Dacou** (first month): pipe length slightly over seven *cun*, hollow, circumference nine *fen*;
- **Jiazhong** (second month): pipe length slightly over seven *cun*, hollow, circumference nine *fen*;
- **Guxi** (third month): pipe length slightly over seven *cun*, hollow, circumference nine *fen*;
- **Zhonglü** (fourth month): pipe length slightly over six *cun*, hollow, circumference nine *fen*;
- **Ruibin** (fifth month): pipe length slightly over six *cun*, hollow, circumference nine *fen*;
- **Linzhong** (sixth month): pipe length slightly over six *cun*, hollow, circumference nine *fen*;
- **Yize** (seventh month): pipe length slightly over five *cun*, hollow, circumference nine *fen*;
- **Nanlü** (eighth month): pipe length slightly over five *cun*, hollow, circumference nine *fen*;
- **Wuyi** (ninth month): pipe length slightly over four *cun*, hollow, circumference nine *fen*;
- **Yingzhong** (tenth month): pipe length slightly over four *cun*, hollow, circumference nine *fen*.

All pipes are made from bamboo grown on the sunny side of mountains, with round hollows and no branches at the nodes.

If the hands or arms cannot be raised, the method may still be applied to any afflicted area on the limbs. First, gently massage the afflicted area with one hand for a long while. Then, close the eyes and visualize the five viscera. Swallow saliva three times, click the teeth three times, compose the mind, and softly recite the incantation:

*"Supreme Four Mysteries, Five Flowers, Six Courts,
Three Hun, Seven Po, Heaven’s Gate, Earth’s Essence,
Divine Talismans, Radiant Guardians,
Heavenly Embryo, Illuminated Above,
Four Limbs, Hundred Spirits, Nine Joints, Myriad Numina,
Enrolled in Jade Dawn, Inscribed in Jade City,
Jade Youths Guard Life, Jade Maidens Attend the Body,
Forever Aligned with the Two Luminaries,
Ascending as Immortals to the Upper Clarity,
Ageless as Sun and Moon,
Transcending to Join the Great Peace.
Flowing winds bind stagnations, pestilent ghosts take flight,
Specters and tomb-haunters contend,
Dual qi intertwine,
Assailing my four limbs,
Encroaching on my flourishing and decline.
Celestial Soldiers of Mount Tai, Dragon and Tiger display might,
Slay inauspicious ghosts,
Crush wind and malevolence,
Examine hidden litigations,
Concealed poisons and wrongs,
Restore me to constancy,
Sharing radiance with Sun and Moon.
If I am beset, the Northern Asterism shall seize and destroy,
Upholding the majesty of the Illuminated Above."*

Once finished, at the time when *shengqi* (vital qi) arises, swallow saliva fourteen times and press the painful area while facing the ruler and reciting:

*"Left Mystery, Right Mystery, the Two Spirits unite in perfection,
Left Yellow, Right Yellow, the Six Flowers align.
Wind and malevolent qi,
Lurk in the four directions.
Jade fluid flows in grace,
Above and below, all is harmonized.
Internally dispatch Water and Fire,
Externally repel inauspiciousness,
Attain long life and flight as an immortal,
The body ever strong and at ease."*

After reciting, swallow saliva fourteen times again and press the painful area thirty-one times in quick succession. Practicing this regularly will prevent illness.

*On the Essentials of Treating Illness*

Heaven endows life as *ming* (destiny), which relies upon form and spirit; the harmony of *qi* originates in the viscera and bowels. When form and spirit remain steadfast and unyielding, life is preserved whole and longevity unfolds as one, ever aligned with the pristine and tranquil—*qi* then flourishes in peace, and illness finds no foothold.

Yet when examining the inception of the two essences and their nourishment of the countenance, each varies with the four seasons; the foundation of embodied form and established nature seldom adheres perfectly to the rhythms of the Five Constants. Thus, restlessness and distraction multiply, cravings and indulgences accumulate, and illness may take root at the very moment of conception or arise at the dawn of bodily existence.

Therefore, joy, anger, and anxiety—arising from within—give rise to illness; cold, heat, drink, and food—encountered from without—beget disease. As years advance and vigor wanes, one persists in reckless transgressions; the decline of yin and yang becomes intertwined, form and *qi* fall into discord, and manifold afflictions emerge, their signs manifold and varied.

Moreover, for those who practice *qi*-absorption, once grains and meats are forsaken, the body gradually weakens, essence and *qi* remain incomplete, and spirit and soul do not flow freely. Old ailments may thus stir anew, while new afflictions arise from vacuous pathogenic influences. One must discern their origins and carefully attend to their treatment.

Here, I roughly outline the discernible symptoms to guide inquiry with physicians, for the art of *qi*-attack differs from that of medicinal substances. How do the forms of vacuity and repletion arise? When *qi* and blood intermingle, yin and yang incline toward imbalance: *qi* disorders the defensive, blood flows through the channels, and blood and *qi* part ways, one becoming replete, the other vacuous.

When blood merges with yin and *qi* with yang, it gives rise to fright and mania; when blood merges with yang and *qi* with yin, it results in *gen zhong* (internal obstruction). When blood merges above and *qi* below, the heart is vexed and prone to anger; when blood merges below and *qi* above, confusion and forgetfulness ensue.

Yang vacuity produces external cold, yin vacuity internal heat; yang exuberance yields internal cold, yin exuberance external heat. The pathways of the Five Viscera all emerge from the channels and network vessels, circulating blood and *qi*. When blood and *qi* fall into disharmony, the hundred diseases transform and arise.

When *qi* is in excess, abdominal distension and undigested diarrhea follow; the pernicious *qi* of untimely celestial influences, when contracted, harms the Five Viscera. The cold and warmth of water and grains, when affected, harm the Six Bowels. The damp *qi* of earth, when contracted, harms the skin, flesh, sinews, and vessels.

Furthermore, the origin of pathogenic influences may arise from yin or yang. Those born of yang are contracted from wind, rain, cold, and summerheat; those born of yin are contracted from drink and food, dwelling places, the interplay of yin and yang, and joy and anger.

Yang pertains to the *qi* of Heaven and governs the exterior; yin pertains to the *qi* of Earth and governs the interior. The Way of yang is repletion, the Way of yin is vacuity. Thus, when one is assailed by thieving wind or vacuous pathogenic influences, yang receives them. Immoderate drink and food, or untimely rising and resting, are received by yin. When yang receives them, they enter the Six Bowels, causing untimely fever and restlessness, with panting and gasping above. When yin receives them, they enter the Five Viscera, leading to fullness, blockage, and closure, with undigested diarrhea below, and over time, intestinal aggregation.

When the throat governs the *qi* of Heaven and the pharynx governs the *qi* of Earth, the intestines receive wind-*qi*, while yin receives damp-*qi*. Thus, yin *qi* ascends from the feet to the head, then descends along the arms to the fingertips; yang *qi* ascends from the hands to the head, then descends to the feet.

Therefore, it is said: In yang diseases, ascent reaches its limit before descent begins; in yin diseases, descent reaches its limit before ascent begins. Those harmed by wind are first affected above; those harmed by damp are first affected below.

The head is the palace of essence and clarity; when the head droops and the gaze sinks deep, essence is about to be lost. The back is the palace of the chest; when the back is hunched and the shoulders slump, the chest is about to fail. The waist is the palace of the kidneys; when one cannot turn or sway, the kidneys are about to weaken. The knees are the palace of the sinews; when one cannot bend or stretch, and walks with a limp, leaning on support, the sinews are about to weaken. The bones are the palace of marrow; when one cannot stand for long, and walking causes trembling, the bones are about to weaken.

In lung heat disease, the right cheek reddens; in heart heat disease, the forehead reddens first; in liver heat disease, the left cheek reddens; in spleen heat disease, the nose reddens; in kidney heat disease, the chin reddens. Though the disease has yet to manifest, upon seeing its color, one should treat it. Thus it is said: Treat the disease before it arises.

In lung heat disease, the complexion is white and the body hair withers; in heart heat disease, the complexion is red and the network vessels overflow; in liver heat disease, the complexion is green-blue and the nails wither; in spleen heat disease, the complexion is yellow and the flesh twitches; in kidney heat disease, the complexion is black and the teeth wither.

The liver governs spring, with the foot *jueyin* and *shaoyang* channels presiding over treatment; its days are *jia* and *yi*. The liver suffers from tension, so one should hastily consume sweet flavors to relax it. It is also said: In liver disease, one desires dispersion, so hastily consume acrid flavors to disperse it; use acrid to supplement and sour to drain. Avoid facing the wind, for the liver loathes wind.

The heart governs summer, with the hand *shaoyin* and *taiyang* channels presiding over treatment; its days are *bing* and *ding*. The heart suffers from slackness, so one should hastily consume sour flavors to astringe it. It is also said: In heart disease, one desires oppressiveness, so hastily consume salty flavors to oppress it; use salty to supplement and sweet to drain. Avoid warm clothing and hot food, for the heart loathes heat.

The spleen governs late summer, with the foot *taiyin* and *yangming* channels presiding over treatment; its days are *wu* and *ji*. The spleen suffers from dampness, so one should hastily consume bitter flavors to dry it. It is also said: In spleen disease, one desires relaxation, so hastily consume sweet flavors to relax it; use sweet to supplement and bitter to drain. Avoid warm food, overindulgence, damp ground, and damp clothing, for the spleen loathes dampness.

The lung governs autumn, with the hand *taiyin* and *yangming* channels presiding over treatment; its days are *geng* and *xin*. The lung suffers from counterflow ascent of *qi*, so one should hastily consume bitter flavors to drain it. It is also said: In lung disease, one desires astringency, so hastily consume sour flavors to astringe it; use sour to supplement and acrid to drain. Avoid cold clothing and cold food, for the lung loathes cold.

The kidney governs winter, with the foot *shaoyin* and *taiyang* channels presiding over treatment; its days are *ren* and *gui*. The kidney suffers from dryness, so one should hastily consume acrid flavors to moisten it, opening the interstices to facilitate the flow of fluids and *qi*. It is also said: In kidney disease, one desires firmness, so hastily consume bitter flavors to firm it; use bitter to supplement and salty to drain. Keep warm suddenly, avoid hot food and warm clothing, for the kidney loathes dryness.

Acrid flavors course *qi*, so in *qi* disease, avoid acrid;
Bitter flavors course bone, so in bone disease, avoid bitter;
Sweet flavors course flesh, so in flesh disease, avoid sweet;
Salty flavors course blood, so in blood disease, avoid salty;
Sour flavors course sinews, so in sinew disease, avoid sour.
These are called the five prohibitions—do not consume them in excess.

Symptoms of lung wind: profuse sweating, aversion to wind, frequent coughing, shortness of breath, improvement during the day but worsening at dusk. The diagnosis lies above the eyebrows, and its color is white.

Symptoms of heart wind: profuse sweating, aversion to wind, parched lips, and frequent anger. The diagnosis lies in the mouth, and its color is red.

Symptoms of liver wind: profuse sweating, aversion to wind, tendency to sorrow, slight pallor, dry throat, and frequent anger. The diagnosis lies below the eyes, and its color is blue-green.

Symptoms of spleen wind: profuse sweating, aversion to wind, lethargy of the body, reluctance to move the limbs, slight yellowing, and loss of appetite. The diagnosis lies above the nose, and its color is yellow.

Symptoms of kidney wind: profuse sweating, aversion to wind, swollen face, back pain, inability to stand upright, dark complexion, and difficulty with private matters. The diagnosis lies on the cheeks, and its color is black.

Symptoms of stomach wind: profuse sweating in the neck, aversion to wind, inability to swallow food and drink, blockage and obstruction, frequent abdominal fullness, distension when clothing is removed, and diarrhea when cold food is consumed. The diagnosis lies in the body—emaciated with a swollen abdomen.

Symptoms of head wind: profuse sweating on the head and face, aversion to wind; if exposed to wind for a day, illness ensues, with severe headache making it unbearable to go outside. If exposed to wind again on the following day, the illness slightly improves.

Symptoms of wind in the five viscera: When wind enters the five viscera, the body becomes emaciated, the complexion withers, and the hair falls out. The diagnosis lies in the face—its color is black, and the lips are parched.

Symptoms of wind in the heart: The heart governs the blood vessels. When wind enters the heart, the blood vessels become obstructed, the face turns red, the body feels hot, and there is aversion to fire. Even when drinking cold water, the heat does not dissipate; when lying down, one cannot sleep. The diagnosis lies in the tongue—its color is red, and the tip is curled.

Symptoms of wind in the liver: The liver governs the sinews. When wind enters the liver, the sinews contract, the limbs become stiff, and one cannot bend or extend them. The diagnosis lies in the nails—they turn green and wither.

Symptoms of wind in the spleen: The spleen governs the flesh. When wind enters the spleen, the flesh trembles, the limbs feel heavy, and one cannot walk steadily. The diagnosis lies in the lips—they turn yellow and sag.

Symptoms of wind in the lungs: The lungs govern the skin. When wind enters the lungs, the skin becomes rough, the body hair falls out, and there is aversion to cold. Even when wearing thick clothing, the cold does not dissipate; when lying down, one cannot rest. The diagnosis lies in the body hair—it stands on end and withers.

Symptoms of wind in the kidneys: The kidneys govern the bones. When wind enters the kidneys, the bones become heavy, the lower back and spine ache, and one cannot stand for long. The diagnosis lies in the teeth—they turn black and decay.

The *Way* of wind is such that it follows the *qi* and transforms. Though its symptoms vary, the method of treatment remains consistent: one must first regulate the *qi* and blood, then expel the wind and harmonize the viscera. If the *qi* is harmonized and the blood is balanced, the wind will naturally disperse. If one merely seeks to drive it away, it will only linger and recur. Thus, the superior physician treats before illness arises, the mediocre physician treats as illness emerges, and the inferior physician treats after illness has taken hold. Those who understand the *Way* of wind will know how to prevent it.
