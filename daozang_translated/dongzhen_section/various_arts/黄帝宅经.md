**Huangdi’s Residence Classic, Upper Scroll**

The residence is indeed the pivotal hinge of yin and yang, the model for human order. Without profound knowledge and sagely insight, none can grasp this Dao.

Of the five essentials, the most critical and truly secret art is the method of residence.

Wherever a person dwells, they reside in a home—whether grand or humble, the interplay of yin and yang differs. Even within a single rented chamber, there exists good and ill fortune. The great principles apply to the grand, the minor to the small. Those who transgress invite calamity, while proper alignment halts disaster—just as medicine cures illness.

Thus, the residence is the foundation of a person.
A person takes the residence as their home. If it is harmonious, their lineage prospers with good fortune; if unstable, their clan declines, their graves become desolate by rivers and hills.

All follow this principle: from armies and nations above, to prefectures, counties, and villages below, even to mountain dwellings—wherever people reside, the same rules apply.

What we see and hear confirms that ancient systems were not few in number.

The Yellow Emperor’s *Er Zhai Jing* (Two-Dwellings Classic), the *Di Dian Zhai Jing* (Earth Canon Dwellings Classic), the *San Yuan Zhai Jing* (Three Elements Dwellings Classic), the *Wen Wang Zhai Jing* (King Wen’s Dwellings Classic), the *Kong Zi Zhai Jing* (Confucius’ Dwellings Classic), the *Zhai Jin, Zhai Nao, Zhai Tong, Zhai Jing, Tian Lao Zhai Jing* (Residence Patterns, Residence Lures, Residence Regulations, Residence Mirror, Heavenly Old Man’s Dwellings Classic), the *Liu Gen Zhai Jing* (Liu’s Root Dwellings Classic), the *Xuan Nü Zhai Jing* (Mysterious Lady’s Dwellings Classic), the *Si Ma Tian Shi Zhai Jing* (Master Si Ma’s Dwellings Classic), the *Huai Nan Zi Zhai Jing* (Master Huai Nan’s Dwellings Classic), the *Wang Wei Zhai Jing* (Wang Wei’s Dwellings Classic), the *Si Zui Zhai Jing* (Si Zui’s Dwellings Classic), the *Liu Jin Ping Zhai Jing* (Liu Jin Ping’s Dwellings Classic), the *Zhang Zi Bo Zhai Jing* (Zhang Zi Bo’s Dwellings Classic), the *Ba Gua Zhai Jing* (Eight Trigrams Dwellings Classic), the *Wu Zhao Zhai Jing* (Five Omens Dwellings Classic), the *Xuan Wu Zhai Jing* (Mysterious Understanding Dwellings Classic), the *Liu Shi Si Gua Zhai Jing* (Sixty-Four Hexagrams Dwellings Classic), the *You Pan Long Zhai Jing* (Right-Sided Dragon Dwellings Classic), the *Li Chun Feng Zhai Jing* (Li Chun Feng’s Dwellings Classic), the *Wu Xing Zhai Jing* (Five Clans Dwellings Classic), the *Lü Cai Zhai Jing* (Lü Cai’s Dwellings Classic), the *Fei Yin Luan Fu Zhai Jing* (Flying Yin, Tumbling Fu Dwellings Classic), and the *Zi Xia Jin Men Zhai Jing* (Zi Xia’s Golden Gate Dwellings Classic)—all the aforementioned classics, though differing in minor details, share a common essence. Each claims its own hidden wonders, yet they mutually praise and criticize one another. Without exhaustive inquiry, one cannot apply them fully.

In recent times, scholars often focus on *Wu Xing Ba Zhai* (Five Clans Eight Dwellings) and *Huang Dao Bai Fang* (Yellow Dao/Way White Directions), yet their methods invariably violate the core principles of the great classics, leading to misfortune and calamity. How tragic it is that people transgress the Dao/Way’s harmony, causing their dwellings to be abandoned and their alignment with yin and yang to yield no results!

To honor the sages of old and make their teachings resplendent, I now reveal to the unenlightened the daily applications they overlooked. The sun and moon, the heavens and earth, the cold and heat, the masculine and feminine—day and night, yin and yang—all these encompass the myriad phenomena, embodying the thousand threads of existence. In their boundless transformations, they shape the world profoundly.

The principle of yin and yang is this: the yin of the classics is the mother that generates and transforms all things; the yang is the father that does the same. They are the progenitors of heaven and earth, the revered ones of nurturance. To follow them brings prosperity; to defy them brings ruin—what difference is there? The loyal official receives his due, while the one who betrays his mandate suffers misfortune. Such is the law.

Now, I compile verified secrets and arrange them into the Twenty-Four Paths, the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces, aligning with the positions of female and male, demarcating the boundaries of yin and yang in the residence. By examining auspicious and inauspicious signs, none surpass the first Two-Dwellings Classic—this is indeed the sacred method of nourishing life’s essence!

The Twenty-Four Paths correspond to the main and side halls of a residence, dividing the four directions into twenty-four paths: the Ten Heavenly Stems, the Twelve Earthly Branches, and the trigrams *Qian* (Heaven), *Gen* (Mountain), *Kun* (Earth), and *Xun* (Wind), together forming these Twenty-Four Paths.

*Qian* governs the Three Males: *Zhen* (Thunder), *Kan* (Water), and *Gen* (Mountain), all belonging to the yang position. Thus, from the northwest, *Qian*’s *Zhen* is the yang’s brilliance.

*Kun* governs the Three Females: *Xun* (Wind), *Li* (Fire), and *Dui* (Lake), all belonging to the yin position. Thus, from the southeast, *Xun*’s path, following its sequence to *Xu* (Earth), is the yin’s brilliance.

Hence, yang does not stand alone; it gains strength from yin. A residence should be modified to suit the yin’s Way. Yin does not stand alone; it gains strength from yang. As stated above.

It is also like the virtue of winter being warmth and summer being coolness, the male being strengthened by the female, and the female by the male.

*The Easy Key* states: *"Yin obtains yang like summer obtains coolness; when the Five Stems harmonize, all affairs flourish."*

Thus, a residence with a **virtue/power** (德) that is lofty, vigorous, and dense is auspicious, while excessive yin or excessive yang is inauspicious.

A **yang residence** should enhance the **east** and **north** directions, while the **south** is considered excessive. The **east** is the **Chen-South** position, and the **west** is the **Xu-North** position, with a diagonal division marking the boundary between yin and yang.

For a **yang residence**, there is yang *qi* embracing yin, and for a **yin residence**, there is yin *qi* embracing yang. Such yin-yang residences are the **Dragon** (龙).

In a **yang residence**, the Dragon’s head is in *Hai* (Water), and its tail is in *Si* (Fire). In a **yin residence**, the Dragon’s head is in *Si* (Fire), and its tail is in *Hai* (Water).

The appearance of the Dragon is as follows: the **yin Dragon** is green, the **yang Dragon** is red; each has its own command-sitting position—**avoid violating** (犯) these at all costs.

If one moves from *Xun* (Wind) toward *Qian* (Heaven), from *Wu* (Horse) toward *Zi* (Water), from *Kun* (Earth) toward *Gen* (Mountain), from *You* (Rooster) toward *Mao* (Wood), or from *Xu* (Earth) toward *Chen* (Metal), these are called **yang shifts** (入阳). If such shifts occur near the residence of the **upper official** (上官), regardless of distance, they are all considered **yang shifts**.

If one moves from *Qian* (Heaven) toward *Xun* (Wind), from *Zi* (Water) toward *Wu* (Horse), from *Gen* (Mountain) toward *Kun* (Earth), from *Mao* (Wood) toward *You* (Rooster), or from *Chen* (Metal) toward *Xu* (Earth), these are called **yin shifts** (入阴). If such shifts occur near the upper official’s residence, they are all considered **yin shifts**.

Thus, the directions of **virtue/power** (福德) must diligently follow the **Dao/Way** of Heaven. When **Heaven’s virtue/power** (天德), **Moon’s virtue/power** (月德), and **life-giving *qi*** (生气) arrive at that position, one should then modify the residence to be **clean, spacious, and sturdy**—this will bring the entire household **peace and prosperity, along with wealth and honor**. Heaven’s **virtue/power** (福德) is the **residence’s financial destiny** (财命).

If the **financial destiny** is **virtue/power**-ful, why should one fear not flourishing? Hence, one must diligently modify it.

If yin and yang are **repeatedly shifted** (重往), it is called **no *qi*** (无气). If yin and yang are **three times repeatedly shifted** (三度重入), it is called **no soul** (无魂). If **four times shifted** (四入), it is called **no spirit** (无魄). When the soul and spirit are lost, the household will collapse, its members will flee, and descendants will perish—this is the **extinction of the clan and the severing of posterity** (灭门绝嗣).

*The Classic* says: *"If violations continue, the clan will perish, and posterity will be severed—this is what is meant."*

If one maintains a single yin-yang shift, the back-and-forth will align with Heaven’s **Dao/Way**, naturally forming an auspicious pattern.

If one must repeatedly shift, then one should stay in each direction for **forty-five days, seventy-five days, or until the shifts cease without harm** (无咎), but it is still better to modify the residence to suit the **life-giving *qi* and virtue/power** directions for auspiciousness.

If one violates the **Five Ghosts** (五鬼), **severing of life** (绝命), or **punitive *qi*** (刑祸), the harm is even greater.

*The Key* states: *"If movement is not measured, it is better to return to the original state."* This is what is meant.

It also says: *"If the residence is impoverished, urgently reverse the original courtyard."* One should **demolish structures in the punitive *qi* direction** (刑祸方舍) and **expand those in the virtue/power direction** (福德方).

It also says: *"Reverse the residence, flatten the walls—this can dispel calamity."* If a residence’s annual *qi* is inauspicious, or if there are quarrels, illnesses, or other misfortunes, one should **narrow the punitive *qi* direction and expand the virtue/power direction**, adjusting the walls accordingly—this will **dissipate the disaster and bring great auspiciousness**.

Those who discern a residence’s **Dao/Way** must consider the **shifted directions** (移来方位), not merely whether it faces **north of the street** (街北) or **south of the street** (街南). Even if a position is **yang**, one should not hesitate to reside there as a **yin residence**—this is auspicious. The **south** and **west** of the street are **yin**—even if one resides there as a **yang residence**, it is still auspicious.

When shifting directions, one should not restrict the distance—**whether one *li*, one hundred *li*, one thousand *li*, ten steps, or a hundred steps**, all are treated equally.

For these two types of residences, modifications and constructions must be based solely on Heaven’s **Dao/Way**. When **Heaven’s virtue/power** (天德), **Moon’s virtue/power** (月德), and **life-giving *qi*** (生气) arrive, one must modify accordingly—**without avoiding** the **General’s *qi*** (将军), **Grandfather’s *qi*** (太岁), **Tiger’s Tail** (豹尾), **Yellow Banner** (黄幡), **Black Banner** (黑方), or **harmonious names** (音姓).

What is auspicious or inauspicious must follow the yin-yang *qi* as primary, for these gods’ **punitive *qi*** (神杀), the **Five Stems**, and the **Sixty Heavenly Stems-Earthly Branches** (六十甲子) all arise from these two *qi* and are positioned in the cardinal directions, influencing **public affairs** for a year. Hence, they are not considered disasters.

If any **punitive *qi*** (刑杀) is in the **punitive *qi* direction** (刑祸方), even if **Heaven’s virtue/power** (天德) and **Moon’s virtue/power** (月德) arrive, one must still avoid it. If the **punitive *qi*** is within the residence itself, the **virtue/power direction** (福德方) should wait until **Heaven’s virtue/power** (天德), **Moon’s virtue/power** (月德), and **life-giving *qi*** (生气) arrive at that position before modifying it—**the more effort exerted, the better the result**, hence it should not be avoided.

If one does not understand that yin-yang *qi* must be modified when it arrives at a position—**the more effort exerted, the better the result**, hence it should not be avoided—one cannot grasp its overarching principles.

It also says: *"If the punitive *qi* direction is incomplete, restore it and connect with the **virtue/power direction** (福德方)—this brings long-term auspiciousness."*

It also says: *"The punitive *qi* direction’s walls and structures should be **narrow and thin**, guarding against their being **lofty and vigorous**."* The **virtue/power direction** (福德方) and its walls and structures should be **connected and sturdy** for the household.

It also says: *"If the punitive *qi* direction is **constricted and repeatedly constricted**, calamities and disasters will still fearlessly pursue. If the virtue/power direction is **expanded and repeatedly expanded**, descendants will enjoy prosperity and joy. The punitive *qi* direction must be **guarded against encroachment and expansion**; if too constricted, the *qi* will be insufficient, and insufficient *qi* will diminish wealth and fortune. The virtue/power direction must also be **guarded against excessive encroachment and expansion**; if too extreme, the **virtue/power** and **punitive *qi*** will become negligible, failing to **dissipate the thick auspicious *qi*** that descends upon it."*

If **any direction is excessive or encroached upon beyond its original proportion**, it is called **excessive**.

It also says: *"A residence has **Five Emptinesses** (五虚), which bring poverty and depletion; and **Five Fullnesses** (五实), which bring wealth and nobility.
The **Five Emptinesses**:
1. A large residence with few people (**大人少**).
2. A large residence with a small gate (**宅门大内小**).
3. Incomplete walls and courtyards (**墙院不完**).
4. A well or water source without proper positioning (**井鳌不处**).
5. A residence with **excessive land and insufficient houses, or overly spacious courtyards** (宅地多、屋少、庭院广).

The **Five Fullnesses**:
1. A small residence with many people (**宅小人多**).
2. A large residence with a small gate (**宅大门小**).
3. Complete walls and courtyards (**墙院完全**).
4. A small residence with many livestock (**宅小六畜多**).
5. Water channels that **flow northward** (水沟束南流).

It also says: *"If a residence gradually flourishes, do not abandon the courtyard. If it does not decline, do not move—otherwise, calamity will follow. If one seeks a broader dwelling, it is not necessarily joyful; if one builds only half, one will certainly attain longevity."* A residence should not be overly broad.

It also says: *"Though its fields may be fertile, weeding and tilling will make them flourish; though its residence may be good, modifying and moving will make it prosperous."*

「The **residence (宅)** and **tomb (墓)** together symbolize the source of honor and prosperity. Those who gain advantage will act according to their desires, while those who lose advantage will recklessly construct contrary to their true nature.

When the tomb is **auspicious (凶)** and the residence is **auspicious (吉)**, descendants attain **official rank and wealth (官禄)**.
When the tomb is **auspicious (吉)** but the residence is **auspicious (凶)**, descendants suffer from insufficient clothing and food.
When both the tomb and residence are **auspicious (吉)**, descendants flourish in honor and prosperity.
When both the tomb and residence are **auspicious (凶)**, descendants are forced to relocate, their lineage perishes, ancestral spirits **condemn (谴责)** them, and **land calamities (地祸)** persist. Over seven generations, their souls endure sorrow and suffering, descendants fail to thrive, scatter as refugees, wander like tumbleweed, and die as strangers along riversides.

**Qingwu Zi (青乌子)** said: If the residence **aligns with (得)** the tomb, the two **spirits (神)** gradually **protect (护)** the descendants, securing their **wealth and position (禄位)**.
If the residence **aligns with (得)** the land and the tomb, the **Dragon’s brewing (龙酿)** and **Tiger’s strides (虎步)** bring prosperity—**livestock and crops flourish (物业滋川)**, wealth accumulates in granaries—descendants uphold **loyalty and filial piety (忠孝)**, and celestial spirits **assist (佑助)** them.

**Zi Xia (子夏)** said: Tombs have **Four Anomalies (四奇)**—the **commercial (商)** and **angular (角)** alignments **afflict (二姓)** two clans, while **homophonic (丙壬)** and **sinister (乙辛)** strike three. The **celestial (甲)** and **earthly (庚)** as well as **metal (丁)** and **water (癸)** are also **auspicious (奇)**.
If the residence **aligns with (得)** the land and the **celestial alignment (宫)**, descendants become **governors and nobles (刺史王公)**, adorned in **scarlet robes and purple sashes (朱衣紫绶)**, their lineage **renowned and powerful (名雄)**.
If the residence **aligns with (得)** the land but **loses (失)** the celestial alignment, there is **prosperity without permanence (有始无终)**—ancestors suffer, and descendants face misfortune.
If the residence **loses (失)** the land but **aligns with (得)** the celestial alignment, descendants will never lack, though they may lack **foundations of wealth (基业)**, their **clothing and food (衣食)** will still be abundant.
If the residence **loses (失)** both the land and celestial alignment, their lineage **perishes utterly (绝嗣无踪)**, descendants **beg for sustenance (行求衣食)** and die as strangers in **reeds and thistles (蒿蓬)**.

**Zi Xia (子夏)** also said: A person **establishes (立)** themselves through their residence, and a residence **endures (存)** through its inhabitants. Human and residence **mutually support (相扶)**, harmonizing with the **Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth (天地)**. Thus, one must not **blindly trust (独信)** fate alone.

**The Sequence of Residence Construction (修宅次第法):**
First **rectify (修)** the **auspicious (刑祸)**, then **cultivate (修)** **virtue/power (福德)**, and it will be auspicious.
First **cultivate (修)** **virtue/power (福德)**, then **rectify (修)** the auspicious, and it will be inauspicious.
For **tombs (阴宅)**, construction begins from the **fourth heavenly stem (巳)** and follows the **auspicious (吉)** sequence of the **Eight Trigrams (八卦)**. For **residences (阳宅)**, it begins from the **eleventh heavenly stem (亥)** and follows the same.

When **auspicious (刑祸)** matters are **rectified (方)**, employ **one hundred laborers (一百工)**. When **virtue/power (福德)** is **cultivated (方)**, use **two hundred laborers (二百工)** to **overwhelm (压)** the former—this ensures auspiciousness.
**Residences (阳宅)** should be **rectified (修)** mostly in **external (外)** aspects, while **tombs (阴宅)** focus on **internal (内)** rectifications.

Some mistakenly **divide (取)** **residence (子)** and **tomb (午)**, separating **yin (阴)** and **yang (阳)**—this is a grave error.
This is the **Dao/Way of the Two Qi (二气)**—**yin (阴)** and **yang (阳)**—**potentially harmonizing (潜通)**, yet their **cyclical returns (运回)** differ. The **Eight Trigrams (八卦)** and **Nine Palaces (九宫)** display **forms and symbols (形象)**, aligning with **male and female positions (男女之位)**.

At the **winter solstice (冬至)**, the **sacred (圣)** reaches the **fourth heavenly stem (巳)** to the **eleventh heavenly stem (亥)**—this marks the **extreme divergence (极处)** of **yin (阴)** and **yang (阳)** in their **ascendancy (起盛)**. The **sage (圣人)** mapped the **Eight Trigrams (八卦)** upon the earth, arranging the **palaces of males and females (女男之宫)**. The **palaces (宫)** are the **residences (宅)**.
**Xun (巽)** represents the **eldest daughter (长女)**, belonging to **yin (阴)**; **Qian (乾)** symbolizes **Heaven (天)**, which is **yang (阳)** and **illuminating (明)**.

If one possesses **great talent (长才)**, **profound wisdom (深智)**, **compassion for all (慜物)**, **love for life (爱生)**, and **respect for the enlightened (敬晓)**, their **door (斯门)** will bring **unfathomable benefits (利莫测)**.
Major **transgressions (犯)** lead to **family ruin and dispersal (家破逃散)**; minor **transgressions (犯)** result in **loss of rank and office (失爵亡官)**.
Other **miscellaneous transgressions (杂犯)**—such as **fires (火光)**, **verbal disputes (口舌)**, **lame limbs (跛蹇)**, **partial paralysis (偏枯)**, **decline and calamity (衰殃)**, **illness (疾病)**—all manifest in countless ways. How can such matters be **dismissed lightly (轻之)**?

If the **transgression (犯处)** is **distant (远)** and **neglected (慢)**, its effects will appear only after **half a year, one year, two years, or three years**.
If the **transgression (犯处)** is **near (近)** and **urgent (紧)**, its effects will manifest within **seventy-five days, forty-five days, or even before the month ends**.

If one encounters this **diagram (图)**, they will naturally **comprehend (悟会)** its principles. Whether **wise or foolish (愚智)**, if they **cultivate virtue/power (福德自修)** and **avoid transgressions (灾殃不犯)**, they will attain **official prosperity (官荣)** and **wealthy sustenance (进达)**. Livestock will **thrive in peace (获安)**, and such benefits **outshine even Heaven’s offerings (天寿金玉之献)**.

This **diagram (图)** should be **kept as a family treasure (家藏)**, sincerely passed down to descendants, **hidden and revered (秘而宝之)**, and named the **"Residence Mirror (宅镜)"**.

The **Residence Book (宅书)** also states:
To **demolish (拆)** the old and **build anew (营新)**, if the **divinatory lines (爻卜)** **contradict (相伏)**, moving from **south (南)** to **north (北)**—where **yin (阴)** and **yang (阳)** **intersect harmoniously (交分)**—is **auspicious (和)**.
**Yin (阴)** and **yang (阳)** are **qi (气)**, ever-changing with those who dwell within; **auspiciousness (吉)** and **inauspiciousness (凶)** are **transformations (化)**, arising with circumstances.
The **endless cycles of Heaven and Earth (坎天地运转)** and the **variations of humans, livestock, and spirits (人畜鬼神变化)** are **unpredictable (何准)**. The *Search for the Supernatural (搜神记)* says: **Refined spirits (精灵)** and **ghostly apparitions (鬼魅)** can all **transform into humans (化为人)**.
Some may **mutually influence (自相感)** and **become demonic (变为祆怪)**, akin to **heterogeneous wood (异性之木)**—when joined, it grows. Though roots and shoots differ, their **aroma blends (异味相杂)**.
Even **obstructive forms (形碍)** adapt through **change (变通)**. Since **yin (阴)** and **yang (阳)** are **formless (虚无)**, how can they be **fixed constants (常定)**?

Thus, it is known that a **residence (宅)** is not determined by its **qi (宅气)** alone—its **auspiciousness (吉凶)** shifts with **relocation (移)** and **transformation (变)**.

It also says:
A **residence (宅)** takes its **form and layout (形势)** as its **body (身体)**, its **springs and waters (泉水)** as **vital channels (血脉)**, its **land (土地)** as **flesh and skin (皮肉)**, its **vegetation (草木)** as **hair (毛发)**, its **dwellings (舍屋)** as **garments (衣服)**, and its **gates and entrances (门户)** as **headgear and sashes (冠带)**.
If these aspects are **harmonized (得如斯)**, the **affairs (事)** will be **refined and elegant (俨雅)**, achieving **supreme auspiciousness (上吉)**.

The *Three Elements Scripture (三元经)* states:
**Auspicious land (地善)** yields **luxuriant crops (即苗茂)**; a **auspicious residence (宅吉)** brings **human prosperity (即人荣)**.

It also says:
A person’s **virtue/power (福)** is like the **beauty of a fine appearance (美貌)**.
A **auspicious residence (宅之吉)** is like an **ugly child adorned in fine clothing (丑陋之子得好衣裳)**—their **spirit and luster (神彩)** are **enhanced by half (尤添一半)**.
If one’s **fate is thin (命薄)** and their **residence is inauspicious (宅恶)**, it is like an **ugly person wearing rags (丑人更又衣弊)**—how can they **endure (堪)**?

Thus, when selecting a **residence (人之居宅)**, one must **proceed with great caution (大须慎择)**.

It also says:
To **rectify (修)** the **approach path (来路)**, ensures **unfailing auspiciousness (无不吉)**.
To **transgress (犯)** the **blocking path (抵路)**, invites **no lasting security (未常安假)**.
For instance, if one **recently arrives (近)** from the **east (东)** and enters this **residence (宅)**, they should later **expand westward (修拓西方)**.
The **blocking path (抵路)**—if named **west (西)**—should instead be **rectified (修)** by **expanding eastward (拓东方)**, thus becoming the **approach path (来路)**.
Other **paths (余方)** that are **moved or altered (移转)**, along with **official visits (上官往来)**, regardless of **distance (远近)**, should follow this principle.

In matters of **marriage (婚嫁)**, purchasing **estates (庄田)**, **livestock (六畜)**, establishing **tomb domains (茔域)**, and **seeking official benefits (上官求利)**, all should **face the auspicious virtue/power direction (宅福德方)**. Over time, this brings **joy and blessings (吉庆)**.
If one **faces the auspicious (刑祸方)**, misfortune will **persist (久久不利)**.

One must also **avoid (忌)**:
A **tortoise-head hall (龟头厅)** situated on **land of the seventh heavenly stem (午地)** and **facing north (向北)** to **clash (冲)** with the **auspicious (日凶亭)**.
Even a **slightly elevated (稍高)** and **sturdy (坚)** dwelling is **inauspicious (不利)**.
The **precept (诀)** states: *"A tortoise-head hall on the seventh heavenly stem (龟头午) will **easily change ownership (易主)** or **harm the master (妨主)**."*
If such a hall exists in any **courtyard (院)**, it is **inauspicious (不吉)**.

Moreover, if a **residence (宅)** has **high towers or pavilions (高楼大榭)**** on the fourth heavenly stem (午)**, fifth heavenly stem (巳)**, or sixth heavenly stem (己)**—all facing **east (东)** or **south (巽)**—they are **inauspicious (不利)** and should be **removed (去之)** for **auspiciousness (吉)**.

It is also said: **"When undertaking construction or repairs (修造动治)**, one must **avoid (避)** the **Four Sovereign Gods (四王神)**, also known as **Imperial Chariot (帝车)**, **Imperial Bridle (帝辖)**, and **Imperial Shelter (帝舍)**.

If, for instance, in the **three months of spring (春三月)**, the **eastern direction (东方)** corresponds to the **Green Sovereign, Wood King (青帝木王)**, with **Tiger (寅)** as the **Imperial Chariot (车)**, **Rabbit (卯)** as the **Imperial Bridle (辖)**, and **Dragon (辰)** as the **Imperial Shelter (舍)**, then this is the case.

In the **first month (正月)**, **second month (二月)**, and **third month (三月)**, one must **not face east (不得东)**.

The *Hu Jīng* (户经) states:
*"Offending the **Imperial Chariot (帝车)** brings **parricide (杀父)**, offending the **Imperial Bridle (帝辖)** brings **matricide (杀母)**, offending the **Imperial Shelter (帝舍)** brings **harm to descendants (杀子孙)**."*

Similarly, **avoid (为忌)** these in the **three months of summer (夏)**, **three months of autumn (秋)**, and **three months of winter (冬)**.**

It is also said: **"Each year has twelve months (十二月), and each month has positions of **vital qi (生气)** and **death qi (死气)**."**

One should **modify (修)** the **auspicious month (月)** by aligning with the **position of vital qi (生气)**, inviting **fortune (福)**, and **harmonizing (集)** the **auspicious month (月)** with the **position of vital qi (生气)** and the **monthly Dao/Way of Heaven (天道月德)** to secure **auspicious paths (吉路)**.

If one **offends (犯)** the **position of death qi (死气)** in a month, **disaster (凶灾)** will ensue.

The **positions of vital qi (生气)** and **death qi (死气)** for each month are as follows:
- **First month (正月)**: Vital qi in **Rat, Gui (子癸)**, death qi in **Horse, Ding (午丁)**.
- **Second month (二月)**: Vital qi in **Ox, Gen (丑艮)**, death qi in **Sheep, Kun (未坤)**.
- **Third month (三月)**: Vital qi in **Tiger, Jia (寅甲)**, death qi in **Monkey, Gang (申庚)**.
- **Fourth month (四月)**: Vital qi in **Rabbit, Yi (卯乙)**, death qi in **Rooster, Xin (酉辛)**.
- **Fifth month (五月)**: Vital qi in **Dragon, Xun (辰巽)**, death qi in **Dog, Qian (戌乾)**.
- **Sixth month (六月)**: Vital qi in **Snake, Bing (已丙)**, death qi in **Pig, Ren (亥壬)**.
- **Seventh month (七月)**: Vital qi in **Horse, Ding (午丁)**, death qi in **Rat, Gui (子癸)**.
- **Eighth month (八月)**: Vital qi in **Sheep, Kun (未坤)**, death qi in **Ox, Gen (丑艮)**.
- **Ninth month (九月)**: Vital qi in **Monkey, Gang (申庚)**, death qi in **Tiger, Jia (寅甲)**.
- **Tenth month (十月)**: Vital qi in **Rooster, Xin (酉辛)**, death qi in **Rabbit, Yi (卯乙)**.
- **Eleventh month (十一月)**: Vital qi in **Dog, Qian (戌乾)**, death qi in **Dragon, Xun (辰巽)**.
- **Twelfth month (十二月)**: Vital qi in **Pig, Ren (亥壬)**, death qi in **Snake, Bing (巳丙)**.

**On the Construction of Walls and Residences**

In all matters of erecting walls and building homes, the direction struck by **Earth qi** shall bring misfortune to the household—one must then act according to the **Dao** to avert it.

- **First month (正月)**: Earth qi strikes the **Ding-Wei (丁未)** direction—repair on the **6th day (丁日)**.

The **Outer Qīnglóng (青龙)** thrives in cleanliness—incense burned, seats arranged—to attract guests and eminent **Daoists (高道)** and extraordinary individuals naturally.
