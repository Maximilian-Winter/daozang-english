**Comprehensive Divination of the Celestial Images and Star Canon, Fascicle One**
*(One folio missing at the beginning)*

The Four Auxiliary Stars embrace the Pivot Star of the Northern Culmen, governing the rites between ruler and minister, presiding over the myriad affairs of state, and manifesting the image of assisting and aiding the myriad realms. They serve as the Northern Asterism’s attendants, issuing and receiving governance.

The Six Jia Stars, six in number, lie beneath the Canopy of Flowers beside the Pole Star. They govern the division of yin and yang and their correspondence with the seasonal nodes. Their proximity to the Imperial Throne signifies their role in promulgating governance and teaching, as well as bestowing the agricultural seasons.

The Six Stars of the Curved Array lie beneath the Five Thearchs, representing the Empress and primary consort of the Grand Thearch of the Rear Palace. They further govern the Son of Heaven and the generals of the Six Armies, as well as the Three Dukes. If these stars dim, it portends a baleful omen for the ruler.

**Celestial August One (Tianhuang)**
The Celestial August One is a single star within the Curved Array. Though not counted among the numbered stars, it sits before the Five Thearchs, serving as the chart of the myriad spirits’ auxiliary records. Its spirit is called *Yaoguibao* (Radiant Ghost Treasure), and it governs the management of numinous grasses.

**The Historiographer Beneath the Pillar (Zhuxia)**
The Historiographer Beneath the Pillar lies east of the Northern Asterism, governing the Left and Right Historiographers, who record transgressions.

The Five Secretaries lie in the southeast quadrant, governing the reception of words and the deliberation of affairs day and night.

**The Inner Kitchen**

**The Inner Kitchen**
The Inner Kitchen comprises two stars, located in the northwest quadrant. It governs the beverages and foods of the Six Palaces, the banquets of the empress and consorts, and the imperial kitchens.

**The Celestial Bed**
The Celestial Bed consists of six stars, situated before the palace gates where the ruler holds court. It also governs repose, feasts, and rest. If these stars incline, the Son of Heaven will be unsettled and lose his position. As the verse states: *When fire enters the Purple Tenuity Palace, the realm falls into great chaos, and the Thearch loses his throne.*

**The Northern Dipper**
The Northern Dipper is called the *Seven Governors*, the feudal lords of Heaven, and also the *Imperial Chariot*. The four stars of the *Dipper’s Bowl* form the *Celestial Sphere*, while the three stars of the *Handle* are the *Jade Pivot*. Together, they regulate the Seven Governors, and the Dipper serves as the instrument by which the ruler issues decrees. It governs the proclamation of edicts, the enactment of policies throughout the heavens, and the oversight of the Four Quarters.

The first star is named *Celestial Pivot*, corresponding to the planet Saturn. It governs the yang virtue and is also called the *Governance Star*. It resembles the crown prince; if this star dims, a great calamity will strike within seven days.

The second star is named *Wandering*, governing metal, punishment, the yin, and the empress’s position. It also governs the moon and the law. If this star dims for six days, a lunar eclipse will occur.

The third star is named *Sphere*, governing wood and misfortune; it is also called the *Metal Star*. If the Son of Heaven fails to cherish the common people, this star will dim.

The fourth star is named *Authority*, governing fire and punitive expeditions, as well as the *Celestial Principle* of chastisement. If a wayless Thearch issues decrees contrary to the four seasons, this star will dim.

The fifth star is named *Pivot*, governing water and execution, aiding the four seasons. It executes those guilty of transgressions. If the Son of Heaven indulges in excessive pleasure, this star will dim.

The sixth star is named *Gate of Yang*, governing wood, the realm’s granaries, and the five grains.

The seventh star is named *Luminous Jade*, governing metal and also serving as the *Responsive Star*.

As the verse states: *When the ruler possesses virtue, the Dipper shines in perfect alignment, and the state prospers; when it dims, disaster arises in the land.*

To the right of the Dipper, if the *Junior Star* is few, lewdness and chaos will spread among the people, and decrees will go unheeded. If Jupiter guards the *Noble Person*, the realm will fall into turmoil. If Mars guards, wars will erupt, the lord will face disaster, and the people will have no means to live, abandoning their homes to flee to other cities. If Saturn guards the west of the Dipper, there will be great famine, and people will resort to cannibalism. If it guards the south, the five fruits will fail to ripen. If the five planets enter the Dipper, the Middle Kingdom will see a change of governance and ruler, and great chaos will ensue. If a comet or broom star enters the Dipper, the land will narrow, the lord will face great execution, and the first to raise arms will meet misfortune, while the last will prosper. The lord of that state will face great disaster, worse than the calamity of a comet. The misfortune of guarding its right side is severe; examine closely where it lingers.

The *Pivot* enters *Zhang* at one degree, eighteen degrees from the *North Star*. The *Crossbar* is fifteen degrees from the pole and eleven degrees from the celestial equator. The *Canopy* consists of sixteen stars, positioned above the *Five Emperors’ Thrones*; when aligned, it is auspicious, and the Dao of the Thearch flourishes. If the stars tilt, great misfortune will follow. The *Pole* of nine stars forms the handle of the *Canopy*. The upper seven stars govern the offices of the concubines’ sons. If the stars are bright, they will rectify the lord’s rule over the realm. If dim, the lord will face eight years of chaos, and the state will have no ruler.

The *Five Emperors’ Inner Thrones* lie beneath the *Canopy*, covering the *Emperors’ Seats*. When the Five Emperors share a throne, and the color above is correct, it is auspicious. If the color changes, it portends disaster and misfortune. The *Four Seats of the Imperial Consorts* lie north of the *Curved Array*, governing the eighty-one consorts of the Son of Heaven and the offices of the empress. Brightness is auspicious; dimness, inauspicious.

The *Celestial Pillars* of five stars reside within the *Purple Tenuity Palace*, near the eastern wall, governing the establishment of teachings and the twenty-four qi. The *Female Scribe*—one star—lies below the *Celestial Pillar* and north of the *Scribe*, recording the transmissions and movements within the palace and overseeing timely critical matters. The *Yin Virtue* of two stars, with the *Great Yin* west of the *Royal Secretary*, governs the realm’s laws, yin virtue, legacies, bestowed favors, and relief through wealth.

The *Grand Judges* of two stars lie within the palace gates, governing matters of punishment and imprisonment. From the *North Star* downward, fifty stars reside within and around the *Purple Tenuity Palace*. The divination states: If a comet or broom star enters the *Central Palace*, there will be a king of a different surname. If Mars enters and guards the *North Star*, ministers will slay the lord. If Jupiter enters and guards the *North Star*, the state will face great decline. If it divides and lingers, there will be treacherous ministers and rebellions. If Saturn encroaches upon it, great men will bear the consequences, and the heir apparent will be guilty. If the five planets gather in the *Central Palace*, the emperor will be replaced. If the five planets or visiting stars encroach upon and guard the *Curved Array*, high ministers will face misfortune, and all seats they encroach upon will suffer calamity.

The *Auxiliary Star* resembles a close minister aiding and illuminating the ruler. If it shines brightly and grows as large as a peck measure, ministers will seize power and wars will erupt. If it is dim and small, death or dismissal from office will follow. If it approaches the Dipper within one or two *cun*, it signifies ministers coercing the lord. If it is four to six *cun* distant, or if visiting stars or comets enter the Dipper, the feudal lords will contend for power and threaten the Son of Heaven. If the moon encircles the Dipper, great floods will enter the city, wars will erupt, and the lord will grant amnesty.

The sixth and seventh stars of the Dipper may lose their horns; the fourth, fifth, and sixth point south; the first and second point toward the *Beak*. There are twenty-nine stars in total. The *Inner Steps* of six stars lie north of *Wenchang*, forming the head of the *Hall of Enlightenment*. The *Wenchang* of seven stars, shaped like a half-moon, lies before the *Dipper’s Ladle*, serving as the *Celestial Storehouse* that plans the realm’s affairs. Its six stars each have names, governing the *Grand Judges* and the law. If their color is yellow and lustrous, the realm will be at peace, and all things will flourish. If they are green-black and faint, much destruction will follow. If they tremble and shift position, the Three Dukes will be executed; otherwise, the empress will perish. *Wenchang*, the *Three Dukes*, *Sheti*, and *Xuanyuan* form a single body for divination. If Jupiter or Saturn guards it, the realm will be at peace; if Mars guards, the state will fall into chaos and war. If Venus guards, great wars will erupt. If comets, broom stars, or meteors enter it, great generals will rebel.

The *Three Dukes* of three stars lie east of the Dipper’s handle, harmonizing yin and yang, aligning the seven governances, and instructing the people of the realm. If one star vanishes, the realm will be in peril; if two vanish, the realm will fall into chaos; if three vanish, the realm will be ungovernable.

The *Celestial Stake* of five stars should not be bright; if bright, wars will erupt in the realm, and axes and halberds will be wielded. The *Clubs* of eight stars are all extraordinary. They enter *Di* at one degree, twenty-eight degrees from the *North Star*. The *Celestial Spear* of three stars lies east of the Dipper’s handle, governing the celestial edge and military preparedness, positioned to the right of the *Purple Tenuity Palace* for defense.

The *Transit Lodgings* of nine stars lie north of *Xizhong* beneath the *Canopy*, near the *Celestial River*, governing guest lodgings. If visiting stars guard them, wars will erupt, and the lodgings of the four directions will be affected. The *Celestial Kitchen* of six stars lies at the northeastern corner of the *Purple Tenuity Palace*, near the north of the *Transit Lodgings*. It represents the kitchens of the hundred officials, now modeled after the *Directorate of Imperial Banquets*. If the stars vanish, nobles will sell their clothes, and commoners will sell their wives and children; great famine will follow. If visiting stars guard them, there will be severe famine.

The *Celestial Unity*—one star—lies outside the gate of the *Purple Tenuity Palace* to the right, called the south, serving as the spirit of the Celestial Thearch, governing battles and foreknowing good and ill fortune. Brightness is auspicious; dimness, inauspicious. If it departs from its position and rides behind the Dipper, within ninety days great wars will erupt. If luminous, yin and yang will harmonize, all things will flourish, and the Son of Heaven will be auspicious. If the star vanishes, the realm will fall into chaos, and great misfortune will follow.

The *Great Unity*—one star—lies half a degree south of *Celestial Unity*, serving as the spirit of the Celestial Thearch, governing the sixteen spirits, and foreknowing wind and rain, floods and droughts, wars and horses, famines and plagues, disasters and harms. If it resides in a state, brightness is auspicious; dimness, inauspicious. If it departs from its position and rides the Dipper, within ninety days great wars will erupt. The *Great Unity* enters *Han* at ten degrees, fifteen and a half degrees from the *North Star*; the *Great Unity* is eleven degrees from the *North Star*.

The *Celestial Penitentiary* consists of six stars, located beneath the *Dipper’s* *Kui* asterism. It governs the imprisonment of nobles and shares its divination with the *Chain of Stars*, presiding over forbidden longings and treacherous ambitions. If Mars lingers within it, the people will resort to cannibalism, though a pardon may follow.

The Eastern Palace’s seven lodges comprise thirty-three stars spanning seventy-five degrees, encompassing inner and outer courts, auxiliary seats, and the like. The *Horn* consists of two stars, forming the *Celestial Gate* and the *Longevity Star* of Venus. In spring and summer, it governs fire; in autumn and winter, water. It is the horn of the *Azure Dragon*. The southern left horn of the Eastern Palace’s first lodge is called *Celestial Ford*, its azure hue marking it as the chief of the stellar ranks. The northern right horn is the *Celestial Gate*, its yellow center named the *Celestial Pass*. The left governs the *Celestial Fields*, the right the *Celestial Spirits*, spanning thirteen degrees. In the eighth month, the sun lies to its north, ninety-one degrees from the *North Star*.

All the sun, moon, and five planets traverse the *Celestial Pass*. This is the *Yellow Path*; if they enter it, drought follows. Two degrees south of the *Horn* lies the *Path of the Great Yang*; entering the *Yin Path* brings floods. Two degrees north of the *Horn* is the *Yin Path*. When the *Horn* points directly at *Chen*, it signals the time for plowing and sowing. Next comes the *Minister of Agriculture*. If bright, the king’s Dao prevails, and great peace ensues. If dim, vanished, or trembling, the ruler loses governance. If the stars are faint and small, the state weakens, governance falters, and the king’s Dao fails. When the sun or moon enters the *Horn* in spring and forms a halo, the king loses governance. If an eclipse occurs within the *Horn*, the realm will not be at peace.

If Jupiter lingers, a seven-*jin* amnesty is granted, and loyal ministers are employed. If Mars lingers, loyal ministers and worthy chancellors are executed, silk becomes dear, battles erupt, and armies of ten thousand rise—timed by the day—while palace thefts and internal strife arise. If Mars lingers in the *Horn*’s palace, roads become impassable, great rings and distant hooks form, and the state suffers famine. If Mars invades, war is certain. If it lingers at the left horn, the Grand Commandant dies, and the state is imperiled. If at the right horn, the five grains fail to ripen, and great floods occur. If it invades either horn, drought follows, ministers plot war but fail, and are executed. If Saturn lingers, internal joy arises, but after sixty days, the state engages in bitter disputes. If Venus lingers, wars rage across the realm, and the state faces strife. If Venus and Mars conjoin, with Venus trailing, generals are slain. If Mercury lingers, the ruler’s punishments grow harsh, and floods, plagues, and epidemics follow.

If a guest comet or broom star enters the *Horn* and turns white, the state will face war, great mourning, or military defeat and city walls’ collapse. If a guest star lingers, after forty-five days drought comes, the five grains wither, winds and rains arrive untimely, and locusts arise. If a star streams out from the *Horn*’s gate, the Son of Heaven dispatches envoys abroad.

If a star enters the *Horn*’s gate from another constellation, foreign envoys arrive at the capital, or a close minister is slain, and the ruler dies in battle. If the Moon eclipses Mars, a treacherous minister lurks in the palace—neither bandit nor thief. If the Moon enters the *Celestial Market* or the *River* and is encircled by a halo, war erupts thrice, roads across the realm are severed, and generals suffer defeat.

The four stars of *Heavenly Principle* lie within the handle of the *Northern Dipper*, governing nobles and officials of the law. Their brilliance is ill-omened: if bright, high ministers face punishment. The four stars of *Law Enforcers* stand northwest of the *Great Yang*’s head, overseeing those who administer punishments and legal governance. They assist in proclaiming the ruler’s decrees and serve as inner attendants.

The *Great Yang* (●), when stationed in the northwest, presides over great ministers and generals, preparing for unforeseen affairs across the realm. Its brightness bodes well; dimness, ill. If it shifts, war arises, and the central kingdom grows restless. It enters the *Wings* at thirteen degrees, forty-five degrees from the *North Pole*.

The *Prime Minister* (●) star lies south of the *Northern Dipper*’s *Pole*, overseeing all offices, upholding state teachings, aiding the emperor, pacifying the realm, and consolidating affairs as the chief minister’s deputy. Its brightness is auspicious; dimness, ominous. If the *Prime Minister* star vanishes, death follows—or else it streams away. The *Great Yang* enters the *Wings* at thirteen degrees, forty-five degrees from the *North Star*; the *Prime Minister* enters the *Wings* at one degree, thirty-one degrees from the *North Star*.

The two stars of *Even Path* lie between the *Horn*, governing officials of the Luo Road. The single star of *Promoting Worthies* (●) stands at the western wall of *Even Path*, overseeing ministers, recommendations, reclusive scholars, and academicians. When bright, worthy scholars are employed; when dim, petty men prevail.

The two stars of *Heavenly Gate* lie south of the left *Horn*, governing the celestial gate and the site of court audiences and diplomatic exchanges. The two stars of *Heavenly Fields* lie north of the *Horn*, governing the imperial domain, its left bordering frontier cities and borderlands. The three stars of *Zhou Tripod*, shaped like clouds or tripod legs, lie west of *Great Horn* and *Supporting Handles*, governing the sacred tripod.

The *Armory* constellation comprises twenty-eight stars: fifteen *Armory Towers*, fifteen *Pillars*, and four *Balances*, located south of the *Horn*, southeast of the *Wings*, and east of the *Next Instrument Storehouse*. It is also called the *Repository of Military Chariots*; when densely populated, great wars arise. If no stars occupy the armory, ministers below plot rebellion, and all troops are deployed—no one remains in the realm to avert disaster. If the *Pillars* within the armory stir, weapons are drawn against the Four Barbarians. If half the *Pillars* are missing, the Son of Heaven personally leads half the army into battle. If Jupiter lingers, people starve, and grain grows dear. It enters the *Wings* at one degree west, forty-nine degrees from the *North Star*, culminating in the west eighty-nine degrees from the *North Star*.

The six stars of *Supporting Handles* lie northeast of the *Horn* and *Neck*, governing the Nine Ministers, armor, weapons, regulations, and the establishment of seasonal omens. If Mars lingers, the realm changes rulers. If Venus lingers, war erupts.

The single star of *Great Horn* (●), the *Celestial Ridgepole*, lies amid the *Supporting Handles*, governing the imperial throne. If Venus lingers, great wars arise. If the Moon eclipses it, the ruler dreads and abhors the omen. It enters the *Neck* at three and a half degrees, fifty-nine degrees from the *North Star*.

The three stars of *Imperial Couch* lie north of *Great Horn*; if dim, the realm is at peace. Their brilliance is ill-omened: if bright, nobles and lords face misfortune. The six stars of *Neck Pool* lie north of the *Neck*, governing the rites of sending off and welcoming. The seven stars of *Breaking Might* lie south of the *Neck*, governing imperial prisons, executions, and the deaths of frontier generals. The two stars of *Yang Gate* lie northeast of the *Armory*, overseeing border defenses and banditry. The three stars of *Battle Chariots* lie south of the *Clan*, governing war chariots.

The four stars of the *Neck* are called the *Celestial Storehouse*, also known as the *Celestial Court*, governing the Four Seas. Mars is its namesake star; in spring and summer, it corresponds to water; in autumn and winter, to metal. If dim, the state grows weak and disordered. If bright, the realm is at peace. If the Sun or Moon eclipses the *Neck*, the central kingdom faces turmoil. If the Five Planets trespass or move retrograde against the *Neck*, the ruler grieves over lost lands, and great ministers are dismissed.

If Jupiter lingers for thirty days or more, amnesty is granted, and the year is bountiful; prolonged lingering brings dear grain, widespread illness, and floods. If Jupiter and Mars conjoin, crops fail, people perish like grass and trees, and floods follow. If Mars lingers, heavy rains fall, and wars across the realm cease only to erupt anew. If Mercury lingers, grain grows dear in its region; prolonged lingering brings illness and great floods. If Saturn lingers, all things fail to ripen, and illness spreads. If Venus lingers, roads are blocked, war erupts, bandits and thieves arise, and floods harm the people. If Venus enters the southern path, crops wither, red droughts strike, and people flee. If comets or broom stars trespass, war erupts in that state, and ministers rebel within a year. If the Moon’s halo encircles its light, generals act on their own, campaigns fail beyond a hundred *li*, and troops perish.

The three stars of *Obstructing River* lie north of *Great Horn* and the *Imperial Throne*, governing the emperor’s vanguard and also barbarian troops and funeral dates. If *Obstructing River* departs, separation brings fortune; convergence, war. If a guest star lingers, the age grows chaotic.

The twenty-seven stars of *Cavalry Officers* lie south of the *Clan*, governing the emperor’s mounted guards, the sons of noble clans, and the imperial retinue, mirroring the Three Guards. When numerous, the realm is at peace; when few, war erupts.

If the Five Planets converge here, war arises in the northwest. It enters *Northern Culmen* at 115 degrees.

**General of Chariots and Cavalry**●
The star of the *General of Chariots and Cavalry* lies southeast of *Cavalry Officers*, governing the office of the general of chariots and cavalry. The three stars of *Chariots and Cavalry* lie south of *Cavalry Officers*, overseeing the affairs of chariots, cavalry, and military campaigns.

The four stars of *Western Barrier* lie east of *Clan*, governing the regulation of licentiousness. The southern star enters *Clan* at five degrees, 93 degrees from *Northern Culmen*.

The seven stars of *Seven Excellencies* lie east of *Beckoning Shaft* and north of *Clan*, serving as *Celestial Chancellors* and overseeing the good and evil of the Three Dukes and ten policies. When bright, deliberations are thorough. If stars enter the *River*, rice grows costly, and people resort to cannibalism. If Venus lingers, the realm falls into chaos and war. The western star enters *Clan* at four degrees, 49 degrees from *Northern Culmen*.

The twelve stars of *Massed Soldiers* lie southeast of *Clan*. When faint and small, it is auspicious; if bright and trembling, the court faces war. If faint and small: one star lost means half the troops depart; two stars lost, most troops depart; three stars lost, all troops depart. If the Five Planets converge, war arises. The stars enter *Clan* at thirteen degrees west, 124 degrees from *Northern Culmen*.

**House**●
The four stars of *House* are called *Celestial Storehouse*, governing the four directions. Alternate names: *Celestial Banner*, *Celestial Team*, *Celestial Dragon*, *Celestial Horse*, *Celestial Balance*, and *Hall of Light*. It is the fire star: in spring and summer, water; in autumn and winter, fire. *House* serves as the four markers, with three paths—the constant routes of the Sun, Moon, and Five Planets.

The first star above is called *Right Harness*, the *Deputy General*, also named *Upper Yang Path*. The second is *Right Shaft*, the *Chief Minister*, also named *Middle Path*. The third is *Left Harness*, the *Deputy General*, also named *Lower Path*. The fourth is *Left Shaft*, the *Chief Minister*, overseeing the *Four Assistants*. *Left Pennant* and *Left Harness* indicate the east and south are fit for war; *Right Shaft* and *Right Harness* indicate the west and north are unfit for war.

**Dark Lance**●
The single star of *Dark Lance* lies north of *Beckoning Shaft*, also called *Minister’s Lance*. If the Five Planets converge, war arises. If the star brightens and stirs, the northern tribes rebel. It enters *Clan* at one degree, 42 degrees from *Northern Culmen*.

**Beckoning Shaft**●
The star of *Beckoning Shaft* lies north of *Obstructing River*, governing the northern tribes’ troops. If its rays sharpen and stir, armies march. It enters *Clan* at two degrees, 41 degrees from *Northern Culmen*.

The two stars of *Zhuanxu* lie southeast of *Broken Might*, governing prison officials and the examination of prisoners, beatings, and truth from falsehood.

**Clan**●
The four stars of *Clan* form the *Celestial Lodging Palace*, also called *Celestial Root* and *Celestial Tally*. It is the wood star: in spring and summer, wood; in autumn and winter, water. It governs the empress, consorts, and concubines. The two foremost large stars represent the principal consort; the two behind, when bright, signify ministers serving the ruler peacefully. If dim, ministers lose power; if stirring, ministers flee the state. If the Sun or Moon passes through *Clan*, the ruler incurs misfortune.

If Jupiter lingers, the empress rejoices. If it guards for twenty days, the ruler’s travels are inauspicious; if swift, governance is delayed, and ministers fulfill their duties. If it remains fixed, feudal lords will vie for kingship. If Mars lingers, ministers conspire against one another. If it moves and reddens, a great minister perishes. If it guards for sixty days, a great amnesty occurs. If Mars enters, a treacherous minister stirs rebellion, soon within a year, or later within two.

If Venus lingers, war arises, and generals receive titles in the fire position. If Mercury lingers, great floods inundate palaces and halls, and the myriad things fail to thrive. If Mercury enters, noble ministers grieve, and legal cases arise. If a guest star lingers, cloth and silk grow costly. If Saturn lingers, a crown prince is established. If it guards for eighty days or more, the state faces war.

If comets or broom stars pass through *Clan*, the rear palace harbors unusual troops. If they stir, within 180 days, the court suffers floods. If the halo of the Moon encircles *Clan* in Dongping, the great general meets misfortune, and many fall ill.

The two stars of *Lock and Bell* govern the law, seven *cun* from *House*. The first is called *Celestial Strength*, the second *Celestial Office*. If the lock opens the storehouse, or if close, husband and wife share hearts; if distant, they grow estranged. If bright, ministers fulfill their duties, and the realm’s Way is harmonious. If dim, ministers disrupt governance, and the ruler’s Way falters.

If the Sun or Moon eclipses within *House*, the ruler grows chaotic and dim, and ministers usurp power. If Jupiter lingers, the realm knows peace. If it remains for forty days, the five grains flourish, people are safe and auspicious, and free from illness. The ruler’s decrees bring virtue, with the appointed time in the fourth month.

If Mars lingers, war arises; within seven days, great mourning and amnesty follow. If it guards for ten days, high officials face disaster. If it does not depart for twenty days, ministers rebel, and the ruler’s sons grow restless; the ruler fears chaos, and the state suffers drought. If it halts for a single day, ministers stir rebellion.

If Saturn lingers, the ruler’s concubines cause chaos, drought, and earthquakes. If it guards long, war arises. If Venus lingers, the ruler undertakes great earthworks, the state falls into chaos, and cloth and silk grow costly. If it guards long, people starve, and the ruler is replaced.

If Mars lingers, treacherous ministers plot against the ruler, great ministers slander and execute one another, and ministers assist the realm. If it departs or exits between *House* and *Heart*, the earth quakes. If a guest star lingers, rice grows tenfold in price.

If the Sun, Moon, or Five Planets trespass *House* with a blue hue, the state grieves over war and mourning. If white, great armies slaughter one another, piling corpses like hills. If comets or broom stars enter *House*, the state teeters, and people turn on one another.

If a shooting star enters *House* and moves west, a madman appears; the ruler kills loyal ministers, ministers kill the ruler, or chief ministers perish. The distant term is three years, commonly observed in the third month.

If the Sun or Moon exits *House* south of the markers, great drought and mourning follow; if north, disaster strikes ten thousand *li* away, with war, yin rains, and chaos. If they exit the middle path, peace reigns in Xu and Yingzhou.

If the Moon’s halo encircles *House* and *Heart*, plague and calamity strike, with the ninth month’s sun at five degrees.

This lies 144.5 degrees north of the North Star.

The three *Punishment* stars, positioned below the eastern *Seal* and aligned north-south, govern the receipt of gold fines, cloth taxes, and market levies.

The four eastern *Seal* stars, northeast of *House*, oversee the prevention of licentiousness. If Jupiter lingers in the north and trembles, the Son of Heaven indulges in excessive debauchery.

If a star enters *Heart* two degrees to the south, 103 degrees from the North Star, the event occurs within 180 days at its soonest, or within three years at its latest, arising in Song, Bian, and neighboring prefectures.

**Celestial Teat**
The *Celestial Teat* star, north of *Root*, governs sweet dew. At fifteen degrees and twelve minutes, its westernmost star lies 96 degrees from the North Star. The aforementioned pertains to the *Celestial Teat* in particular.

The nine *Chain Shackles* stars, before the *Seven Excellencies*, serve as the prison for malefactors. The single star at the prison’s mouth acts as its gate; when open, amnesty follows. If amnesty is granted, the master grieves. If the prison’s gate closes or the mouth-star enters the shackles, self-strangulation occurs. Observe this on the five *zi* days and nights. If one star vanishes, joyous events arise; if two vanish, matters of rank follow; if three vanish, amnesty is granted. For *jia* and *geng* days, the term is eighty days; for *bing* and *xin*, seventy days; for *wu* and *ren*, sixty days. If stars enter the River, cannibalism ensues. When all nine stars appear together, legal affairs multiply. If Mercury lingers, water disasters strike; if Mars lingers, grain prices soar. A great star emerging from the shackles heralds a grand amnesty; a small star portends minor clemency, contemplation of demotion, or fear of slander.

This star enters *Tail* at one degree, 55 degrees from the North Star.

The two *Shaman Officials* stars, southwest of *House*, oversee the duties of physicians and shamans.

The three *Celestial Blessings* stars, west of *House*, govern the officials of imperial carriages and regalia.

**Lock and Bolt**
The *Lock and Bolt* star, northeast of *House*, governs keys and locks. It must not shine brightly; if bright, internal strife arises, gates fail to secure, and licentiousness spreads among women.

The three *Heart* stars, at mid-heaven, with the foremost as the Crown Prince and the rearmost as the common prince, belong to the Fire Star. In spring and summer, they align with Wood; in autumn and winter, with Water. Also called *Great Fire*, *Great Star*, or *Quail Fire*. The central star, when bright, large, and crimson, reflects the Son of Heaven’s virtuous conduct; when dim, small, or discolored, it signifies the ruler’s weakness and indecision. The stars must not align straight; if straight, the ruler loses strategy. If they tremble, the Son of Heaven grieves. If Jupiter lingers, the realm knows peace. Prolonged lingering, with encroachment, signals ministers plotting against the ruler and great armies rising. If Mars lingers, earthquakes strike. After twenty days, ministers conspire against the ruler. If black, it portends the ruler’s demise. If Saturn lingers, a sage emperor and wise ministers emerge, bringing peace to the realm. Some say: if amnesty is granted but the star lingers, worry over treachery arises; the land suffers great drought. If Venus lingers, mountains collapse and armies rise on all sides. After lingering twenty days or more, if three *cun* from *Heart*, armies clash in hook formations upon the palace halls. The term is eighty days, with great beast disasters and famine. If Mercury encroaches, water disasters, drought, and war arise, with cloth and silk prices soaring. If a guest star lingers or encroaches, great drought scorches the earth for a thousand *li*. When the Sun, Moon, or five planets traverse *Heart*, losses accumulate. If red halos, rainbows, or inverted arcs eclipse it, famine, war, ministerial rebellion, dynastic change, and the ruler’s demise follow. If the Moon pierces *Heart*, internal strife erupts. If comets or broom stars enter *Heart*, the ruler grieves, mourns, and ministers are deposed or *Heart* transforms. The response arrives swiftly, within seven days.

The *Celestial Market Wall*, comprising fifty-six stars north of *House* and *Heart*, governs scales and measures, also called *Celestial Banner*. When bright, grain prices rise. If stars crowd the market, the year is bountiful. If the five planets enter the market gate, war erupts. If fiery rays or red qi enter, great disasters strike. If Mars lingers, grain prices soar. All encroachments upon its position foretell events at the gates.

The left star enters *Tail* at one degree, 94 degrees from the North Star.

The *Observer* star, east of the market, governs assistant ministers and officials of yin-yang law. When bright, assistant ministers grow strong; when dim, they weaken.

It enters *Winnowing Basket* at three degrees, 72 degrees from the North Star.

The four *Eunuch* stars, southwest of the *Emperor’s Seat*, attend beside the throne, entering *Tail* at twelve degrees.

The five *Measure* stars, southwest of the *Eunuch* stars, govern weighing and measuring. If the western *Measure* star brightens, the latter reign prospers; if the *Measure* stars vanish, crops fail to ripen.

They enter *Tail* at ten degrees.

The four *Clansmen* stars, east of *Clan Governance*, oversee ancestral sacrifices. If they move, the emperor personally grieves.

The two *Clan Rectifiers*, southeast of the *Emperor’s Seat*, govern the Grand Masters of the Clan Rectification Office. If dim, the royal chambers and ancestral temples face affairs.

Here ends the first scroll of *Comprehensive Observations of Celestial Portents and Astrological Canons*.

**Comprehensive Observations of Celestial Portents and Astrological Canons, Scroll Two**

The two *Butcher’s Stalls* stars lie north of *Silk Measure*, governing the station of slaughter. The six *Market Tower* stars stand within the market gate, overseeing the administration of commerce and the duties of market officials.

The four *Hú* stars lie south of the *Northern Dipper*, governing matters of measured grain.

All the above stars reside within the market.

The three *Women’s Beds* stars lie north of *Celestial Discipline*, overseeing the bearing of daughters in the rear palace and attending the emperor and empress. If bright, palace women grow unruly.

They enter *Winnowing Basket* at one degree, fifty-three degrees from the *North Star*.

**Emperor’s Seat**
The *Emperor’s Seat* is a single star within the market, revered by *Shennong*. If its color is bright and lustrous, the Son of Heaven’s authority prevails. If faint and small, misfortune follows; if vanished, great calamity ensues.

It enters *Tail* at fifteen degrees, seventy-one degrees from the *North Star*.

The two *Clan* stars lie east of *Observer*, governing the imperial lineage and the ministers of the emperor’s bloodline, who record the ranks of royal kinsmen. If bright, the clan maintains order; if dim, the clan faces sorrow.

The two *Market Stalls* stars lie northwest of *Hú*, governing the trade of treasures, gold, and jade.

The two *Eastern Stalls* stars lie west of the left star of the palace gate’s wall, governing officials who regulate market prices.

The two *Silk Measure* stars lie northeast of the *Clan* stars, governing fair measurement.

The nine *Celestial Discipline* stars lie east of *Linked Chain*, overseeing the governance of the Nine Ministers and all matters of state discipline, adjudicating grievances and lawsuits. If connected to *Linked Chain* by a cord, earthquakes occur within two years. The stars must not shine too brightly, lest the realm breed resentment. If vanished, the state’s governance collapses.

They enter *Tail* in the west at five degrees, fifty-one degrees from the *North Star*.

The five *Celestial Cudgels* stars lie northeast of *Women’s Beds*, governing wrath, punishment, and defense against royal crises, preparing for the extraordinary. If bright and large, there is sorrow; if faint and small, fortune prevails, though their brightness is unwelcome.

If Mars lingers, war arises. It enters *Winnowing Basket* at eight degrees, twelve degrees from the *North Star*. In spring and summer, it is fire; in autumn and winter, water—governing the inception of the eight winds. Another name: *Splitting Wood*.

The three *Celestial Cords* stars lie north of *Tail*, behind the Dipper’s handle. If scattered, the realm’s names and reputations fade.

The four *Celestial River* stars lie north of *Tail*, governing the Great Yin. If bright and restless, floods rage unchecked, armies mobilize incompletely, and the realm’s bridges and ferries fail. The southern star enters *Tail* at six degrees, one hundred eleven degrees from the *North Star*.

The six *Celestial Turtle* stars lie south of *Tail* in the Milky Way, governing divination of fortune and misfortune, and the harmony of ruler and minister. If Mars lingers, drought and flood strike. It enters *Tail* at twelve degrees, one hundred forty-one degrees from the *North Star*.

The single *Celestial Fish* star lies in the Milky Way near *Tail*, governing clouds and rain, regulating yin and yang, and overseeing rivers and seas. When the *Celestial Fish* stirs, sudden floods arise. If Mars lingers, the south suffers drought while the north floods.

The nine *Dragon’s Tail* stars form the rear palace. The first is the Empress; the next three, the Ladies of the Palace; the next nine, the Consorts; and the rest, concubines. Another name: *Imperial Clan*—a water star. The second is *Wind’s Aftermath*; the third, *Celestial Rooster*; the fourth, *Celestial Hound*; the fifth, *Grand Ancestral Temple*. All should shine brightly. If their sizes align in succession, the court abounds with descendants.

The *Tradition* states: one star lies two *cun* east of the second, the smaller being the elder. If bright, ministers aid governance with loyalty; if dim, courtiers disrupt the state. If Jupiter lingers, the heir is named, but within thirty days the imperial clan rebels, concubines sell power, and ministers plunge the state into chaos. If Mars lingers, armies face off, and ministers grieve. When fire and water converge between *Winnowing Basket* and *Tail*, at the *Nine Rivers’ Mouth*, amnesty is granted. If they clash or break apart, the realm falls into chaos and drought.

If Saturn lingers, bandits multiply, drought strikes, and the palace sees dismissals. If Saturn enters, salt and fish grow costly, war begins, and generals march. If Saturn, Mars, and Venus converge at the *Level Star*, the people rebel, and ministers alter governance with disastrous results.

If Mercury lingers, the realm suffers floods, rivers overflow, and fish and grain grow dear. If a guest star lingers, bandits turn violent and rise in power. If it enters, the realm faces famine, cannibalism, plague, and exile; fields lie fallow, the learned sell their robes, and the poor sell their wives and children.

If the sun or moon is eclipsed in *Tail*, high ministers are implicated. If halos encircle and invert, or rainbows turn their backs on *Tail*, generals and ministers face turmoil, followed by mourning.

If comets or broom stars trespass, high ministers are executed, inner favorites disrupt governance, and the regions of Youzhou, Dingzhou, Jizhou, and Liaodong respond in kind.

The four *Winnowing Basket* stars govern the Empress, her separate household of twenty-seven consorts, and eighty-one handmaidens, serving as the celestial mouth of the rear palace. They also form the *Celestial River’s Nine Rivers’ Mouth*, governing the *Liang* region along the Han’s edge—a metal star. In spring and summer, it is metal; in autumn and winter, earth. When the rear of *Winnowing Basket* stirs, wind arises within three days. The two front stars represent the Empress.

If *Winnowing Basket* enters the Milky Way, great famine follows, and people devour one another. Its front is also called the *Chaff Star*. If bright and large, the year is abundant; if faint and small, the realm starves, and grain vanishes.

If Jupiter lingers in the palace, disputes arise. If Mars lingers, the realm starves. If it lingers long, forming a hook or circle, high ministers are executed. If Mars lingers, great floods surge, drowning marshes. If it lingers in the tenth month, floods double grain prices and famine follows.

If Saturn and Mercury linger together, the harvest fails, and famine comes. If they linger long, war erupts, grain prices soar, or amnesty is declared. If Venus enters and lingers, war begins, amnesty is granted, and ministers change. If it lingers long, wind and drought strike, and internal rebellion threatens governance.

If Mercury lingers, the harvest fails, and ministers grieve. If a guest star lingers, the realm faces famine, grain prices rise tenfold, cannibalism spreads, and refugees flee to other cities, abandoning plows. If red, great storms and rain arise; if the guest star lies in the south, drought follows.

If the sun, moon, or five planets enter *Winnowing Basket* at mid-heaven, war erupts in Cangzhou and Luoyang; the regions of Xuantu and Guangling respond in kind.

The six *Establishment* stars lie north of *Southern Dipper*, serving as the celestial capital where the three luminaries’ paths open. They govern the movements and missteps of the seven luminaries. On the *jiazi* day of the eleventh month, the winter solstice’s great response begins here, the starting lodge of governance.

If Jupiter lingers, floods come, grain grows dear, and illness spreads. If Venus lingers, the harvest fails. If baleful stars linger long, misfortune follows. If Mercury lingers, people starve and wander. The stars enter *Dipper* at seven degrees, one hundred thirteen degrees from the *North Star*.

The nine *Celestial Market Official* stars lie near *Establishment* by the river, governing the chief of market affairs. If dim, misfortune strikes, and all things vanish. If bright and large, all things flourish, and trade thrives.

The two *Celestial Hound* stars lie before *Dipper’s Ladle*, governing the relocation of ministers. If ministers rebel, the hounds cause chaos.

The four *Hound State* stars lie southeast of *Establishment*, governing the Xianbei, Han, and Wuhuan. If bright, border wars erupt.

The seven *Celestial Lock* stars lie west of the second star of *Dipper’s Handle*, governing the opening and closing of gates and locks. If bright, fortune follows; if dim, disaster strikes.

The fifteen *Celestial Soft-shelled Turtle* stars lie south of *Dipper*, governing the Great Yin’s water creatures. If not in the Milky Way, water and fire disasters strike. If white, clothing and food abound.

If stars appear large, people perish. If Mars lingers, drought ensues. When Mercury approaches, fire disasters strike. It enters *Dipper* at one degree, lying 127 degrees from the North Star.

The four *Gradual Terrace* stars belong to the eastern foot of *Weaving Girl*, governing faults, leaks, pitch pipes, and yin-yang affairs. The five *Processional Way* stars belong to the western foot of *Weaving Girl*, governing the imperial thoroughfares for leisure and amusement.

The three *Pestle* stars lie south of *Winnowing Basket*, governing the pounding of grain in mortars. If the stars shift, people lose their cooking pots, fields lie fallow, and great famine follows. If they linger, the realm suffers hunger. The northern star enters *Winnowing Basket* at one degree, lying 143 degrees from the North Star.

The single *Agricultural Elder* star lies south of *Dipper*, governing the offices of agricultural administration, rectification of policies, and the Minister of Agriculture.

The seven lunar lodges of the northern quadrant comprise thirty-five stars, spanning ninety-eight degrees, seventy-five degrees, and fifty *miao*.

The six *Southern Dipper* stars govern the Son of Heaven’s lifespan and are also said to preside over the ranks and emoluments of prime ministers. Master Wu Xian states:

Jupiter, in spring and summer a wood star, in autumn and winter a water star, is also called *Celestial Axe*, *Celestial Watchtower*, or *Celestial Mechanism*. When bright, the kingly Way is harmonious, generals and ministers unite in purpose, the emperor’s mandate endures, and the realm knows peace. When dim, high ministers lose their positions, and the realm is shaken. If its rays quiver, the state loses loyal ministers, and the realm grieves. If Jupiter lingers, after sixty days high ministers gain rank and longevity. If Jupiter retrogrades into *Dipper’s Ladle*, high ministers rebel. Prolonged lingering brings war, floods, great famine, and cannibalism.

If Mars lingers, the state faces internal strife, ministers are unsettled, and war erupts. If Mars retrogrades or lingers in opposition, or if it encircles distant cities, generals and ministers perish, and the state suffers calamity. Prolonged lingering by Mars severs the royal line.

If Saturn lingers within *Dipper*, a king who refrains from war ascends the throne. If it lingers, after ninety days war erupts and floods follow.

If Venus lingers, law-enforcing ministers rebel, the state falls into chaos, war erupts, and amnesty is granted. If Mars and Venus both enter *Dipper*, it is called *Melting*—ministers or sons will rebel. If they linger long or Mars swiftly departs, disasters swiftly subside.

If Mercury lingers, floods follow. If Mars enters *Dipper*, war arises in Wu and Yue, and people suffer great famine. If it lingers as a guest star, war severs roads, sudden floods strike, bandits and thieves multiply, brothers attack one another, sons kill fathers, or the ruler perishes, and grain grows dear. Prolonged lingering severs the royal line. If a guest star lingers at the second star, great floods bring cannibalism. If a red guest star enters *Dipper*, war erupts and generals die. If the sun or moon enters *Dipper*, high ministers lose their positions or are executed. If an eclipse occurs within *Dipper*, or if the sun’s baleful influence or the moon’s halo encircles it, people are exiled a thousand *li*, and the regions of Jiang, Chi, Zhou, Yang, Yue, Lu, and Hong respond.

The ten *Celestial Springs* stars lie east of *Soft-shelled Turtle*—one day’s journey to the Great Sea—governing irrigation and canals.

The three *Weaving Girl* stars lie east of *Celestial Market*, weaving the celestial threads, governing water caltrops, fruits, silk, and treasures, as well as feminine transformations. When bright and large, the realm knows peace. They regularly appear in the east on the sixth or seventh day of the first and seventh months. If their color is red and their essence clear, women’s work prospers. If one star presides, war erupts and women are conscripted. If they face *Supporting Frame*, all is well; if not, silk and cloth grow twice as dear. If Mars lingers, cloth becomes dear, war lasts ten years before ceasing, and the princess grieves. If a guest star lingers, silk and cloth grow dear. They enter at twenty-seven degrees, lying fifty-one degrees from the North Star.

The six *Oxherd* stars govern the gates of Liang, also overseeing great roads and, centrally, cattle. Jupiter, in spring and summer a wood star, in autumn and winter a fire star. The central fire star initiates governance; the sun, moon, and five planets begin their courses here. If stars drift far from the Milky Way, cattle grow dear across the realm. When bright, they grow dearer still; when dim and small, bandits enter the Milky Way, conscripts die at their posts, and grain prices soar—rice, wheat, and millet grow dear. If their color is irregular, cattle die in great numbers, and grain fails. If Jupiter lingers, the realm knows peace. Prolonged lingering brings floods, people freeze to death, grain grows dear, children are sold, tigers harm people, and ministers plot against the ruler. If Jupiter retrogrades and lingers, floods block roads. If Mars lingers, old ministers rebel, cattle grow ten times dearer, cannibalism spreads, war erupts, generals die, great floods strike, and ferries and bridges fail. If Saturn lingers, ministers plot against the ruler, and the lord loses loyal ministers. If Venus lingers, earth’s qi leaks, war reaches the city walls, and many perish. If Mercury lingers, floods follow. Mercury typically appears near *Oxherd* at winter dawn; if it fails to appear, the next year’s harvest will fail, and great floods will cause damage. If a guest star lingers, war erupts within twenty days. If a comet traverses *Oxherd*, war reaches Yue, and a new king arises. If a comet emerges from *Oxherd*, after seventy days governance will change. If a rainbow appears at *Oxherd*, a city will collapse near the Huai River. If the moon’s halo encircles *Oxherd* tenfold, younger brothers suffer harm—an omen of disaster. It spans eight degrees, culminating at the center of *Dipper* at dusk in the eighth month, lying 110 degrees from the North Star.

The seven *Supporting Frame* stars lie east of *Celestial Pillar*, governing silkworm affairs.

The two *Celestial Rooster* stars lie north of *Hound State*, governing rare birds. If Mars lingers, war erupts. If Saturn lingers, famine drives cannibalism and exile.

The three *River Drum* stars—with the central great star as Grand General, the left as Left General, and the right as Right General—govern military affairs. When aligned, they bring fortune, heralding a capable commander. When crooked, they portend misfortune—strategies fail and power is lost.

The *Left* and *Right Banners*, each comprising nine stars, lie north of *Oxherd* along the riverbank, governing military drums and the transmission of orders, as well as the defense of strategic passes. If the banners shift without cause, war erupts. The *Left Banner*, black in color, governs hidden and urgent matters. If *River Drum* bristles with rays, the general is fierce and flourishing.

The *Celestial Float*, comprising four stars, lies north and south of the *Left Banner*, governing clepsydras and celestial drums. If dim, the clepsydras lose their timing; if bright, they attain auspicious precision.

The *Nine Pits*, nine stars situated south of *Oxherd*, oversee the establishment of ditches and canals, ensuring the flow of springs and waterways. When bright, disasters arise; when dim, fortune prevails. If the Five Planets linger or trespass here, floods overflow. They enter the *Dipper* at four degrees west, one hundred twenty-six degrees from the North Star.

The *Celestial Fields*, nine stars located southeast of *Oxherd*, govern the duties of fields and seedlings within the royal domain. The *Net Weir*, two stars east of *Oxherd*, if dim or faint, bring good fortune. If overly bright, horses are submerged by water.

The *Maiden*, four stars, presides over cloth and silk as treasures stored away, also called *Babā* or *Celestial Woman*. When Mercury appears, it governs water in spring and summer, fire in autumn and winter. If bright, women’s work prospers, and the realm enjoys great harvests. If faint, the realm suffers scarcity, and treasuries stand empty. Should the sun or moon eclipse within the *Maiden*, women’s work fails to serve the state, and woes follow. If Jupiter lingers, the year brings floods, and many women freeze to death. If Mars lingers, childbearing women perish in great numbers, and cloth and silk grow costly. If Saturn lingers, people grow envious and malicious; the wealthy rise violently, and women suffer bereavement. If Venus lingers, ministers plot against the ruler, war erupts, many die, women become widows, and treasuries release fine silks. If Mercury lingers, floods arise, crops fail, and cloth grows dear. If a guest star lingers, feudal lords offer courtesans, silk and cloth become expensive, and women rise to sudden power. Should comets or broom stars trespass, war erupts in the realm, women sow chaos, often in the western commanderies of *Zī*, *Zī*, and *Tái*. A lunar halo here foretells the death of the ruler’s women. When the sun resides here in the twelfth month, it culminates at dawn in the second month, with the western star one hundred six degrees from the North Star.

The *Pearl Strand*, five stars north of the *Maiden*, governs treasuries and the protection of the inner palace. If displaced, disorder follows. They enter the *Maiden* at one degree west, ninety-four degrees from the North Star.

The *Gourd and Melon*, five stars north of the *Pearl Strand* and south of the *Broken Melon*, when bright, herald great harvests. They oversee the inner palace’s schemes and the Son of Heaven’s orchards. If the stars are incomplete or shift, bandits harm people. If Jupiter, Mercury, or guest stars linger, fish and salt grow costly. The *Gourd and Melon* enter the *Maiden* at one degree, seventy-one degrees from the North Star.

The *Lapis Lazuli*, three stars arrayed southeast of *Qín*, govern the king’s robes and garments.

The *Void*, two stars, preside over ancestral temples and lamentation. When Venus appears, it governs water in spring and summer, metal in autumn and winter. Also called *Mysterious Pillar*, *Zhuānxū*, or *Grand Minister*, it leans against the *Official Star*. If misaligned, sacrifices to the temple are improper. If Jupiter lingers, ancestral ranks fall into disorder, people starve, and illness spreads. If Jupiter and Saturn conjoin here, it is called *Yin and Yang Exhausted*, foretelling great floods where fish swim in human paths, people flee their homes, and do not return. Within three years, a great drought will scorch the land for a thousand miles. If Mars lingers, the land burns red for a thousand miles, women perish in great numbers, crops fail, and earthworks and labor consume the Son of Heaven’s armies. If it lingers long, people starve, and rice grows tenfold in price. If Saturn lingers, winds and rains arrive untimely, great droughts and winds arise, and rice grows dear. If Venus lingers, ministers plot against the ruler, state affairs grow urgent, war erupts, and blood flows. If Mercury lingers, drought ensues, and crops fail. If a guest star lingers in its domain, disasters and labor follow. Should it be encroached upon or encircled, the state falls into chaos. If comets or broom stars trespass long, war erupts, mutual slaughter follows, blood flows like rivers, and corpses pile like hills. If a great star like a half-moon lingers, it is called *Celestial Bandit*, and the Son of Heaven must offer sacrifices at the suburban altars to avert disaster in *Qízhōu*. If the sun encircles the *Void*, war stirs, and people starve.

The *Yue* star lies south of *Wùnǚ*. The *Zheng* star lies south of *Yue*. The *Zhao*, two stars, lie south of *Zheng*. The *Qi*, two stars, lie south of *Yue*. The *Zhou*, two stars, lie east of the *Yue* star. The *Chu*, two stars, lie south of the *Wei* star. The *Yan* star lies south of the *Chu* star. The *Qin*, two stars, lie southeast of the *Zhou* star. The *Wei*, two stars, lie north of the *Han* star. The *Han* star lies north of the *Jin* star. The *Jin* star lies north of the *Dai* star. The *Dai*, two stars, lie near the *Qin* star. Should these stars darken, shift, or vanish, or if the Five Planets trespass, the respective states face calamity.

The *Controller of Fate*, *Controller of Rank*, *Controller of Danger*, and *Controller of Wrongs*, each comprising two stars, lie north of the *Void*. The *Controller of Rank* follows north of the *Controller of Fate*, the *Controller of Danger* north of the *Controller of Rank*, and the *Controller of Wrongs* north of the *Controller of Danger*. Each governs the lifespan, rank, and fortune of the realm, as well as peace, peril, failure, and disputes.

The *Celestial Ford*, nine stars in the river north of the *Void*, oversees fords, ferries, and bridges, and the officials who manage perilous crossings and safe passage. If the stars brighten and shift, war erupts. If uneven, rice grows dear. If the stars enlarge, fords become impassable. If three stars appear, the river brings harm. If ten stars appear, the river overflows and submerges. If red qi enters, drought follows. If yellow or white qi enters, the Son of Heaven enacts virtuous decrees. If Mars lingers, the realm falls into great chaos and drought. They enter the *Oxherd* at two degrees west, forty-nine degrees from the North Star.

The *Rooftop*, three stars, governs palaces and ancestral sacrifices. When Saturn appears, it governs water in spring and summer, fire in autumn and winter. If it shifts and dims, the Son of Heaven undertakes earthworks and palace construction. The *Tomb Mounds*, four stars below the *Rooftop*, oversee funerary mounds and mournful affairs. If dim, they lose their proper place. If faint, tombs are destroyed, and coffins are desecrated. Should the sun or moon eclipse within the *Rooftop*, palaces collapse, ministers rebel and are slain, and the realm rises in turmoil. If Jupiter lingers, sacrifices grow irreverent, and the Son of Heaven builds new palaces. If Saturn and Mars linger, many laborers die unburied, the year grows lean, and war arises in the south. If they linger long in the east, great armies rebel, the state falters, people starve, drought ensues, and rice grows tenfold in price.

When Saturn lingers, earthworks commence, drought arises, and urgent military campaigns suffer losses. When Venus lingers, wars cease, and generals rejoice in auspicious tidings. When Mercury lingers, ministers below plot rebellion, schemes collapse, punishments are meted out, officials face calamity, and the state suffers floods. If the sun, moon, or five planets enter, the realm falls into chaos, and the following year brings great famine. If a guest star lingers, state governance concerns the king and nobles, and rice grows dear. If comets or broom stars trespass, the state turns back to war. If a shooting star enters, the realm knows no peace—for half a year at best, three years at worst—affecting Cai Prefecture and Taiyuan Commandery. When the moon’s halo encircles with colored light, many fall ill.

The two stars of *Barracks* govern military provisions. The six stars above *Detached Palace* govern concealment. Jupiter, fire in spring and summer, water in autumn and winter, is also called *Office* or *Chamber*. When bright, the state prospers; when it shifts and trembles, armies march forth.

If the sun is eclipsed within *Chamber*, the king leads an expedition in person and does not submit. If the moon is eclipsed, the year brings famine, and the common folk perish without descendants. The six stars above are called *Detached Palace*, governing the six palace consorts and the empress’s position, serving as the inner chambers’ curtains. Should *Rooftop* ascend and linger, encircling the city with hooks and loops far and near, or move back and forth within the palace, it portends the empress’s deposition; or the ruler’s demise, the queen’s faction executed; or palace women engaging in illicit affairs—judge by the time.

When Jupiter lingers in the southeast, auspicious affairs arise in the north; if in the fourth quadrant, rice becomes dear. When Mars lingers, generals meet misfortune. Should it remain long, forming hooks and loops, the ruler loses his office, ministers plot in secret, drought ensues, rice prices rise tenfold, high officials rebel, and if it lingers twenty days or more—up to ninety days—ministers create chaos, slay the sovereign, and usurp the throne, an act the Son of Heaven abhors. When Saturn lingers, yin forces construct palaces and earthworks, and generals gain enfeoffment. When Venus lingers, weapons and armor disperse; if it lingers long, armies fill the fields. When Mercury lingers, floods bring disaster, the people turn against the ruler, and signs of ruin appear within forty days. When a guest star lingers, armies march forth, military discipline falters, the people gain land, rice becomes dear, and the populace scatters. When comets or broom stars appear, the realm falls into chaos, governments change, and in the end, governance expands. If one raises arms before a comet’s encroachment, their forces will be weak, unable to hold ground, and in battle, they will surely lose; this bodes ill for the provinces of Yinsui, Gan, and Qin.

When the moon’s halo encircles *Chamber* and *Wall*, subordinates’ schemes come to fruition. If the plot fails to materialize, women and children will sicken and die—judge the outcome by the time. The four stars of *Xizhong* lie north of *Tianjin*, marking the Eastern Palace of the Son of Heaven. The nine stars of *Hook* lie in the river west of *Zaofu*, and their movement signals earthquakes. The seven stars of *Chariot Treasury* lie east of *Tianjin* near the river, governing the repository of official carriages. The two stars of *Weeping* lie south of *Xu*, governing matters of death and mourning. The two stars of *Wailing* lie east of *Weeping*, both presiding over grief and lamentation. The five stars of *Zaofu* lie south of *Traveler’s Lodge*, governing the palace of the imperial concubines and the value of horses. The two stars of *Roofing* lie south of *Danger*, governing palace construction. The four stars of *Abandoned Tomb* lie south of *Danger*, governing the imperial mausoleums and ancestral temples, places not meant for human habitation.

The thirteen stars of *Celestial Rampart*, arranged like a string of cash, lie south of *Weeping* and *Wailing*, governing the affairs of the northern barbarians—Dingling and the Xiongnu. The four stars of *Ruination* lie south of *Xu* and *Danger*, governing the onset of political decay, weeping, and ruin; people sell their cauldrons and rice, abandon their homes, and when a guest star lingers, chaos spreads in the southwest. *Chamber* spans thirteen degrees, lying one hundred thirty-one degrees from the North Star. The five stars of *People* lie north of *Danger*, governing the common folk of the realm; when officials act with deceit, edicts are issued in haste. *People* also represents women, foretelling disorder and misfortune. The three stars of *Pestle* lie beside *People*, governing the milling of military grain. The four stars of *Mortar* lie below *Pestle*. If *Pestle* and *Mortar* do not align, war brings famine. When the *Mortar* is upright, the year yields abundance; when overturned, great famine follows.

The three stars of *Earth Officials* lie southwest of *Chamber*, governing the oversight of agricultural affairs. The ten stars of *Celestial Treasury* lie south of *Abandoned Tomb*, governing the treasury of wealth, amassing the realm’s riches, and overseeing the laborers and tax collectors—now corresponding to the left and right storehouses. The twenty-three stars of *Soaring Serpent* lie north of *Chamber*, cradling the river, governing aquatic creatures. When dim, the state is at peace; when it shifts south, severe drought ensues.

When it shifts north, great floods occur, and enemy forces occupy the land, bringing water disasters. Its head enters *Chamber* at one *du*, fifty *du* from the North Star.

The ten stars of *Great Sea* lie southwest of *Wall*. If they are guarded, waters surge and overflow, submerging towns. The six stars of *Thunder and Lightning* lie southwest of *Chamber*, governing the arising of thunder and lightning. The four stars of *Cloud and Rain* lie east of *Thunder and Lightning*, governing rain and moisture, through which the myriad things are completed. The five stars of *Thunderclap* lie north of *Cloud and Rain*, governing the awe of Heaven, cleaving the myriad things.

*Northern Screen*
The single star of *Northern Screen’s Gate* lies west of *Feathered Forest Army*, governing the sentinel star of military affairs. When bright, large, and angular, the army is at peace. When slightly dim, warfare arises throughout the realm. If the Five Planets trespass, war erupts. If Venus or Mercury, or Jupiter, guard it, the situation is especially dire. If Jupiter or Saturn trespass, it is auspicious. If Mars guards it, human armies cannot be fortified, the state is ruined, and the court falls. It enters *Rooftop* at nine *du*, twenty *du* and one day from the North Star.

The two stars of *Celestial Rigging* lie southwest of *Northern Screen*, governing the stretching of Heaven’s ropes, used for encampments in the wilds. The nine stars of *Eight Cauldrons* lie southeast of *Northern Screen*, governing the office of beasts. If the Five Planets or visiting stars guard them, war arises. If Venus or Mars guard them, the omen is especially inauspicious.

The three stars of *Axe and Chisel* lie northwest of *Eight Cauldrons*, also called *Axe and Iron*, governing the execution of those who act in chaos and the punishment of deceitful and fraudulent people. When dim, it is auspicious; if they shift position, war arises.

The two stars of *Eastern Wall* govern literature and books. Saturn governs in spring and summer, while Venus governs in autumn and winter. It is also called *Celestial Art*. If its color fades or its size alters, the Son of Heaven will enfeoff distant lands yet lose the realm. If an eclipse passes through *Eastern Wall*, the state will not employ worthy scholars and lose its texts. If the moon eclipses it, great ministers will be troubled, and men of letters will die. If Jupiter guards it, the Five Classics scholars will be employed, and the court will flourish. If Mars guards it, great ministers will plot against the ruler, the year will suffer drought and poor harvests, grain will be dear yet not apparent, internal and external governance will contend, and war will arise. If Saturn guards it for long, worthy ministers will be employed by the state, literature and Daoist arts will flourish, the lord of the state will enjoy longevity, and the realm will know abundance and great peace. If Mars enters *Central Street*, the ruler will perish, and within five days, the chief minister will die; if not, they will be exiled. If Saturn guards and retrogrades into *Eastern Wall*, the myriad things will not come to fruition. If it guards for ninety days or more, great war will arise, and among the common people, one will be proclaimed king. If Venus guards it, the realm will be cut off, the ruler will enforce harsh punishments, war will come, and great ministers will be troubled. If Mercury guards it, there will be floods and roads will be impassable. If a visiting star guards it, there will be frequent storms and floods, ministers will betray the ruler, and governance and punishments will be inwardly illuminated. If it shines brightly, governance will be inwardly pure. If the moon encircles *Eastern Wall* for long, the state will fall into chaos. If comets or broom stars trespass, war will arise. If Mars guards it, there will be fires at the gates of the great ancestral temple, the realm will see those who seize power, the Way of the Enlightened King will flourish, and men of virtue will hold office. If the stars dim, the kingly Way will decline, men will resort to arms, and the regions of Lan, Liang, and Wei will be divided. The forty-five stars of *Feathered Forest Army* and the twelve stars of *Rampart* lie south of *Encampment*, governing the imperial guardsmen’s peace. The *Flying General* star should be bright and majestic for the realm to be at peace; if it dims, armies will be lost. It enters *Encampment* at five *du* west, one hundred twenty-three *du* from the North Star.

The five stars of *Wang Liang* lie north of *Straddling Legs* in the Celestial River, governing the office of imperial horses. The four stars of *Han Ford* and the one star beside *Celestial Team*, named *Wang Liang*, govern swiftness and roads, serving as the *Celestial Bridge* for urgent military matters. If the stars are incomplete, fords and rivers will be impassable. If they shift toward the four directions, war will arise in the corresponding quarter. The *Whip* (●) is one star before *Wang Liang*, serving as the Son of Heaven’s groom and whip for driving horses. It is said: When *Wang Liang* whips his horses, cavalry fills the wilds, and great war arises. If Mars guards *Wang Liang*, war will come. If it shines brightly, horses will be cheap; if it dims, horses will be dear. It enters *Eastern Wall* at half a *du* west, forty-two *du* from the North Star.

The two stars of *Earth Lord* lie south of *Eastern Wall*, governing the offices of construction, palaces, and earthworks. The ten stars of *Celestial Stables* lie north of *Eastern Wall*, governing the offices of the Son of Heaven’s horse pastures and stables. *Comprehensive Divination of the Great Celestial Images and Star Canon*, Scroll the Lower, concludes.
