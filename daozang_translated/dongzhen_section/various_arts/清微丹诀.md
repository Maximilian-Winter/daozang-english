### **Chapter One: The Qingwei Concealed Truth and Union with the Dao**

The three supreme medicines—spirit, qi, and essence—preserve essence to generate qi, refine qi to generate spirit. Refining the form through spirit enables one to preserve the form and abide in the world. The form is the dwelling of spirit and qi. Thus, when the body is at peace, essence is firm; when essence is firm, qi is abundant; when qi is abundant, spirit is whole; and when spirit is whole, longevity is attained.

If essence is depleted, qi is exhausted; if qi is exhausted, spirit departs; and when spirit departs, death follows. Therefore, those who attain immortality refine essence into qi, refine qi into spirit, and refine spirit to merge with the Dao—thus is the great work accomplished.

Is this not the method of the Dao? Preserving the form is precisely the refinement of essence. One must sever the six senses, maintain a single thought of true purity, enter the chamber at the proper time, sit upright, and concentrate the spirit. After stilling the breath for a long while, strike the Red Dragon. Ascend to strike the seventy-two celestial dragons, whereupon the *li* fire naturally descends and the *kan* water naturally ascends, converging in the Yellow Court. Subdue the true qi, refine the yin, and evil cold sweat will emerge. After five repetitions, completing the three hundred sixty-five cycles of the celestial revolution, yang light suffuses the body, rendering it pure yang. Thus is the Dao of preserving form and qi achieved. Former calamities dissolve, and all illnesses vanish. One becomes free from hatred and desire, from excess and indulgence, and may then refine qi to merge with spirit.

Refining qi requires stilling the mind and regulating the breath, abiding in primordial quiescence, guarding the spirit within the chamber. Qi enters the cinnabar field; the navel’s movement and breath continue unbroken. With both hands embracing the navel, the elixir fire warms gently. The six senses are settled and at peace; self and other are forgotten—this is the Dao of refining qi.

Walk without reckless steps, speak without hasty words, and then refine spirit to merge with the Dao.

Refining spirit requires entering the chamber and sitting upright. When spirit and qi are stilled, neither issuing nor entering, the mind is undivided, thoughts unattached. Seeing yet not seeing, hearing yet not hearing, qi halts and becomes breath; spirit enters and forms the embryo. In profound obscurity, the mind wanders the vast emptiness, beholding a luminous vision like a golden tangerine—neither within nor without—guarding this image. Like the moon’s light, like a mirror’s reflection, grasp and preserve it without separation. In the indistinct and subtle, it naturally expands like a chariot wheel. Form perceives spirit, spirit perceives form; form and spirit intermingle, the heart leaps with joy, and the light scatters. Like the sun and moon illuminating the void, form and spirit attain subtlety, merging with the true Dao.

When spirit returns to the body, the true spirit becomes numinous. With a thousand days of practice, one may leave the form and ascend; with a hundred days, transcend the ordinary and enter sagehood. Without contrivance or artifice, the principle is natural.

### **Chapter Two: The Chamber Practice**

This aperture is no ordinary aperture—it is formed by the union of Heaven and Earth. Called the Cavern of Spirit and Qi, it contains the essence of *kan* and *li*. Located between the heart below and the kidneys above, to the west of the liver and left of the lungs, it is neither the intestines nor the stomach, yet qi flows freely within. This is the true aperture.

The common teaching of "one *cun* and three *fen* below the navel" is incorrect. The correct location is "one *cun* and three *fen* above the navel." It lies behind the navel, before the kidneys, to the left of the large intestine, and right of the small intestine—a hollow space that opens when intent arrives. It is the Yellow Chamber where the essence of the Heavenly Father and the blood of the Earthly Mother coalesce to form the embryo, the Cavern of Spirit and Qi, which conceals the essence of water and fire.

Within it, to the left is the fire aperture. At all times, day and night, without fixed hours, perform three, five, or seven repetitions. Alternatively, sit cross-legged at any time, left foot above and right foot below, close the eyes, and concentrate. Focus the spirit within the primordial chaos without emergence. Drive the Red Dragon upward to strike the seventy-two heavens, whereupon true fire descends and numinous springs surge upward. Press the tongue against the upper palate, wait for the Flower Pool to fill, rinse and swallow five to seven times. Visualize a single qi merging and harmonizing, its numinous light vast and boundless.

Alternatively, follow the master’s instructions to refine spirit, recite incantations, and narrate affairs—proceeding as one wishes. Detach from form and knowledge, forgetting self and other. After twenty-one days or a month of such practice, press the hands beside the aperture. If warmth like fire is felt, and movement stirs on both sides, this is the sign—what is called "gathering as embryonic breathing, guarding as the aperture."

With half a year or a full year of diligent, unceasing effort, former calamities are entirely dispelled. The supreme work of the Golden Elixir and the great Dao lies in nothing beyond this.

**Chapter Three: Summoning and Uniting at the Altar**
Close the eyes and concentrate the spirit, gathering qi within the primordial chaos—neither exhaling nor inhaling, circulating the single qi seven times. With the sword mudra, refine the true writ with fire, swallow it into the ancestral palace, pass through the three barriers, and ascend into the Celestial Gate. Let the mind roam the vast sky, open the eyes and gaze straight ahead. Behold the three golden characters radiating light, illuminating heaven and earth. Issue commands, and the ten thousand perfected beings obey.

**Chapter Four: Activation and Application**
The Thunder-Enshrouded Perfected One said: When the ears grow hot, wind arises; when the eyes emit qi, clouds form. When the abdomen trembles, thunder resounds; when sweat flows in great and small streams, rain falls. When the eyes blur, fire is born.

Inhaling to stillness, after a long while the spirit and breath settle. Once harmonized, wait in readiness—inner realms do not emerge, outer realms do not enter. Only perceive the body as no longer one’s own, heaven and earth as empty and vast, entering the light of samādhi.

At times, the ancestral master appears, issuing commands like thunder, the ten thousand perfected following in train. Whatever five matters the mind desires all assemble in clarity. Dispatching, then returning, gathering and refining, the subtlety lies in circulating the single qi seven times. Gazing near, see the celestial qi descending and the earthly qi ascending, steaming mountains and boiling seas, merging in the Yellow Center to ferment the five affairs. At the altar’s edge, stir the mechanism of the barriers, and the power issues forth through the apertures.

When the ears grow hot, raise both hands with the jade writ, ascending from the waist and kidneys to the ears. A single sweep upward summons the southern wind; downward, the northern wind; forward, the eastern; and behind, the western.

For the qi of the eyes, ascend as above, gazing straight into the vast sky. Scatter the clouds and drizzle qi, ceasing when the eyes move.

When the abdomen’s thunder stirs, employ the *ju* mudra, ascending from the waist to the ears. Lift the ears with the *ju* mudra, pressing thrice to release, sweat flowing without end. If urgency arises in great or small movements, shake the body so all apertures open, and a torrential rain pours forth.

When the eyes blur, ascend as above, flashing left or right as the gaze shifts.

The above mechanisms operate within profound stillness—what is called "generating being from non-being." One cannot act with a mind of absence, nor seek with a mind of presence. Only when daily practice is pure and mature does this arise naturally and spiritually. One knows not how it is spiritual, yet prayers and exorcisms respond as swiftly as drum to mallet. Beyond this mystery, there is no further mystery.

This treasure is not transmitted even for a thousand gold—those who obtain it, guard it well.

**Seated Practice and Sleeping Method**
The Gate of the Mysterious Female lies between the two kidneys, called the Great Sea, also known as Weak Water. This is the Cinnabar Field: green on the left, white on the right, red above, qi below, and yellow at the center. In men, it stores essence; in women, it stores blood—this is the womb of gestation, the root of human life, the origin of the five qi.

Within dwells the divine tortoise, inhaling and exhaling primordial qi. When flowing, it becomes wind and rain; when clashing, it becomes thunder and lightning, coursing through the four limbs without fail.

The left and right kidneys are the essence of the sun and moon, the transformations of dragon and tiger. The navel is Kunlun, the great mountain, the abyss, the Five Cities. Within resides the true person, the Five Emperors. Beyond the Five Cities are the Eight Envoys, the great spirits of the eight trigrams. Together with the Great One, they form the Nine Ministers. Above are the Twelve-Storied Tower, where the twelve officers and the three *jiao* spirits dwell, totaling twenty-seven great officials. Combined with the spirits of the four limbs, they form eighty-one primordial scholars.

The Supreme Unity Perfected Person resides in the navel, presiding over the thirteen thousand divine generals within the body. The suburban altar is in the brain’s chamber atop the head; the temple is at the crown behind the neck; the altar of soil is at the left edge of the spleen; the altar of grain is at the end of the large intestine; the Earl of Wind is at the right side below the navel’s pivot; the Master of Rain is at the end of the small intestine; the Duke of Thunder is in the Great Sea at the right kidney; the Mother of Lightning is at the summit of Weak Water, above the eight gates.

Within the body are thirty-six divine palaces, each with its officials and ministers, all receiving commands from the Supreme Unity Perfected Person.

When sleeping, one must guard the assembled body spirits, sever the Three Corpses, and examine the Six Bandits. Only then can one merge with the transformations of creation, peer into the mysteries of heaven and earth. Though heaven and earth are vast, all lies within this body.

Gather the body in cross-legged sitting, eyes gazing at the nose and heart, guarding the Mysterious Female. Then stabilize the spirit and form. Qi guards the spirit, the spirit guards the life force. Where intention goes, qi follows, and the spirit moves naturally. Lower the heart’s spirit with utmost sincerity. With a single exhalation, gather the body’s spirits. Gaze at the tip of the nose, then observe the ancestral palace. Stillness upon stillness, circulate the single qi seven times.

**The Pearl of Supreme Transformation**
*Verse:*
One method gives rise to ten thousand methods,
Ten thousand methods return to the One Void.

The Most High said: If within there is even a hair’s breadth of deviation, heaven and earth become distant realms. Achievements have levels, but attainment has no before or after—later learners, ponder this carefully. Do not treat this as easily obtained; resolve to practice it.

This method is the gateway of all methods, the pivot of the Three Caverns. One must nurture the spirit and cultivate qi, refine the body and congeal essence, banish stray thoughts, sever cravings, slay the Three Corpses, and relinquish the single qi. Let no inner thoughts arise, no outer thoughts be born. Maintain purity and simplicity, abide in correct samādhi and non-action. Only then can one proceed with reverence, preserving life and attaining longevity.

First, raise both hands with the great *sha* mudra to the crown. Rinse the mouth once, twice, and swallow; the third rinse fills the mouth with saliva. The first two mouthfuls are thick saliva born of the five flavors, so take the third—this is the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir. Curl the tongue downward, concealing its flavor and condensing its fragrance. Close the two apertures, inwardly observe the Mud Pill Palace, and visualize the five-colored cloud qi. Then sit evenly, left hand covering the right, left foot atop the right, and meditate within.

When one spirit is open, all spirits are open.
When one aperture is open, all nine apertures are open.
I am endowed with the two qi of yin and yang—when they emerge, they shake heaven and earth.

The *gang* spirits return to the mountains and cause their peaks to crumble; the *sha* dispels essence-demons and shatters them to dust. The essence of the method does not lie solely in talismans, nor is it confined to incantations. First, unite your upright *qi* with that of the general. The strike of the numinous method lies in the Dipper; what the Dipper governs aligns with the upright and the askew—these are the *qi* of the Four Directions, the meaning of central uprightness. The *qi-gang* is the *sha* of the Dipper; follow the celestial Dipper as it turns with the body, and the askew does likewise. Yet where do my Dipper and my *gang* reside? One must clarify one’s own *gang* and one’s own Dipper, employing the Three Harmonies—then there is nothing that does not prove efficacious, nothing that does not flow unimpeded. When condensed, the subtlety of the apertures becomes visible; when moved, the workings of the silent are known. The spirit-*qi* is clear and bright as the autumn moon. The subtlety within stillness, the mystery within the method—its silence enables knowing. The general resides in heaven; why unite with it? Simply abide within the Two Dippers and the Radiant Calm. With my spirit and *qi* interpenetrating, I unite with the general to become the general—then all illnesses vanish, and all demons submit as guests. Thus, virtue is the talisman of the Dao, and sincerity is the root of the method. The Dao without virtue is insufficient to be the Dao; the method without sincerity is unworthy of being called method. To uphold the Dao is to be upright; when the upright method transforms and spreads, following the method without partiality, the general must heed and be commanded. The method is for rectifying oneself; the Dao is for preserving oneself. If these two matters remain unblemished and the mind unwavering, even kings, dukes, and great ministers may be seated and subdued—this is why the Dao is the method.

Now, when transmitting the method, ancestral masters adopt surnames of rivers and lakes, roam the world, and display their arts—yet they bear only the name without the reality. They practice the method through the Dao and also practice the method through the method. As a result, later learners remain ignorant of the method; how then can they grasp the Dao? With hearts contrary to the Dao, how can they possess the method? Heaven does not speak yet silently revolves; Earth does not speak yet brings forth life. The Dao does not speak yet encompasses all; the method does not speak yet responds with numinosity. Heaven descends with *qi*; Earth ascends with *qi*. The Dao presides over *qi*; the method transforms through *qi*. Heaven’s general is Earth’s spirit; the Dao’s talisman is the method’s seal. To enter the Dao through the method, first clarify the root of Heaven and Earth, then investigate spirit and *qi*. Employing Heaven’s silent revolution, thunder roars, rain pours, lightning flashes, spring generates, and autumn slays—endless transformations. Earth’s silent bearing yields roots, sprouts, fruits, and seedlings—growth, nourishment, and boundless sustenance. The Dao’s all-embracing nature encompasses above, Heaven; below, Earth; and in the center, humanity—nothing is left unenveloped. Only thus can one illuminate the Dao and practice the method. This requires rectifying oneself and fostering sincerity, with spirit and *qi* harmoniously surging. Therefore, the Dao is the method, and the method is the Dao.

Heaven’s generals guard the law; Earth’s spirits protect the gates. The primal stars govern affairs; the numinous light endures. One may expel demons, cure illnesses, reach the Emperor, command wind and thunder with a whistle, and govern the workings of creation. Initially, there is no need for excessive elaboration—only the single word "upright" suffices, through which all is attained. One must not take the Dao as the gate and the method as the door, thereby creating obstacles, lest the spirit-generals turn to evil and their employment become irredeemable. Those who cultivate reality and study the Dao must take this as a warning.

The great transformations of Heaven and Earth all reside within a single aperture. If one knows this aperture, all methods become thoroughly understood. The *Central Palace Diagram of Pointing to the Mysterious* is also called the *Mysterious Pass Aperture*, or the *Gate of the Mysterious Female*. It faces the navel in front and the kidneys behind, white as silk floss, connected like a ring, one *cun* and two *fen* in breadth. The essence of the entire body gathers here, located approximately one *cun* above the navel. Draw in the water of the Celestial River, enter it into the body, and circulate the Yellow River’s water again. From the double passes of the spine, reverse the flow into the talisman, and urgently use light ink-water. Obtaining the central *qi* of Heaven and Earth, draw in one breath for every fifteen strokes, then spray it into the talisman—this becomes clouds and rain. The Black Warrior’s water and fire, the tortoise and snake, lie beneath the Black Warrior.

With reverence, align inwardly—
the myriad black *qi* return to the One *Qi*.
With righteousness, square outwardly—
the myriad spirits return to the One Spirit.

The *Mysterious Pass Aperture* is the primordial One *Qi*, the essence of all methods, the pivot of the Golden Elixir. In the *Lingbao* tradition, it is called the *Mysterious Pearl*; in the *Shenxiao* tradition, the *True King*; in thunder methods, the *Thunder Ancestor*; in refinement and deliverance, *Water and Fire*; in the Southern Culmen, the *Circular Light*; in the tradition of the Old Lord, the *Dharma Master*; and in talisman-water methods, the *Numinous Light*. This is the true One *Qi*, an infinitely transforming great spirit. It can subdue the demons of the Six Heavens, summon the spirits of the Nine Earths, refine and deliver the deceased to be born in Heaven, and absolve the transgressions of many lives.

This is the utmost secret of Daoist methods; it must not be lightly disclosed, for to do so invites heavenly punishment, a grave offense.

**Qingwei Sitting Practice**
Whenever entering a quiet chamber, wash the feet, sit upright, and clasp the hands firmly. Release all thoughts, settle the mind as if in the primordial chaos before the Great Ultimate divided, within the empty and round luminosity. Or, as if within the round luminosity of a single aperture, undifferentiated chaos—body and mind both absent, limpid and profound, universally illuminating the ten directions. Heaven and Earth cannot fathom it; ghosts and spirits cannot know it. Practice this in the morning and evening, always employing it.

**Internal Refinement of Yin-Yang Thunder Spirits**
In this method, first visualize Kan and Li. Ascend from the Mud Pill Palace, emerging as the Two Dippers in union—its wonder lies therein. Kan and Li unite and emerge from the Mud Pill; the Two Dippers intersect before the neck. The heart’s fire and the kidneys’ water follow the ascent and descent; the Jade Pivot emerges on both sides. When the Two Marshals are refined, no words are needed—the Three Platforms of the Primal Beginning transform naturally. In an instant, thunderous rain pours down, and transformations endure for thousands upon thousands of years.

Should incense or paper be used, talismans may also suffice. For urgent clearing of skies, write in vermilion with the brush pointed upward. To pray for clear weather in all four seasons, always employ the Kan trigram; for other matters, follow the indications of the relevant hexagram.

For Water and Fire in mutual completion, point the brush downward.

Here ends the *Qingwei* Elixir Formulae.
