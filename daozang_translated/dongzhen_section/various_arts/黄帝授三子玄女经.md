**The *Xuannü Jing* (Scripture of the Three Sons’ Black Female Dao)**

The *Xuannü* resides in the **Tianyi** (Celestial Unity) position on **Jia** (甲) and **Wu** (戊) days.
**Geng** (庚) dawn brings great auspiciousness; evening brings lesser auspiciousness.
**Yi** (乙) **Si** (巳) day: during the day, the *Shenhou* (神后, Spirit’s Retreat) is active; at night, the *Chuansong* (传送, Transmission and Conveyance).
**Bing** (丙) and **Ding** (丁) dawn: during the day, the *Dengming* (登明, Ascending Brightness); in the evening, the *Congkai* (从魁, Following the Leader).
**Liu** (六) **Xin** (辛) day: during the day, the *Shengxian* (胜先, Overcoming the First); at night, the *Gongcao* (功曹, Official of Merit).
**Ren** (壬) and **Gui** (癸) day: during the day, the *Taiyi* (太一, Supreme Unity); at night, the *Taichong* (太冲, Great Surge).

**Divining Meetings:**
If one consults the *Xuannü Jing* to determine when a meeting will occur,
when the **Tianjiang** (天罡, Celestial Restraint) aligns with the day’s or hour’s **stem-branch** (天干地支),
the meeting will take place **before** the designated time if the querent is already past it,
or **after** if the querent has not yet arrived.

**If the *Shen* (神, Spirit) is at the door:**
The meeting will occur when the guest is **nearby but has not yet arrived**,
or when the guest is **far away but has already arrived** if the host is traveling.

**Tianjiang’s Influence on Stem-Branches:**
If **Tianjiang** aligns with the **first heavenly stem** (孟, *first of the ten heavenly stems*—甲, 丙, 戊, 庚, 壬),
the *Shen* (Spirit) resides **inside**.
If it aligns with the **second heavenly stem** (仲, *middle*—乙, 丁, 己, 辛, 癸),
the *Shen* is **at the door**.
If it aligns with the **third heavenly stem** (季, *last*—丙, 戊, 庚, 壬, 甲),
the *Shen* is **outside**.

**Tianjiang and Great Auspiciousness at Noon and *Wei* (未):**
If **Tianjiang** or **Great Auspiciousness** (大吉) aligns with **Wu** (午) or **Wei** (未),
the summoned person **must arrive**.
Otherwise, it is **inauspicious**.

**Divining the Arrival of Officials:**
If **Tianjiang** aligns with the day or hour of an official’s visit,
they **will arrive**.
If the official’s **stem-branch** clashes with the querent’s, they **will not come**.

**Seeking Objects:**
If **Tianjiang** aligns with the **first heavenly stem** (孟),
but does not fully align with the **second** (仲),
the querent will obtain **half** of what they seek.
If it aligns with the **third heavenly stem** (季),
they will obtain **all** of it.

**Divining Travelers’ Arrival:**
On **Jia** (甲) and **Yi** (乙) days, travelers will arrive on **Bing** (丙) and **Ding** (丁) days.
If they do not arrive, reverse the calculation—**Jia** and **Yi** days will determine their arrival.
Other cases follow this pattern.

**For Marriage and Betrothal:**
When arranging marriages or betrothals,
one must **record the original day the betrothal was agreed upon** as the foundation (*本*).
At the time of taking the bride,
**care must be taken to avoid clashing with the original betrothal day’s stem-branch** (*日辰*).
Clashing with the **day** harms the **father-in-law** (*舅*).
Clashing with the **hour** harms the **mother-in-law** (*姑*).
The **mother-in-law** and **father-in-law** are the **husband’s parents**.
If the **day and hour** are entirely clashed,
it is **detrimental to the entire family**.

**Example:**
If a betrothal was agreed on **Jiazi** (甲子) day,
and the bride is taken on **Gengxin** (庚辛) days,
both are **clashing days** (*克日*).
If taken on **Wuj** (戊己) days,
it clashes with the **hour** (*克辰*).
If taken on **Xinwei** (辛未) day,
all days clash (*皆为克日*).
If taken on **Chenwu** (辰午), **Shen** (申), **J** (己), or **Y** (酉) days,
the same applies.

**Avoiding Harmful Conjunctions:**
One should also ensure that the **day and hour’s yin-yang balance** is harmonious,
and that during the **transmission phase** (*传中*), there is **no Celestial Sovereign** (*后天*) without the **Vermilion Serpent** (*腾蛇*),
nor **white beasts** (*白兽*) clashing inauspiciously.
Such alignment is **auspicious for the bride’s arrival** (*内妇时*).
If this condition is met,
it is **auspicious**.

**Preventing Injury to the Bride:**
If the **husband’s family’s door** (*夫家之门*) is harmed by the **bride’s age** (*妇年*),
she will suffer **misfortune**.
**Example:**
In the **second lunar month**, on **Yiwei** (乙未) day at **Si** (巳) hour,
**Tianjiang** aligns with **Si** (巳),
and the **bride’s age** (*妇年*) is established at **Chen** (辰).
If **Congkai** (*从魁*) aligns with the **husband’s family’s door** (*夫家门*), located in the **Zi** (子) direction,
or if **Taiyi** (太一) aligns with it in the **Chou** (丑) direction,
or if **Shengxian** (胜先) aligns with it—
these all **harm the bride’s age** (*夫家门伤妇年*).
This is because the **husband’s family’s door** is governed by the **Fire Spirit** (*火神*),
which clashes with the **bride’s family’s door** governed by the **Metal Spirit** (*金神*).

**If the Husband’s Door is at *You* (酉):**
When the **Gongcao** (功曹) aligns with **You** (酉),
and the bride is from the **Mao** (卯) direction in the **Xing** (星, constellation) of **Xiyou** (西酉),
entering the **Gongcao** (功曹) domain—
the bride **will suffer misfortune**.
Other cases follow this pattern.

**Preventing Injury to the Groom:**
If the **bride’s age** (*妇年*) harms the **husband’s family’s door** (*夫家之门*),
the groom’s family **will suffer misfortune**.
**Example:**
If the bride’s age is established at **Chen** (辰),
and **Congkai** (从魁) aligns with the husband’s door in the **You** (酉) direction,
while **Gongcao** (功曹) governs the **Geng** (戌) direction,
or if **Taichong** (太冲) aligns with it—
this is when the **bride’s age** harms the **husband’s family’s door**,
and the groom’s family **will suffer misfortune**.

**Definitions of *Topple* (顽):**
The **direction of the door** (*门*) is determined by the **stem-branch** of its location.
For **marriage**, the bride’s entry is called **entering topple** (*入顽*).
For **betrothal**, the bride’s exit is called **exiting topple** (*出顽*).
If the movement follows the **square array** (*从方入圆*),
it is **entering topple**.
If it follows the **circular array** (*从方出圆*),
it is **exiting topple**.

**Avoiding Harm to the Groom’s Family:**
If the **Spirit** (*神*) harms the **day** (*日*) of the groom’s family,
it will **harm the father-in-law** (*害翁*).
This is because the **Spirit** (*神*) is **about to harm the day** (*伤日*).
**Example:**
In the **first lunar month**, on **Gengzi** (庚子) day,
**Congkai** (从魁) aligns with the **Chou** (丑) hour.
If **Taiyi** (太一) aligns with **Geng** (庚) above,
the querent will soon obtain the **Vermilion Serpent** (*朱雀*),
which is a **minor auspiciousness** (*小吉*).
This is because **Taiyi** (太一) is the **second Spirit** (*前二加庚*).
This is when the **Spirit** (*神*) is **harming the day** (*伤日*), which harms the **father-in-law** (*舅*).

If the **day** harms the **Spirit** (*日并伤神*), it will soon bring harm (*将为害矣*).
**Example:**
In the **second lunar month**, on **Gui Chou** (癸丑) day,
**Shengxian** (胜先) aligns with **Gui** (癸) above,
the querent will soon obtain the **Remaining Serpent** (*剩蛇*),
which is when the **day** harms the **Spirit** (*日并伤神*), bringing harm to the **husband** (*将害夫*).

If the **hour** (*辰*) has a **subtle qi** (*微气*) going to aid it,
it will cause the **husband’s death** (*为夫死*).
**Example:**
In the **second lunar month**, on **Jia Xu** (甲戌) day,
**Chuan Song** (传送) aligns with **Jia** (甲).
**Jia** is **wood** (*甲木*), **Chuan Song** is **metal** (*传送金*), and **metal** harms **wood** (*金伤木*).

If the **metal** (*金*) within **Xu** (戌) further aids it,
it will cause the **husband’s death** (*为夫死*).

Harming the **hour** (*辰*) is harming the **bride** (*伤辰为妇*), for the **Spirit** (*神*) is about to harm the **hour** (*神将共伤辰*).
**Example:**
In the **second lunar month**, on **Geng Shen** (庚申) day,
**Congkai** (从魁) aligns with **Chou** (丑) hour,
and **Taiyi** (太一) aligns with **Shen** (申),
the querent will soon obtain the **Vermilion Serpent** (*朱雀*).
This is when the **Spirit** (*神*) is about to harm the **hour** (*并伤辰*).

**Example:**
In the **second lunar month**, on **Ren Zi** (壬子) day,
**Congkai** (从魁) aligns with **Chen** (辰) hour,
and **Shengxian** (胜先) aligns with **Zi** (子) for **use** (*临子为用*),
the querent will soon obtain the **Jiao She** (*胶蛇*).
This is when the **day** and **hour** (*日辰*) both harm the **Spirit** (*神将*).

If the **hour** (*辰*) is harmed, it means harm to the **bride** (*以其上将为所坐形状*).
**Example:**
In the **second lunar month**, on **Ding Si** (丁巳) day,
**Congkai** (从魁) aligns with **Mao** (卯) hour,
and **Shen Hou** (神后) aligns with **Si** (巳).
**Si** is **fire** (*巳火*), **Shen Hou** is **water** (*水*), and **water** harms **fire** (*水伤火*).
Moreover, **Ding** (丁) is the **wife of Ren** (壬) by nature (*丁巳丁是壬妻故也*).
If it further aids, it will cause the **bride’s death** (*为妇死*).

**Example:**
In the **second lunar month**, on **Jia Xu** (甲戌) day,
**Congkai** (从魁) aligns with **Chen** (辰) hour,
and **Chuan Song** (传送) aligns with **Qinglong** (青龙),
while also aligning with **Jia** (甲).
This will cause the **husband’s and wife’s deaths** (*为夫妇死*), for it is the **form of the sitting** (*死坐*) that aids the **departure and arrival** (*送行酒食故也*).
