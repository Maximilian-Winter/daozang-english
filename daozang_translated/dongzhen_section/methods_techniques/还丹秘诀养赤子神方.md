*The Secret Formula of the Reverted Elixir for Nurturing the Divine Infant*
By Xu Mingdao of Xishan

In the past, during the Chunxi era, I wandered beyond the mundane world, seeking out masters far and wide, yearning for the Dao of longevity and immortality. By chance, while passing through Xiang and Ying, I arrived at Tongbo Mountain in Suizhou, where I encountered a true teacher named Peng Mengqu, styled Boyu, a native of Yingzhou. Within the temple of the Huai River deity, I lit incense, knelt, and received the oral transmission of the Way of the Golden Fluid Reverted Elixir. Aside from diagrams, the master’s teachings were all conveyed through direct oral instruction and heart-to-heart transmission, never recorded on bamboo or silk.

I have observed that in recent times, those who study the Dao are often misled by heterodox names and peripheral paths, and few succeed in refining the Great Elixir. Thus, undeterred by potential reproach, I have organized the master’s teachings into clear sections to guide later learners, laying the foundation for their progress. With diligent practice, swift attainment may be possible.

### The Chamber of the Spirit
The Chamber of the Spirit is the palace where the myriad spirits gather and the essential locus for refining the Golden Elixir. For those who cultivate the truth, ignorance of this is like a person without a dwelling. If the spirit has no abode, qi is difficult to preserve, and the Elixir may never take form.

If one can tranquilly guard this chamber, the numinous spirit will transform of itself. As Zhuangzi said: *"When the cosmos is at peace and settled, radiance issues forth from celestial light."* This is the principle. He also said: *"The empty chamber generates brightness, and the spirit of wisdom comes of itself."* This is the truth of sincerity and illumination in the *Doctrine of the Mean*.

Though the Chamber of the Spirit may seem to exist or not exist, the method of guarding it ensures mutual attainment. If one entirely forgets all realms and instantly stills all karmic conditions, the spirit becomes yin-quiet—this is the way of Chan masters. If one single-mindedly focuses on the One without responding to phenomena, one becomes one of the ten kinds of immortals, yet if one ceases practice entirely, all prior efforts are lost—this is the path of those who practice *daoyin*. But if one recognizes the Chamber of the Spirit, guards the method with measure, and maintains a foundation in both existence and non-existence, then mutual attainment leads to the abode of supreme tranquility.

Moreover, the Chamber of the Spirit lies north of the heart, south of the kidneys, to the right of the liver, left of the lungs, and beside the spleen. Above it is the Crimson Palace, called the Yin Tripod; below it is the Yellow Court, called the Yang Furnace. These form the upper and lower cauldrons, with a space of one *cun* between them—this is the void between heart and kidneys, known as the Chamber of the Spirit, the pivot of the Mysterious Pass. How wondrous! How marvelous!

The Water Clock

The water clock is the essential subtlety of cultivating the True. If one does not recognize the water clock, the temporal markers become misaligned, and within the Chamber of the Spirit, bitter winter may turn to scorching summer, or midsummer to biting frost. Thus, the four seasons fall into disorder, the five phases intertwine in chaos, the workings of creation turn perverse, and the elixir becomes difficult to refine.

The water clock divides one day into one hundred *ke*. These one hundred *ke* are governed by the twelve hours, with each hour comprising eight *ke*, totaling ninety-six *ke* for the twelve hours. The remaining four *ke* are the pivot of Yin-Yang stagnation and harmony, the essential mechanism for the generation of the myriad things.

If one understands the water clock, one may verify it by drawing breath through the nose: Yang flows to the left, Yin to the right. The twelve hours alternate and shift, distinguishing the ninety-six *ke*, while the four *ke* are the crucial mechanism of *geng*, *jia*, *ren*, and *bing*.

The Temporal Markers

The temporal markers are the utmost essentials of cultivating the True. Without recognizing them, the workings of creation remain obscure, and the elixir difficult to refine.

From *zi* to *si*, the six hours are the time for advancing the Yang Fire. From *wu* to *hai*, the six hours are the phase for retreating the Yin Talisman. *Zi*, *chou*, and *yin* correspond to spring; *mao*, *chen*, and *si* to summer; *wu*, *wei*, and *shen* to autumn; *you*, *xu*, and *hai* to winter.

Within these, *zi* and *wu* serve as the gates of advance and retreat, *mao* and *you* as the doors of exit and entry, and *yin* and *shen* as the omens of creation and subjugation. When these six hours form a complete cycle, they correspond to the fire numbers of the celestial revolution—truly the crucial mechanism for the adept’s refinement.

Pursuing the Two Qi

Pursuing the Two Qi refers to the primordial qi before Heaven and Earth divided, the essence of the initial encounter between Dragon and Tiger, the great medicine of the elixir. Relying on the profound and obscure moment when Heaven and Earth are indistinct, the pivot of stagnation and harmony, one may at this time concentrate the spirit within the Chamber.

Awaiting the arrival of the celestial tally, the true spirit transforms and generates, becoming the true seed. The subtlety lies in the oral instructions.

Uniting the Three Essences

The Three Essences are the primordial qi, primordial essence, and primordial spirit. Previously, one has struck the Mysterious Pass to generate the true person. In cultivation, guarding these is called "guarding the One and preserving the Three."

Guarding the One ensures the full generation of the medicine, allowing the aged to regain youth, the old woman to become a maiden, white hair to turn black, fallen teeth to regrow, and the form to be transformed to escape worldly calamities—this is called the true person.

Gathering the Five Phases

Gathering the Five Phases means that when the previous five matters are complete, they converge and enter the Chamber. Advancing the fire and warming the water is called "drilling and gathering the Five Phases."

The previous Two Qi are Metal and Wood, which are the transformative mechanisms of Water and Fire. Water and Fire rely on Metal and Wood, while the true person is the true Earth. Thus, the Five Phases are complete. The oral instructions follow.

Advancing the Fire

Advancing the Fire means advancing the Yang Fire. At the qi of the first Yang before the Winter Solstice, one enters the Chamber. For fifteen days, the spiritual root is fortified, and the spirit resides in the kidneys. As the Yang Fire circulates, the spirit follows and advances.

The kidneys are the root, and the Chamber of the Spirit is the stem. From root to stem, they are connected, thus enabling the formation of the embryo and the fruition of the elixir. Inhaling at the root, inhaling at the stem, when the seasonal markers complete their cycle, the great elixir is achieved.

When advancing the Yang Fire on the night of the Winter Solstice, one must begin at the end of *hai* and the start of *zi*, igniting the fire from *ren*. For one ascent, three hours pass, and the breath neither enters nor exits. Carefully, from *zi* through *chou* to the end of *yin* at *jia*, Metal and Fire press forward into the Chamber, and the elixir gradually forms. At *mao*, one does not advance but halts the fire—this is the limit of seclusion. At *chen*, the fire is advanced again, and the oral instructions continue until the end of *si*, when Metal and Fire press into the Sea of Marrow. When the Yang Fire reaches its peak, the Yin Talisman is set in motion.

Warming the Water

Warming the Water means circulating the Yin Talisman. The Talisman is set in motion from within upward, proceeding for three hours, with the breath neither entering nor exiting. From *wu* through *wei* to the end of *shen* at *geng*, Metal and Water enter the Chamber via the Magpie Bridge at the Double Pass, and the Mysterious Pearl gradually manifests. At *you*, the Talisman is not circulated, and the Golden Sand undergoes bathing. At *xu*, the Talisman is circulated again, and the oral instructions continue until *hai*, when it returns to the source. The One Intestine regenerates, and the root and origin, along with the spirit, are fully transformed.

Taking one grain daily, as large as a millet seed, after a year’s effort, the Returned Elixir begins to take form. Over three hundred and sixty days, totaling four thousand three hundred and twenty hours, excluding the two hours of *mao* and *you* when Metal and Water bathe—during which neither Yang Fire is advanced nor Yin Talisman circulated, and the breath enters and exits—sixty days are thus excluded. Precisely three hundred days remain for receiving the fire and talisman, refining the Golden Elixir.

This is akin to the ten months of gestation in an ordinary person. During this process, one must meticulously regulate and harmonize, applying sincere intent. If the slightest deviation occurs, misfortune arises, the elixir fails to form, the Red Dragon flees, and the Maiden escapes. Acting carelessly and lightly, one fails to align with the celestial mechanism. This is not the fault of the fire and talisman but the error of the adept who circulates them.

As the scripture states: "One who cultivates with knowledge is called a sage." How can this be taken lightly?

Shedding the Embryo

Shedding the Embryo means that once the sacred embryo is formed, one must not yet exit the Chamber. Further work is required within the Chamber to carefully preserve the sacred embryo in the Sea of Marrow. This takes no more than two cycles of the Greater Yin *jiazi*. One must wait until the Celestial Gate suddenly opens with a thunderclap, and the sacred embryo sheds forth—two identical and indistinguishable forms.

One must not immediately separate from the body, for there remains the Way of Immortal Transformation to follow.

The Cloud Chamber states:
*A thunderclap shakes Kunlun,*
*Countless spirits silently startle.*
*Two identical, indistinguishable forms—*
*Only then does one know the work is complete, emerging from the dust.*

Spiritual Transformation

Spiritual Transformation means that once the sacred embryo has left the body, one must not yet depart far, lest one encounter the hindrance of the Corpse. Initially, one distances oneself by one step, then ten steps, a hundred *li*, a thousand *li*, and ten thousand *li*. Only then may one traverse the Three Realms, pass through stone and penetrate metal without obstruction. Going and staying are at one’s discretion, no longer subject to Heaven.

The Cloud Chamber states:
*"The child is young and not yet grown,*
*Dependent on father and mother’s nurturing grace.*
*After three years and nine, worldly ties are complete—*
*Yet roaming the earth remains bound to kin."*

This is the secret formula for circulating the Returned Elixir, the method for nurturing the Divine Infant, the wondrous Dao of profound quiescence—no shallow art of peripheral schools. Whoever obtains this text must treasure and guard it in secrecy. Should it be transmitted to the unworthy, divine retribution will surely follow. Yet if one withholds it from the deserving, calamity shall likewise befall. The master’s warning is grave—how can one not take heed?
