**The *Huizhen Collection***

**Title:** *Huizhen Collection*. Composed by Wang Jichang, styled Chaoran. Five fascicles. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.

**Preface to the *Huizhen Collection***

The *Book of Changes* is vast and boundless, formless in its essence. It begins with the singular *qi*—this is the Dao. The *Changes* embodies three principles: the unchanging, the mutable, and the simple.

The unchanging is that which stands alone and never alters. The mutable is the succession of the four seasons. The simple is the effortless order of heaven and earth.

The six lines of a hexagram: the inner trigram is called "purity," the fixed structure of heaven, earth, and humanity as the Three Powers. When doubled, it is called "regret," for fortune and misfortune, regret and humiliation arise from movement.

The lower two lines represent earth, the middle two humanity, and the upper two heaven. The top and bottom positions hold no rank. The second and fifth lines are discussed in terms of human affairs, hence the phrases "the dragon appears" and "the dragon soars," and "it is beneficial to see the great person." The third and fourth lines occupy the positions of heaven and earth and are not called "dragons." When addressed in human terms as the "noble person," this reflects the resonance between heaven and humanity.

*Qian* and *Kun* are the virtues of heaven and earth. Through the interplay of hardness and softness, they give birth to three sons and three daughters, governing the Five Agents—these are the Five Phases, acting on behalf of heaven and earth. Later, the sixty-four hexagrams emerged, distributing 384 lines across a year, roughly corresponding to the cycles of years, months, seasons, days, and hours, with twelve hexagrams changing each day.

Humankind is the spirit of the myriad things, its nature and destiny complete, one in body with heaven and earth. Only the sagely know the sagely; the benevolent see it as benevolence, the wise see it as wisdom. Those who can harmonize and direct it within themselves are called cultivators of the Dao.

Later scholars divided teachings into three, regarding the *Book of Changes* as the "true mystery," the *Laozi* as the "void mystery," and the *Zhuangzi* as the "discursive mystery." Though their explanations differ, they converge in mystery, beyond the grasp of ordinary people—only immortals can fathom it.

Last spring, at the Qingyi Pure Spirit Abbey, I met Master Wang Jichang, styled Chaoranzi. In conversation, his words flowed like pearls and jade, his breath like mist and clouds, as he expounded the three mysteries. Alas, our parting came too swiftly. Like a pair of wild ducks flying west, time passed in the blink of an eye, and I have not forgotten him day or night.

Now, two immortal youths have arrived at Yunxi, and I rushed out to greet them, sandals askew. One is the reincarnation of Liang Zhen of the Tang, the other a scion of the southern Liang—both old friends. I invited them to the honored seat, and over tea, they mentioned their teacher Chaoranzi’s work, the *Huizhen Collection*, wishing to carve blocks and disseminate it widely. They asked this old rustic to write a preface.

From his sleeve, he produced the text. From beginning to end, I perused its words, recalling our conversation of last year. Examining its diagrams, poems, and songs, all sprang from his heart and mind—shaping the altar, revolving the wheel, harmonizing the great cosmos, forging the Primordial within his innermost being. He clarifies the ages of the seven, eight, nine, and six, and the generation and completion of water, fire, wood, metal, and earth.

This is what Prince Wang Zijian meant by "inverting the Five Phases and shifting the Eight Trigrams." Who but an immortal could achieve this? If it spreads throughout the world, seekers of the Dao will be like those holding a torch in a dark room.

I admire the two immortal youths for propagating their teacher’s excellence—they have not forgotten their roots. Thus, I dare not refuse their request and have briefly set forth these facts at the beginning of the scroll.

**Fascicle One of the *Huizhen Collection***
**[Diagrams and Explanations of the Symbolism and Numerology of the *Zhouyi*]**
**The Supreme Ultimate**

The Supreme Ultimate is the designation of the Limitless, yet it cannot be named. Its qi, form, and substance remain undifferentiated in primordial chaos. Within it reside the fifty-five numbers, containing the Two Modes, Three Luminaries, Four Images, and Five Phases—all complete yet without form. This is what the *Laozi* refers to as "a thing chaotically formed." The *Jade Inscription* states: "Before the separation of the Dark and Yellow, the qi’s appearance was dim and obscure." How can those who study the Dao fail to know the origin of the singular qi, the ancestor of the myriad things?

The numbers generate the Five Phases:
Water: one (☰ Qian, Jia)

Once the Five Ultimates were divided and the Two Modes first separated, the Four Images then subtly arose, and the Five Phases secretly took form. Within them, the qi’s hues shifted and transformed, their shapes and images becoming distinct. After a million years of dim obscurity, the qi turned black. Black corresponds to the image of Water, whose generative number is one. One is the beginning of the Qian’s origin, the root of the Eight Trigrams, and gives rise to Jia. Jia is the first of the Five Phases and the origin of the ten celestial stems. Thus, in this primordial era, the sages observed its celestial patterns and inscribed the heavenly tally, recording the celestial patterns. Later, worthy successors reverently upheld this, marking the celestial origin and establishing the calendar through the arrangement of lines. From that time onward, the reckoning of years and seasons spread and became manifest.

Fire: two

The black qi transformed again after a million years, turning crimson. Crimson corresponds to the image of Fire, whose generative number is two. Two is the beginning of the Xun trigram and gives rise to Xin.

Wood: three
After a million years, the crimson qi turned verdant. Verdant corresponds to the image of Wood, whose generative number is three. Three is the beginning of the Gen trigram and gives rise to Bing.

Metal: four
After another million years, the verdant qi transformed into white. White corresponds to the image of Metal, whose generative number is four. Four is the beginning of the Kun trigram and gives rise to Gui.

Earth: five
After a million years, the white qi turned yellow. Yellow corresponds to the image of Earth, whose generative number is five. Five is the beginning of the Li trigram and gives rise to Ji.

The Completion Numbers of the Five Phases
From the generative numbers to the completion numbers of the Five Phases: the odd numbers one, three, and five sum to the yang nine, governed by Jia and Bing, serving as the guest. As the central five of Earth (Li Ji) combines with Jia and the Water of one, it reaches the completion number six, descending to generate Kun Yi, thus moving first as the guest. The even numbers two and four sum to the yin six, governed by Xin and Gui, serving as the host. Further, the five of Earth added to the Fire of two reaches the completion number seven, ascending to generate Zhen Geng. Yi and Geng unite, exchanging north and south, thus moving later as the host. Water (one) and Fire (two) with Earth sum to ten, generating Kan Wu. Fire’s generative number (Xun Xin) follows Earth’s Ji to combine with Wood’s three (Gen Bing), reaching the completion number eight and generating Dui Ding. Water’s generative number (Qian Jia) also joins the central Earth’s five with Metal’s four (Kun Gui), reaching the completion number nine and generating Qian Ren. Ding and Ren unite, exchanging east and west. Thus, the transformations of two earths and three heavens are set in motion, reckoning the yang nine and yin six in generation and completion, revolving the stems and branches, distinguishing the soaring and hidden, and incorporating the Jia. With two ascending and one descending, water and fire are drawn and replenished; three are illuminated while four are concealed, and wood and metal interchange. Hence, the primordial Dao disperses as the foundation of the myriad transformations, its wondrous workings manifesting in the descent of a thousand spirits. How can those who cultivate the truth not delve into the origins of yin and yang?

Fire: six
From the five of Earth added to the Water of one, reaching the completion number six, generating Kun Yi.

Fire: seven
From the five of Earth added to the Fire of two, reaching the completion number seven, generating Zhen Geng.

Wood: eight
From the five of Earth added to the Wood of three, reaching the completion number eight, generating Dui Ding.

Metal: nine
From the five of Earth added to the Metal of four, reaching the completion number nine, generating Qian Ren.

Earth: ten
From the five of Earth added to the five of Earth, reaching the completion number ten, generating Kan Wu. Thus, the Eight Trigrams are complete, and the ten celestial stems are fully arrayed. They blend and merge, the mother embracing the child’s womb, the child concealed within the mother’s body, yet to be distinguished.

Interchange to Form Ten
As Qian and Kun pair, their completion numbers are fulfilled. Yang descends and yin ascends, floating and sinking, reversing and intertwining; rotating left and right, connecting above and below, the five positions interact, each finding its union. One and nine form ten: Ren and Jia meet, Qian pairs with Kun to generate Kan, which conceals Jia and Yi. Four and six form ten: Yi and Gui shift together, Kun pairs with Qian to generate Dui, which conceals Gui and Ren.

Interchange to Form Ten
Three and seven form ten: Geng and Bing meet, Qian pairs with Kun to generate Zhen, which conceals Bing and Ding. Two and eight form ten: Ding and Xin meet, Kun pairs with Qian to generate Li, which conceals Geng and Xin.

Earth’s Image Self-Unites
Kan Wu: Li incorporates Ji to obtain five, Kan incorporates Wu to obtain ten, together summing to fifteen. This number attains the mean of heaven and earth, its position occupying the center of heaven and earth, thus requiring no pairing but uniting itself.

The Four Images Generate the Eight Trigrams
From the Two Modes arise the Four Images. Within the Four Images, Kan’s completion number is six; its original trigram retains three, with three external numbers generating Qian, incorporating Ren but not Gui, as Qian and Kun pair and Gui is incorporated into Kun. Dui’s completion number is nine; its original trigram retains three, with six external numbers generating Kun, incorporating Yi but not Jia, as Kun and Qian unite and Jia is incorporated into Qian. Li’s completion number is seven; its original trigram retains three, with four external numbers generating Xun, incorporating Xin but not Geng, as Zhen and Xun interact and Geng is incorporated into Zhen. Zhen’s completion number is eight; its original trigram retains three, with five external numbers generating Gen, incorporating Bing but not Ding, as Gen and Dui interact and Ding is incorporated into Dui. Thus, the Five Phases are inverted and defined, their mutual transformations and changes clearly distinguished. The Eight Trigrams take form, their structures manifest and evident.

The middle son produces the old yang: Metal emerges from within Water. The youngest daughter gives birth to the old yin: Earth arises from within Metal. Only Wood is born of Fire, the middle daughter descending as Xun Xin. And Earth is born of Wood, the eldest son emerging as Gen Bing. From this, we discern the firmness and yielding, movement and stillness of Qian and Kun; the stirring and moistening of Zhen and Xun, wind and thunder; the meeting and separation of Bing and Ding at the corners; the clear divisions of soaring and hidden, shifting palaces. With the completion numbers established, the body reverses and cycles, the hun-soul transforms and roams, concealment and manifestation return to their origin, ascent and descent gather their traces. The eight celestial stems above undergo three positional shifts. Wu and Ji, formless and solitary, govern the four directions yet lack pairing. Ji, as yin, is incorporated into the middle daughter Li; Wu, as yang, is incorporated into the middle son Kan. Thus, the ten celestial stems are complete, their numbers forming odd and even, revealing the transformations of a single moment, the union of movement and stillness with the true. This fully expresses the Dao of observing heaven and mastering its movements. Those who cultivate the truth should diligently study the line texts, clearly follow the trigram structures, seize the ascent and descent of yin and yang above and below, and thoroughly explore the ebb and flow of generation and completion. With focused and inwardly refined intent, they will fathom the ceaseless changes of each day. When no regrets arise within the crucible, the purest qi descends, gold and mercury congeal into form, and the divine elixir is swiftly achieved—clear as the palm of one’s hand.

The Essentials of Stem Conjunction and the Return of the Eight Trigrams

The ten celestial stems and eight trigrams embody the five phases and four images, generating transformations and giving rise to completion. They divide north and south, east and west, then return and interchange. Within them, Kan and Li serve as gates and portals, while Qian and Kun act as the pivot and vessel of the crucible. They propel the union of yin and yang, dispatching the two qi to race forth. With each descent and ascent, the stem spirits shift position; through the convergence of the Two Modes and Three Unions, the trigram images submit to their origin.

Those who study the Dao must embody heaven and earth’s transformative workings and drive the sun and moon to share the same palace. With each inhalation and exhalation, a single celestial cycle is completed; with each gathering and dispersion, life and destiny are determined. As Laozi said: *"The gate of the Mysterious Female—this is called the root of heaven and earth."*

When the yang tally is to move, Kun pursues Qian, emerging from the left; when yin holds authority, Qian follows Kun, responding from the right. Their ceaseless coming and going aligns with the principle of stem conjunction and trigram correspondence.

The formula states: Through exhalation, the number seven is formed—Li as fire, where true water descends within. Ji unites with Jia, and Jia, rejoicing, ascends, flying into the divine palace. Through inhalation, the number six is formed—Kan as water, where true fire rises within. Wu unites with Gui, and Gui, delighted, descends into the elixir chamber. Ding and Ren conjoin, returning to Li and Ji, like mountains and marshes exchanging qi, phoenix dancing and crow soaring. Yi and Geng gaze longingly, turning to Kan and Wu, like wind and thunder clashing, hare glowing and toad shining.

Thus, the four images return to the golden crucible, and the five phases gather into the jade furnace. Bing and Xin manifest, meeting Qian and Kun, uniting with Wu and Ji, and circulating the ten stems to return to the origin. When gathered, they are like grasping ten fingers; when dispersed, each reverts to its proper place.

**Upright**　　　　　　**Inverted**

The inversion of the five phases is thus: Kan as water generates metal, producing Qian-metal, which conceals Jia and Yi, with flying and latent wood, its phase of growth beginning in Hai. Dui as metal generates earth, producing Kun-earth, which conceals Ren and Gui, with flying and latent water, its phase of growth beginning in Shen. Li as fire generates wood, producing Xun-wood, which conceals Geng and Xin, with flying and latent metal, its phase of growth beginning in Si. Zhen as wood generates earth, producing Gen-earth, which conceals Ding and Bing, with flying and latent fire, its phase of growth beginning in Yin.

As for Wu and Ji, they alone govern the center, flourishing in all four seasons, lodged in the southwest Kun-earth—the place where earth is most vigorous, its phase of growth beginning in Shen. This is called: with exhalation, the yang stems move in sequence; with inhalation, the yin stems reverse their course. Yin and yang, reversing and advancing, gather and disperse, concealed within the completion numbers. The completion numbers are the dynamic qi of the celestial origin.

**Five Phases**　　　　　　**Stems Conjoin**

When heaven and earth first divided, yin and yang separated into their positions. Heaven distributed the five qi, and earth arrayed the five phases. The five phases established their positions, governing the four directions; the five qi branched forth, scattering into the ten stems. The stem spirits shift their positions, pairing and generating one another, their forms and images distinctly manifesting their unions, deriving from the celestial origin’s five qi to become the true five phases.

All who cultivate the Dao must first thoroughly investigate the mechanism of stem-wheel interchange, then comprehend the images of their generative unions—this is the foundation for binding essence and life, the basis for the great elixir of transformation. When the root is established, the great Dao arises.

**Jia-Ji True Earth**
Gui generates the wood spirits Jia and Yi in the east—water generating wood, with Wu as Jia’s father. The central yin-earth Ji is given to Jia as wife, and Jia-Ji unite to form true earth.

**Yi-Geng True Metal**
Ji generates the metal spirits Geng and Xin in the west—earth generating metal, with Jia as Geng’s father. The eastern yin-wood Yi is given to Geng as wife, and Yi-Geng unite to form true metal.

**Bing-Xin True Water**
Yi generates the fire spirits Bing and Ding in the south—wood generating fire, with Geng as Bing’s father. The western yin-metal Xin is given to Bing as wife, and Bing-Xin unite to form true water.

**Ding-Ren True Wood**
Xin generates the water spirits Ren and Gui in the north—metal generating water, with Bing as Ren’s father. The southern yin-fire Ding is given to Ren as wife, and Ding-Ren unite to form true wood.

**Wu-Gui True Fire**
Ding generates the earth spirits Wu and Ji in the center—fire generating earth, with Ren as Wu’s father. The northern yin-water Gui is given to Wu as wife, and Wu-Gui unite to form true fire.

Revealed thus for application, cycling without end.

**Wood and Metal Interspersed**
Those who study the Dao must probe the root of essence and life, fathom the origin of transformation, discern the cause of wood and metal’s interspersion, clarify the principles of water and fire’s extraction and supplementation, grasp yin and yang’s manifest and latent states, and understand the floating and sinking of hun and po.

The interspersion of metal within wood: wood is yang-hun, embodied in the eastern Zhen trigram, which receives Geng as Kun’s eldest son—a single yang with two yins, thus yang-hun. It should ascend, but with two yins suppressing one yang, it cannot rise. In the human five viscera, this is the liver, submerged beneath lung-metal. The liver contains Geng-metal’s interspersion: though the liver’s true nature desires to float upward, Geng, as yin-po, steals the yang-hun, preventing its ascent and keeping it below. If one seizes the mysterious mechanism, circulating the fire tally of the celestial cycle for a thousand days without error, refining away the Geng-po within the liver, the liver returns to its ancestral nature, pure and unadulterated, and naturally ascends.

Leng Ranzi asked: "What in the liver is metal?"
Answer: "When the liver is born and enters water, it sinks—what sinks is metal. Wood and metal intermingle, its color becoming purple. Purple is metal. Thus it sinks below. When met with fire’s refining, it matures, the liver floats above, its color turning green, called *returning to the origin*. It regains its original nature, and the hun-spirit congeals, undisturbed."

The interspersion of wood within metal: metal conceals yin-po, belonging to the west, embodied in the Dui trigram. It should sink, yet instead floats—why? Dui is Qian’s youngest daughter, one yin with two yangs. The single yin cannot suppress the two yangs, so it floats above. Dui is Geng-metal; Yi and Geng unite, the wife following the husband’s chamber, with metal as the host. Metal is the lungs, but Yi-wood floats it, so metal lies above water. If one seizes the fire tally of the celestial cycle, refining for a thousand days without error, refining away the wood within the lungs, it becomes unadulterated, revealing metal’s original body, and naturally sinks.

Leng Ranzi asked: "What in the lungs is wood?"
Answer: "When the lungs are born, their color is red, but white is wood. Thus they float in water. When met with fire’s refining and matured, the lungs sink below, their color turning purple, returning to the true po of their original nature, settled and prolonging life."

**Metal and Wood in Fire: Discerning Host and Guest**
When metal and wood intermingle, fire restores their original natures. One must remove metal from wood and wood from metal. Since both are refined together, why is metal alone removed from wood while wood remains, and wood alone removed from metal while metal remains?

Removing metal from wood: wood has its original form as host, while metal, hidden within, is a floating guest in color. When refined by fire, the guest departs first, preserving the host. Removing wood from metal: metal has its rigid body as host, while wood within is soft and a guest. When refined by fire, the host remains while the guest departs.

In all who cultivate the true Dao, one must clarify the causes of refining metal and wood, thoroughly investigate the principles of host and guest in their preservation or loss, rely on the fire’s timing without error, and follow the measures for withdrawing and adding lead and mercury. Then, without waiting for days, the elixir will naturally form.

Master Pingshu notes: Nurturing the elixir without fire is like a mother holding a dead fetus—prolonged effort yields no result, only futile labor. How is this different in principle from metal and wood, which only reveal their natures when refined by fire?

**Water and Fire: Attainment and Non-Attainment**
The natures of water and fire mutually contain and gestate one another. Within water there is fire, and within fire there is water. What is meant by "within water there is fire"? Water belongs to the northern *Kan* trigram, embracing yang within yin. That water can reflect objects is the true fire. In the human body’s five viscera, water corresponds to the kidneys, which store essence—essence being fire.

What is meant by "within fire there is water"? Fire belongs to the southern *Li* trigram, embracing yin within yang. The blackness at the heart of fire is the true water. In the five viscera, fire corresponds to the heart, which governs blood—blood being water.

The *Book of Changes* states: "When water is above fire, it is *jiji* (attainment); when fire is above water, it is *weiji* (non-attainment)." Master Pingshu notes: "Within water, three fires gather; within fire, water refines and steams." All who cultivate the Dao rely on method and image to harmonize yin and yang, mastering the subtle transformations of the key and lock, causing water and fire to ascend and descend. By adding and withdrawing in accord with *jiji* and *weiji*, lead and mercury naturally congeal within the crucible, and the elixir forms—then golden light fills the chamber.

**Water and Fire Ascend and Descend Through Earth**
The *Book of Changes* states: "Water flows toward the moist; fire tends toward the dry." Without awareness, they respond to one another, revealing the principle of nature. Yet water is said to moisten and descend, fire to flame and ascend. How then, in *jiji*, does water remain above while fire stays below? Within *Kan* water there is fire because *Kan* receives *wu* (yang), which is pure and becomes essence, transforming into clear yang qi that ascends to become true water. Within *Li* fire there is water because *Li* receives *ji* (yin), which is turbid and becomes blood, transforming into heavy turbid qi that descends to become true fire.

Water and fire are the true qi of Heaven’s origin, born from the spleen. The spirit of the spleen governs creation alone, residing at the center, revolving the four directions, ascending and descending with each breath. When the qi of Heaven’s origin moves, one breath contains five—subtly aligning with the five phases.

The *Book of Changes* states: "Heaven’s number is five; Earth’s number is six"—the central number of yin and yang. This central number refers to earth. The *Cantong Qi* says: "Earth flourishes in the four seasons, weaving from beginning to end. Green, red, white, and black each occupy a direction, while the central palace receives the work of *wu* and *ji*." Master Pingshu also says: "The four images and five phases all rely on earth." Without the central qi of *wu* and *ji* circulating between *Kan* and *Li*, the divine elixir will never be produced.

**The Qi of Kan and Li Transform and Return to the Origin**
Within the heart, mercury is concealed; within the kidneys, lead is hidden. How are these two substances to be employed? Through the inverted technique of the five phases, true fire transforms into divine water, lead and mercury become wandering souls, and breath rises with the wind—naturally accomplishing the work of creation.

When the qi of Heaven’s origin stirs in the kidneys, *Kan*’s *wu* is yang, and one exhalation moves five. When the qi of Earth’s origin stirs in the heart, *Li*’s *ji* is yin, and one inhalation moves five. The movement of yin and yang qi combines to make ten. The *Book of Changes* states: "Heaven is nine; Earth is ten"—*wu* and *ji* naturally unite.

Drawing mercury from the heart transforms it into essence; ascending lead from the kidneys transforms it into qi. Essence and qi become things and change, naturally coagulating into the *daogui*. When mercury is drawn from the heart, true water descends, and the *Li* trigram sheds its yin to become the *Qian* body. *Qian* is Heaven—light and clear, without yin. Those who align with this naturally extinguish the seven emotions and melt the six desires like ice.

When lead ascends from the kidneys, true fire rises, and the *Kan* trigram sheds its yang to become the *Kun* image. *Kun* is Earth—heavy and turbid, without yang. Those who align with this naturally gather the three into a circle, and the myriad conditions of the heart dissolve.

Devotees of the Dao, take heed of these words.

I have heard Guangchengzi say: "Above the celestial pivot, the qi of Heaven’s origin governs; below the celestial pivot, the qi of Earth’s origin governs; at the celestial pivot, the source of yin and yang follows." Those who cultivate the Dao model their forms on Heaven and Earth. The head is round like Heaven, the root of clear yang, revolving the seven luminaries, responding to the movement of the pivot, assisting the Purple Tenuity and the Valley of Emptiness, with the primordial spirit encircling it.

The Yellow Emperor said: "Imitate the way the seven luminaries revolve in emptiness—seizing yang to refine yin." *Tan* and *Ju* correspond to the two ears. They assist the numinous terrace, preventing the dust of the world from staining it, the myriad conditions from clinging to it, so that the spirit’s awareness becomes still and settled.

*Lu* and *Wen* correspond to the two eyes. If they are opened, the spirit scatters outward; if closed, the spirit settles within. *Lian* and *Wu* connect the path of the assisting ministers, piercing the Gate of the Mysterious Female—the root of Heaven and Earth, the key to nature and life. Exchanging them in due time, continuously as if present, the five spirits interact, and the elixir furnace’s fire blazes.

*Pojun* guards the Metal Pass, sealing the Earth’s gate, fanning the true wind within, so that water qi cannot assail. It secures the golden womb, preventing leakage, and the essence of the red dragon causes the Three Corpses to flee. With the heart cold and the six bandits trembling in fear, fire burns the golden crucible, water overflows the Jade Pass, and the original qi of the entire body flows through the three fields above and below.

The eight trigrams of the body: *Li* is the Crimson Palace, the meeting place of *jia* and *si*, the land where tiger and dragon transform and arise—the dwelling of the ten thousand spirits.

The *Kan* trigram conceals the Two Mysteries, gathering the Five Phases, harmonizing the Four Images; essence and light converge, *wu* and *gui* return to their root—this is called the Palace of the Great One.

The *ding* of the lungs stores the *po*; undisturbed by fright, it remains at peace. The *geng* of the liver conceals the *hun*; free from joy and anger, it abides in stillness. *Ren* and *jia* govern the large intestine, transmitting the Dao; *xun* and *xin* adhere to the gallbladder’s nature, maintaining central harmony. The *kun* earth forms the Winding River, reversing and returning yin and yang; the *gen* mountain pours forth the water source, generating pure and vast primordial *qi*. These are the functions of the Seven Governors and Eight Trigrams—the root and stem of yin and yang, the alchemy of the golden elixir, whose wonders cannot be measured.

As the *Yinfu Jing* states: "When the Seven Governors achieve success, the yellow sprout grows within; when the Eight Trigrams encircle, the divine light dims and fades." The *Xici* of the *Yijing* says: "The sage establishes images to fully express meaning, sets forth trigrams to fully convey the essence."

*Huizhen Ji*, Scroll One concludes
*Huizhen Ji*, Scroll Two
By Chaoranzi Wang Jichang

**Xingxiangzi**

Wood and metal stand apart,
Wood’s nature kind and yielding,
Its form in harmony with metal.
Hard to distinguish—reversing, floating, sinking.
Returning to the ancestral nature,
The workings of creation profound.
Wood draws forth metal,
Metal departs wood—
Their mutual encroachment ceases.

Refined essence transforms the wandering *hun*,
Deeply entering the meditative heart.
In the boundless dark,
Traces are hard to find.
From nothing, something appears,
Penetrating ancient and modern.
The *po* is settled, the *hun* secure,
The *hun* prevails over the *po*—
Even ghosts and spirits revere it.

**Again**

Within *Zhen* lies *geng*,
Metal and *yi* form a union.
Borrowing harmony,
Thunder and lightning intertwine.
Dragon’s chant, tiger’s roar—
The secluded valley clarifies the spirit.
Amidst the boundless dark,
Wind and clouds enfold,
The whole self stands aloof.

Misty rain, hazy,
The germ of the magic mushroom fresh.
The Eastern Lord
Weaves the warp and weft of eternal spring.
The fire of Min Mountain swirls,
Hiding the true within.
No more extraction or addition,
No separation—
Returning to purity.

Within *Zhen*, *yi* is tender in nature,
Passionately loving *geng*-Metal.
Wood and Metal harmonize,
Their notes attuned to pure sound.
The wooden man claps his hands,
The stone maiden tunes her zither.
Manifesting skill through benevolence,
Diligently practicing righteousness—
The Dao’s sentiment runs deep.
Two elements fuse,
Mutually rising and sinking.
Fire refines and simmers,
The body transforms as Metal melts.
Once ignorance is dispelled through completion,
Yang’s refinement prevails over Yin.
Regaining the root and origin,
Distinguishing *hun* and *po*,
Recognizing the true heart.

**Xingxiangzi: Wood Yields to Metal**

Wood withdraws, Metal’s form concealed,
Yet Metal’s hue lingers on.
Wood stands dense,
Assuming a revered semblance.
Wholly reliant on fire’s power,
It entices the wandering *hun*.
The guest first returns,
The host alone remains—
Each reverts to its root.
Departure and return divide like stones on a board,
Nature and life gather like clouds.
Delighting in celestial truth,
Silent and dim,
Nurturing the Yang body,
Treading misty steps in lofty ascent.
Attaining the boundless mystery,
Ascending the realm of longevity,
Emerging beyond Heaven and Earth.

**Xingxiangzi: Metal Yields to Wood**

Metal’s body is firm and unyielding,
Wood’s nature gentle and harmonious.
Discerning host and guest,
Fire’s power achieves much.
The firm assumes mastery,
The yielding dissolves like mist.
Each reveals its return to origin,
Reverting to true nature,
Quelling the winds and waves.
Penetrating the divine crucible,
Enveloped in rosy clouds,
Silver lead is released—
Flowers bloom in graceful dance.
Radiance fills the chamber,
The spirit transforms without bounds.
Abiding in the Peng Palace,
Roaming the Purple Courts,
Freely wandering at will.

**Nanxiangzi: Water and Fire Intermingle in Completion**

Within *Kan*, a single Yang abides,
Its true nature clear, illuminating forms.
True fire blazes fiercely, its power fully revealed—
Attend closely!
Completion’s misty vapors seal the precious vessel.
The spirit exerts its mighty efficacy,
Qi’s ascent and descent testify to *wu* and *ding*.
Sunlight soars, refining the cauldron of medicine,
Its fragrance like orchids.
The work of creation complete,
It enters the boundless dark.

**Again**

**Within Fire, Six Yins Nurture**

Within fire, the six Yins are cultivated,
Fiercely ablaze, the heart’s core bears a speck of black coal.
The work manifests as the pure, cool image of true water—
A spirit-embryo.
The central qi withdraws and replenishes, moving of its own accord.
Resplendent, it shakes the golden thunder,
Mists and rains suffuse, reflecting the Dipper’s majesty.
Creation’s work unites heaven and earth as one,
The heart reduced to ashes.
Clapping, the cosmos is sealed—
The Dao-body restored in grandeur.

**Nanxiangzi: Water and Fire Ascend and Descend Through Earth**

*Wu* and *ji* wed yin and yang,
Wielding sole authority to govern the four directions.
They drive and harness the primordial, following breath’s rhythm—
Beyond the ordinary.

Thunder resounds through the cosmos,
Steeping jade buds as sacred mushrooms sprout in splendor.
Await the crucible’s fire to cool and ice to congeal—
Only then is the snow-like flesh perfected.
The body abounds with fragrance, musk and orchid,
Within, golden light radiates,
Bright as day in the night.
Virtue flourishes in emptiness,
Manifesting purity,
Truly without flaw.
All forms and void dissolve,
The spirit refined, the soul sanctified,
Penetrating the profound depths of earth and the vastness of heaven.
Amidst the wondrous selection of the Three Clarities,
Already vying for leadership.

*Playing with Sand by the Stream · Drinking the Knife’s Measure*
Rising and sinking between Li and Kan, qi remains unconfused,
At heaven’s gate, breath diminishes as one drinks the knife’s measure,
Flying past the moon palace to the sun’s crow.
In the northeast, companions arise, harmonizing the jade hare,
The two natures’ harmonious qi exhales rainbow hues.
The fire-refined jujube is carried by the youthful attendant.

*Again*
Diligently drinking the knife’s measure to refine utmost yang,
The steaming medicinal aroma permeates heaven’s fragrance,
Instantly spraying sweet dew, the soul-returning nectar.
Drinking to radiant intoxication, ever drunk through long days,
Whirling and dancing in time with reed pipes and flutes,
In blissful joy, ascending to heaven’s realm.

The triple-eight forms the knife’s breath, lingering slow,
The *gui* relies on *wu-ji*’s inhalation and exhalation to refine.
Flying and concealing, the ten stems attest to added growth.
When creation congeals the immortal elixir’s body,
Consume it in due time to ascend in spirit-flight—
Beyond the sun’s flight, one attains carefree wandering.

*Again*
With each breath, the medicinal aroma deepens,
The five spirits stir, stirring golden sand from the sea.
The immortal of the Celestial River ferries the sacred raft.
Water fills the golden city, congealing cold dew,
Man and ox vanish, the moon shines empty splendor—
A pure wind bears one homeward in laughter.

*Ten Thousand Springtimes*
Jade lock and golden pass exchange seals and closures—

Jade lock and golden pass,
Yin and yang strike the watchman’s clapper, firmly sealed.
Mutually congealing, they restrain.
Transforming without attachment,
The belly brims with fine, cool wind.
In the nine qi of heaven,
Clouds tread without the slightest veil.
The root and stem of Dao,
Silently harmonizing,
Pervade the three realms in clarity.

*Again*
A single qi of harmonious surge,
The heart-ape tightly locked, unable to flee.
Tamed and softened, it receives—
The pass is sealed in secrecy,
Guarded by the Great One’s misty embrace.
When the two merge,
Silent and dim, they endure long—
Forming the odd and even,
Refinement must reach nine nines.
Then one enjoys the boundless longevity of emptiness.

*Again*
Vast qi flows and circulates,
Continuously cradling true *chan* stillness.
Nurturing the spirit, it rises—
Profound and obscure, hard to awaken,
Congealing the mysterious and yellow to gestate.
Creation’s round emptiness,
Polishes the spirit-terrace to translucence.
Ever responsive,
The wood-child’s form excels,
Stepping steadily along the cloud-radiance path.

*Slow Tune of the River Spirit: True Sitting*
Cultivating truth amidst ten thousand entanglements,
The mind’s ground demands fierce effort.
Nurturing the foolish and clumsy,
Releasing the four great elements,
One rests at ease, untroubled.
Will like iron—
Vigorously severing the horse and ape, breaking both legs,
Ceasing all waywardness, gathering all into quiescence.
The eight passes, six viscera, and three palaces,
All harmonized and smooth,
The ten thousand spirits rejoice.
Tortoise-breath, mysterious and unbroken,
Attains limpid stillness—mother and child,
Round and conjoined.
The two natures merge—
Revealing the yang body,
Refined to the moment of flight.
The mind, ice-pure,
Creation’s true emptiness returns beyond things,
The effortless Dao, perfectly complete, yet seeming incomplete.
Releasing the nature-moon’s radiance,
It pierces through heaven and earth.

*Slow Tune of the River Spirit: False Sitting*
The valley spirit dies, unaroused,
Burrowed in delusion, the heart errs in its merit.
Futilely chiseling,
Seeking the mysterious and wondrous,
Relying on the water and grain’s cloud-root.
Wasted effort—
Twisting and contorting the body, constantly grasping,
Focusing intently, the earthly pass lacks lock and key.
The heavenly gate remains unbroken, tightly sealed,
How could qi linger between being and non-being?
The three palaces’ ascent and descent are hindered,
Clinging to one nature, losing the returned,
The dregs of the Western advent.
Dao’s essence thins—
The soul and spirit stray,
In motion and stillness, dragon and tiger coil.
Ignorant of the sacred key,
How can one refine the jade crucible’s golden water?
Without the elixir’s body,
How could one tread the clouds in joy?
If by chance the mysterious mechanism becomes clear,
One may meet the Penglai covenant.

*No Mundane Thoughts: Qi Deviance*
One breath, one sigh,
Ignoring the valley spirit, the mysterious female’s continuity falters.
Hurried gathering and scattering defy creation,
Root and stem hang precariously, far removed.
No return above or below,
Coming and going lose control,
Not directed toward the three palaces.
Internally lost, seeking the superior,
The mind clings to one fixed point.
Externally flooding the four limbs and skin,
Floating and scattered, restless,
Clumsily unsettled.
Beholding the body’s many tremors,
Transforming a thousandfold—how could it be otherwise?
The mind not reduced to cold ashes,
The form not withered like deadwood,
Life and nature diverge like cloud and mud.
Chan’s power stagnates—
How could one achieve the pure yang body?

*Plum Blossoms by the River: Qi Deviance Returned to Right*
A vast qi stirs in the Primordial Palace,
Aligning with refined cultivation, moving the pure wind.
Piercing the three passes,
Naturally filling above and below.
The victorious external wanderings are drawn inward,
All in one finger’s span,
Gathered into the jade path’s midst.
The spirit welcomes the celestial valley, proud in the clear sky,
Nurturing harmony and fusion, attaining free flow.
The body, unentangled, becomes limpid—
Profound stillness verifies the *Can Tong Qi*.
Self and other both forgotten, truly expansive,
The principle of non-action,
Perfectly complete,
Reveals sacred merit.

*Plum Blossoms by the River: Spirit Deviance*
The four limbs’ qi scatters, losing root and sprout—
Becoming spirit deviance, emitting empty flowers.
A thousand strange phenomena,
Before the eyes, chaotic as hemp.
All sages and worthies appear at will,
Transforming endlessly,
All due to a single thought’s deviation.
Unaware of the heart’s illness, still boasting,
Scenes boundless, affairs deemed fine.
Specially obscuring the mysterious and unobstructed,
The Dao-eye veiled by dust.
Not practicing true *chan*, one falls into demonic realms—
Yin and yang sundered,
See how one refines the cinnabar sand.

*Plum Blossoms by the River: Spirit Deviance Returned to Right*
The numinous breast, washed clean of dust and filth,
The illusory form hollowed, the outer guise foolish.
In the tranquil and indifferent realm,
One gallops, delighting in Dao’s essence.
A single qi restrains the spirit, the spirit intoxicated,
Riding drunkenness in dance,
Golden lads and jade maidens lend support.
The mysterious mechanism’s true creation demands diligent effort—
Shedding the mortal frame,
Entering emptiness.
Expansive and luminous,
The nature-moon, solitary and round.
Coldly immersed in *chan*’s heaven, wind and mist still,
The ice-flesh’s radiance,
Proud and limpid,
Shines like a jade flask.

*Again*
Scenery forgotten, passions extinguished, ten thousand entanglements sparse,
Gazing and cleansing, Dao’s essence unfurls.
Grasping the origin,
Spirit and breath move slowly.
Nurturing the spirit-terrace, still as a mountain,
Ever silent,
Regulating the spirit, with surplus to spare.
The forest of true realms, proud in *Huaxu*,
Revealing the primordial beginning,
Wondrously thus.
Formless, majestic,
The appearance aligns with emptiness.
Dancing and frolicking, unobstructed,
Singing wildly,
Rejoicing unrestrained,
Like *Jieyu*.

*Again*
Ten thousand slants do not mar the solitary spirit’s wonder—
The wondrous appearance aligns with emptiness.
The sea of awakening, vast and boundless,
Shines uniquely, surpassing the black pearl.
Clouds still, water cold, without the slightest veil,
The pure body,
Pierces mountains and walls with ease.
In the wild, no one—proud as a pair of wild ducks,
Striding the heavenly thoroughfare,
Playing in the immortal capital.
A single point of round clarity,
Unrestrained by transformation.
The belly, full of harmonious surge, cradles fine jade,
Secretly stored in the treasury,
No longer seeking,
To sell at a good price.

*Immortal in the Moon: Guest and Host Exchange*
Seeking the wondrous, cultivating truth,
Dividing the primordial spirit as guest,
A single qi as host.
The mysterious mechanism unobscured,
Relying on Kan and Li’s essence,
Balancing the three and five.

The vast qi shapes creation,
Dissolving the corpse’s poise, pure Yang coalesces.
The sevenfold return of true Yin descends,
Work complete, traces gathered,
Returning to recognize the primal ancestor.
Refining spirit to merge with the Dao in profound obscurity,
Only then does the true emptiness reveal its form.
The real mark is hard to behold.
Boundless transformations,
Manifest the luminous pearl of nature at will,
Radiating expansive light.
Alone transcending beyond the three realms,
Commanding purity to soar across past and present.
Reversing guest to host,
First elevating the ultimate merit of universal virtue.

---

The resolute scholar delves into the origin,
Discerning the floating and sinking, movement and stillness,
Distinguishing essence and function.
Spirit, initially a guest in form,
Relies on the misty qi as host,
Timely uplifted.
At the staff’s tip, sun and moon are borne,
Turning heaven and earth, shifting the qi’s flow.
The Northern Dipper and Southern Stars revolve,
Their brilliance illuminating the grotto-heaven,
Deep within, the Wood Lad rejoices.
Now the host wields sole authority,
Witnessing Yang’s extremity returning,
Yin descending in its season.
True work molds creation,
Revealing the original body’s state,
Its clear radiance pure as ice.
Resplendent, without a speck of defilement,
Resounding through the three realms,
Permeating the ten directions.
In utter oneness, transformed into the formless,
Neither empty nor existent, beyond birth and extinction.

---

*Wu Ling Chun: The Desire Realm*

In the Desire Realm, the Valley Spirit first divides,
Passions dissolved in harmonious fusion.
Great Unity’s clouds rise, earth-enveloping winds,
Peak-topped rains, mist-laden.

Creation’s Yin and Yang ascend and descend in accord,
The eight vessels flow with sweet spring’s nectar.
Zither tones, resonant and clear, stir the ears’ wisdom,
Utter stillness brews wondrous work.

---

One qi first parts from primordial chaos,
Awaiting the eight trigrams and nine palaces.
Within the crucible, Kan and Li unite,
Their subtle movements swelling through the flesh.

Turning the celestial pivot, spirit settles in stillness,
Dragon and Tiger harmonize with metal and wood.
Nature pervades the three palaces, creation’s marvel,
Silently entering the formless.

---

Desires suddenly forgotten, passions unindulged,
Abandoning cunning, the Dao nurtures form.
When heart and trace converge, half-drunk, half-sober,
Mother and child gather in the Yellow Court.

Nine qi in heaven resound with jade-like tones,
Day and night unceasing.
The immortal lad is ushered into the boundless,
Transforming, displaying mighty spirit.

---

When the heart delights in limpid stillness,
Yin within embraces Yang’s essence.
A rustling, harmonious wind rises from the sea’s depths,
Filling the six viscera and nine palaces.

One qi stirs, the Big Dipper turns,
The Celestial Valley welcomes the supreme spirit.
All thoughts dissolved, pure virtue perfected,
A mere footstep scorns the roc’s path.

---

*Yong Yu Le: The Form Realm*

Heart’s concerns congeal to ash,
Wondrous perfection, virtue complete,
Dignity flawless.
Profoundly serene in meditation,
Obscurely veiled by form,
Within the crucible, windscape revealed.
Clouds and mist come and go,
Tiger and Dragon chant and roar,
Delighting the Wood Lad’s spirit.
Expanding the chest, deeply drinking harmonious qi,
Unfettered, drunk in the season of chanting.

---

Pipes and songs boil like cauldrons,
Startling phoenixes dance,
Freely traversing in ranks.
All eyes filled with auspicious light,
The sky brimming with propitious mist,
Faintly drifting red snow.
Clapping the breast, ice gleams,
Filling the lapel, the moon chills,
Vigorously coursing with the Dao’s luminous clarity.
Proud in the true realm,
True joy, true awe,
Transcendent wonder unmatched.

---

The mechanism moves alone,
Yet still bound by form,
Dignified, spirit upright.
All leaks sealed,
All entanglements severed,
The heart’s mirror opened, vast and clear.
The meditation barrier shattered,
Deeply entering the crucible’s spring,
Myriad forms encircle the seven luminaries.
The Milky Way turns,
Light from the Moon’s Grotto flies,
Low against the azure sky, reflecting.

---

Pure Yang binds the body,
Auspicious clouds, high repose,
A light, crisp wind brushes the face.
Joy unbounded,
Transformations beyond measure,
At times, wild songs and chants.
Pipes and reeds swirl,
Thunder’s drums resound,
The Wood Lad plays in surplus blessing.
In profound obscurity,
Witnessing a single point of perfect emptiness,
Utmost purity, utmost clarity.

**Long Thought of the Immortal**

In the formless realm, life returns to emptiness,
Nature returns to emptiness.
Object and self both forgotten, the wind of wisdom unfurls,
In profound obscurity, all merges as one.

Exerting spiritual work, uniting with primordial chaos,
The pristine radiance of spirit shines amid heaven and earth.
The formless body flows freely everywhere.

---

The mind settled, awareness stilled,
Host and guest dwell together in profound tranquility.
Neither ox nor man is seen in form.
The true nature is numinous, the image is numinous,
In movement and stillness, non-doing merges with the boundless dark.
Perfect emptiness pervades above and below.

---

**Immortal of the Yellow Crane Grotto – Stubborn Emptiness**

Deeply stained by the illness of stubborn emptiness,
Unknowing of the true mandate of cultivation.
In vain, one remains blind to the transformations of yin and yang,
The true heart’s mirror shrouded in dense obscurity.

Severing thoughts to perceive the nature—
This is but sinking into hollow purity.
Without refining the elixir to perfect the wondrous body,
One shall never, even after long ages, return to sagehood.

---

The root of life and nature is profound,
The Dao’s foundation lies in yin and yang’s creation.
To cling solely to the purity of a single point of spirit’s light
Is to nearly lose sight of heaven’s Way.

The Three Thieves must be deeply investigated,
The Four Images must be inversely examined.
Seizing the power of heaven and earth’s transformations,
One crystallizes the treasure of perfect clarity.

---

**A Sprig of Plum Blossoms – Severing Emptiness**

Seizing the fire’s timing of the celestial cycle,
The elixir furnace burns day and night,
Simmering mercury, refining lead.
From the sea’s depths and riverbanks, qi billows like smoke,
Day after day surging, penetrating the Three Fields.

Failing to awaken, one sinks into the trance of profound meditation—
Spirit scatters, qi disperses,
Mother and child cannot unite.
Yin and yang lose their union, the mystery obscured.
For nine years and three, the crucible’s heaven remains unseen.

---

A single qi ascends, the precious tripod seethes,
Water and fire intermingle,
Lead flies along the jade path.
Yet without spirit’s steadfastness, the two cannot merge as one,
Separated as if by clouds and mud,
The profound mystery remains unattainable.

It is essential to still the heart and sever the myriad entanglements,
Then nature and life naturally blend, returning to Chan.
The yang soul transforms, freely ascending,
In a hundred days and a thousand mornings,
Cloud-stepping into the crucible’s heaven.

---

**Gazing at the Tide – True Emptiness**

True emptiness is the root and foundation,
Wholly reliant on spirit and breath,
Differentiating the essence of the Five Aggregates.
Harmonizing the six spirits, suffusing the Three Isles,
The Milky Way’s waves surge with the numinous raft.
The Qian tripod simmers cinnabar,
As clouds bear the Kun ox,
And the wind conveys the ram-drawn chariot.
Secretly circulating the Yellow Gold Well,
Forming resplendence, crystallizing jade-like blossoms.

The most wondrous livelihood flourishes,
Manifesting the principle in perfect emptiness,
With a profound vision unmarred.
Pure and undivided, the One True,
Penetrating heaven and earth,
Vast and unhindered, without obstruction.
The square inch of the heart encompasses river sands.
Freely delighting in wind and moon,
Intoxicated, reclining amid mist and rosy clouds.
Within this, the true message is imparted—
Bestowed solely upon the family of Daoists.

---

Form and spirit both wondrous,
Spirit unobstructed, transcendent,
Solemnly independent in profound mystery.
Revealing principle, simplifying emotions,
Emptiness and form without barrier,
Unveiling the ultimate cause.
The ancestral intent is secretly transmitted in emptiness.
As the mind’s realm and all phenomena dissolve,
Wisdom’s understanding is entirely dispelled.
A single stretch of true purity,
Expanding the spirit’s transformation,
Emerging from Kun and Qian.

The wondrous body of vast emptiness is perfected,
Manifesting thusness without image,
Loftily proud in the heavens of Chan.
Resplendent wisdom’s light,
Majestic true reality,
The boundless Dharma realm of the myriad phenomena.
Uniting with the Dao, one wields mighty power,
Having shattered the void,
Even kalpas’ force cannot refine.
Shattering the shell of rebirth,
Embracing the True One,
Transcending the flow of years.

---

**Laozi’s Chant – Three Thousand Merits**

Purifying the spirit, seizing the phoenix’s marrow,
Cessation of breath gathers the crow’s blood.
Six yangs soar through the cosmos,
Five qi penetrate the joints.
Clouds, thunder, wind, and lightning strike,
Toward the Three Heavens,
Descending ice and snow.
Jade mountains and sea peaks spew crimson mist,
Resplendent as daylight,
The nature’s light shines through.

The two passions unite.
The heavens of Chan equalize the transformations of things,
The mind writes the script of awe and joy.
The yang soul fully embodies creation,
Called true merit—
Merit most wondrous.
The three thousand numbers unite without flaw.
Spirit transcends beyond the realm of things,
Forever departing birth and extinction.

---

A numinous wind permeates the marrow,
Vital qi fills the limbs and joints.
Drawing and adding from Li and Kan,
In movement and stillness, they are arranged in exchange.
The tally of the celestial cycle is complete,
Gathering yin and yang,
Qi and spirit conjoin.
The Yellow Court’s brocade canopy is fully pregnant with auspice,
Transforming the yang soul,
The sacred land’s heaven is thoroughly penetrated.

In fine distinction,
The three thousand true transformations,
The ebb and flow of the mysterious and the yellow are revealed.
The nature’s light is without a speck of defilement,
Luminous as ice,
Spreading pure snow.
Instantly transcending the Three Realms in true joy,
Singing and chanting, wandering the Gardens of Lang,
The Dao’s sentiment is supremely pure.

---

**Laozi’s Chant – Eight Hundred Practices**

The numinous source is without a speck of defilement,
Ever responsive, ever pure.
Yin and yang have ceased their union,
Mother and child rejoice in the same palace.
Embracing the True One in emptiness,
Expanding perfect clarity,
Illuminating the heart’s mirror.
Everywhere, enlightenment shatters, returning to extinction,
The wondrous function of the Dharma vast and boundless.

Possessing true practice,
Compassion shapes the Dao’s foundation,
Sorrow and empathy, the heart without contention.
Universally bestowing, benefiting all things,
Holding humility as virtue,
Wielding it as authority.
Perfecting the eight hundred, the fruit of no-leakage,
Instantly transcending the cloud steps steadily,
Shedding the mortal to return to sagehood.

---

**Freeing the Heart – Returning to Youth**

Earth, water, fire, wind,
Composing the Four Great,
In the end, aging decays into emptiness.
Life and death, like the cicada’s molt,
Rely on wondrous work in solemn cultivation.
Uniting with heaven and earth, shifting true creation,
Yin and yang’s movement, matching female and male.
The spirit’s embryo splits and judges,
The numinous body suffuses in mist,
Light and healthy, returning to youth.

Nurturing thusness to perfection,
The mysterious emperor’s message,
Crafted to emptiness, the Dharma image spiritually penetrates.
Secretly harboring vast qi,
Expanding transformations,
The body boundless.
Freely resplendent, in the original form,
Mounting the simurgh and crane, laughing proudly in the heavens.
Unrestrained and at ease,
Manifesting transcendence from the mortal to the sage,
A thousand ages of pure wind.

---

A single qi’s mysterious work.

The Three Marvels’ true creation,
Originally jade-like countenance perfected.
Merging into the treasure vault,
Secretly harboring the nine-turns’ divine elixir.
Defying the sun’s form, majestic in true appearance,
Dwelling in the real realm, vast as boundless heaven.
Let the sun and moon hasten,
Urging the four elements to gradual decay.
All things in their prime cannot endure,
The borrowed body easily lost—
Only that solitary, icy clarity stands firm.
Vast and sacred transformation,
Soaring and dancing, freely singing and strumming.
Accompanied by winds beyond the clouds,
Bright moon in clear sky,
Manifesting myriad hidden and revealed forms.
Returning to youth, never aging,
Facing calamities and kalpas,
The formless spirit abides in peace.

Without worldly thoughts, the firing times unbalanced—
The celestial cycle’s firing times,
Must rise and fall, soar and settle,
Without error or fault.
Qi ascends, piercing the crimson gates,
Breaching the nine heavens with searing heat.
Eyes struggle to open,
Ultimately consumed by fire’s disaster,
Swiftly one must adjust.
Prolonging the years,
Transforms into demonic realms, sinking into ruin.
The six spirits lose control, rampant,
The three corpses run wild,
The five thieves all turn vicious.
To quell the raging flames, return to the jade path,
Deeply enter the spirit palace, vast and open.
The three thieves circulate,
Water and fire intermingle,
Forging the elixir.
Driving them back to rectitude,
Attaining the pure essence of sages and saints.

Autumn in the courtyard—
Perfect Realization:
Yin and yang fully equipped, the Dao’s wind pure.
Essence preserved, celestial truth intact.
Discerning hardness and softness, movement and stillness,
Refining the nine returns, the elixir body renewed.
Upholding the single nature, already spiritually awakened,
Everywhere revealing the whole self.
Lucid in the three voids, unimpeded,
Merging with the great void, the body purified, transcending dust.

Again—
Aspiration pervades heaven and earth, uniting spirit.
The subtle workings preserve perfect truth.
Creation’s mysteries at the ultimate of profound wonder,
Refining the nine yangs, the soul transforms in swift succession.
The Western Patriarch’s intent unfolds with ease,
Intimately embracing the unobstructed Dharma gate.
Responding and transforming universally like the Ganges’ sands,
Revealing wondrous perfection, the essence pure and clear.

Again—
Thusness thoroughly penetrates, nature perfectly luminous.
The samadhi principle deeply refined.
Though all phenomena manifest,
It is but the single spirit—
Yin’s soul and its emotions.
The mysterious mechanism must be awakened, the will clarified.
The elixir body in the cauldron, simmering and boiling.
Nurturing the pure yang’s dharma image,
Nature and life wholly preserved,
Eternally safeguarding the unborn.

*End of Scroll Three of the Collected Writings on Meeting the Real*
*Scroll Four of the Collected Writings on Meeting the Real*

**By Chaoranzi Wang Guchang**

**Spring Comes from Beyond the Heavens**

Fame and profit—what are they?
Sigh for the Six Dynasties, the Seven Kingdoms,
The Five Hegemons’ rivers and mountains.
How many rises and falls,
But a dream in Nanke.
Time silently wears all away.
Awakened to misty mountains and flowing waters,
I long to return—
Staff in hand, straw cloak donned.
Let the seasons pass,
Delighting in nurturing spirit and cultivating qi,
Whether moving or still, all is leisurely drift.

At home, snow on the plum, fire on the jujube,
Brewing a jade flask’s shimmering waves,
Filling it with golden ripples.
Drinking to blissful intoxication,
Spirit soaring beyond the clouds,
True joy arises in carefree chanting.
Accompanied by the clear wind and bright moon,
Through the heavens’ clarity,
Dancing and whirling in freedom.
Releasing harmonious qi,
Attaining the primordial body’s form,
Transcending the farthest shores.

**II**

Returning to the root, cultivating the real.
Awaiting the first stir of yang,
The five qi fully extended.
The Golden Lad bestows righteousness,
The Jade Maiden spreads benevolence.
Hard and soft harmonize in union.
Gathering in the Yellow Court’s immortal hall,
Wisdom’s wind guides,
Feasting with all spirits.
Auspicious mist thickens,
Floating in the jade flask’s snowy waves,
Refining and infusing lead and silver.

Skin like ice, radiant in rosy curtains,
Intoxicated by the three wonders’ light,
Jade petals fresh and pure.
Body smooth as orchid fragrance,
Soul soaring on feathered wings,
Keeping company with Dao and virtue.
Proud in the vast emptiness,
Truly pure and still,
Unchanging, ever-spring.
The treasure within nature
Illumines the ten directions and three realms,
Transcending the icy moon.

---

**Water Melody**

Nurturing the true life with harmony,
Spirit’s radiance shatters the murky paths.
Amidst bright mountains and waters,
In the depths of Thunder Marsh, the mysterious pearl gestates.
The Seven Luminaries pivot around the Northern Star,
Resplendent golden flower qi congeals,
Withered wood revives anew.
The numinous viscera, wind and mist stilled,
At the mountain’s peak, the moon’s wheel stands alone.

Piercing the three heavens,
Nourishing the nine cauldrons,
Drinking the jade nectar.
In Huaxu’s realm, laughing and carefree,
Deeply intoxicated, jade lads lend support.
Graceful as the magic mushroom chariot, crane-drawn,
Galloping through the pure yang’s sacred realm,
Even the cosmos cannot confine.
The serene, precelestial visage,
Manifest or hidden, merges with emptiness.

**II**

Wisdom’s wind sweeps away demonic obstructions,
The sacred sword severs the wheel of rebirth.
Within, spirit and breath settle,
Driving forth sweet dew to sprinkle the numinous terrace.
The four images, five phases, and three-in-one
Gather in the cauldron, mist thickening like bellows’ key,
Stirring clouds and thunder to life.
Water cradles golden blossoms,
Fire nurtures jade lotuses to bloom.

Aligning with celestial patterns,
Harmonizing nine and six,
Uniting the three powers.
Aiding the formation of a robust body,
Clear wind and bright moon as eternal companions.
In the profound and obscure, essence transforms,
Merging into the formless Dao’s alchemy,
Spirit’s function vast and boundless.
Seemingly returning to ultimate bliss,
In an instant, savoring Penglai.

---

**Dispelling Sorrow**

Through the ages, the common way:
The strong often bully the weak.
Ants’ quarrels breed strife and evil.
Heaven watches through the eye of Confucius,
Determining wealth and nobility—
No principle is arbitrary.
The resolute and heroic,
None compare to those who seek Dao,
Embracing utmost emptiness and pure joy.
Swiftly harmonizing wood’s liquid and metal’s essence,
Within the nine-tiered jade palace,
Refining the mysterious frost elixir.

Radiant,
The chamber gleams with splendor,
The yang body takes flight,
Transforming beyond all bounds.
Releasing the heart beneath the bright moon,
Indulging in intoxication,
Jade lads pour the wine.
All sounds—whistling winds and pipes—
Resound in clarity.
Proud beyond the mundane,
In the vast and serene expanse,
The ancestral intent shines alone,
Zen’s heavens thoroughly penetrated,
Securing the path to longest life.

---

**Slow River of Crimson**

Seeing through glory and splendor,
Wielding wisdom’s sword,
Swiftly fleeing life and death.
Cast aside cleverness,
Shatter the body, empty the chamber,
Inwardly delve into principle.
Green waters and blue mountains as companions,
Clear wind and bright moon as confidants.
Singing and rejoicing in the celestial truth,
The beauty of the eternal real.

Heart serene,
Spirit joyful.
Flowing freely,
Moving or still at will.
Like a solitary cloud or wild crane,
Coming and going beyond measure.
The true wind of Śākya earnestly tended,
Cleansing all hindrances, coarse and base.
Awakening to perfect clarity,
A single point realizes bodhi,
Surpassing all merit.

**II**

The steadfast scholar, delving into the origin,
Relies on resolute determination,
Breaking free from the dusty net.
Focusing on spirit,
Harmonizing the true and plain,
Inwardly pure and tranquil.
One qi, misty and vast, creates transformation,
The nine palaces above and below connect in flow.
The three lights descend to illuminate heaven and earth,
Everlasting splendor.

Golden light resplendent,
The heart’s lamp bright.
Ever pure and still,
Free from partiality.
In every instance, the true form manifests,
Through kalpas, its image endures.
Neither within nor without, the true realm revealed,
Unborn and undying, penetrating celestial clarity.
Having shattered the void,
Escaping the wheel of rebirth,
Enjoying longevity without end.

**Candlelight Sways Red: For Gao Yingchan**

Heart cold toward schemers,
Will follows the teaching father to seek the ancestral root.
Heaven’s secret art first expands,
Ice and snow fill the numinous viscera.
Sealing the metal and earth cauldron,
Regulating yin and yang,
Revolving the cycles of zi and wu.
Rising and descending in due time,
Creation’s mystery, the formless,
The three lights radiantly emerge.

Life and nature mutually sustain,
Heaven and earth harmonize, roles defined.
In profound stillness, merging with spirit’s work,
The dharma image pervades the sands.
This principle—do not slight it,
Nor indulge desires, transgressing bounds.
One day, merit complete,
Returning to the three isles together,
Name surpassing past and present.

**II: Warning of Good and Evil**

The Dao’s gate opens,
At the destined moment of jiazi’s celestial origin.
The Three Pure Ones’ immortal courts list the names,
Refinement must transcend the ordinary.
This is the hidden one’s awakened truth,
Abandoning glory, pure clouds unattended.
Carving open perfect enlightenment,
Shattering the void,
Climbing the ladder to the cloud path.

Foolish streams lost in the sea of desire,
Delighting in the husk’s return to myriad destinies.
In the darkest night, the three lights obscured,
Hands and feet utterly at a loss.
Bound in Fengdu’s chains, no recourse,
Regretting delayed cultivation,
Lost on the path, steps misplaced.
When will they ascend to the true realm,
Riding the clear wind,
Encountering it at last?

**Embroidered Needle: A Loyal Admonition**

**Reflecting on the Futile Striving to Shoot Down the Sun**

Aspiring to shoot the sun and turn back heaven’s course,
Yet all ends in vain exhaustion.
Buried through eons untold,
Once fame, profit, *qi*, and wealth are seen through,
Their lingering winds swept clean in a single stroke.
A heart of pure integrity remains.
Comprehending the three thieves within,
One steers the stars and constellations,
Guides the Silver River’s turning,
Yet pours waves over the elixir crucible.
Mysterious and yellow *qi* lead the way,
Binding earth’s marrow and heaven’s essence,
Suddenly soaring, then tumbling in chaos.
Refining jade, smelting gold,
Spirit transforms into utter emptiness,
The body merges with the profound mystery of *xi yi*.
Rising high on iridescent clouds,
Revealing the wondrous form,
Abiding in true emptiness with eternal pride.
Such flavors of the Way—
Yet worldly folk, though near, never attain.

**II: Brewing the Golden Elixir**

Irrigating the three fields above and below,
Washing away eons of dust in a single rinse.
Nurturing the vastness like Yan Hui’s master,
Embracing poverty’s joy, admiring Yan Hui’s ease,
Floating on lakes like Fan Li’s light skiff.
Within, one unfolds magnanimity and harmony,
Reveling in the wondrous garden,
Where the Dao’s winds flourish abundantly.
Purifying the heart’s illumination,
Never straying from oneness,
Embracing softness and following ritual.
The breast brims with cloud-capped majesty,
Stealing the moon palace’s toad essence,
The sun palace’s crow marrow.
These two substances mutually nourish,
Refining jade frost and cinnabar,
Filling the chamber with cinnabar radiance.
Transforming into a mysterious body,
Surely becoming the primal yang soul’s leader.
Treading the wind, transcending,
Not dwelling in the nine heavens’ bounds.

**Water Dragon’s Chant: Harmonious Nurturing Following Heaven’s Numbers**

Silently aligning with the celestial cycles,
Unseen, it entwines the revolving measures.
Yin and yang’s longing forms,
Wind, thunder, clouds, and lightning,
Congeal to bring forth timely rains.
Droplet by droplet, the numinous source pours,
Irrigating all,
Yet old dust cannot defile.
The winding river gleams pure,
Crows seize the jade hare,
Osmanthus branches bloom,
Spilling crimson mists.
The two *qi* blend and gather,
Scattering golden light,
Three mountains densely arrayed.
Tempering a robust body,
A youthful visage moistened,
With ample leisure to soar.
Spirit transcends the mundane,
Beyond the dust, in pristine clarity,
The true countenance fully revealed.
This is the kalpa’s one thread,
A living craft through heaven,
Awaiting each person’s awakening.

**II: Heaven and Earth’s Judgment of Yin and Yang’s Positions**

Primal simplicity scatters, *qi* swirls to form vessels.
The mother’s womb holds the child’s belly,
The child is born of the mother,
Mysteriously parting auspicious signs.
The body refines into purity,
Expanding the spirit’s chamber,
Clouds recede, dust burdens lifted.
Wind clears, moon brightens,
Golden youths dance,
Reveling on Mount Jia,
Scenes wondrous and strange.
Returning from the feast, deeply intoxicated,
Arriving at Hua Xu,
Yet the jade pass remains barred.
Splitting the jade curtain,
The host invites me,
Secretly transmitting the ancestral intent.
How could there be three voids?
The body manifests purity,
Perfect clarity, non-dual.
Freely roaming, unbound,
Unentangled, unshackled,
Like the vast emptiness itself.

**III: Wisdom Sweeps Away the Thicket, Opening the Heart-Ground**

*Qi* nurtures, *qi* swirls in purity.
The three wonders gather in the crucible,
Within the blazing fire,
The elixir flower blooms auspiciously.
From the sea’s depths, a clear breeze rises,
Exotic fragrance sprays,
Lush and rich in form.
Wooden lads playfully tease,
Soaring unimpeded,
Adorned by jewel-bright light,
Flames of rosy clouds ablaze.
The secret chamber, cool and ever-charming,
Expands the breast,
Bathed in frost’s radiance.
Smoke vanishes, fire extinguishes,
Clouds recede, mists disperse,
Instantly becoming non-dual.
With towering presence, carefree,
Affairs merge with river sands,
Light and dust undifferentiated.
This primal wondrous existence,
The pure and empty Dharma-body,
Attains the bodhisattva’s rank.

**IV: The Perfected One Grasps the Handle of Cultivating Truth**

Beyond the ordinary, delving into the profound words’ ultimate meaning.
Limpid, deep contemplation,
Unbroken, perfect breath,
*Qi* swirls in true nature.
A single fusion with the blazing wind’s force,
Five gates open,
Three wonders’ light converges.
At the time of fullness and emptiness,
Yin and yang transform toward peace,
Revealing the true creation,
Harmonizing with heaven’s mandate.
Composing the spirit’s centeredness,
Manifesting eternal spring,
Wind and light towering and distant.
Myriad strands of rosy clouds,
A range of misty peaks,
Fill the sky with clarity.
Distant and near pavilions,
Reflecting cloud-borne steps,
Carefree in song and chant.
Reveling in the cool Dharma-realm,
At ease in life’s craft,
Attaining the saint of non-action.

**Auspicious Crane Immortal: Cherishing the Heart’s Devotion to Simplicity**

Inwardly revering plainness and frugality,
Drifting like duckweed,
Footprints lost in waves of sinking.
Wisdom and brilliance never employed,
Recalling riches that shake the heavens,
Mistaken dreams startling one awake.
Fiercely severing the cords of desire,
Seeking the leisure of true winds,
Graceful and ample.
The valley spirit at peace,
Breath slows, connecting to truth,
The primal *qi* stirs the bellows’ key.
Spending freely from jade crucible and golden tripod,
Fire billows, clouds surge,
Mysteriously conceiving the elixir medicine.
Spirit and soul refined,
Becoming pure and vast in form.
Toward the profound and boundless,
Penetrating the pot’s heaven,
Grasping the joy of cool winds and ease.
Merging with emptiness,
Truly pure, truly clear,
Resolving the one move of emptiness.

**Eternal Joy: Wondrous Alignment with Heaven’s Wheel**

Mastering the celestial wheel,
Turning the pivot of the seven governors,
The jade balance revolves.
Silently operating ascent and descent,
Pushing to the limits of creation,
A single *qi* transforms the three wonders.
Tortoise essence, toad marrow,
Phoenix fluid, crow blood,
Boiling in the crucible’s rolling brew.
The mysterious pearl forms,
Golden medicine fresh and radiant,
Spewing forth nine dragons’ lightning.
The infant enters the golden chamber,
The maiden returns to the silver palace,
Pipes and songs crowd the pure feast.
Kingfisher curtains lowered,
Pearl blinds rolled up,
Joyous auspicious clouds displayed.
Ice-cold, the sky vast,
Wind clear, moon bright,
Revealing the original face.
Perfect emptiness expands,
Unobstructed spiritual powers,
Scattering through the great void.

**II: Snail-Horn Merit, Fly-Head Profit**

Snail-horn merit,
Fly-head profit,
Swept away with a sigh.
With a flick of the hand, wielding the blade,
Cleaving open the pass’s essentials,
Within, the mysterious origin revealed.
Delusive clouds crumble,
Zen’s heaven glistens like ice,
Instantly the moon shines, winds sway.
Stamping a thousand streams,
Green waters limpid,
Universally bathing in one luminous vessel.
Standing alone, resolute,
A model of perfect fusion,
Near and far, undisturbed in oneness.
Coming and going distinctly,
All dualities dissolved,
Auspicious signs of the yang soul appear.
The cool other shore,
A wondrous, lively craft,
Sitting beyond, jade flowers gracefully bloom.
Towering, attaining
The flawless merit’s completion,
The saint’s mechanism fully realized.

**III: The Wisdom Sword’s Unyielding Edge**

The wisdom sword’s unyielding edge,
A hundred demons swept away,
Terrifying hearts and gall.
Fierce tigers captured alive,
Flood dragons seized in hand,
Unleashing awe-inspiring transformations.
Thunder drums roar,
Serpents fly like golden lightning,
Billowing clouds spew hailstones.
Through rivers and seas,
Tidal waves surge,
Two beasts locked in mortal combat.

**III: The Three Peaks’ Fiery Advance**

The three peaks’ fire advances,
Nine heavens’ rosy clouds dazzle,
Enveloping the treasure trove’s radiant display.
A thousand auspicious hues,
A single speck of gold,
The crucible and cauldron refine ceaselessly.
Simmered into jade-like pistils,
Skin like snow,
The jade person’s visage emerges.
The Wooden Lad rejoices,
Drawing near to return,
Exotic fragrance fills the courtyard.

**IV: The Qi’s Profound Mist**

Qi’s profound mist swirls,
Revolving the cosmos,
Myriad wondrous transformations arise.
Creation’s rise and fall,
East and west inverted,
Metal and Wood in tender affection.
A thousand crimson rosy strands,
A single golden radiance shines—
Surely the sun returns to the Toad Palace.
Exotic fragrance enhances,
Cassia blooms contend in splendor,
Six yin and nine yang engage in battle.
Clouds gather, rain scatters,
Wind clears, moon brightens,
The erstwhile visage reappears.
In stillness, tranquility deepens,
In leisure, contemplation settles,
The dharma realm joins in revelry.
The sparse net spans the Silver River,
Iron walls’ gates unlock,
Concealment and manifestation shift unseen.
Within nothingness, being stirs—
Body merged with river sands,
The wondrous field’s karma excels.

**The Resplendent Divine Light**

Sorrow and joy, thoughts stilled,
Movement and stillness, the heart hollowed,
No one in the vast wilds—boundless expanse.
Verdant qi harmonizes,
Skillful brew stirs wind and thunder.
Unfolding heaven and earth’s grand transformation,
As sweet rain,
Dharma seeds bloom into lotuses.
Auspicious signs appear,
Toward the Yellow Court’s brocade canopy,
The divine embryo wondrously forms.
Misty auspicious light envelops the body,
Bathed in the Nine Dragons’ waters,
Borne aloft to the Jasper Terrace.
Laughing in eternal spring,
Pipes and songs escort the golden kalpa.
Scenes cluster like resplendent jade blossoms,
Drunken, riding the wind,
Soaring and lingering in flight.
Attaining true joy,
The path ahead—birth and death self-destroy.

**II: The Divine Work’s Creation**

Divine work forges creation,
Revolving heaven’s pivot,
In leisure, silently aligning true cultivation.
Illuminating the Three Lights,
Shifting the Five Qi’s ebb and flow.
The Northern Dipper and Southern Stars encircle,
Rolling the Silver River,
Myriad streams surge in waves.
The Jade Pass opens,
Conveying the three chariots in ceaseless motion,
Together harnessing the Golden Ox.
Thunderclaps shake the cosmos,
Crimson light bursts through mountains and rivers,
Lightning flashes without end.
Spreading the Yellow Sprout,
Rosy clouds veil phoenix towers and dragon halls.
A priceless flawless pearl congeals,
The Wooden Lad rejoices,
Secretly securing the treasure.
In this form,
Drawn through emptiness to the fruition’s end.

**Southern Song Lyrics**

**I**
The cave’s lock tames the docile ape,
The reins restrain the unruly horse.
Qi congeals, spirit gathers—emptiness perfected.
Eons’ clouds disperse,
Proudly mastering one’s own heaven.
Bright moon, clear wind—refreshing,
Auspicious light veils the sacred lotus.
Wooden man and stone maiden discourse on the profound.
Transformative divine powers,
Beyond the mundane—attaining Golden Immortality.

**II**
Firmly rooted, the mechanism’s handle,
Deeply planted, the transformative power.
Plucking flowers, gathering leaves—all defilements dissolved.
Nurturing harmony’s surge,
Above and below, threading the Three Fields.
Riverbanks harmonize with crow and hare,
The cinnabar furnace cooks mercury and lead.
Counting the ninefold perfection of sacred work.
The body permeated with golden light,
Shimmering, illuminating the dhyāna heavens.

**III**
Utterly stilling thoughts, driving away all foulness,
Clarifying the heart, eradicating myriad ties.
The inner pivot’s bellows and keys—breath ceaseless.
One thread through the Three Palaces,
Warp and weft align with the celestial circuit.
Fire’s warmth tempers the golden crucible,
Brightly following the six hundred chapters.
Simmered into the sixteenfold body’s roundness.
Veiled and gleaming auspicious light,
Graceful, proudly soaring as a flying immortal.

**IV**
The candle ignites the heart’s radiance,
Clouds disperse, the moon of nature shines.
A flask of ice-like clarity, wind’s might roused.
Myriad forms interweave,
The Dipper’s handle revolves the celestial sphere.
Creation’s principle of non-action,
Vast and boundless, the Dao’s transformation towering.
In profound obscurity, aligning with heaven’s mechanism.
The hawk’s divine work,
The dharma realm steps upon clouds to return.

**V**
The numinous viscera cleansed of all dust,
The people’s mountain—qi’s singular birth.
The Three Fields plowed day and night by the iron ox.
Stirring wind and thunder’s moisture,
The golden well ever blooms with jade blossoms.
Fire’s power adjusted with care,
Frost-like skin simmered in season.
Round and bright, the square inch—ghosts and spirits startled.
Joyous immortal lads,
Feasting at will, soaring in flight.

**VI**
Supreme rank’s lightness and luxury,
Golden seals arrayed in mighty cauldrons.
Heaven-shaking renown—fleeting in its moment.
Lightning turns, stars fly,
The body vanishes, qi follows the wind.
Spitting at past clumsiness,
Feigning foolishness, not feigning wisdom.
The true yang’s essence—urgently cultivate and honor.
Nine nines’ work perfected,
Strolling at ease through Penglai’s palace.

**VII**
The great elixir gathered in the southwest,
Harmonized in the northeast’s corner.
Fire dragon and water tiger stir in heaven’s thoroughfare.
The Seven Governors’ pivotal mechanism?
Revolving, dispensing jade-like nectar.
The moon’s grotto sprays musk’s fragrance,
The water flask offers pearls of jade.
The Golden Lad plays and presents at the immortals’ capital.
Heaven’s countenance delights,
Granting a lifespan equal to emptiness.

**VIII**

**VIII**
Qi pierces the autumn light’s chill,
The breast harbors winds of radiant hue.
The body soars, twisting free from the Dragon Palace,
Hastening to the Orchid Court,
Where youth’s years rejoice in harmony.

Riding the tiger through limpid streams,
Driving the crow ‘neath the moon’s bright glow.
The cauldron’s work complete, the elixir perfected,
Wielding divine powers at will,
Unfettered, scorning the true void.

*Jiang Mei Yin*
The dark pearl spits auspicious lightning, flying bright.
Piercing the curtains, circling the celestial sphere.
The Yellow River’s flow reversed,
Wind and waves surge with divine might.

After midnight, the six yin lines descend once more,
The seventh return achieved—
The immortal lad dons his feathered robe.
Vast and serene, nurturing the towering Dao,
The host knows no resistance,
The guest returns in kind.

No trace of the primal beginning,
Yet the ten thousand images’ realm lingers dim.
Plunged into stillness, ever silent,
The whole body revealed,
Witnessing the vast chaos—
A single gleam.

**IX**
Mad apes and clumsy horses—debates on cultivating the true.
Most arduous,
The Dao hard to embrace.
Only the clear-eyed,
Generous, cast off the dust of the mortal world.

Toppling the mountain of gratitude, the heart shatters,
Delighting in rivers and clouds,
Taking refuge where virtue has neighbors.

The true union of Kan and Li nurtures the primordial spirit.
By the winding river’s edge,
The elixir sprouts anew.
Fermented in the jade field,
The nation is enriched, the people at peace.

Behold the majesty of the nine yangs—
The mysterious body robust,
Wielding the dharma-realm,
Manifesting the towering,
Pure transformation of the Dao.

**X**
Yellow robes, primal fortune—
The golden winds unfurl.

Striking the sparse paulownia, driving back the fading red.
All things return to their root,
The ancestral intent proves the perfect void.
In ceaseless toil, the time comes for the western decree to dawn—
Yellow chrysanthemums bloom,
Autumn’s fragrance fills the jade grove.

Ascending the heights, the sacred assembly’s joy knows no end.
The golden elder and the immortal youths gather.
A crisp qi fills the breast,
In profound stillness, the inner spirit communes.
Lofty and without action, true joy arises,
The original body revealed,
Vibrant and towering,
Eternal and mighty.

**XI**
Ignorance gnawed through, the契 of true cultivation.
Passing spring and autumn,
The will remains serene and secluded.
The moon’s light over the river takes flight,
Icy radiance illuminates the divine land.
After ten thousand kalpas, clouds disperse to reveal the ancestral intent—
Eyebrows raised,
All things at once cease.

The wondrous mechanism of life and nature merges in harmony.
Two entwined,
The spirit roams freely.
The profound true void,
Heaven and earth cannot contain.
Boundless transformation, neither inner nor outer—
The body of the great void,
Expansive as the primal beginning,
Qi’s brilliance afloat.

*To the Tune of "Picking Mulberries"*
For Sister Wang, whose nature is vast in samādhi, prajñā, and emptiness—
The hollow valley transmits the spirit.
Formless, celestial truth,
Clapping the cosmos shut—her visage utterly pure.

Through the years, unimpeded, the perfect brightness appears,
Unchanging, ever-spring.
The ancestral intent made manifest,
Yin’s essence and yang’s essence—a body beyond the body.

**II**
The pearl of nature gleams, clear as the moon over the dhyāna heavens.
Light flows through the three realms,
Auspicious signs fill the four seas.
Qi and spirit meet, descending jade frost.

The divine sprout evenly steeped, golden flowers bloom,
Fragrance suffuses her being.
Musk sprays the bright hall,
Through kalpas, the ancestral wind and Dao’s transformation flourish.

**III**
Wisdom’s light pierces through the coarse heart’s dross,
Severing thought, forgetting emotion.
Form still, spirit clear—
She cradles forth the perfect emptiness, a single gleam of brightness.

Sweeping clouds, dispelling mist, her divine mechanism triumphs,
Roaming free in all directions.
True form defies naming—
She brandishes radiance, illuminating the eight reaches.

**IV**
The pivot of will moves through stillness and motion, diligent from dawn to dusk,
Delighting in hardship and obscurity.
Subtle signs interflow,
Bellows and keys breathe in harmony with the Great Void.

The craftsman forges the body of pure yang through subdued fire,
Dharma realms merge in emptiness.
The true work of creation—
The cosmos entire returns to her grasp.

*To the Tune of "Green-Headed Duck"*
The Dao’s wind pure,
Martial curtains intertwine in ceaseless weaving.
Gathering the three heavens, harmonizing the two lands,
Revolving the primal palace—true qi flows.

Transforming hardness and softness, dragon and mare roam,
Responding to the seventy-two seasonal nodes.
Jade runs, gold flies,
Smoke spouts, mist is drawn—
Water and fire swiftly meet in union.

The six yin disperse, the three yang gather in the cauldron,
The elixir’s essence blooms in splendor.
Fragrant winds attend, golden light suffuses her form,
A few strands of rosy dawn gleam.

Suddenly the foundation opens—
Nature manifests in every detail,
Penetrating the great thousandfold worlds in all directions.
A gentle breeze carries her, soaring and leaping,
Treading the clouds, her bearing majestic.

Neither form nor emptiness,
Neither increase nor decrease—
The ocean’s treasure, the wish-fulfilling gem, emits true crystal.
Within and without, radiance flows unimpeded,
Her divine powers welcome the six penetrations.

Her primordial visage—
Work accomplished, vast and boundless,
Beyond all naming.

**II**
Her body rare and subtle,
The mysterious female of the valley-spirit as foundation.
Qi coils back through three thousand six hundred turns,
Tracing the twin passes—wind and waves ripple.

Around the golden city, the mud ox drags the phoenix,
Across the jade path, the wooden horse consults the tortoise.
Seven returns to the true,
Nine restorations of life—
The sacred embryo forms, auspicious mist suffuses.

Reciting prajñā, she strays not from samādhi,
Attaining the shore, she realizes non-action.
Beyond the true realm—
Crimson light and white radiance,
Entering and exiting, ever attendant.

The grotto-heaven gleams, pure and serene,
Her yang soul races lightly, swiftly as the wind.
She wields the spirit’s brilliance, boundless and resplendent,
Her countenance through the ages shines in full glory.

The wind of purity, the life of emptiness,
A vast and sudden point—utterly unblemished.
Unleashing the sacred transformation, penetrating heaven and earth,
The pearl reveals its mani-jewel.

Thus and thus, soaring and still—
Everywhere, the jade pools.

*To the Tune of "Drizzling Rain"*
The myriad conditions—her heart rests.

Releasing the spirit, emotions flow harmonious—
Chronic ailments retreat to their hidden dens.
The Dao’s work in clarity and emptiness ascends,
The subtle spirit breathes, its movement unhurried.

The Seven Luminaries greet the true in a pristine chamber,
Cool radiance, bones like frost.
Above the nine heavens, before the twelve towers,
The five qi surge skyward, veiling the golden palace.

Raising high the sword of wisdom, immortal youths pay homage,
Advancing its frigid light—
The keen edge lifts sun and moon.
Gathering the resplendent essence,
Concentrating in the crucible, stirring the mysterious frost to bloom.

Something takes form—
The supreme marvel returns to the nebulous.
The vastness of the nature-sea, steeped in non-action,
Gracefully transcends the Three Voids.

**II**
Qian’s primal potency begins,
While Kun’s gentle yielding shapes all things,
Silently harmonizing with heaven’s essence.
The transformations of creation, pure and empty,
Move the three essentials, the five phases’ divine water.

Nine qi surge skyward, the six yin stilled—
Purple mists arise in secret.
Manifesting ascent and descent, ebb and return to the origin,
The jade cavern’s three flowers unfurl golden pistils.

The Jade Emperor’s treasury, the wind-harp’s beauty—
Escorting the blue maidens,
The Crimson Palace feasts the red child.
Conch cups brim, fragrant waves rise,
Unrestrained, the great draught pours forth true joy.

Beyond the mundane, towering—
The yang body revealed, freed from life and death.
Across vast ages, bones revolve in cycles,
Yet this life’s end is perfectly clear.

*Collected Writings on Meeting the True, Scroll Four Concludes*
*Collected Writings on Meeting the True, Scroll Five*

Master Chaoran Wang Jichang’s *Manjianghong*

That primal spark—
from the first, beyond birth and extinction.
Yet chasing shadows, it falls into yin and yang,
shaped into form, its face and features ever-changing.
In this turbid age of five defilements,
the eight sufferings press and sear—
born, then dead; dead, then born again,
when will this cycle of birth and death end?

I teach you awakening,
your will seizing the mystery of the Yellow and the Dark.
The seven luminaries thread the three wonders,
the pivot of the pearl and the jade wheel stirs, qi flowing.
Nine returns, seven reversals,
the elixir timed and tempered—
in the golden cavern, jade blossoms unfurl,
five qi soaring as crimson snow.

*Drunken Ecstasy*
Nourish the vast with fasting heart.
The true work of the five phases overturned—
a divine wind rises and falls through the three isles of teeth.
The merit aligns with the celestial circuit,
the True One embraced within.

Form sustains the formless Dao,
the passionless brews the treasure of passion.
Upholding the body’s health, the spirit endures forever.
Alone, the dhyāna heavens revealed,
the heart illumined by the moon’s bright radiance.

*The Golden Goblet*
Lock the monkey-mind,
thoughts sinking deep.
In profound obscurity, the subtle mechanism turns—
southern fire, northern abyss of metal.
Open the mercury crucible, tiger and dragon roar.
Nourish the nine qi, strip away the host of yin.
Pour the wine diligently, the wind-harp’s melody.
Send off the wooden lad with a great draught of drunkenness.
The six viscera flow, the five spirits feast.
Cross into the sage’s realm, shed the mortal garb.
The pure and tranquil body—
even ghosts and gods revere it.

*Second Stanza*
Preserve the celestial true,
nurture the primordial spirit.
Harmonize the two substances, brew the eastern sun’s wine.
Follow heaven’s reckoning, respond to the hour.
Withdraw and replenish with care, rise at *gengshen*.
Refine the mercury medicine, smelt the lead and silver.
Eight jades renewed, the snow-flesh even.
Crimson clouds blanket the earth, fragrant winds stir.
The guest from the west—
his intent pure and refined.
In the dream of *Huaxu*, dreaming through spring,
he returns beyond things, revealing his whole body.

*Third Stanza*

**Knock at the Mystic Pass, tread the clouded peaks.**
Flower-glow and stone-luster, pine-winds soft.
The zither dispels vexation, wine unfolds the face.
The heart’s truth soars free, the mind at ease.
All realms dissolve—I alone endure.
Nine suns return, six yins are pared away.
Gather the eight treasures, golden light brims full.
The body fuses and shines, rosy clouds deepen.
Form and reality merge, the Great Void unbroken.
Welcome the immortal guest, transcend the dusty world.

*Fourth Stanza*
Sever dust-bound passions, wisdom’s wind arises.
Heaven’s gate and earth’s pivot serve as levers.
The mystic mechanism turns, the Dipper’s hub revolves.
Toad marrow, sun-crow essence—
*ren*-palace gathers, jade crucible refines.
Lush blossoms bloom, the ten thousand spirits grow clear.
Three Terraces and Six Auxiliaries celebrate in the celestial palace.
Feast on jade nectar, ferment the true essence.
Return to the sea of awakening, merge into perfect completion.
Behold the sovereign self—majestic in form.

*Fifth Stanza*
Emerald mists clear, ripples pure.
Light drifts o’er the thatched hut, pine windows still.
At dusk, I don my robe, the zither across my lap.
Idle chanting, content in true feeling.
Poverty brings joy—greater than duke or minister.
Favor brings no pride, disgrace no alarm.
The numinous terrace nurtures, the balance shifts.
Zen moon serene, the nature-pearl bright.
Samādhi unravels, the six penetrations refined.
The supreme Dao—attained in perfect completion.

**Drunk in Penglai**
The primal form, one qi, thrones divide heaven and earth,
Uncarved simplicity reveals its auspice.
Through boundless kalpas, none escape—
ensnared by yin and yang’s weave.
Sudden awakening turns back, light harmonizes gold,
Wood clusters *kan* and *li*’s essence.
Miasma winds howl, clouds drift, rain descends—
the elixir’s foundation evenly steeped.
Nine gatherings, three epochs, six lines’ numbers fulfilled,
Odd and even multiply, the Valley Spirit leaves its vessel.
Piercing Kunlun’s summit, I seize the clear wind in play.
Reclining at ease, white clouds amass,
lost in blissful drunkenness.
Seeing through emptiness, movement and stillness graceful,
the spirit-pearl grants every wish.

---

**Drunk on the River Moon**
Primal qi swirls through the celestial pivot,
the Dipper’s handle turns the starry vault.
Sun and moon entwine, advancing and retreating,
fixing dawn, dusk, crescent, and full.
The four seasons cycle, yin and yang harmonize—
creation’s work supreme.
Vast and luminous, it crafts the myriad forms in perfect accord.
Divine function cleaves heaven and earth,
generation responds to the seasons—
the work of seven and nine converges.
Tiger coils, dragon coils, their roars a melody,
the riverbank’s voice wails in wind and wave.
Nurturing the divine embryo, surging in sacred transformation,
the Dharma-realm’s true nature unfurls.
The pearl in darkness gleams,
its radiant image boundless unfolds.

*Second Stanza*
The true heart, a hand’s breadth,
embraces the Great Ultimate, divides auspice,
mystic and yellow intertwine.
Within creation’s midst, the sage’s message—
sun and moon, tiger and dragon arrayed.
Beneath the crucible, crimson light,
diligently the civil and martial alternate,
advancing and retreating by the hour.
Refined into golden pistils,
the elixir’s body, ice-pure, densely clustered.
In the land of harmony, people rest,
the Heavenly Root silently aligns,
profound stillness delights in true suchness.
The pearl’s crystal light shoots through Ox and Dipper,
its bright radiance keen as frost and snow.
Ten thousand kalpas’ clouds gather,
lifetimes’ dust settles—
the heart’s dharma wholly extinguished in duality.
No words suffice—
suddenly, the bottom drops away, clarity dawns.

**Southern Village Song**
Duckweed and driftwood traverse heaven’s edge.
Cast off burdens, hollow out passions—all things void.
Rinsing stones, pillowing streams, sweetly nurturing vastness,
toiling diligently.
Plucking tortoise and snake, place them in the jade crucible.
Black waters yield golden pearls.
On winding shores, red frost moistens, anoints the soft.
The body’s crucible molds inch-long pellets—
the elixir’s wonder, without care.
Galloping through divine powers, the sun-and-moon flask.

*Second Stanza*

Advancing, retreating—hare and crow in harmony,
driven into the crucible of Heaven and Earth’s creation.
