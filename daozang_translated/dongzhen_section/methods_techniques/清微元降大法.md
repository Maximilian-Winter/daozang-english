**Invoking the Marshal, Dao’s Origin**

During the reign of Yu, the Dao Lord had already descended into the world, moving between existence and non-existence, upholding the Way of the Primordial Beginning. In the twenty-fifth year of King Zhao of Zhou, on the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth lunar month at noon, Lao Jun transmitted the *Scripture of the Dao* and *Scripture of Virtue* to Guan Yin, along with the *Nine Elixirs of Great Clarity* and the *Hidden Writings of the Eight Heavens*. The teachings of the *Western Ascension*, admonitions, and other methods were entrusted to the Perfected Du. The Perfected Du was the first to embody the Dao and its virtue.

In the second year of Guanghe during the reign of Emperor Ling of Han, the Perfected of the Great Ultimate bestowed the *Corpus of Numinous Treasure Scriptures* upon the Perfected Left Immortal Xi of the Great Ultimate at Mount Tiantai (some say Mount Shangyu). These are the ancestral texts of the *Cavern Mystery* corpus.

Later, on the first day of the fifth month in the first year of Han’an during the reign of Emperor Shun of Han (some say the fifteenth day of the first month), the Heavenly Master Zhang descended upon Mount Heming, where he received the *Twenty-Four Ranks of Secret Registers*, the seal, and the sword, establishing the lineage of Orthodox Unity and the Alliance of Might.

From the Zhou to the Qin, Han, and Wei dynasties, though the Three Scriptures were transmitted in the world, their regulations and ranks remained obscure. Until the second year of Anxing in the Jin dynasty, on the day of the First Farmer in the jiazi cycle, the Purple Void Primordial Lady, the Lady Wei of the Southern Marchmount, first transmitted the Way of Highest Clarity to the Perfected Yang, Eastern Flower’s Supreme Assistant and Controller of Destinies. At that time, the celestial scriptures and treasured texts—such as the cloud-scripts, dragon-seals, and the eightfold configurations of the *Assembled Writings*—were beyond the comprehension of the mundane world. Our Primordial Lady, the Perfected, distinguished their talismanic scripts and oral instructions, transcribing them into clerical script. From then on, their transmission flourished, becoming the ancestral lineage of Highest Clarity.

**Establishing the Law**
The *Scripture of the Primordial Beginning* pertains to the Great Thunder Rites. The Great Purification Rites are called the *Celestial Treasure Thunder Purification* (also known as the *Celestial Treasure Purification*) or the *Jade Clarity Thunder Cavern Perfection Purification*. They comprise:
1. The Heavenly Scripture
2. The Cavern Chapters
3. The Heavenly Chapters
4. The Jade Chapters
5. The Jade Writings
6. The Numinous Talismans

Highest Clarity corresponds to the *Cavern Mystery*; Great Clarity to the *Cavern Divinity*. The Divine Empyrean aligns with the Northern Culmen; the Great Tenuity with the Purple Tenuity. The Eastern Culmen corresponds to the Southern Culmen; the Northern Culmen to the Western Culmen. The Purple Sovereign aligns with the Purple Clarity.

**Commanding the Generals**
For a Marshal, Vice Marshal, or High General, use one talismanic messenger. For a Marshal with five messengers, use one talismanic messenger. The same applies to purification and thunder rites.

The *Divine Pivot Thunder Scripture* states: The Heavenly Worthy transforms into Marshals; the Heavenly Lords serve as Generals. Yang becomes the Thunder Duke; Yin becomes the Lightning Matriarch. The left is the Earl of Wind; the right is the Master of Rain. The five directions’ stars manifest as the Five Thunders. The great deities of the eight directions become the Eight Pursuing Messengers above and the Eight Titled Divine Lords, talismanic messengers, and merit officials below. In accordance with the imperial-approved scriptures, generals are established following the statutes, their names memorialized to the Emperor, and their summons invariably answered.

**Pivot of Daoist Methods**
Transmitted by Cloud Mountain Preserver of Unity, True Man Li Shaowei

Within the Dao there is Dao; within the Dao there is method; within method there is method.
The Dao within Dao: a single thought unarisen, the myriad things all quiescent.
The method within Dao: in stillness, dragon and tiger intertwine; in motion, thunder and lightning roar.
The method within method: pacing the stars, forming mudras, reciting incantations, inscribing talismans.
All beyond this is mere numerology.

The Great Dao is wordless—it may be grasped through spirit.
The wondrous method is untransmitted—it may be received through the heart.
Those adept in practice: they enact the Dao, not merely its methods.
Those adept in seeking teachers: they follow the heart, not the person.

One may ask: Does method distinguish between prior-heaven and posterior-heaven?
If inquiring of prior-heaven: there is only the One, yet "Dao" is but a forced name—what then is "method"?
Moreover, the moment a thought stirs, it already belongs to posterior-heaven.
Talismans, diagrams, incantations, mudras—these are but the least of it.

Prior-heaven gives birth—birth without form.
Posterior-heaven responds—response with emotion.
Quiescence responding, response returning to quiescence—who but the perfected can attain this?

Method excludes visualization—visualization is not true.
Method excludes fabrication—fabrication is demonic.
Method excludes shouting—shouting is madness.
Method excludes prayers and praises—prayers and praises are shamanism.
Method exquisitely harmonizes with yin and yang—square and round, movement and stillness, these are it.
The Dao penetrates the Three Powers—heaven, earth, and humanity alone.
Water, fire, wood, metal, earth—correspond to the Five Phases.
East, south, west, north, center—governed by the Five Directions.
Heaven, earth, water, fire, wind, thunder, mountain, marsh—paired with the Eight Trigrams.

Those mired in numerology: when I inscribe talismans, I apply a specific function to a specific aperture—thus aligning with transformation, thus reckoning generation and conquest, thus commencing the brushstroke, thus activating the charge.
The mechanism of spirits and gods—I have grasped it.
Yet they do not know: before the Supreme Ultimate divided, what was yin and yang? What were the Three Powers? What were the Five Phases? What were the Five Directions? What were the Eight Trigrams?

Thus, those of the Dao cast aside their hands and practice—no talismans are needed.
As the ancients said:
*"Inscribing talismans without knowing the aperture—ghosts and gods will laugh.
Inscribing talismans while knowing the aperture—ghosts and gods will cry out in alarm."*

Practitioners today, ignorant of the roots of Dao and method, vainly manipulate paper, mistaking it for the talismanic aperture.
Yet this aperture is no ordinary aperture—formed by the union of Qian and Kun, it is called the *Spirit-Qi Cavity*, containing the essence of Kan and Li.
Seek it within the body—do not seek it elsewhere.
One who knows this single aperture may be spoken to of the Dao.
How could it be merely about method?

*The Supreme Mind-Method Essential Preface* states:
*"Gathered as embryonic breath, employed as the aperture—within Daoist methods, this is the true essential wonder."*
This is a leaked secret—ponder it well.

Talismans are the true credentials of heaven and earth; all borrow cinnabar, ink, paper, and brush.
I alone say: a single point of numinous radiance, penetrating heaven and earth, where spirit resides—what is not a talisman?
It may be empty space, water, fire, tiles, stones, grass, trees, food and drink—it may be present or absent, communicative or transformative. This is Daoist method.

*The Plain Questions* says:
*"Serene emptiness, tranquil indifference—true qi follows. Spirit guarded within—whence comes illness?"*
Human ailments—whether cold or heat, severe or mild—all arise from improper regulation, excessive desires, and lack of moderation. Thus, the six qi’s pernicious influences seize the opportunity to invade.

To treat illness with talismans: talismans are but cinnabar and ink—how can they be inherently numinous?
What makes them numinous is my true qi.
Thus it is said: Talismans have no fixed form—their numinosity lies in qi.
One who understands this may infuse any object with qi—even a grain of millet or a blade of grass can aid others.

Talismans are instruments of yin-yang harmony.
Only the utterly sincere in the world can wield them.
If sincerity is lacking, they naturally fail to work.
Thus it is said:
*"With my essence, unite the essence of heaven, earth, and the myriad things;
With my spirit, unite the spirit of heaven, earth, and the myriad things."*
Essence interlocks with essence, spirit leans upon spirit—thus, a scrap of paper may summon spirits and gods, and they cannot but respond.

Methods may emerge from the same lineage—identical talismans, identical mudras—yet their application often fails. Why? Sincerity is lacking.
Where sincerity is lacking, self-trust falters.
Where self-trust falters, doubt arises.
Once doubt arises, the center loses its anchor.
With no anchor at the center, how can resonance occur?
Thus it is said: All methods are mind-methods; when the mind is open, the method is open.
This openness is the unity of the Three Powers and one qi.

Heaven operates through qi, earth brings forth through qi, yin and yang contract and expand through qi, wind and thunder stir through qi, the human body breathes through qi, Daoist methods resonate through qi.
Those adept in practice know: spirit arises from qi, qi governs spirit.
External thoughts do not enter, internal thoughts do not exit—one qi, harmonious and balanced, returns to the root and restores life.
In movement and stillness, sitting and lying down, ceaselessly abide—thus nurturing the vast and boundless.

When applied to methods, one harmonizes one’s true qi with the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth. Thus, exhaling becomes clouds and rain, inhaling becomes thunder and lightning. When employing generals, the primordial spirit naturally awakens; when subduing evil, spirits and demons naturally submit. Permeating Heaven and penetrating Earth, emerging from darkness and entering the unseen—what transformation is not mine to command? Yet if the center lacks an anchor, qi scatters and spirit dims. In practice, one merely clings to talismans and incantations, hoping for a stroke of luck in ten thousand—such efforts, I see, will not succeed.

Someone asked: What is the teaching on transforming spirit?
At the primordial beginning of the kalpa, the one qi divided into the true. I am the primordial beginning; the primordial beginning is I. This is called transforming spirit. Yet some sit with eyes closed, visualizing a general arriving from some direction. Others massage and contract, circulating inner qi to merge with outer qi. Alas, these are delusions. If one truly attains the numinous general—the teaching of the general’s numinosity—then in ordinary times and leisurely days, one nurtures spirit through stillness, and spirit naturally awakens; one harmonizes qi through equilibrium, and qi naturally becomes true in its function. In practice, spirit naturally unites with spirit, qi naturally unites with qi. With a single glance or a single thought, marshals, generals, officers, and soldiers teem as if at one’s side.

The Yellow Emperor said: The cosmos is in the palm of your hand; the myriad transformations arise within your body. Those who know this Way are the great Heaven and Earth, while Heaven and Earth are small to them. Zhuangzi said: The corpse abides, yet the dragon appears; the abyss is silent, yet thunder resounds. Those who know this Way may speak of the subtleties of movement and stillness. Thunder spirits come and go like flashing lightning; the world’s stale vapors cannot long adhere. Summon them swiftly and dismiss them promptly—do not indulge in empty formalities. When they possess a body, they illuminate its radiance; when generals descend, they report their directives. Sealing the arm with a single drop of water or rescuing the lost with a falling banner—if the spirit is not numinous, if the affair does not respond, these are mere techniques. They may be used to establish teachings through the spirit-way, but those who know the Dao do not rely on them.

Someone asked: What is the way to subdue evil?
Simply cultivate oneself to rectitude. Have you not heard that the flower and moon spirits dared not appear before Di Liangong? Even ghosts and spirits fear the upright gentleman—how much more so the man of the Dao!

Someone asked: What is the teaching on refinement and deliverance?
To refine the hun-soul, one must first refine the spirit; to deliver others, one must first deliver oneself. This is the teaching of refinement and deliverance. The one nature is numinous and luminous, enduring as long as Heaven. Yet through greed and attachment, there is death and birth; the four great elements disperse, and no form remains to cling to. Still, one clings to the deluded mind, unaware of liberation. Thus one revolves through the six paths, emerging and submerging in the three realms. The Most High, moved by compassion, bequeathed methods and teachings so that those of the Dao might awaken their delusion with their truth, refine their yin with their yang, and quicken their spirit with their spirit.

With my qi, I return their qi. This lies solely in settling the mind and stabilizing thoughts, focusing the will and maintaining practice—if a single thought strays, perfection is not attained.

As for talismanic decrees and ritual protocols, these are but the outward forms of the teaching; the texts exist here, yet their essence does not reside here.

For grand supplications, deploying the myriad spirits, healing illnesses, eradicating evil, delivering from childbirth perils, rousing dragons, subduing flood-dragons, and vanquishing all demonic specters and malevolent spirits. For solar and lunar eclipses or yin-yang disharmony, all may be remedied. Burn in an open space; inscribing the purpose enhances efficacy.

**Static Glyph**
Pacifies mountains and stabilizes peaks, safeguards the state and secures the household, halts rain and stills winds, calms waves and silences surges, commands thunder and lightning—none in the Three Realms remain unsettled.

Wearing it shields the body with the myriad spirits, redeems the sunken, eternally dispels darkness, and reveals light—all sins dissolve. None fail to receive the essence of the Three Luminaries and stellar constellations, gathering form to preserve life.

**Qi Glyph**
Also named *Primal Origin One Qi Illuminating Three Sceneries True Talisman*. For all matters within the Six Harmonies and Three Realms, regardless of scale, it may be employed. For all thunder methods, mastery of this ensures efficacy; with sincere practice, swift verification follows.
