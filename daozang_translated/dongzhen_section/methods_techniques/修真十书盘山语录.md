*Recorded Sayings of Master Shi at Mount Pan, Volume 53*

Master Shi once expounded at Mount Pan, saying: Generally, those newly embarking on the Dao, if they immediately turn to places where words fail to grasp, will find nothing to hold, no support to rely upon, and doubt will surely arise. For if the mind lacks effort, faith will falter, and without faith, one cannot practice. Without practice, learning becomes chaotic and haphazard, and over time, one grows lax.

Now, let me tell you this: Trust in what your eyes clearly see and your ears distinctly hear, and practice accordingly. From the ordinary, enter the wondrous—this will not lead you astray. Though they are but sounds and forms, they are the functioning of the Dao.

What, then, is trustworthy? Do you not see the vast emptiness, the heavens and earth, the sun and moon, mountains and rivers, wind and clouds? These are all clearly visible before your eyes—they are the models for cultivation, the very gateway to entering the Dao.

Consider how clouds emerge from mountains: they come and go without intent, drifting freely and at ease. Neither circumstances nor things can cling to them—so too should the mind of the Dao practitioner be.

Or observe the wind as it stirs and animates the myriad things: it rushes forth and returns, utterly unobstructed, leaving no trace. Neither grasses nor forests can impede it—it sweeps past in an instant. So too should the mind of the Dao practitioner be.

Or behold Mount Tai: towering and majestic, steadfast and unshaken. No thing can disturb it—so too should the mind of the Dao practitioner be.

Or consider water: its nature is soft and yielding, flowing downward to benefit all beings. It does not contend with things but adapts to every shape, its essence pure and tranquil. When it gathers into rivers and seas, it embraces the hundred streams without distinction, containing all—fish, turtles, shrimp, and crabs—without exclusion. So too should the mind of the Dao practitioner be.

Or look to the sun and moon: they illuminate wherever their light reaches, impartial and without selfishness, radiant in all directions, unobscured day and night, boundless in brilliance. So too should the mind of the Dao practitioner be.

Like the heavens above, their essence is ever clear, and in their clarity, they embrace all. They cover without exception.

Like the earth below, its essence is ever still, benefiting the ten thousand things without harm. So too should the mind of the Dao practitioner be.

Like the vast emptiness, boundless and without limit, containing all—sentient and insentient, covering heaven and bearing earth—it embraces without discrimination. Neither moving nor still, neither existing nor non-existing, neither attached to nor separate from the ten thousand things, it embodies the clarity of heaven, the stillness of earth, the brightness of the sun and moon, and the transformations of the myriad things. The emptiness is one with all—so too should the mind of the Dao practitioner be.

The Dao is one with heaven and earth, and its functioning is thus. Constantly embody it, and when your effort matures, you will naturally comprehend it. In action, you will harmonize with the Dao, and there will be a master within.

If you dismiss words entirely and sever all thought, you will lose the way. Having entered the mysterious gate, each of you must strive diligently.

Someone asked: For beginners in cultivation, how does one enter the gateway of the mind?

The Master replied: Sever in one stroke all private attachments, scheming calculations, forward and backward deliberations, and the mind that entraps or ensnares others. Abandon entirely all clinging to wine, lust, wealth, and temper; to right and wrong, self and others; to craving, love, and desire; to selfishness, perversity, greed, and desire. Free from external burdens, the body becomes light and at ease. Free from internal defilements, the mind becomes light and at ease. With both inner and outer lightness, over time, purity will naturally arise, and false thoughts will vanish. Then, moment by moment, guard and attend to it: be cautious in speech, moderate in diet, and sparing in sleep. Inner and outer assist each other, and when the dust and grime are entirely cleansed, leaving not a single thing behind, in time, your original life-spirit will naturally manifest, and you will enjoy freedom and ease—this is the supreme Dao practitioner.

The Master instructed the assembly: The cultivator who attains the Dao in their hometown should not remain there. One who ascends to immortality after consuming meat and wine should not partake. Even if your family are immortals, do not cling to them. What others love, do not love; what others reject, do not reject. Do not mistake the impure for yourself. Even if you attain the Dao in sleep, do not indulge in sleep. Do not associate with unworthy companions, nor speak useless words. When things go well, do not rejoice; when they go ill, do not grieve. Learn from those better than yourself; teach those who are not. When others wrong you, it is fortune; when you wrong others, it is misfortune. Words beyond deeds are empty; deeds beyond words are real. Those with desires are bound to worldly affairs; those with a mind free of dust walk the immortal Dao. Those who humble themselves will rise; those who embrace poverty will grow rich. Return to the constant and harmonize with the Dao; follow principle and align with others. The true Dao should be practiced; deviant paths should not be entered. Penetrate the Dao and illuminate virtue; embody and perfect its use—this is called the Perfected.

The Master said: The cultivator must strictly avoid speaking of others’ strengths and weaknesses, or inquiring about their rise and fall. For all worldly matters unrelated to oneself, the mouth must not discuss them, nor the mind ponder them. Merely speaking of right and wrong is to obscure one’s own nature. If you focus solely on refining the mind and constantly examining your own faults, how will you have time to meddle in others’ affairs? In dealing with others, emulate their virtues and avoid their vices. Do not concern yourself with them, and gradually, you will reach a state of rest.

The Master said: Heaven and earth are the parents of the ten thousand things. The heavens cover all without exception; the earth bears all without distinction. How could they discriminate between good and bad? They cover and bear all equally, illuminating all alike.

Thus, those who stand above others do so by the mandate of Heaven, and ought to emulate Heaven’s all-covering embrace, nurturing, preserving, and cherishing all those beneath them, making no distinction of self and other, high and low. Those who stand beneath others likewise do so by Heaven’s decree, and ought to emulate Earth’s steadfast bearing, revering, honoring, and obeying those above them, never daring the slightest negligence. Since we dwell between Heaven and Earth, we must align with the Dao of Heaven and Earth. Otherwise, we act beyond our proper bounds, inviting punishment, misfortune, and calamity.

The Master said: Causes arise from fate, not from human contrivance. One must follow the natural course, accept one’s time, and await one’s destiny. Inner cultivation and outward conduct depend entirely on the mind. Only by applying effort oneself can one achieve merit. Whether one practices or not, each reaps what they sow. When the teaching’s gate remains closed, one must remain concealed, with the mind in communion with Heaven. Once the teaching’s gate opens, outward conduct must also accord with Heaven and serve others. There is no limit to the merit one may accumulate, nor to the breadth of one’s conduct. But all depends on the steadfastness of the mind—only then can one attain fulfillment.

Someone asked: If I devote three years of diligent practice, can I escape the cycle of rebirth?
The Master replied: Those who cultivate the Way must establish firm resolve, advancing with unceasing diligence to refine the mind. How can one presume to harbor expectations of future liberation? There was once a Daoist who, upon first leaving the household life, boasted: “The cycle of rebirth is trivial—I need only apply some effort to escape it.” Though he began with resolve, an incurable illness soon befell him, persisting for years and gradually eroding his determination. How could such an outcome arise from overweening ambition?

The Master said: Those who inquire into the Dao should never tire of questioning, just as a traveler on the road asks directions to avoid going astray. Without a teacher, even minor skills cannot be mastered—how much more so this great Dao, which cannot be seen or heard? Without encountering one at the outset, how can one awaken to it? Of all sufferings, none surpasses birth and death. Without drawing near to a perfected being, how can one be freed from them? Thus it is said: The ancients did not learn the Dao lightly; they served true masters until old age. Without knowing where to begin or drawing near to those who have attained realization, even with resolve and discipline, one will err in countless ways.

The Master said: Those who cultivate the Way must apply effort and exert strength to temper the deeply ingrained, biased thoughts and attachments that have long accumulated in the mind. One must relinquish them with difficulty, even to the point of being willing to abandon this very body—how much more so the attachments of the mind. All that is false and illusory must be eradicated entirely, and then no afflictions will remain. As for all external matters and things beyond the body, they are not worth dwelling upon. The comings and goings before one’s eyes are like mosquitoes and gnats—brushed away, they bring relief. But the attachments that are difficult to relinquish from the mind—there lies the seed of rebirth.

When Master Changchun resided at Fanxi, tigers and leopards often passed by at night, coming and going at dawn and dusk. At first, he felt fear and wished to erect fences. But then he reflected: In such circumstances, if I feel fear and seek to shield myself, can I ever truly escape birth and death? He resolved to let go. Abiding in equanimity, he allowed life and death to take their course. His fear naturally vanished, and even amid the trials of life and death, he remained unmoved. All entanglements dissolved at once—this is the practice of what is most difficult to practice.

The Master said: Those who cultivate the Way should emulate only the good in others, never their faults, lest they lose themselves. Nor should they engage in mutual criticism, for harboring judgments distorts the mind and hinders progress. Rightness can overcome wrongness, but wrongness will always slander rightness. Those who constantly criticize others out of self-attachment fail to see their own faults and belong to heterodox teachings. With true insight, one must examine one’s own mind for bias and error, seeking out one’s own faults. Those who concern themselves with the faults of others are not true practitioners.

In a monastic community, people gather from all directions—how can they all be the same, each following an identical path? It is like Mount Tai, which encompasses all things: some are useless, some become useful, some stand alone, some cling to others, some are rare and auspicious plants, some are wild brambles and thorns. Though diverse, each follows its nature and unfolds in due order. The mountain stands majestically, making no distinctions, embracing all—flowing waters and strange rocks, lush forests and abundant grasses, beasts that run and birds that sing—all manifest the wondrous workings of the immortals. They mutually sustain one another, like hemp and reeds that stand straight without support. Heaven and Earth endure, and each attains fulfillment in its own way. If one seeks to cut down the tall to fill the short, or change blue to yellow, not only will none find peace, but their original nature will be lost.

When the assembly discussed appointing a monastic leader, the Master said: Those who cultivate the Way and take up the role of monastic leadership must measure their strength, act with simplicity and ease, and live lightly. They must not, like worldly people, contend for fame and profit, lest they lose their original aspiration and forget the great matter of life and destiny. They should appear yielding outwardly while remaining steadfast within. When facing difficulties, they should endure with patience, transforming reluctance into willingness. When circumstances are fitting, they should find peace of mind. Abiding in stability, they should welcome those from all directions, benefiting themselves and others, cultivating both inner tranquility and virtuous action—thus fulfilling both aspects of practice. If they do not refine the mind but mistake external things for themselves, they will become greedy and narrow-minded, accumulating faults and worldly entanglements, thereby ruining their future.

Upon arriving at Changzhen Abbey, the Master addressed the assembly one night: Beginners who leave the household life cannot yet stand alone. Though they rely on the monastic community or form bonds with fellow practitioners for mutual support to avoid bias, there are three kinds of companions: cloud friends, good friends, and reckless or eccentric friends.

Those with noble aspirations, who refine their minds, investigate the consequences of sin and blessing, sever worldly attachments, and wander beyond the mundane—seeking like-minded companions and forming steadfast bonds—are called *cloud friends and rosy-cloud friends*. Their minds resemble clouds and rosy dawns, untouched by worldly affairs.

Others study scriptures and teachings, play the zither, read books, chant poetry, engage in lofty discussions, and debate right and wrong. These are called *good friends and wise friends*, for though they do not refine their minds, they do not commit evil either.

Then there are those who neither cultivate their minds nor study scriptures, heedless of sin and blessing. Their words are perverse, their actions reckless. At the slightest provocation, they quarrel, boast wildly, flaunt their strength, bully the good, and band together in cliques. These are called *reckless friends and eccentric friends*.

After these three kinds of people depart this life, each is assigned a place according to their deeds, receiving their due recompense. The *cloud friends and rosy-cloud friends* ascend into the formless, roaming the Jade Capital, becoming immortals or celestial officials. The *good friends and wise friends*, their worldly minds not yet extinguished, remain within the cycle of human existence, subject to repeated retribution. The *reckless friends and eccentric friends*, having consumed the offerings of the ten directions without accumulating merit to repay their debt, may fall into the Dark Realm or be reborn among beasts, enduring the suffering of transmigration. When such a fate befalls them, how can regret avail? The wise and discerning should ponder this carefully and seek the most advantageous path.

The Master, urging the assembly to dwell in monastic communities, said: The Perfected One of Danyang has a verse: *"Those who study the Dao and dwell in monastic communities must measure their depth and explore its shallows, choosing the virtuous as their intimate companions. If they cannot yet grasp the ultimate principle, they should cling to its essence and uphold its core."* In monastic communities, practitioners guide one another, lifting the banner and grasping the essentials to cultivate together the supreme mind-ground and the great Dharma gate—no small matter.

Yet some, lacking insight and direction, neither seek wise companions nor dwell in monastic communities. They idly claim to wander, heedless of the mind-ground, traversing mountains and rivers, going south and north, wasting straw sandals. They only seek ease and convenience, fleeing at the slightest obstacle. Such renunciates know not what is most urgent for themselves, nor how to spend their days—merely chasing comfort. Little do they realize that ahead lies the inescapable reckoning of life and death. How will they withstand it? Can they afford to drift through days, squandering time? What did they renounce the household life for?

The Master said: Practitioners vary in their natures—some sharp, some dull. Those of dull nature should not be rigid but should dwell in monastic communities, humbly preserving their minds. By associating with those of clear understanding and bright minds, they will naturally be guided onto the path, gradually awakening. If one’s nature is dull and lacking in insight, yet one daily keeps company with the like-minded, entangling with worldly affairs, the worldly bonds grow strong. Over time, one inevitably strays from the path, or encounters demonic realms, falling into hell with no one to save them—a profound sorrow.

The Master said: Even those who have long dwelt in monastic communities, receiving daily instruction, may grow negligent and complacent, their resolve for the Dao waning as worldly affairs increase. They become unruly and reckless, unable to attain stillness. How much worse for those who wander alone in the world, their worldly passions lingering, entangled in desires, their path obstructed at every turn, unaware of their own plight. Even if they encounter sages, they cannot be transformed. With a hundred evasions and deceptions, they delude themselves and others, gradually sinking deeper. Their blessings diminish as their karma grows. If they would but turn back, they might yet be saved. But if they cling to the dust and turn from the Dao, there is no recourse—hell awaits without delay.

The Master, discussing those who dwell in mountains, said: A practitioner in the mountains must see through things as they arise and respond to circumstances as they come. Each response is like a single act—once passed, it is done. Once, a Daoist lived in the mountains, wearing clothes of grass and eating wild plants, vowing never to descend, believing he had shed all worldly burdens. One day, two men bearing weapons came seeking food. The master cooked mountain fruits to offer them. When the fruit softened, one man reached into the pot, tasted it, and angrily said, *"Who would eat such fare?"* He was about to overturn the pot. The master said nothing. Seeing the men’s anger and hearing their harsh words, he secretly devised a plan. On some pretext, he went outside, found his hidden staff, grasped it, and shouted, *"Come out, you two! You won’t dare come near me!"* The men stepped outside and laughed: *"Living in the mountains has made you so aggressive. You’d be better off descending to become a layman."* They left, and suddenly vanished from sight. The master then suspected they were sages testing him and could only regret his failure.

The Master, discussing the unmoving mind, said: Once, in Shandong, a practitioner boasted to his master that he had extinguished the fire of ignorance. The master said, *"If the fire of ignorance is extinguished, the mind does not move—then you are a good person."* Later, the master secretly sent someone to test him. At dusk, the visitor arrived to find the hermitage gate closed. He loudly struck the door with his staff, and the master, hearing the harsh tone, reluctantly opened it. The visitor’s manner was violent, and upon entering the hall, he did not remove his shoes but leapt onto the seat, utterly lacking in courtesy. The master grew furious and severely rebuked him. The visitor clasped his hands and smiled: *"I dared not act so—your master sent me to test your truly unmoving mind. Before the test was even complete, it was already revealed. No need for further trial."* The master was greatly ashamed and had no reply.

Generally, those who cultivate the Way may have some skill, but how dare they take pride in it? In an unguarded moment, their true state is revealed. Only when one’s heart is like cold ashes and their form withered do they lack the thought of self-praise—yet once self-praise arises, their true state is already exposed. Even if one attains unshakable stillness, there is still something beyond.

Someone asked, *"What of the practice of those who dwell in seclusion?"*
The master said: *"Once, when Master Changchun was in the capital, he passed by a Daoist abbey. Behind it lived a recluse in a walled garden. The community was holding a ritual feast when someone reported to the Perfected One: ‘The master in the garden wishes to speak with you.’ The Perfected One decreed that they should meet after the feast. Unexpectedly, the Perfected One later went out and sought the recluse in his garden. He struck the gate loudly several times with his staff. The recluse, assuming it was an ordinary visitor, responded in anger. The Perfected One then turned away. After the feast, the community again requested a meeting, but the Perfected One said: ‘I have already tested him. His mind is still present—he is not yet ready for discourse.’ And so he departed.*

*Generally, dwelling in stillness is for the sake of the work of nature and life—consolidating, securing, and nurturing one’s inner power is the true task. Meeting circumstances without disturbance is the test. Here, the sound of the gate being struck is the circumstance; the response is the mind. If the mind forgets the self, it is like cold ashes—even if there is light, there is no great flame. To meet circumstances without disturbance, responding with tranquility, is to have skill in the mind. Now, if a mere empty sound stirs the heart, how can one pass through all adverse circumstances? Though dwelling in seclusion, what use is it? Accepting others’ offerings, how can one repay such debt? It would be better to refine this stubborn heart among the community. One day, when the gold is fully smelted, one becomes a person of true insight."*

The master said: *"Once, beneath the hall of the Perfected One of Longevity, there was a kitchen attendant. The community praised him for his gentleness and humility, saying they had never seen him lose his composure. The Perfected One, knowing this, had him tested. Secretly, someone moved the kitchen utensils to another place early in the morning. When the attendant went to prepare congee, he washed the rice and filled the pot, then urgently searched for the ladle and scoop but could not find them. The pot boiled over, and he grew greatly agitated. The Perfected One saw this and taught: ‘Even if it all spills out, these are merely external things—why disturb the heart?’ The attendant then awoke, bowed in gratitude, and that was all.*

*The master, while overseeing work, addressed all present: ‘Once, beneath the hall of Master Shu, there was a man named Zhang the Immortal, skilled in carpentry. He never opposed others, was humble and yielding, and no one had ever seen anger on his face. The community praised and admired him, so they asked the Perfected One about him. The Perfected One said: “Not yet—he must be tested. It is like unrefined gold: without testing, one cannot know its authenticity.” One day, he was ordered to make a meditation bench. He assented and began the work. Before it was finished, he was told to make doors and windows as well. He reluctantly complied, but already showed signs of impatience. Before half the work was done, he was ordered to make several boxes. He refused, arguing before the Perfected One that he should finish one task before starting another. The Perfected One then said: “Previously, the community praised you for never opposing others and never losing your composure—today, the test has revealed the truth.”*

*For those who cultivate the Way, when refining the mind and responding to affairs, the inner self must first be settled, at ease and harmonious. Externally, one responds to matters with perfect accuracy. What comes first, what comes later? Respond to what is urgent, even if it means grinding one’s bones to dust—only the mind must not move. Whether it is this task or that, these are but temporary things, without fixed substance. The mind must die; the mechanism must be alive. Simply respond to what is urgent in the moment, steadily and calmly, without disturbance or dullness—this is what is meant by “constantly responding, constantly still.”*

*The master, seeing some lose composure during work, said: “For those who cultivate the Way, though external conditions are illusory, one cannot fail to respond. Responding without self, the mind’s essence is empty space. When affairs arise, there is no obstruction—just as empty space is unobstructed by the ten thousand things, and the ten thousand things do not obstruct empty space. Like the myriad forms and beings between heaven and earth, all move and act without hindrance. If the mind clings to the self, when affairs arise, there must be opposition. Then there is friction, and one cannot pass through swiftly. Stumbling and colliding, the self’s mind is disturbed. Once the mind is disturbed, there is no peace. Though one toils all day, it is labor without achievement.*

*Living among the community and engaging in work, one must guard the self’s mind and not be easily moved. Constantly examine one’s own faults, never mind others’ wrongs—this is the work of cultivation. When the moment comes, one must take responsibility. The ten thousand circumstances and dusts of the world do not chase after them—the self is clear and bright, untroubled by any demon. Passing through life thus, with an unretreatant initial resolve, one naturally attains great merit.”*

The master, hearing someone discuss dwelling in a walled garden—building a hut within, enclosing it with a wall, and opening a small window for food to be delivered—said: *"This is to sever ties with friends and devote oneself entirely to secluded cultivation. One day, the community asked him to come out and move about freely. An old friend saw him and asked: ‘Brother, what have you gained from your time in stillness? Can you maintain it amidst the bustle? Have you truly reached the point of unshakable stillness?’ The man was haughty and remained silent for a long time. His friend then said: ‘I have a touchstone to distinguish truth from falsehood. Let me test the heart you’ve cultivated in these years of seclusion—what do you say?’ The man replied: ‘What is there to say of stillness?’ The friend said: ‘If that is so, you will go forth with fur and horns, repaying the debt of others’ offerings.’ The man grew furious and began to curse. The friend laughed and said: ‘This is what you’ve gained in the garden—indeed, the test has revealed it.’ The man was so enraged that he severed ties with his friend for life."*

This man had never tempered his mind amidst circumstances—merely sitting in stillness for a hundred years would yield nothing. It was like whipping a horse to make it stand still: once the rope was loosened, it would bolt as before.

The Master said: Once, during a rainstorm at the Hall of Restraint, the manager called for general labor, summoning all without regard for age or youth. The crowd rushed to respond, save for one old immortal who remained seated, unmoving. When the task was done and all gathered in assembly to mock the old immortal, someone reported this to the Perfected Lord of Long Spring. The Lord rebuked them, saying: "How much can one destroy falsehood to reveal truth? One who has truly tempered the mind to its resting place is like a priceless pearl. Let each act according to the state of their own heart."

In the teachings, what is rare is to find one who has truly attained.

Someone asked: "When I walk or sit alone in the mountains, I personally witness mountain spirits foretelling future events—is this real?"

The Master said: The common mind clings to the ten thousand dusts, dull and unclear. When beginners leave the household life, they grind away the dust of the heart. If by chance they attain stillness and suddenly encounter a tranquil state, they generate strange visions—demonic faces and spectral forms. Taking these as the true ground of the heart, they rejoice without cease. Some see themselves foretelling future events; others hear voices in the void predicting things that later come to pass; still others encounter departed masters, true spirits, or immortals who appear before them to instruct their hearts. If one clings to these experiences, it is already falling into delusion. If not abandoned, they nurture a sickness of the heart for which there is no cure.

Have you not heard the ancients say: "Perception, awareness, and knowledge are themselves afflictions"? Moreover, all that is seen with the eyes, heard with the ears, or conceived in the mind belongs to the realm of sound and form. Have you not read in the ancient scriptures: "It cannot be seen when looked for, cannot be heard when listened for, cannot be expressed in words, cannot be reached by thought"? To take what appears in sound and form as real is to fall into the demonic path.

Once, a Daoist in meditation suddenly tasted wine in his mouth and dreamed of someone delivering wine. The next day, wine was indeed brought to him. This was merely the heart’s emptiness evoking a spiritual response—nothing extraordinary. To take it as real is to fall into delusion.

Another Daoist, while sitting, suddenly found his spirit departing his body. It wandered several hundred paces away before returning, only to see his original form still seated upright. This happened several times, yet it was nothing extraordinary—no different from ordinary thoughts wandering outward, merely clearer in detail. To regard it as an achievement is to fall into delusion.

As the saying goes: "Of all auspicious signs, none compares to ordinary peace and stability." This accords with the Dao.

The Master said: In stillness, the visions encountered by practitioners are manifold, all conjured by their own consciousness, arising in quietude to seduce the sovereign mind. Have you not heard the ancients say: "All appearances are illusory"? When the heart seeks to dispel consciousness, consciousness remains and transforms into forms—demonic faces, spectral shapes—disturbing the lord of the mind. If the lord remains unmoved, seeing as if not seeing, embodying emptiness, with nothing to grasp, the visions naturally dissipate. Without a realm to invade, nothing can be corrupted.

Once, a Daoist who had attained rest for his heart was sitting one day when suddenly countless evil spirits descended from the sky. The man steadied his heart, making his body like the vastness of space. In profound unknowing, he resolved to let his body live or die as fate willed. The demons scattered of their own accord. With the sovereign present and utterly still, what demon could remain? The deluded mind had not yet been exhausted, so these appearances manifested. When the nature of reality is perfectly clear, they vanish of themselves.

The Master said: Once, a gardener heard people speak of the "ground of being." Entering the garden, he wished to see this ground, and as his mind dwelled on the thought, it manifested in response—though he did not know it was false. What is heard with the ears belongs to sound; what is seen with the eyes belongs to form; what is imagined in the heart belongs to delusion. Thus he saw golden youths and jade maidens, true immortals and sages appearing in broad daylight—yet all were illusory realms, fabrications of deluded thought. Taking them as the "ground of being," he could not dispel them, muddling through his life, ensnared by delusion and possession.

He did not understand that the "ground of being" is what the ancients called the place where the heart’s activity reaches perfect stability and rest. It is like preparing a dwelling place: clearing away brambles, sweeping aside rubble, leveling the ground so it is fit to inhabit—this is called the "ground of being." For the practitioner, when the heart-ground is stable and untroubled by circumstances, it is an unshakable ground; when the ten thousand dusts cannot stain it, it is a pure ground; when one’s original dharmakāya is revealed, radiant and self-sustaining, it is a luminous ground. All talk of the "ground of being" has its limits. When one reaches the place without location, without direction, beyond names and words—this is what is called "mysterious beyond the mysterious." How could what is seen with the eyes, heard with the ears, or conceived in the mind ever suffice?

Someone asked: "This student has always held that the matter of life and death is of utmost importance, yet my seeking has brought no clarity. What is the meaning of this?"

The Master said: When a single thought does not arise, there is no death. Those who cannot do this are burdened by emotions in the heart and dust on the nature, endlessly manipulating life and death. Seeking liberation, they chase after each transgression, pursuing it again and again until not a trace remains. The source is fundamentally pure—neither following sound nor chasing form, at ease everywhere, empty and carefree, enduring as heaven and earth, the true sovereign becomes self-evident.

When the heart is upright, all things are upright; when the heart is crooked, all things are crooked. With a sovereign within, what others love, one does not love; what others despise, one does not despise. All old habits are turned around. When the six senses are empty, the true sovereign abides in stillness—what fear of life and death remains?

If one reaches such a state, yet finds oneself unable to gather or restrain, unable to contain or conceal—like one possessed by some malevolent spirit—racing outward in wild abandon, drifting recklessly, this is the scattering of spirit and qi, losing mastery over oneself. Taking this for true joy or true delight, one fails to recognize that joy without joy is the true joy, and delight without delight is the true delight.

The ancients would sing and dance as they walked, yet even in that moment, they were dissolving stagnation and parting from attachments, finding their own delight therein. How could they ever indulge the heart in reckless abandon, deceiving and bewildering the world?

The master, during a discussion on the opening of wisdom’s treasury, spoke of the surging forth of its source: "For one on the path of cultivation, the initial departure from sensory realms is like a mirror suddenly polished bright. When wisdom’s treasury opens, thoughts form into verses without effort—yet one must not cling to them. If the heart’s seal is fixed, functioning without response, it becomes wild wisdom, devoid of merit, merely the operation of spirit, not the essence of the Dao."

"Do not gallop about, mistaking it for skill. Only through nurturing and refinement does merit arise."

Someone asked, "I will not ask about the past or future—what is the present mind?"

The master looked straight ahead and said, "This is not the present."

Then, lowering his head, he said, "This is not the present."

Again, he asked, "Do you understand?"

The person smiled and said, "I do not."

The master replied, "Even with eyes wide open, you fail to recognize the present—how then can you speak of past or future?"

Another asked, "The past is not pursued, the future not anticipated—what of the present?"

The master said, "Extinguish movement but not illumination. Further, you must grasp *who* it is that extinguishes movement. Once attained, the power rests in your hands—whether to extinguish or not is yours to decide."

Another asked, "What is the stabilization of nature?"

The master shifted his seat forward, sat upright in silence for a long while, then said, "What stabilization of nature do you ask about?"

The person did not comprehend. A nearby elder rose and bowed in gratitude.

The master said, "Zhang drinks the wine, but Li becomes drunk."

The person still did not awaken.

The master said, "Scholars do not sleep, for their work is the refinement of the heart. If the heart is not gathered, what use is there? Those who gamble, play chess, spin thread, or grind grain—staying awake all night—are they those who attain the Dao? Such people, driven by profit in every moment, are lured by greed, their minds disturbed like mosquitoes biting the skin. Thus, they cannot sleep. The cultivator is not like this. Sleep is but one desire; if not transformed, it breeds delusion, obscuring clarity, belonging to the yin realm. Like one guarding against thieves, sitting vigilant—thieves will retreat of their own accord. Focus on refining the heart, lest it drift into dissipation. This heart, fundamentally without fixed form, is bright in yang and dark in yin. When familiar realms dissolve, there is non-doing and purity; the pearl of nature shines clearly—this is why one remains awake day and night."

The master said, "Cultivators struggle with this stubborn heart. From beginningless time, the bones of cyclic existence have piled like mountains. Through ten thousand births and deaths, only now does one awaken to past errors, seeking liberation. Thus, by day one dares not eat, by night one dares not sleep—refining this stubborn heart until every worldly inversion is overturned, only then can it be of use. Without refining the heart, even if one sees others not sleeping and imitates them, thoughts arise like hairs, igniting like sparks at the slightest touch. What use is a hundred years without sleep? If the stubborn heart remains, one is still bound to the cycle. To transform this heart, whether in movement or stillness, moment by moment, shatter this stubborn heart to pieces—only then can it be of service. The original true spirit is akin to heaven and earth. Then, in motion it is the Dao, in stillness it is the Dao; speaking it is the Dao, silence is the Dao. What else is there to seek? This is the carefree Daoist."

Someone asked, "Those who cultivate from the beginning must first establish resolve—what is resolve?"

The master said, "In every moment—whether in movement or stillness, in all circumstances, in walking, standing, sitting, or lying down—let every thought be of the Dao. Unshaken by demons, unmoved by harm, whether in ease or adversity, iron-faced or otherwise, one stakes this body without hesitation, advancing single-mindedly without fear of life or death. This is a person of resolve."

Thus, the sutra says: "Those who practice with vigor have resolve."

The master said, "Cultivators must establish resolve and integrity. Yet when resolve and integrity are set, one may become rigid. Rigidity makes one inflexible in matters. When one becomes adaptable in matters, one may grow complacent, letting days pass idly. Thus, scholars are as numerous as ox hairs, but those who attain are as rare as qilin horns. Generally, those who study the Dao must first return to the ancestral source, decisively establish resolve and integrity, recognize adaptability, practice single-mindedly and diligently—persisting without cease, there is nothing that cannot be achieved."

The master said, "The Daoist refines the heart like forging gold into a chicken. Though its form resembles a chicken, its heart remains unmoved, standing apart from the flock. Though chickens may be combative, none dare approach. One who embodies the Dao has a heart like cold ashes, a body like a withered tree. Though the hearts of the world may be contentious, none dare contend with them."

Thus, the sutra says: "Only because they do not contend does the world have none who can contend with them."

Someone asked, "The supreme matter is complete in everyone—why refine it further?"

The master said, "The unrefined heart is like ore containing silver—before smelting, it is but a stubborn stone. Placed in the great blazing furnace, impurities are burned away, the true substance separated. Once refined into gold, it no longer returns to the furnace."

The practitioner of cultivation is likewise thus. The heart shrouded in ignorance and clinging is like unrefined ore—take resolve as the great blazing furnace, wisdom as the black charcoal, and refine it with ardent devotion until not a trace remains. What emerges is one’s own originally unimpeded, primal heart. Once made true, it is no longer false. Guard it well, preserve it steadfastly, and when you comprehend its use, this is the priceless, ever-bright pearl of ancient perfection.

The master said: Those who have long studied the Dao must discipline themselves for the benefit of others, silently accumulating merit and conduct. If the heart remains deluded and one acts without principle, not only does this disgrace the teachings, but one also invites calamity upon oneself. Whether in body or speech, if one is neither pure nor frugal, one differs not from the common folk. To enjoy the sweat and blood of the ten directions is no easy gain—what is taken in joy must be repaid in suffering. When the hour of birth and death arrives, there will be no tricks left to evade it. Since you dwell within this gate, how can you not refine the heart?

Someone asked: Everyone seeks joy—why do Daoists embrace suffering?

The master said: Worldly people know not true joy. They take what pleases the heart as joy, yet desire leads them into suffering, and they mistake suffering for joy. Daily, they scheme and calculate, seeking worldly pleasures. When they fail, sorrow and distress entangle their spirits, leaving them forever restless—this is the greatest suffering. The practitioner of the Dao seeks not worldly joy but holds the great Dao in the heart. Encountering suffering, they do not suffer; without suffering, they abide in constant joy, their hearts at ease. Where there is joy, there is suffering; where there is no joy, there is no suffering. A heart free of joy and suffering—this is true joy.

Someone asked: Why do practitioners of the Dao willingly endure poverty and hardship?

The master said: If one merely accepts poverty, hunger, and cold as right, then the beggars in the streets and the destitute would all be immortals. The practitioner of cultivation takes virtue and power as the heart, purity and stillness as the mind, cutting away deceit and falsehood, greed and reckless action—all dispelled in an instant. Forgetting form and self, they give no thought to external things. Thus it is said:
*A robe to cover skin and flesh—what need for fine or coarse?*
*Food to fill the belly—what need for refined or plain?*
Their sole concern is the inquiry into birth and death and the refinement of the heart, so they do not cling to the suffering of the body.

The master said: The practitioner of cultivation gains a measure of skill and develops a sense of superiority; with full mastery, this sense grows tenfold. Yet with superiority comes the mark of self, and the self’s arrogance becomes a great obstacle. How can one reach the realm of an empty heart? If extinguished, it must be rekindled with even greater intensity. Place your body and mind beneath all things, always yielding to others, and reflect that you are inferior in ten thousand ways—only then can the heart of pride and superiority be cast aside. When the heart is like the vast emptiness, there is no self; without self, one accords with the Dao.

The master said: The practitioner of cultivation gathers in the heart as if it were a carved wooden statue seated in the hall—whether no one is present all day, or whether it is draped and adorned, or offered incense and flowers, or slandered by passersby, it remains thus. Only this wooden statue, spiritually awakened and sagely, vividly illuminates virtue and power, yet does not cling to any affair or thing.

Someone asked: My thoughts follow one after another, impossible to sweep away—how can this be right?

The master said: Sweeping the heart-ground daily only stirs more unrest. If you wish the heart-ground to be still, strike down the handle of the broom.

The questioner bowed in gratitude.

The master said: When practitioners first leave the household life, it is for the sake of this great matter of life and destiny. Yet with the passing years, they unknowingly become moved by things and instead learn verbal tricks and a hundred kinds of skills, serving as slaves and maids. How can one know this? Whenever there is a skill, one must display it before others—is this not being enslaved by others? How can it be the work of a master of purity and non-action? Thus it is said: The wise use things, while the foolish are used by them. The skillful are not employed by the skillful, but the clumsy are; the eloquent speak, while the silent listen carefully and ponder. Who is busy? Who is at leisure? Those who wish to cultivate must keep the heart-ground clear yet appear foolish—then all the clever in the world will serve them.

Someone asked: Practitioners speak of knowing and awakening, yet also call it a sickness—what is the meaning?

The master said: True knowing is knowing without knowing; true awakening is awakening without awakening. The original true spirit, once obscured, only now awakens—this is called awakening. All knowledge and perception arise from this. To speak of having knowing and awakening, and to desire constant knowing and constant awakening, is to bind and burn oneself without cause. Yet if one remains entirely without knowing or awakening, one slips into another shell. Once awakened to the fundamental truth, knowing and awakening become tools—use them when needed, but do not make them constant.

Someone asked: What is the awakened nature of the practitioner?

The master said: Pointing east and drawing west—stop such empty gestures and apply real effort instead. Consider the passions, desires, afflictions, self, and ignorance that dwell in the heart and before the eyes. It is like a vast, slippery well of crystal before you—if you do not watch your step even for a moment, you will fall in and never escape for ten thousand kalpas. If you see it clearly and recognize the danger, then as you prepare to step forward, swiftly retreat and watch carefully—this is your awakened nature. If you have clearly fallen into the snares of self and others yet still point to emptiness and speak of the ultimate, what use is such awakened nature?

Someone asked: Among those who have left the household life, some study the public cases of the ancients, some study the scriptures, and some say that reflecting on the mind in the ancient teachings—are these correct?

The master said: Those who cultivate the Way originally refine themselves to ascend from the mundane to the sacred, yet since leaving the household life, they refuse to take this as their task. Instead, they search only among the words of the ancients, making a living within the characters on paper—counting lines and tallying ink, entangling themselves in vines and creepers. They exhaust all effort, but what good does it do? When Old Yanluo summons them, not a single phrase will serve, not a single word will avail. If even a single word is of no use, then one who knows nothing of worldly affairs yet passes through life in drunken oblivion is somewhat closer to the mark. Take the effort spent in such chasing and turn it toward your own fundamental task—then you will not have wasted your time.

What is this fundamental task? It is simply this: the one who governs the body, that single spark of numinous clarity received from the Dao. From ancient times to the present, its purity has ever been thus—what more could you desire? When you have personally verified and understood this principle, it becomes the proof of transcending the mundane and entering the sacred. If you can truly believe this, then begin your practice at once. This is your own case—why count the treasures of others? Quickly turn inward and apply it to yourself, and from this day forward, you will not be deceived by others.

The master said: Those who cultivate the Way, if their true eye is not opened and their inherent mechanism does not activate, but they only seek on the traces of others and speculate on their words, will never find the right path. It is like a blind man hearing others describe the light of the sun and moon—he will never see it for himself, only imagining it. This is because he has never applied effort to his own mind.

Someone asked: Formerly, I heard that Master Danyang attained the Way swiftly through awakening to death—what is the meaning of this?

The master said: Those who cultivate the Way should regard this body as a condemned prisoner being dragged to the marketplace, each step bringing them closer to death. With death as their constant thought, they relinquish all things. Though sounds, sights, and the splendor of the world surround them, their eyes see nothing, their ears hear nothing, and every thought is forgotten. Even this body is abandoned—how much more all else? Refining the mind in this way brings swift attainment. In death, one finds life, neither born nor dying. For beginners in the Way, rescuing themselves from birth and death should be their sole concern. A single breath not taken, and one is already in the realm of death—each must save the other, and none can afford to procrastinate.

When the master was gravely ill and could not recover, he addressed all present: Those who cultivate the Way must first see through the emptiness of all external conditions, then recognize this body as but a heap of dust. In daily affairs, be free and at ease; at the time of departure, you will surely attain liberation. Formerly, at Dongshan, an abbot lay dying, lingering in prolonged suffering, unable to free himself. He sent someone to ask True Man Changchun: "In the past, I was attached to external conditions and never cultivated my mind amid the objects of the world—this is why I now suffer and cannot attain liberation." Changchun sent back these words: "The body is not yours; the nature is fundamentally empty. When not a single thought arises, the whole body is released." Upon hearing this, the abbot seemed to awaken. He instructed his fellow disciples: "I was deluded by external conditions, and thus my mind remained unrefined. My cultivation was indecisive. Now I urge you all to apply yourselves diligently to refining body and mind, and to investigate this great matter of birth and death." With these words, he passed away.

There was also a Daoist who, at the point of death, could not depart. He asked those around him: "How can I go?" Someone said: "Imagine you are a true person." He imagined for several days but still could not go. Another said: "Imagine emptiness." Again, he could not go. An old immortal heard of this and came to see him. The man recounted the previous suggestions, saying he still could not depart. The old immortal rebuked him: "What did you come with? What are you imagining now? Simply await your fate—when the time comes, you will go." Upon hearing this, the sick man bowed in gratitude and passed away.

Generally, for those who cultivate the Way, all external conditions are provisional tools for the present, but one’s own fundamental reality must be cultivated in earnest. If you can pass through worldly affairs with freedom and ease, how could you not be free at the time of departure? If you are attached and stained by things and affairs, how could you be free at the time of departure? Urgently refine yourself in the face of birth and death—who knows when that day will come? What good are external conditions then? Each of you, reflect on this.

When a certain Daoist fell ill, the master addressed all present: Those who cultivate the Way regulate their diet, maintain regularity in movement and stillness, and keep their minds and spirits at peace, without reckless actions. If they fall ill, it is Heaven’s decree—how dare they refuse it? It may also be the unfolding of their own karmic destiny, or the result of past causes manifesting as this illness. First, recognize that the four great elements are all illusory. If there is sickness, let it be sick; if there is death, let it be death. Remain calm and composed, and let things transform as they will. If the mind is not fixed on illness, a severe illness may become mild, and a mild illness may be cured. When the self-nature is peaceful and harmonious, foul and turbid qi disperse. This is repaying the debt of illness, passing through another barrier. If you do not understand this, the mind will not be at peace. At the slightest ailment, the mind becomes frantic, crying out in pain, cursing heaven and earth, resenting others for not supporting you, blaming them for not seeking a doctor, reproaching them for not preparing medicine, scolding them for not visiting. All the while, you give rise to ignorance, darkening the mind with karmic actions—nothing you do is right. Do you not know that your birth and death are already determined? Even if you rush about in panic, can you escape? With the mind in turmoil, you cannot find peace. Do you not know that the mind is the master of the body? If the mind is not at rest, the whole body is in chaos. Have you not heard the ancients say: "When the mind is distracted and the thoughts scattered, the gates of hell open"—you bring misfortune upon yourself. In such a state of mind, a mild illness becomes severe, and a severe illness leads to death, for the nature is befouled and disordered.

If in all matters you lack restraint and excess leads to illness, then the illness is self-inflicted, and you alone must bear it—whom else can you blame? If you cultivate the mind-ground, you will never act thus. Ponder this well.

Someone asked: *"Daoists also fall ill—how is this different?"*
The Master replied: *"Long ago, Master Danyang fell ill, yet physicians could not read his pulse. Master Huqiu sat in meditation, yet physiognomists could not discern his true nature. Why? Because when the mind is not attached to things, the workings of creation cannot alter it; when the nature is not bound to any school, even spirits cannot fathom it—how much less can ordinary physicians or diviners? This is what sets them apart from common people."*

The Master said: *"Those who cultivate the Dao model themselves on heaven and earth in their daily conduct, ever pure and ever still, luminous yet unobscured. They aid beings and benefit life, though they mingle amidst the ten thousand conditions and myriad circumstances. Their true source remains serene and undisturbed, without interruption. Thus they naturally attain liberation from the bonds of birth and death. This is the great matter of karmic causation. Yet how pitiful are those who fail to awaken! Lacking inner mastery, their desires assail them from within while the senses and their objects lure them from without. They cannot act freely, and the four kinds of birth revolve endlessly, the six paths of rebirth churn without cease. Even if they were to change their very skin, they could never be as they are today."*

Someone asked: *"If one is said to harmonize with the world yet not cling to things, how is this possible?"*
The Master replied: *"Heaven is heaven, earth is earth, mountains are mountains, waters are waters, things are things, and I am I. Though one mingles with the world, how can one truly cling to it?"*

Someone asked: *"Do future blessings and misfortunes truly exist?"*
The Master said: *"Do not ask about the future—let us speak of the present. When you generate a good thought, wishing to burn incense and bow before the sacred, your hand lifts the incense as your heart makes vows for your family’s peace, longevity, and fortune—this is not the mind of true goodness. Though you may seek blessings, even if received, you will not know it. For those who cultivate goodness, the reward is hidden, and thus none perceive it. But if you harbor an evil thought, raising a knife to kill, the moment the intention arises, you have already incurred the debt of a life for a life. This cannot be evaded in the realm of clarity and perfect justice. You may scheme in secret, believing it unseen, but soon your deeds will be exposed, and you will repay the debt—this is not seeking misfortune yet finding it. For evil brings manifest retribution, and this is an evident truth for all to see. Moreover, heaven observes what humans cannot—where can you flee? You cannot but be cautious.*

*Someone asked: ‘People speak of heaven and hell—do they truly exist?’*
The Master replied: *"Heaven is the yang realm, governing goodness and blessings. Hell is the yin realm, governing evil and misfortune. The ancients established heaven and hell as reflections of the human mind. One’s actions resonate in the unseen. If one is ever pure and ever still, benefiting all beings and practicing goodness with clarity and unwavering resolve, one belongs to the yang realm. But if one engages in all manner of evil, deceit, and injustice, following perverse paths, one belongs to the yin realm. Ignorance and darkness grow unchecked, filth and defilement accumulate—all recorded in the black ledger, intolerable to gods and humans alike. When the mind is afflicted and myriad sufferings assail, with no one to save you, that is hell. The ancients said: ‘A clear mind and tranquil intent are the path to heaven; a scattered mind and chaotic thoughts are the gate to hell.’ It is like hearing from a trustworthy person that bandits lie in wait along the road, often harming travelers. If you believe the warning and turn back, you will avoid harm. But if you dismiss it and stumble forward drunk, reaching the mountains unscathed is mere luck—if bandits truly lurk, you will fall into their trap, and regret will come too late. The teachings on hell follow the same principle. Generally, doing evil is never better than doing good. Even if goodness brings no reward, what fault is there? But if you persist in evil, calamity will surely strike. If you fail to repent even when the consequences are plain before you, how much less will you foresee what lies in the unseen?"*

Someone asked: *"It is said that karma spans three lifetimes—is this true?"*
The Master replied: *"Have you not heard the ancients say: ‘When delusion is ended, karmic obstacles are fundamentally empty; while delusion remains, one must repay past debts.’ Long ago, a man suffered from a festering sore, the pain unbearable, pus and blood flowing endlessly. Seeking solitude, he hanged himself. Such a person, neither understanding his own nature nor willing to endure the karmic debt of pus and blood from a past life, though he took his own life, would only be reborn to repay it. How do we know this was past karma? Once there was a high official—let us not speak his name, but the principle of cause and effect suffices. Cruel and tyrannical by nature, he would beat his servants at the slightest displeasure. One day, he suddenly felt an itch on his buttocks. Scratching it, he tore away the skin, and soon flesh and blood split open, as if freshly flogged, the pain unbearable until he died. Thus we know that the debt of pus and blood must be repaid. Not only this, but even minor likes and dislikes, slander, beatings, quarrels, and grudges held at first sight—all are old karmic entanglements from past lives. In this life, one must repay them willingly, accepting and enduring without complaint. This is how debts are settled. But if you contend and refuse to repay, the debt only deepens, the enmity compounds, and there will be no end to it. Moreover, heaven favors repayment, and even in human affairs, every injury and grievance is but a karmic debt. Once, when Master Changchun resided at Changzhen Abbey, a great army returned from the north, and he hid to avoid them. He encountered a nobleman, an old acquaintance whose family had long practiced the Dao. The man said his wife had been captured and that he wished to spend his entire fortune to ransom her and let her leave the household to take vows. He sought the Master’s guidance..."*

The Master firmly declined the proposal. By the time they had finished discussing it, the troops had already marched far away. Later, the nobleman asked why the Master had refused. The Master replied: "Your wife and the man who captured her share a three-year karmic debt from a past life. Now that they have met again, it is the fulfillment of that previous cause. After three years, she will be released and come here to leave the household and take vows." Indeed, three years later, she was set free, donned the hairpin and robes of a Daoist, and came to the abbey to pay her respects to the Master. Because she had long practiced goodness, she was able to enter the Dao. Only then did the nobleman believe and bow in gratitude.

The Master said: "The Dao cannot be expressed in words; it only points to good and evil. Goodness establishes the unexcelled cause for transcending the world—there is heaven, no hell. Evil leads to endless suffering—there is hell, no heaven. These two paths arise from delusion or awakening: awakening brings instantaneous sagehood, while delusion leads to eternal sinking. Having attained a human form, how can one not reflect on this?"

Someone asked: "What are fortune and misfortune?"
The Master replied: "Piling wood makes a forest; piling stones makes a mountain; piling water makes a sea; piling goodness makes fortune; piling evil makes misfortune. The source of fortune and misfortune lies in the mind alone. Once accumulated, how can one not be cautious?"

Another asked: "How can one escape the cycle of karmic retribution?"
The Master said: "Karmic retribution belongs to the shell of yin and yang. If you break free from this shell, then there is no karmic retribution. What is the shell of yin and yang? Any trace of selfish desire or wickedness in the mind belongs to the yin shell; any trace of good intention belongs to the yang shell. Within yin, there is evil retribution; within yang, there is good retribution. But if you have refined your mind until it is like empty space—utterly without good or evil, without the slightest entanglement—then you become the master. Fortune and misfortune cannot touch you; cause and effect cannot bind you. This is a person who has broken free from the shell of yin and yang.

Those who remain in the household life never have a single ancient thought in their hearts. All twelve hours of the day, they scheme for wealth and profit, engage in life-and-death struggles, deceive and entrap others, their minds shrouded in ignorance and dark karma. They are trapped within the yin shell, unable to reach the yang path. How then can they break free from the shell of yin and yang to attain freedom from karmic retribution? Is it not difficult? You have created this fate yourself—how can you escape it? Thus, when you lower your head and close your eyes, you leave it to King Yama to decide."

Someone asked: "What exactly determines one’s future rebirth?"

The master said: A person’s lifetime is spent following their emotions to shape their own mold for the next life. Those who do good forge a mold of goodness; those who do evil forge a mold of evil. This continues until the end of this karmic body, when the original nature departs the kalpa. This shell is like molten iron poured into the self-made mold by the Creator—whether as a human or as another being, one reaps what one has sown. Does the Creator intend for you to become an animal? Does the Creator intend for you to enter the six realms? It is the shell you have forged in this life, trapping you within it with no escape. First there is this nature, then there is this form. For example, the cruel become snakes; the stingy become dogs; the lustful and murderous become swine; the greedy and violent become wolves. Generally, all follow this pattern. Between heaven and earth, the myriad forms and shapes are beyond description. Thus the ancients said: "In harmony with metal and stone, one transforms into metal and stone; in harmony with water and fire, one transforms into water and fire." Their words are true. In an instant, one may lose the human form and not regain it for ten thousand kalpas—why not reflect on this?

The master addressed the assembly: In the midst of others, all that one does and acts upon will bear karmic retribution. Those who embody the Dao attain the Dao; those who perform good deeds gain blessings; those who commit evil deeds suffer misfortune. Those who love others are loved in return; those who are trustworthy are trusted; those who benefit others are benefited; those who harm others are harmed. Those who exalt themselves are humbled by others; those who humble themselves are elevated. Those who disdain others are disdained; those who respect others are respected. Those who hate others are hated; those who seek precedence are contested; those who act with strength are opposed. Thus it is said: Plant orchids and you reap fragrance; plant millet and you reap grain—all follow the principle of karmic retribution. If one harbors a mind of profit and employs deceit to win others’ hearts, one loses authenticity.

The master said: If the heart has not yet penetrated the Dao, one may travel a thousand miles to seek a teacher and inquire, and if the connection is as precise as a needle meeting a magnet, the mind-ground becomes clear, all doubts vanish. Then, whether dwelling in a walled garden, residing by a forest spring, begging in the marketplace, or establishing a temple, one may settle the mind and guard the Dao without deviation or corruption—this is the superior practitioner of the true. There are those who leave the household life, yet their nature remains unclear. Lazy in inquiry, proud and competitive, clinging to their own views, they feign the appearance of high attainment, neglecting merit and losing conduct. Both sides come to nothing. They deceive others into offering alms, never considering how their own virtue can repay such gifts. Such people are unfit to dwell in gardens or beg for food; when the time of life and death arrives, they are of no use. This is because they refuse to work at the root. Even after a hundred years, they achieve nothing.

The master said: In the past, when I dwelled in the mountains, I shut my door for over a decade, avoiding all human affairs. My heart was set on stillness, yet I accumulated no merit or conduct. Sitting alone where no one disturbed me, untouched by circumstances or things, how could this heart discern formation or decay? It was merely passing time in emptiness. If heaven does not benefit beings, the four seasons cease to turn; if earth does not benefit beings, the myriad things fail to grow. If one cannot benefit oneself and others, what merit is there? Thus Master Changchun said: "In movement, bring peace to people and benefit beings." This accords with the Dao of heaven and earth.

Someone asked: For those who cultivate the Dao, every moment must be free from delusion—how can one achieve this?

The master said: At the beginning, before the heart is refined, one does not know how to gather or release. Encountering circumstances or things, one clings to them entirely, renewing in the morning and decaying by evening, persisting until exhausted before ceasing. Unaware of oneself, one is deluded. It is like rebirth—unconsciously slipping into another shell, remaining until the karmic debt is repaid before returning. This is delusion. If one relies solely on knowledge and awareness, one is deluded by knowledge and awareness. The cultivator who can examine themselves in every moment of the twelve hours, untouched by even a speck of emotional dust, lightly passing through circumstances and things, is free from delusion.

The master said: The paths of the ordinary and the sage are the same; the difference lies only in clarity or delusion. Clarity makes one a sage; delusion makes one ordinary. The heart of the ordinary person refuses to sever emotional attachments, abandon falsity, or eliminate evil. Drifting with circumstances, swayed by emotions, they seek momentary pleasure, accumulating kalpas of suffering, never reflecting, never awakening.

The master said: The cultivator who remains unblemished in their fundamental nature, applies effort in conduct, swiftly passes through external things, remains unattached to human affairs, does not entertain the slightest deviant thought, leaves no trace of dust, and abides in luminous emptiness—neither clinging to emptiness nor existence, neither grasping dharma-appearances nor self-views—who gathers the light of all beings and, over time, mutually enhances inner and outer, will perceive the realm of the sages and worthies. What doubt remains?

The master said: The cultivator must first clarify their fundamental nature, then master the teachings. If the fundamental nature is unclear, it is like a person without eyes—unable to distinguish the path, every step is mistaken. If the teachings are not understood, it is like a person with eyes sitting in darkness—prone to partiality and attachment. One must master both self and teachings to respond perfectly. If neither is mastered, it is like sitting in great darkness without eyes—when will one ever emerge?

The master said: If the cultivator’s mysterious pass remains unopened and the mind-ground unclear, their karmic consciousness cannot attain non-action, for they lack merit and virtue. They should therefore engage in active practice within the teachings, cultivating according to their capacity, establishing deeds, welcoming those who come, maintaining humility, respecting teachers and friends, constantly practicing kindness, and eliminating selfishness and deceit. Over time, as familiarity deepens and progress is made day by day, there will naturally come a point of breakthrough.

Worse still is the state of one who, like a roof with empty eaves at both ends, can neither attain non-action nor engage in action—merely drifting through days without merit or practice, planting their feet in seclusion, savoring sweetness with their mouth, idly meddling in worldly affairs, thrusting themselves into clamor, indulging body and mind without fear of divine judgment, and calculating their days ahead.

Have you not heard the words of True Man Changchun: *"To cultivate the mind-ground, wholly cast aside worldly affairs. To exert effort in the teachings is to stir up worldly toil."* If you pass your days in idle routine, reflect upon yourself—what manner of person are you?

A physician once asked: *"I have practiced medicine and revived over a hundred dying souls. What karmic fruit does this bear?"*
The master replied: *"Even if you saved every person in the world, it would not compare to saving yourself from the cycle of birth and death. Worldly blessings have their limits, but if you cultivate to the point of transcending birth and death, this merit is boundless."*

A craftsman asked: *"I built a great hall without seeking payment. With such sincerity, what karmic fruit will I receive?"*
The master replied: *"It is not as meritorious as a person of purity sitting in silent meditation for a single hour. Merit from action decays, but merit from non-action does not."*

Someone asked: *"What are merit and practice?"*
The master replied: *"Closing the mouth is merit; opening the mouth is practice. To attain it in silence, without joy or worry, in the stillness of sealed lips and forgotten words—seeking no recognition, concealing one’s light—this is closing the mouth as merit. To offer expedient means, teach others to practice, benefit all beings, and guide them to the true Dao—this is opening the mouth as practice."*

Another asked: *"The teachings of the world each claim their own truth, distinguishing themselves from others. How can we know which is orthodox and which is heterodox?"*
The master replied: *"There are two paths: one of cultivation, and one of worldly engagement. To cultivate this mind is to make it as pure as heaven and earth, as luminous as the sun and moon, as ceaselessly transformative as the four seasons. One who embodies this and returns to the root need not ask what lies beyond—this itself is the functioning of the true Dao. Only those who cultivate can attain it. As for those who recite scriptures flawlessly with their lips and adorn themselves with the trappings of practice, making themselves pleasing to all—these are merely those who engage with the world through the teachings. What do branches, flowers, and leaves have to do with cultivation? What do they have to do with the true Dao? These are temporary expedients. Moreover, if their hearts are filled with contention over self and others, wealth and gain—if their minds are no different from those of ordinary people—how can they attain the Dao? I speak of the Daoist teaching. Let those with clear eyes discern it.*

*This has both substance and function, transcending self and other. It is the true mind, upright and unchanging, received since before the existence of heaven and earth—neither existent nor non-existent. All sages, ancient and modern, and all Daoist masters in the world have attained this before putting it to use. The thousands of scriptures and countless sutras, even the entire *Great Treasury of Scriptures*, speak only of this. Heaven operates through it, earth operates through it, and even the ten thousand things of the world, the boundless expanse of emptiness, are governed by this very principle. One who comprehends it is not led astray by any circumstance, not swayed by any thought, not deceived by the six senses. This is the daily practice of immortals, the conduct of sages, the path of those who advance in the Dao."*

Someone asked: *"Those who cultivate often speak of eliminating emotions and desires. What lies beyond this?"*
The master replied: *"When emotions are eliminated to the point of no emotion, and desires are gone to the point of no desire—what do you suppose harmonizes with this?"*

Another asked: *"How can one who cultivates attain purity and stillness?"*
The master replied: *"A mind that does not chase after things is a peaceful mind. A mind that does not grasp at things is an empty mind. A mind that is both peaceful and empty is purity and stillness—this is the Dao."*

Someone asked: *"Daoists often speak of the Golden Elixir. What is it?"*
The master replied: *"It is the original true nature. Because it is swift, sharp, bright, and transformative—melting and merging—it is called *gold*. Having undergone refinement, perfected and complete, indestructible for ten thousand kalpas, it is called *elixir*. Its essence is like empty space, radiant within and without, untouched by the slightest attachment, unstained by a single speck of dust, shining brilliantly in all directions. Thus, the ancestral masters said:*
*‘The original true nature is called the Golden Elixir,*
*Refined in the furnace of the four temporal states,*
*Unstained, unthinking, free of delusion,*
*It naturally rolls forth to the immortal’s altar.’*

*Some in the world say the Golden Elixir is created through tangible forms and bound to emotions and desires. This is the view of hell-dwellers, the work of the licentious and perverse—deviating from the human path and entering the realm of beasts."*

The master continued: *"In daily life, let the mind remain undivided in thought, the intent not wander outward. Release without dissipation, restrain without constraint. Illuminate the mind and recognize the Dharma, abandoning cunning and transcending emptiness. In the twelve hours of the day, let each thought be present—yet if you cling to the present, this is not the principle; if you depart from the present, there is no such place. Harmonize movement and stillness, know going and coming, let go of everything, free of entanglements and obstacles—this is the person of carefree ease. But all words fall short; you must discern for yourself."*

Someone asked: *"I am old and cannot study much. I beg you to speak a single phrase on the most profound and wondrous truth."*
The master replied: *"Let go of your seeking for the most profound and wondrous truth—then it is already so."*

Another asked: *"What is the profound and wondrous?"*
The master replied: *"Who taught you to ask this?"*
The person joined their hands and said: *"I came up with the question myself."*
The master replied: *"Then you already understand."*
The person laughed and bowed.

Someone asked: *"It is said, ‘To know the One is to complete all things.’ It is also said, ‘Embrace the Origin and guard the One.’ What is this One?"*

The master said: *"This is the undifferentiated nature in its unbroken wholeness, the moment before distinctions arise. Once you know of its existence, you fall into calculation—and thus cannot be one with it. One gives rise to two, two to three, three to the myriad things. How can you guard it? Better to harmonize with the state where even ‘one’ does not exist. Thus, the ancestral master said: ‘To embrace the Origin and guard the One is the work of practice, but in the end, even ‘one’ is absent for eternity.’ In this place where even ‘one’ is absent, your own original nature becomes clear—yet it is not nothingness. As the sutra says: ‘To know emptiness as not empty, to know form as not form—this is called illumination.’"*

The master said: *"The cultivator should keep the mind constantly free of affairs, upright and centered, investigating at every moment the original destiny of the self. When the true place is clearly understood without obscurity, and you merge with the vastness of empty space—only then is this the heart of one who walks the Dao. Through accumulating days and piling up merit, spiritual verification will naturally arise. Thus, seeing all manner of activity, it is better to rest and investigate the self. If the mind is always fixed on external things, drifting through days in habit, it differs not from the mundane heart."*

The master said: *"When the cultivator suddenly stills the dusty mind and forgets worldly concerns, the original true source of the self stands revealed alone—this is the primordial master who has always been. One naturally assumes the carefree ease of self-possession. All dharma realms are penetrated at once. If you reach this state, you must conceal your light and hide your traces. The more you protect and nurture it, the greater the merit. But if you intentionally display it, you unknowingly diminish its radiance."*

Someone asked: *"What are good and evil?"*
The master replied: *"All kind intentions are good; all resentful thoughts are evil. The good that others do not know is the greatest good; the evil that others do not know is the greatest evil. Where neither good nor evil is contemplated, there lies something beyond."*

Someone asked: *"When one reaches the state of purity and non-action, is this thorough realization?"*
The master replied: *"Spoken in terms of substance, this seems correct but is not. When you arrive at the true place, it cannot be spoken, cannot be thought, cannot be known by knowing, cannot be recognized by recognizing. Only when wonder ceases in wordlessness do you begin to correspond. It is neither attached to movement nor stillness, nor separate from them—how can it be defined as non-action or purity?"*

The master said: *"Those who walk the Dao embrace simplicity and contain purity, silently penetrating and subtly moving. They eliminate emotions and abandon desires, reducing and preserving, acting without self-interest, handling affairs with clarity. They yield to others and humble themselves, cultivating benevolence and accumulating virtue. Even the slightest fault must be removed; the most minute merit must be accumulated. Right and wrong are both dissolved; mind and dharma are both forgotten. Then the mechanism of the beyond naturally opens."*

The master said: *"The cultivator investigates where all affairs are untouched, where all dusts are unstained, where one merges with heaven and earth. Penetrating this, the precelestial does not oppose the postcelestial but accords with the timing of heaven. If heaven does not oppose it, how much less do people, how much less do ghosts and spirits?"*

Someone asked: *"Are seeing, hearing, eating, breathing, grasping, walking, and thinking the nature?"*
The master replied: *"The Dao-nature is not identical with these, yet it does not depart from them. In movement and stillness, speech and silence, it is the function of nature—not the substance of nature. The substance is neither movement nor stillness, neither speech nor silence. The ancients said: ‘To know the great Dao, one must know its source, which does not leave movement and stillness, speech and silence.’ If you take movement and stillness, speech and silence as the nature, you mistake the servant for the master. The master commands the servant—how could the servant command the master? All raising of hands, moving of feet, speaking, seeing, hearing—thousands of forms and myriad postures, even long stillness—are all servants, not the master. The master in the hall cannot be clearly shown outside, yet when you grasp its function, you naturally assume the role of master."*

The master said: *"My Dao is secretly transmitted. It cannot be sought with intention, nor attained without intention. It is known through not-knowing, attained through not-attaining. Some in the world seek the Dao through appearances, words, demeanor, or dharma forms—none grasp its wholeness. They do not realize the Dao leaves no traces. To seek it in the near is not the Dao. Investigate instead: from where does this nearness arise? Knowing its origin, you see it is neither sound nor form, neither fabrication nor demeanor, neither dharma form. It abides within—yet it cannot be known or recognized. It is simply this original completeness, truly real, uniting with heaven and earth, sages and spirits, the myriad things. Such a great matter—how could it be seen by those tainted with dust or those who reveal their traces?"*

The master said: *"The essential wonder transmitted by the true teachers of the beyond, when applied in action, secretly accords with the will of heaven. How can one cling to a single aspect and call it the Dao? Observing closely, the ancients’ methods differed, yet the wondrous source of their spirit was never distinct. Thus, the function of the human mind: in the eyes, it sees; in the ears, it hears; in the mouth, it speaks; in the mind, it thinks; in the hands, it grasps; in the feet, it walks. The uses differ, but the substance of the mind is not separate. How much more is this true of the master’s secret teaching—transmitted beyond words, where the paths of thought and speech are cut off. Only the awakened grasp it—this is the wondrous secret of the true teacher’s transmission."*

Someone asked: *"All forms and shapes differ—how can they be seen as one?"*
The master replied: *"Heaven is the Dao, earth is the Dao, the myriad things are all the Dao. That is the Dao, this is the Dao—though forms differ, none are excluded. How can they not be one?"*

The master said: *"Non-action is the way of heaven; action is the way of humans. To be non-active is to be like heaven; to be active is to be like humans. Like a carrying pole—when both ends are balanced, it is steady. If one end is dropped, it tilts. If both ends are released, even the pole is gone, and you return to the original place."*

The master said: *"The Dao is present everywhere—everywhere is the Dao, every form is true. It depends only on how you apply it in the moment; what other matter could there be? Yet the dust of human minds is thick with obstructions. Not understanding the root, they pluck leaves and seek branches, drifting with the waves and chasing the currents. Few turn back in time; most remain lost in delusion. Even if they delve deeply, they do not seek what is real. Twisting and fabricating, they see ghosts and spirits, piling heads upon heads, turning backward and gazing in confusion. They do not awaken to the illusory, limited nature of the body, nor to how fleeting time is. When a single breath does not return—what then?"*

The master said: *"For one who cultivates the Way, conduct and retreat should follow one’s lot, acceptance and rejection should suit the moment. Humility is the heart; uprightness is the rule. Examine the source of movement and stillness, regulate the use of seeing and hearing. Cut off all at once, and with a single thought abide in true constancy—then through endless kalpas, there will be no decay or ruin."*

Someone asked: *"How should one who cultivates the Way protect and sustain the matters of nature and life?"*
The master replied: *"Amid the ten thousand dusts and ten thousand affairs, though entangled and bound, even if you harmonize with them, you must still maintain mastery and not be swept away. Let affairs not obstruct the mind, nor the mind obstruct affairs. Guard it like the eye—if even the finest speck of dust approaches, close it and refuse to receive. Protect it thus, and over time, merit will appear. But if the mind receives anything, it will be led away by external things, and you will lose mastery."*

Someone asked: *"What is the Dao of true constancy?"*
The master replied: *"Set aside ‘true constancy’ for now. Throughout the twelve hours of the day, examine your own mind-ground. When thoughts and concerns arise, what are they? When they have arisen, are they deluded or upright? If deluded, extinguish them at once. If upright, employ them rightly. What is delusion? All preemptive thinking when there is no matter at hand—this is false and illusory. What is uprightness? When there is a matter before you—receiving things, benefiting beings, respecting superiors, pacifying the multitude—all good intentions not for one’s own sake—these are upright thoughts. In stillness, the body is at peace; in activity, the function is correct. Neither indulgent nor restrained, neither day nor night, not the slightest obscurity—constantly responsive, constantly still, level and steady—this is the Dao of true constancy."*

Someone asked: *"Is freedom from defilement and attachment, unrestrained spontaneity, in accord with the Dao?"*
The master replied: *"To intend freedom from attachment is already attachment. To intend freedom from defilement is still attachment to non-defilement. As soon as you seek stillness and concentration, you fall into the root of intention. To indulge or rely on others is to be deluded by false views. Non-defilement and non-attachment are but medicine. When there is no illness, remove the medicine. If the illness departs but the medicine remains, it becomes a medicinal illness. Only when the paths of thought and speech are cut off do you arrive home. Cease asking about the journey."*
