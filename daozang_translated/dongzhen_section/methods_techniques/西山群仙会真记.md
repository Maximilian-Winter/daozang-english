**Preface to *The Record of the Assembly of Perfected Immortals at West Mountain***
The Preface states:
Innate nature is not born of knowing; those who study the Dao must seek earnest inquiry. The Dao is difficult to transmit through words; those who establish teachings do not rely on explicit texts. Concealing the mechanism and obscuring the meaning guards against the reckless leakage of sacred words. Through analogies and veiled expressions, the profound is secretly transmitted to the accomplished.

In the world, there are those who read books yet let the Five Phases descend, who peruse scrolls and grasp all at a glance, whose fame resounds in the world—yet who knows the method of immortality? Those whose horns scrape the heavens—how could they comprehend the principle of the Subtle and Inaudible?

Thus, one must seek the Dao and pursue the Perfected, select a teacher and choose companions, peruse the ten thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures—yet all is contained within yin and yang. From a single word of a revered teacher, one may discern truth from falsehood.

The Five Phases—Water, Fire, Wood, Metal, and Earth—are mutually generating as mother and child, mutually restraining as husband and wife. This is known to all under heaven, yet few comprehend the method of inversion or the principle of extraction and supplementation.

The Three Fields—Essence (jing), Qi, and Spirit (shen)—are such that within essence, qi is born, and within qi, spirit is born. This, too, is known to all under heaven, yet few grasp the meaning of return and reversal or witness the achievement of transcendence.

Only by mastering the inversion of the Five Phases may one enter the Dao; as for extraction and supplementation, these mark the person of the Dao. Only by achieving the return and reversal of the Three Fields may one be deemed to have attained the Dao; as for transcendence, this marks the person who has accomplished the Dao.

Among the ancients and former worthies, none failed to achieve the Dao, yet those who truly accomplished it numbered barely one or two in a hundred. Among later learners of today, many bear the name of the Dao, yet those who have truly entered it are scarcely one or two in ten. As for those who have attained the Dao and achieved transcendence, among the Western Mountain’s immortals, there are but a dozen or so.

Thus, following the sages of past and present, we secretly harmonize and unify, compiling five scrolls to correspond with the true numerical essence of the Five Phases. Each scroll contains five chapters, aligning with the pure yang qi of the One. Here, the supreme Dao is revealed, and the mysterious mechanism expounded. Through reciting these concise passages, the profound teachings of Zhongli Quan and Lü Dongbin, as well as the Most High, are elucidated. May those of later times who awaken to this truth diligently practice it, following my lead to transcend the mundane world and become pioneers of Penglai and Yingzhou.

**On Knowing the Dao**
Ge Xianxi said: “There is no second Dao in the world; though paths differ, they converge as one. The sage has no dual mind; though thoughts are many, they unite in purpose. The Dao of past and present is one; the minds of sages and worthies are the same.”

Yet once the origin of the Dao was divided, and the mind’s perceptions diverged, those who discourse on the Dao forcibly distinguished between them. Though of the same stream, they diverged in their ripples, plucking leaves to seek branches, each forming their own interpretations to establish independent teachings. How could they exhaust the principles of the myriad things? How could they fully comprehend even their own nature?

The Buddhists prattle of vacuous emptiness, seeking the afterlife in this life; the Confucians cling to the present, prizing youthful glory over old age. Little do they realize that the practice of the Dao by the ancient sages resided in the unity of the mind.

The *Western Mountain Records* state: Master Lü said, “In youth, I studied the Confucian arts; in maturity, I favored the nature school. I cultivated the heavenly nobility and abandoned worldly rank, disdaining vacuous emptiness to awaken to true emptiness. Yet heavenly nobility is confined to human affairs, and true emptiness does not depart from causes and conditions.”

Ge Xian said: “Speaking of the Five Constants, the Dao captures but its remnants; using the Three Vehicles to perceive nature, one cannot fathom its roots. Thus, the Dao is not distant from Confucianism or Buddhism—rather, Confucianism and Buddhism distance themselves from the Great Dao.”

From ancient times to the present, men of wisdom and insight have all turned their minds to purity and emptiness, their aspirations set on the mysterious origin. First, they sought ease and longevity; next, they pursued immortality and deathlessness, silently stealing the celestial mechanism for their own use. Ascending from man to immortal, becoming an official of heaven—how does this compare to the Confucian’s vain glory in his own time? Extending life from a hundred years to ten thousand—how is this akin to the Buddhist’s seeking retribution in the afterlife?

For those who cultivate the truth, right and wrong cannot be confused. To recognize the Great Dao, among the Three Teachings, the Most High comes first. Beyond this body, what more is there to seek?

**On Knowing the Method**
The *Hidden Writings of the Most High* states: “The method is originally without method; its principle returns to spontaneity. The mind is disturbed by circumstances, and the method arises from the mind. The intent of establishing methods is to remedy what has been lost and to prevent what has yet to arise.”

Thus, the three thousand six hundred methods correspond to a ten-year period; the dozens of life-nourishing schools correspond to the numbers of heaven and earth: heaven one, earth two; heaven three, earth four; heaven five, earth six; heaven seven, earth eight; heaven nine, earth ten. One, three, five, seven, nine are the yang numbers of the Five Phases; two, four, six, eight, ten are the yin numbers.

The Great Dao divides into the Two Qi; the Two Qi split into the Five Phases. Expansively, they become heaven and earth; luminously, they become sun and moon; spiritually, they become man. None fail to receive the Two Qi and generate the Five Phases, nor to move the Five Phases and penetrate the Three Powers.

The *Western Mountain Records* state: Hua Tuo observed the frolics of the Five Animals and created the *Dao Yin* exercises, believing that prolonged idleness causes qi stagnation and blood congealment. Thus, he bent the body and labored the form to circulate the constructive and protective qi. Later generations followed this, calling it *ban yun*, yet to seek transcendence through it is mistaken.

Long ago, Chen Yi abandoned his daughter by the roadside; starving for days, she learned the turtle’s method of exhalation and inhalation, attaining longevity without death. Later generations followed this, calling it *fu qi*, yet to seek the elixir through it is mistaken.

Zhang Shao examined how the five flavors disrupt the true fluids: one organ favors while another detests, one qi flourishes while another weakens. Thus, he abandoned the five flavors, embracing plainness and blandness. Later generations followed this, calling it *resting grain*, yet this, too, is mistaken.

Liu Dong understood true yang and true yin: when in excess, he drew from its child; when deficient, he subdued its ghost, supplementing and draining as needed. Later generations followed this, adopting the essence of the sun and the radiance of the moon, absorbing the true qi of heaven and earth—yet this, too, is mistaken.

Long ago, Guangchengzi taught the Yellow Emperor the arts of the bedchamber, fearing the loss of true qi and the detriment to cultivation. He sought only to master the enemy, restraining desire in the face of temptation. Through *cai zhan*, he gained merit by seizing the qi of women. Later generations followed this, believing in “man supplementing man,” “absorbing qi and returning essence,” harming others and injuring themselves in pursuit of longevity—yet this, too, is mistaken.

Guangchengzi taught the Yellow Emperor to cultivate according to the method, yet after long practice without result, on Mount Kongtong, he took inner practices as his rule and refined external elixirs to remedy long-standing deficiencies and accumulated injuries.

Later generations, misled by these methods, took lifeless minerals and metals, refining them amid smoke and flame, separating the "embryo" to reveal the "treasure," hoping to ingest it for ascension or to prolong life without death—yet this, too, is mistaken.

Bian Que’s commentary on the *Ling Shu* teaches drawing pure qi through the nose and expelling turbid qi through the mouth, retaining it for twenty-four breaths as one "ounce of fire" to refine true lead into a playful elixir, calling it the "yang embryo," and refining true mercury into a lotus-holding form, calling it the "yin embryo." When the embryo resides in breath-holding and breath-holding preserves spirit, one may preserve form and abide in the world, accumulating merit to enter sagehood and transcend the mundane. Later generations, misled by this, sought to gather qi into an embryo by inhaling more and exhaling less, taking breath-holding as the method—yet this, too, is mistaken.

The *Nine Immortals Classic* advocates using fire for severe ailments and water for minor ones. With fire, one draws qi and reascends it through the body, so true qi pervades the four limbs, and yin ghosts or demonic forces dare not approach. With water, one draws qi and reascends it through the body, so qi penetrates like a surging spring; in stillness, intent directs it to the afflicted area, and qi and blood flow freely without obstruction. Later generations, misled by this, sat alone holding their breath, using the tongue as a pivot, stirring left and right, gathering excess saliva, rinsing and swallowing it, then sending it through the intestines and stomach to be expelled—calling this "irrigating to grow the yellow sprout" and seeking to concoct the great elixir—yet this, too, is mistaken.

The *Tongxuan True Classic* states: Abide in the Dao of non-action to attain the principle of spontaneity. Be clear without turbidity, still before movement. Shift spirit to the realm of the subtle and formless, preserve form on the path of benevolence and longevity. With no thought arising, all delusions cease, and one attains long life, ease, and joy. Later generations, misled by this, failed to discern stillness, cut off all traces, and remained silent year after year, yet saw no results—this, too, is mistaken.

The *Lingbao Inner Observation Sutra* says: Let no external realm enter, no internal realm depart. Guard spirit and consciousness, close the eyes to gaze inward. Descend sovereign fire to the lower field, spread yellow clouds through the four limbs. Reed pipes and chariots array in procession, and one naturally attains the delight of the pot’s interior. Later generations, misled by this, became like withered wood, their hearts like dead ashes, rigidly guarding a dull emptiness, lost in stupor and torpor. Yin spirits exited through the celestial gate, only to be reborn in wombs—this, too, is mistaken.

Others practiced "opening the crown and retracting the turtle," retreated to mountains to recognize their nature, burned incense, read scriptures, made offerings, and performed acts of charity—yet these were not only futile but harmful. Such were the shallow, ignorant followers who devised minor techniques and side practices, passing them among themselves, misleading later seekers, causing the great Dao to grow ever more distant and estranged.

Yet they did not realize that by gazing upward and downward, silently aligning with the ascent and descent of heaven and earth’s yin and yang, the ebb and flow of the sun’s spirit and moon’s soul, one might perceive it. When the first qi floats, recognize one’s own yin and yang. Once the five phases are distinguished, harmonize one’s own water and fire. Within fire lies water, within water lies heaven. Fire bears yin above; in the dim and indistinct, its substance becomes the true unity of water. Water cradles yang above; in the profound and obscure, its essence becomes the correct yang qi. When the two qi unite in marriage, they form the inner elixir. Nurturing it yields the golden pill, and one may become an immortal of the earthly realm.

The *Shangqing Mysterious Pattern* states: The great Dao appears unworthy, and abundant virtue seems insufficient. Concealing brilliance and obscuring nearness, one guards one’s own body, unknown to others. If the Dao is not yet sufficient within, one’s words will be frivolous toward others. If affairs are not yet fulfilled internally, arrogance will show externally. Seeking to surpass others, one remains unknown. For those who cultivate the truth, recognizing others is the first task.

When selecting disciples, listen to their words and observe their conduct. When seeking the Dao, examine their principles and verify their results. Do not reject words because of the person, guarding against those who are eloquent yet appear slow; do not employ people because of their words, guarding against those skilled in rhetoric. Some may be largely pure with minor flaws, beginning as fools and ending as sages. Those who cultivate the truth must also possess the mirror of discernment, for they cannot but uphold the supreme Dao.

The *Xishan Record* says: Though ancient and modern worthies and sages possessed intelligence surpassing others and illumination pervading all, none failed to first seek teachers, for diligent study is not as good as diligently seeking a master. The master is humanity’s model. The Yellow Emperor sought out Chisongzi for half a year before obtaining the *Zhongjie Jing*, which only prevented external conduct from erring. Liu An studied under Wang Daoyuan for a year before learning minor techniques, yet he never spoke of cultivation. Yin Changsheng did not slacken his resolve because Ma Mingsheng was long ill. Ge Zhichuan did not teach family methods to outsiders because of Zheng Siyuan. Zhu Du remained steadfast with the Hu family, and only then did Fang Fang encounter Jinhua and followers gather near and far. Zhang Mengqian met Haichan three times before obtaining the three vehicles’ methods. Xie Zhiyi met Jingyang and was fully taught the nine transformations’ work. Wang Meng met the Great Immortal of Longevity and, in casual conversation, penetrated the great Dao. Mei Fu encountered the Great Cavern True Lord and, in the midst of walking, received the celestial mechanism in full. Since ancient times, there have been no immortals who did not enter the southern continent, yet those who cultivate the truth fail to encounter them—this is due to their lack of discernment in recognizing others.

If some appear with ancient demeanor and eloquent speech, one may initially mistake them for immortals, only to later realize they are common folk. This is the first reason for failure despite study. Others may bear heavy karmic burdens and meager blessings, distrusting celestial mechanisms, valuing wealth over life, content to become lowly ghosts. They record others’ minor faults and discard their great virtues. Though they may see such people, they do not heed their words; though they may hear their words, they do not accept their principles. In the end, they gain nothing, and the divide between immortality and mortality remains. This is the second reason for failure despite encounter.

Some, though erudite and resolute in aspiration, inquire earnestly and reflect deeply, yet upon obtaining true teachings, grow lax of their own accord. They delight in fleeting moments but weary of sustained effort, altering their course by evening what they resolved at dawn, seeking instant attainment while seated. Thus, though they gain, they do not preserve—this is the third reason for failure despite encounter.

Others form reckless alliances with wayward companions, chasing after heterodox doctrines, squandering time and disrupting their days—how can they succeed? The ancients, those superior adepts, first broadly perused alchemical texts, then extensively consulted Daoist peers. In their exchanges, they aligned words with the Dao, ensuring no divergent doctrines arose; in their associations, they harmonized with people, ensuring no reckless companions guided them.

Alas, the foolish insist on their own authority, unable to discern the worthy from the unworthy; the arrogant cling to their own judgments, unable to distinguish the upright from the perverse. The principles governing when to approach or withdraw from others are too numerous to recount.

Thus, the ancient and modern sagely perfected ones, before refining and cultivating, first cultivated their nurturance. As it is said: bathing must not be done in the wind. In a secluded chamber, a quiet room, one closes the eyes and stills the mind, stretches the body and sits upright, allowing primordial *qi* to ascend, suffusing the four limbs, rising into the *niwan* palace—this is true bathing and true cleansing, a thousandfold superior to external water and fire.

Moreover, one should not spit far to avoid depleting *qi*, nor walk swiftly to avoid straining the sinews, nor strain the eyes to avoid dimming the essence, nor strain the ears to avoid harming the kidneys, nor stand too long to avoid injuring the bones, nor lie too long to avoid harming the flesh. Excessive sleep muddies the spirit; frequent intoxication scatters *qi*; profuse sweating depletes the blood; exhaustion harms the form. Racing chariots and galloping horses disorder *qi* and startle the spirit; gazing at heights and climbing steep places scatter the *po* and send the *hun* fleeing. The Dao of nurturing the form lies in tranquility without labor, and if labored, without exhausting one’s strength; in stillness without disturbance, and if disturbed, without disordering one’s *qi*. Externally, there is supplementation; internally, there is benefit. Only then can one comprehend the five phases, preserve the harmonious and balanced *qi*, secure the exterior while refining the interior, attaining both aspects—thus can one endure long!

**Discerning the Seasons**
The *Dongxuan Jing* states: That which has form cannot be without name; that which has name scarcely advances in the reckoning. In the grand scheme, heaven and earth, yin and yang ascend and descend without losing their proper measure; in clarity, the sun and moon, *hun* and *po* come and go each according to its own rhythm. A deviation by a hair’s breadth leads to inversion and disorder. If yin and yang falter in their concealment and emergence, the four seasons fall into chaos, unable to generate and complete the myriad things. If cold and heat alternate improperly, the eight seasonal nodes err, unable to circulate the single *qi*.

Humans, the most noble of the myriad things, the numinous essence of the single *qi*, in grandeur take heaven and earth as their model, never deviating from the proper measure of ascent and descent; in clarity, they emulate the sun and moon, never disrupting the rhythm of their revolutions. By aligning with the seasons and responding to the reckonings, how distant is the Dao?

The *Xishan Ji* states: The Great Dao is formless, giving birth to heaven and earth. Warmth, coolness, cold, and heat alternate yearly in a single union; if this union does not miss its proper time, each year follows the last. The Great Dao is passionless, revolving the sun and moon. Waxing and waning, new and full moons complete a single cycle each month; if this cycle does not miss its proper time, each month follows the last. The Great Dao is nameless, nurturing the myriad things. Do not say that spring gives birth and summer grows—yet the plum blossoms brilliantly and the chrysanthemum blooms fragrantly. Do not say that autumn harvests and winter stores—yet the sterculia bears fruit and the pine flourishes. Receiving *qi* according to the seasons, sprouting in accord with *qi*, even the unknowing grasses and trees do thus. How much more should humans, the most numinous beings, nurture their true nature and refine their physical forms?

The crane knows midnight; the swallow recognizes *wu* and *ji*. Responding to yin and sensing yang, green waters avoid earth. The snake on the *si* day does not cross the path; the warbler in spring emerges from the valley. Even the unknowing birds and beasts act thus—how much more should humans, the most noble beings, follow the seasons to nurture primordial yang and gather true *qi*?

Alas, the ignorant, once their *qi* is sufficient, dissipate and lose it through reckless expenditure. The eight hundred and ten *zhang* of primordial *qi* gradually diminish over time. Do they not know that the great movement of true *qi* follows heaven: in spring, it resides in the liver; in summer, in the heart; in autumn, in the lungs; in winter, in the kidneys? The minor movement of primordial *qi* follows the days: at *zi*, it is in the kidneys; at *mao*, in the liver; at *wu*, in the heart; at *you*, in the lungs. The spring, summer, autumn, and winter of heaven and earth, the waxing, waning, new, and full moons of the sun and moon, and the *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* of humans—all correspond precisely.

Winter is yin; within yin, yang is born, giving rise to warmth—this is spring. Here, yang is host and yin is guest; within yang, yang is again born, giving rise to heat—this is summer. Summer is yang; within yang, yin is born, giving rise to cold—this is autumn. Here, yin is host and yang is guest; within yin, yin is again born, giving rise to cold—this is winter. These are the four seasons of heaven and earth.

At new moon, it is dark; within the *po*, the *hun* is born, giving rise to brightness—this is the first quarter. After the first quarter, the *hun* is the body and the *po* is the function; within the *hun*, the *hun* is again born—this is the full moon. At full moon, it is bright; within the *hun*, the *po* is born, giving rise to darkness—this is the last quarter. After the last quarter, the *po* is the body and the *hun* is the function; within the *po*, the *po* is again born—this is the new moon. These are the four seasons of the sun and moon.

Heaven and earth have three hundred and sixty days; the sun and moon have three hundred and sixty hours; humans have three hundred and sixty degrees. Heaven and earth have twenty-four *qi*; the sun and moon have twenty-four degrees; humans have twenty-four hours. From *zi* to *wu* is the time of *qi*’s generation—this is yang. From *wu* to *zi* is the time of *qi*’s decline—this is yin. *Yin*, *chen*, *wu*, *shen*, *zi*, and *xu* are the six yang-generating hours; *si*, *wei*, *you*, *hai*, and *chou* are the six yin-generating hours. *Jia*, *bing*, *wu*, *geng*, and *ren* are the yang hours of the five phases; *yi*, *ding*, *ji*, *xin*, and *gui* are the yin hours of the five phases. *Chen* is *Taiyang*, and *mao* is *Yangming*; *yin* is *Shaoyang*, and *chou* is *Taiyin*; *zi* is *Shaoyin*, and *hai* is *Jueyin*; *xu* is *Taiyang*, and *you* is *Yangming*; *shen* is *Shaoyang*, and *wei* is *Taiyin*; *wu* is *Shaoyin*, and *si* is *Jueyin*.

At *wu*, kidney *qi* converges with heart *qi*, ascending from below—this is the time when the three yang *qi* gather. At *zi*, heart *qi* converges with kidney *qi*, descending from above—this is the time when the three yin *qi* gather. The *hun*-soul is yang within yin, its *qi* generated at the onset of *mao*; the *po*-soul is yin within yang, its *qi* generated at the close of *you*.

Nurturing yang is not confined to spring and summer, for in spring and summer yang is nurtured because *qi* resides in the heart and liver. Nurturing yin is not confined to autumn and winter, for in autumn and winter yin is nurtured because *qi* resides in the kidneys and lungs.

After the Summer Solstice, true mercury accumulates in the Crimson Palace; after the Winter Solstice, true lead accumulates in the Cinnabar Field. When the Wood phase ascends through twenty-five degrees of celestial mist, this is the time of *xun*, when yang converges with yang—here one gathers it to form the Great Elixir. When the Metal phase ascends through twenty-five degrees of numinous tally, this is the time of *qian*, when yin converges with yin—here one refines it and calls it the Returned Cinnabar.

Refining the body to kindle the fire must occur before *qi* ascends; gathering the fire to return to the origin must take place during yin’s descent. To refine the body and abide in the world, *qi* comes first, employing the times when the five phases overcome one another. To refine *qi* and transcend the mundane, timing comes first, using the *mao* hour when the three fields reverse and yin gathers.

Those who cultivate the Dao yet see no achievement do so because they do not tonify during times of abundance, do not replenish during times of depletion, do not gather during times of dispersion, do not harvest during times of convergence, do not seek when the time is ripe, do not refine when the time has returned, do not recognize the hour of union, and lack the method of gathering. Wasting time and confusing the days, they see not an inch of progress—how then can they attain the longevity of heaven and earth or the durability of sun and moon?

The *Dongtian Yulu* states: To speak of the Dao in words is to grasp but its trailing threads, and thus those who attain the Dao forget words. To seek meaning through images is to grasp but its outer adornments, and thus those who attain meaning forget images. Yet the Dao does not reside in words—though without words, one cannot instruct the unenlightened in principle. And meaning does not reside in images—though without images, one cannot convey profound truths to the dimly aware. Words reveal principle; images manifest meaning. Only in the profound silence between the imageless and the wordless does the great Dao’s mysterious intent reside.

At first, one employs detailed speech and subtle discourse, fearing the other may not awaken; one establishes images through comparisons, fearing the other may not understand. Yet when the eye meets and the Dao is present, it does not depend on words; when the mind converges and meaning is shared, it does not depend on images.

The *Xishan Ji* states: That which is above form is the Dao; that which is below form is the vessel. The lower serves as the foundation for the higher; the Dao employs the vessel as its instrument.

The *Zhongli Mijue* states: Take the heart as heaven, the kidneys as earth, the lungs as the moon, and the liver as the sun. The sun and moon, heaven and earth—these are the greatest luminaries of creation.

The *Cui Xuanzhen Mijue* states: Take kidney *qi* as the infant, heart fluid as the maiden; liver *qi*, yang within yin, as the sun’s *hun*-soul; lung *qi*, yin within yang, as the moon’s *po*-soul. The infant and maiden, *hun* and *po*—these are the numinous and spirit-like aspects of creation. If the heart is the Vermilion Bird, the kidneys the Dark Warrior, the liver the Azure Dragon, and the lungs the White Tiger, these too are the Four Symbols.

Master Ge the Immortal states: The infant is the essence of heart fluid, the radiance of true yang; the maiden is the center of kidney *qi*, the water of the True One. The Metal Elder is the old yang of the lungs, while the Yellow Dame is its faintly yang aspect—one must cause it to return to the Lower Field. The remaining fluid is old yin. When kidney fluid reaches spleen fluid, true yang approaches lesser yin, and as yin weakens, one must cause it to return to the Lower Field. Thus is the theory of the Four Symbols expounded in detail!

The Tai Bai Immortal states:

The Inversion of the Five Phases Technique:
The dragon emerges from within fire,
The Five Phases do not follow their usual course—
The tiger is born within water.

The dragon, by nature an eastern entity of *jia-yi*, yet emerges from fire: above the heart’s armpit lies the *qi* of true yang, thus called the yang dragon issuing from the *Li* Palace. The tiger, by nature a western entity of *geng-xin*, yet is born within water: amid kidney *qi* flows the water of the True One, thus called the yin tiger arising from the *Kan* position.

Yet the dragon, being yang, ascends freely—when in water, it becomes yang within yin, comparable to the heart’s fluid, the *qi* of true yang. The tiger, being yin, races unbound—when atop the earth, it becomes yin within yang, comparable to the kidney’s *qi*, the water of the True One.

Lord Lao said: “Vague and indistinct, yet within it there is something”—this refers to *qi* containing water, bearing yin. “Dim and obscure, yet within it there is essence”—this refers to fluid containing *qi*, embracing yang.

The Perfected Lord of Yin states: The northern true *qi* is called the River Chariot. A chariot transports goods across land in endless cycles; the term *River Chariot* signifies that within the myriad yin of the human body, a single spark of original yang ascends, steaming the enveloping membranes to generate primordial *qi*. From kidney *qi* it transmits to liver *qi*, liver *qi* to heart *qi*, heart *qi* to lung *qi*, lung *qi* back to kidney *qi*—this is called the Lesser River Chariot. The *Golden Essence* flies behind the elbow, rising from the *Weilu* point, passing from the Lower Barrier to the Middle Barrier, the Middle Barrier to the Upper Barrier, from the Upper Field to the Middle Field, the Middle Field to the Lower Field—this is called the Greater River Chariot. Pure yin descends, true water arrives of itself; pure yang ascends, true fire arises of itself. One rises, one sinks—they meet before the Twelve-Storied Tower, each pellet of returning elixir emitting myriad golden rays—this is called the Purple River Chariot. Thus the chariot travels the river, as *qi* flows within the blood vessels, *qi* secretly harboring true water, like a chariot bearing its load. The meaning of *River Chariot* is now expounded in full!

When Master Guangcheng taught the Yellow Emperor internal practices, no progress was seen for a long time. He then refined the great medicine within the Five Metals on Mount Kongtong. Lead is the metal of *qi*; from within *qi*-metal, one extracts silver. Among the Eight Stones, cinnabar is the red stone; from within the red stone, one extracts mercury. Combining mercury with silver yields the treasure—hence the theory of lead and mercury. Lead is the true *qi* stored in the kidneys; mercury is the true essence conjoined from yin and yang. True yin and true yang form the great medicine. With flawless firing times, essence transforms into mercury, mercury into cinnabar, cinnabar into the elixir—this is called true lead. The *Golden Essence* flies behind the elbow into the Upper Palace, entering the Lower Field from the crown; true fire arises in front, ascending into the Muddy Pellet, passing through the heart and the Double Towers. One yin, one yang—water above, fire below—achieving completion. Rushing into the Original Sea, it is called the Purple Gold Elixir—thus is true mercury. The principle of lead and mercury is now expounded in full.

To seek through analogy: yang is likened to movement, ascending within yin; yin is likened to stillness, congealing within matter. One need not know many things, nor seek many images—only the intermingling of pure yin and pure yang to form the great medicine. Yet within yang there is true yin, within yin there is true yang. Thus yang joins yin, yin joins yang, yang joins yang, yin joins yin—four modes of union. And when yin unites with yang, yang with yin, yin with yin, yang with yang—four modes of convergence. Four unions, four convergences, correspond to the eight nodes of heaven and earth, clearly matching the eight phases of the sun and moon. Excessive learning and broad knowledge not only deplete spirit and harm *qi*, but also lead to divergent discussions, wasting time and sowing confusion, ultimately to no avail.

*Records of the Assembly of Immortals at West Mountain, Scroll Two*

Hua Yang the Perfected of Qingxu Grotto-Heaven, Shi Jianwu the Aspirer to Sageliness, composed;
Disciple of the Three Immortals’ Gate, the Idler of All Under Heaven, Li Lianquan the Perfect, compiled:
*On Nurturing Life*

The *Three Primordials Perfected Scripture* states: Though human and other beings differ in form, they receive life from the same *qi*. The hun-soul is bestowed by heaven, the body and po by earth. Without form or image, it comes from the void—father’s essence and mother’s blood transforming nonbeing into being. At three hundred days, the fetus is complete; when the fetal *qi* is full, birth occurs—being arises from nonbeing. Those who do not nurture life well return from being to nonbeing!

When blood and *qi* are in their prime, one’s possessed spirit-*qi* is again bestowed upon one’s children. When blood and *qi* decline, the hun and po one has possessed return to heaven and earth. Thus, within life arises extinction, and extinction halts life. When *qi* severs and spirit scatters, there is no more life.

Good people and noble gentlemen all desire life yet do not know the time for nurturing it. Taking heaven and earth as their model, the sun and moon as their foundation: when yin is cut off, yang is born; when the intestines are cut off, yin is born—unceasing generation, by which heaven and earth endure long. The po departs, the hun arrives, coming and going without cease—by which the sun and moon endure long. Thus, when *qi* is nurtured, it does not weaken; when form is nurtured, it does not wither. Nurturing within and without without error, one thereby attains the same longevity as heaven and earth, sun and moon.

The *Records of West Mountain* states: From ancient times to the present, sages and worthies who have discoursed on the principles of nurturing life and composed treatises on the subject are not few. It further says: To be of few selfish desires—by this, one can nurture the heart. To sever thoughts and forget scheming—by this, one can nurture the spirit. To be moderate in eating and drinking—by this, one can nurture the form. To be measured in labor and rest—by this, one can nurture disorder. To enter purity and exit turbidity—by this, one can nurture *qi*. To sever lust and abstain from sensuality—by this, one can nurture essence.

Yet the Dao of nurturing life does not lie solely in these. What is born is subtle—those who nurture well proceed from the subtle to the manifest. What is born is small—those who nurture well progress from the small to the great. When in ascendance, nurture and gather; when in decline, nurture and supplement. Thus, in spring nurture the spleen; in autumn, the liver; in summer, the lungs; in winter, the heart.

Refining the form kindles the fire; returning the elixir gathers *qi*—this is using the months within the year, not losing the Dao of nurturing life. In spring and summer, nurture yang, letting true *qi* follow heaven. The great movement resides in the liver and heart—heart and liver are where *qi* ascends. In autumn and winter, nurture yin, letting true *qi* follow heaven. The great movement resides in the lungs and kidneys—kidneys and lungs are where fluids descend. This transmission of yin and yang does not lose the Dao of nurturing life.

When kidney *qi* is born at the *zi* hour, one yang arises amid two yins. At this time, if one stills the heart and calms the thoughts, closes the eyes and raises the body, imagining a wheel of fire arising from the cinnabar field, this is nurturing *qi* as it is born with method.

When liver *qi* is born at the *mao* hour, one yang arises beneath two yins. At this time, if one sits in solitude, closes the eyes, breathes in deeply and out shallowly, visualizing a man and woman meeting in the Yellow Chamber and giving birth to an infant, this is nurturing yang as it is born with method.

When heart *qi* is born at the *wu* hour, one yin arises amid two yangs. At this time, if one forgets speech and severs thoughts, fills the mouth with saliva, concentrates heart *qi* to prevent its dispersal, visualizing dragon and tiger mating amid swirling flames, the golden crucible revolving, the flow surging below—this is nurturing the *qi* of the cinnabar field as it is born with method.

When lung *qi* is born at the *you* hour, one yin arises above two yangs. At this time, if one closes the eyes and darkens the heart, gently contracting the abdomen, visualizing a great fire roasting the crucible, within which three pearls blaze unceasingly, the three samādhis simultaneously arising—this is nurturing yin as it is born with timing.

After three hundred days, the fetus is complete, and true *qi* is born. Nurturing this true *qi* and refining it gives birth to spirit. The five *qi* pay homage to the origin; the three flowers gather at the crown. After five hundred days, the yang spirit is born. Nurturing this yang spirit and refining it to unite with the Dao—from the birth of form, one nurtures and gives rise to true *qi*; from the birth of *qi*, one nurtures and gives rise to the dharma-body. A body exists beyond the body, transcending the mundane and entering sageliness. The Dao of nurturing life is complete herein.

*Nurturing the Form*
The *Jade Flower Numinous Writ* states: Spirit takes brightness as its mother; *qi* takes form as its dwelling. Refining *qi* completes spirit; refining form completes *qi*. Before the yang spirit gathers, the three flowers do not enter; before true *qi* pays homage to the Mud Pill Palace, the five colors do not arise in the cinnabar palace. Without form to bind them, spirit and *qi* separate.

Thus, though heaven and earth are vast, they cannot escape the image of light purity and heavy turbidity. Though the sun and moon are bright, they cannot avoid the forms of round brightness and crescent darkness. Accumulated yang gives birth to spirit, above adorning heaven—these are the stars and constellations. Accumulated yin gives birth to form, below strengthening earth—these are the soil and stones. *Qi* ascends from water to become rain and clouds; water descends from *qi* to become mist and dew. The myriad images and multitude of beings cannot be without form.

Only humans gather numinosity to live and rely on the Dao to complete themselves. Not knowing the beginning of nurturing form, their essence and po dissipate, leaving only an empty yin husk. Before death, they are already like withered wood; when their last breath ceases, they become mere dung and dust. The Dao of nurturing form—can one not ponder it deeply?

The *Records of West Mountain* states: In the months of mid-summer and mid-winter, those who skillfully nurture form dwell in secluded halls, avoiding the *qi* of extreme cold and heat to protect their skin and flesh. This is not all: one should don clothing before the cold arrives, and not all at once...

Excessive warmth should precede removal of clothing, and garments should not be shed all at once. After prolonged exertion, rest in tranquility to preserve one’s utmost strength; after prolonged idleness, practice *daoyin* to circulate sluggish *qi*. In summer, avoid sitting in drafts, for drafts cause *rong* (nutritive *qi*) to congeal and *wei* (defensive *qi*) to stagnate; do not sleep exposed to dampness, for dampness scatters *qi* and causes blood to pool. In winter, avoid extreme heat, for extreme heat depletes the kidneys of true yang, leading to congestion in the liver and heart come spring and summer. In summer, avoid extreme cold, for extreme cold traps floating yin in the heart, bringing stagnation to the lungs and kidneys in autumn and winter.

Do not eat when ravenously hungry, and never eat to fullness, for fullness harms the spirit while hunger injures the stomach. Do not drink to excess, for excess harms *qi*, while thirst injures the blood. Wash the hair every ten days; bathe every five. Bathing every five days allows the five *qi* to circulate, cleansing the body so that *rong* and *wei* flow unimpeded. Washing the hair every ten days completes a full cycle, restoring true *qi* to the brain and sharpening hearing and sight. Frequent bathing causes blood to congeal and *qi* to scatter; though the skin may appear lustrous, *qi* is gradually depleted. Those afflicted with paralysis suffer from *qi* failing to overcome blood and spirit failing to govern form. Frequent hair-washing congests *qi* in the upper body and stagnates the brain, making one heavy and fatigued, eventually blocking the meridians.

Thus the ancients nurtured yang with yang to prevent its dissipation, and refined yang with yin to prevent its weakening. Within a year, yang is cultivated in spring and summer, yin in autumn and winter—this is borrowing yin to nurture yang, using yang to dissolve yin. Within a day, before noon, one refines *qian* (heavenly *qi*) to invigorate the body, first cultivating form, then refining the golden elixir. After noon, one refines *kun* (earthly *qi*) as medicine: when medicine is present, gather *qi* to refine the elixir; when the elixir is absent, withdraw the fire to "boil the sea." In all cases, true yang is employed within the body; if not, gather it through inward concentration to nurture true *qi* from nothingness. Ascend with true *qi* to vanquish demonic yin!

Those who follow the Dao may read widely and study much, yet exhaust themselves in vain, unaware that yin and yang are the fundamental principles governing all. True yin and true yang coalesce as an embryo in the *dantian*; true yin becomes *qi*, true yang becomes form, and one attains a body beyond the body, transcending the mundane to enter sagehood.

**Nurturing Qi**
The *Hidden Writ of the Supreme* states: Heaven and earth take clarity and turbidity as their essence, yet without *qi* they cannot move yin and yang. The sun and moon are shaped by brightness and darkness, yet without *qi* they cannot unite *hun* and *po*. The function of the bellows and the principle of breathing—all are made possible by *qi*. A bird soars on a single surge of *qi*, treading the void as if it were solid; a fish leaps on a single burst of *qi*, piercing water as if it were nothing. While all plants wither, only the pine and wutong remain evergreen—this is the strength of their *qi*. While all creatures perish, only the tortoise and crane endure—this is the endurance of their *qi*. Form is the dwelling of *qi*, and *qi* is the talisman of form. To preserve form and abide in the world, one must first nurture *qi*.

Vast and unyielding, it fills the space between heaven and earth. When *qi* gathers, spirit becomes numinous, roaming beyond the dust of the world. Those who excel at nurturing life nurture their form; those who excel at nurturing form nurture their *qi*.

The *Records of West Mountain* states: Those who nurture *qi* from ancient times to the present have not escaped illness and death—this is because they do not understand the Dao. Some say that the noble-minded do not speak to nurture *qi*—this is preserving *qi*, but it leads to dullness. Others say that inhaling the pure and exhaling the turbid nurtures *qi*—this is exchanging *qi*, but it leads to emptiness. Dullness scatters *qi* and maddens the spirit, causing true numinosity to wane daily until it has nowhere to return. Emptiness leaves the *dantian* without treasure; mere breathing in and out is labor in vain, and one cannot abide long. Inhaling more than exhaling may cure illness, but to mistake this for "embryonic breathing" is an error. Swallowing saliva and guiding it downward may gather yang *qi*, but to call this "returning the elixir" is a mistake. Breathing should be continuous, as if present yet not forced—this harmonizes *qi* with spirit. Each breath should be held, inhaled without exhalation—this refines form through *qi*-retention. Swallowing repeatedly, drawing in from both sides, using exhalation and swallowing as a method—this is borrowing *qi* to draw water, a technique of irrigation. Sitting upright and ascending the body, filling the four limbs with *qi*, unblocking the blood vessels, harmonizing *rong* and *wei*—this is the method of "spreading *qi* to burn the body." Yet none of these are true ways of nurturing *qi*.

The Dao of nurturing *qi* lies in nurturing it while it is still vital, so it does not decline; nurturing it when it is weak, so it does not scatter. For example, the ancient practice of *zhun* (Layering) occurs at dawn, when yang first stirs, coiled but not yet extended—thus morning *zhun* is used to foster the flourishing of *qi*. The practice of *meng* (Youth) occurs at dusk, when a single yang resides amid a host of yin, hidden and unclear—thus evening *meng* is used to seek the meaning of yang.

Moreover, straining the mind where it is not keen injures it; forcing the body where it is not strong injures it. Grief and sorrow injure; excessive joy and laughter injure. Craving desires injures; harboring worries injures. Prolonged talking and laughter, irregular sleep, drawing bows and pulling crossbows, indulging in wine and vomiting, lying down after a full meal, leaping and panting, shouting and weeping, lack of union between yin and yang—accumulated injuries lead to early death.

Thus those who nurture well remain desireless and abide in stillness, naturally attaining the subtleties of the unseen and unheard. In winter, yang is born; by the spring equinox, yang flourishes and yin scatters—guard against residual yin entering the abdomen, causing bitter cold illnesses. In summer, yin is born; by the autumn equinox, yin flourishes and yang scatters—guard against residual yang entering the abdomen, causing scorching heat afflictions. Do not observe the dead, lest the *qi* of death strike the *qi* of life.

Avoid impure places, lest foul *qi* strike the true *qi*. When the true *qi* is not yet robust, yet one rises at dawn without emptiness and fills the mouth with food; when the true *qi* is near exhaustion, yet one retires at dusk without fulfillment and restrains the mouth from eating. Yet regulating *qi*, harmonizing *qi*, distributing *qi*, swallowing *qi*, gathering *qi*, circulating *qi*, preserving *qi*, and replenishing *qi*—all these do not depart from the Dao of nurturing *qi*.

*Qi* is like a thread: touch it and it breaks. *Qi* is like smoke: disturb it and it scatters. Those who cannot nurture it lose the Dao of preserving form.

Yet nurturing *qi* does not yet reach the stage of gathering the medicine; gathering the medicine does not yet reach the stage of refining *qi*; refining *qi* to return to the origin, congealing it into the Golden Elixir, tempering it to transcend the shell, and transforming into an immortal—these follow in sequence. Before refining, one gathers; before gathering, one nurtures.

The *Tongxuan Jing* states: Man takes form as his dwelling, the heart as his master. When the master governs a state, there is the distinction between ruler and minister; when he governs a household, there is the ritual between father and son. The heart is the ruler and father, *qi* the minister and child; the body is the household and state. When the heart and *qi* unite in focus, no *qi* disobeys.

Among the Five Phases, it corresponds to fire, the essence of flourishing yang in the south. Its celestial correspondence is Mars, its spirit receives the Vermilion Bird, its form hangs with three leaves, its color like a crimson lotus. Its numinous brightness dwells within, its transformations unfathomable. It blends yin and yang, encompassing heaven and earth, entering even the finest hair. Control it, and it rests; release it, and it rages.

From clarity and stillness the Dao is born; from turbidity and restlessness the spirit perishes. Only by attaining emptiness and quiescence can one grasp it with constancy, forever preserving non-action—thus the body flourishes. Only by restraining madness through mindfulness can one become a sage; only by a sage’s absence of thought can one become mad. The wise of past and present nurture through few desires, devote themselves to utmost sincerity. The true source remains serene, the numinous light naturally shines upon the cinnabar terrace.

Not being deluded by affairs or enslaved by things, one may transcend the ordinary and enter sagehood.

The *Xishan Ji* states: To receive life from the Dao is called *nature*; to receive form from the One is called *destiny*. That which engages with things is called the *heart*; the heart’s recollection is called *intent*; intent’s contemplation is called *will*; affairs fully attended to are called *wisdom*; wisdom encompassing all things is called *thought*; movement that adorns the body is called *hun*; stillness that stabilizes the body is called *po*; flowing through bones and flesh is called *blood*; preserving form and nurturing *qi* is called *essence*. *Qi* that is clear and swift is called *nutritive*; *qi* that is turbid and slow is called *defensive*. Encompassing the hundred bones is called the *body*; all images fully manifest are called *form*; being solid yet bounded is called *substance*; form and appearance as a model are called *corporeality*; having distinctions of size is called the *frame*; thoughts unobstructed are called *spirit*; silent transformation is called *numinosity*. *Qi* entering the body is called *life*; *qi* departing from form is called *death*. That which connects life is called the *Dao*.

The Dao exists yet has no form; it is formless yet possesses essence. Its transformations are unfathomable, its spirit pervades all living things. True persons and celestial immortals teach that cultivating the Dao is cultivating the heart; cultivating the heart is cultivating the Dao. The Dao cannot be seen—it is revealed through the heart. The heart cannot be constant—it is stabilized through the Dao.

Thus an empty heart dispels its fullness; a heart without thought removes its attachments. A settled heart remains unshaken; a peaceful heart avoids peril; a still heart avoids disorder; a correct heart avoids deviance; a pure heart avoids turbidity; a purified heart avoids impurity—all these already exist and are thus removed.

A heart that is upright does not waver; a heart that is level knows no high or low; a heart that is bright is not dim; a heart that is penetrating knows no obstruction—all these are inherent and thus affirmed.

Moreover, one must have few thoughts, few intentions, few desires, few affairs, few words, few laughs, few sorrows, few joys, few likes, few dislikes. Only then can the numinous light remain undisturbed, the spirit and *qi* unconfused—only then can one serve the Dao and preserve life.

Alas, the ignorant: excessive thought exhausts the spirit; excessive intention scatters the will; excessive desire harms *qi*; excessive affairs labor the form; excessive speech weakens *qi*; excessive laughter harms the viscera; excessive sorrow constricts the blood; excessive joy overflows the intent; excessive delight causes confusion; excessive anger unsettles the hundred vessels; excessive fondness leads to delusion; excessive aversion leads to emaciation and joylessness. Thus, when the source is impure, harmonious *qi* dissipates of itself. One cannot prolong life, having lost the way of nurturing the heart.

Thus the ancients compared it to a monkey—wild and unsettled; to a thief—stealing what one possesses.

On Nurturing Longevity:
The *Sanqing Zhenlu* states: The true yin and true yang of father and mother, the two *qi* with essence and blood, form the embryo. When the embryo is complete and *qi* is full, form is established. Gathering the numinous and relying on the Dao, spirit and *qi* unite—thus longevity is determined.

Great longevity is twelve thousand years: preserving simplicity and following one’s endowment, though the body perishes, the Dao does not. Middle longevity is one thousand two hundred years: retaining form and abiding in the world, the Dao remains and the body also remains. Lesser longevity is one hundred twenty years: knowing and cultivating it, one may live in peace and prolong life; not knowing and cultivating it, one loses and dissipates what is one’s own. What is within me is no longer mine, and further, one violates prohibitions, unknowingly eroding one’s allotted years—one count erases three hundred days of life. One year is the base count of longevity; one cycle is the proper span of longevity.

The ignorant and poorly learned regard minor evils as harmless, accumulating evil until the body is destroyed; regard minor harms as inconsequential, accumulating harm until life is extinguished. First, one count is erased; next, the base count is removed; finally, the proper span is eliminated. Before reaching middle age, half one’s years are prematurely lost.

Immortal beings and true persons, moved by pity, though possessing methods of transcendence, must first employ the way of nurturing longevity. Examine and apply it, and one may extend life to great longevity. Without fear of cultivation, after a thousand days, one naturally attains the Dao of transcending the ordinary.

The *Xishan Ji* states: Though one knows the principles of nurturing life, without awakening to the methods of cultivation, life will still not be long.

Though one knows the methods of cultivation, without understanding the Dao of nurturing longevity, cultivation will yield no verification. Thus, in nurturing longevity, one must universally employ prohibitions and taboos to guard against calamity. Speak little, lest the spirit scatter and qi be harmed; sleep with the mouth closed, lest qi leak and the spirit be diminished. Facing peril or ascending heights causes the hun-soul to flee; gazing at slaughter or observing celestial battles causes qi to congeal. Mourning the dead or inquiring after the sick scatters the joyful spirit; sleeping on damp ground or in drafts daily weakens the true qi. Do not enter ancient temples or inauspicious shrines, for entering startles the spirit; do not play with fierce birds or strange beasts, for such play terrifies the spirit. Urinating beneath the Three Luminaries shortens one’s years; celebrating the Four Profound Debts of Gratitude reduces one’s allotted span. Feasting beside sacred images disturbs the hun and po souls; sitting among tombs scatters the spirit. Do not rest beneath withered trees or large trees, lest the yin qi of the Nine Yin assail the yang spirit. Do not cross deep marshes or vast waters, lest the extreme cold press upon the true qi. Do not pluck blossoming flowers, lest you invite demonic madness into your home. Do not eat unseasonal fruits, lest you ingest perverse qi into the belly. Avoid frivolous speech or lewd talk; do not frequently recount misfortunes, for such words diminish one’s proper lifespan. Avoid rich foods and fine wine; do not drink them often except at gatherings, for overindulgence erodes one’s fundamental fortune. Betraying the worthy or forgetting kindness invites disaster; squandering wealth or destroying objects forfeits blessings. Do not venture deep into great mountains, for entering invites misfortune; do not covet beautiful things excessively, for attachment bodes no good. Harming others or damaging things invites karmic retribution; envying the worthy or obstructing the capable breeds mutual resentment. Spreading false teachings or recklessly transmitting secrets, slighting friends or disrespecting masters—any transgression of these, even if one obtains the correct oral instructions or encounters extraordinary persons, will prevent the completion of the Great Dao. First, such misdeeds will shorten one’s lifespan, and with sins outweighing merits, one cannot swiftly achieve success.

Those who skillfully nurture longevity cultivate the internal through method and verify the external through principle. Cultivating the internal involves guarding essence and nourishing qi, pacifying the hun and purifying the spirit, unifying form and spirit in wondrous harmony, and attaining a lifespan equal to heaven and earth. Refining the spirit to merge with the Dao, one transcends the ordinary and enters sagehood. Verifying the external involves aiding the poor and relieving the suffering, showing kindness to all beings and benefiting others, being filial at home and loyal to the state, obedient to superiors and compassionate to subordinates. Do not pursue profit at the expense of harm; do not seek leisure in haste. Let expediency guide the heart, and do not dwell on self and others. Only then, in reverently following the Dao, will one frequently encounter perfected beings and naturally obtain the true method. After commencing practice, even if minor adversities arise, swift completion will follow. Such outcomes stem from cultivation and nurturance, as well as the recompense of hidden virtue. Without comprehending the proper way of nurturing longevity, how can one achieve internal and external completion in unison?

*The Western Mountain Record of the Immortals’ Assembly in the True* (Scroll Two, Conclusion)
*The Western Mountain Record of the Immortals’ Assembly in the True* (Scroll Three)

Within the Three Pure Realms lies the Three Ultimates; within the Three Ultimates resides the Two Modes. Once the Two Modes divide, the Five Emperors are arrayed; once the Five Emperors are established, they unite in a single domain.

Within heaven and earth, above and below, yin and yang ascend and descend; east and west, the sun and moon come and go. Cyclical and ceaseless, revolving without end, they alternate and circulate, never straying from their course.

Yet for humans, essence is the mother, and qi the master. Within the five viscera, each holds its essence, and from essence arises qi; within the five viscera, each holds its qi, and from qi arises spirit. To attain boundless longevity and abide in the world forever, refine essence into elixir and nurture qi into spirit.

True immortals and perfected sages cultivate the inner truth rather than the outer. When inner truth responds externally, there is nothing that cannot be accomplished, and all endeavors reach fruition, elevating the mortal to the sacred.

*The Western Mountain Record* states: In men, the right kidney forms first, enclosing blood within external essence, with yin as its wrapper. In women, the left kidney forms first, enclosing essence within external blood, with yang as its wrapper. The kidneys generate the spleen; the spleen generates the liver; the liver generates the lungs; the lungs generate the heart; the heart generates the small intestine; the small intestine generates the large intestine; the large intestine generates the gallbladder; the gallbladder generates the bladder; the bladder generates the Three Origins; the Three Origins generate the Triple Burner; the Triple Burner generates the Eight Vessels; the Eight Vessels generate the Twelve Channels; the Twelve Channels generate the Twelve Collaterals; the Twelve Collaterals generate one hundred eighty connecting branches; the one hundred eighty connecting branches generate one hundred eighty encircling branches; the one hundred eighty encircling branches generate thirty-six thousand minute branches; the thirty-six thousand minute branches generate three hundred sixty-five bones; and the three hundred sixty-five bones generate eighty-four thousand hair pores. Once the fetus is complete and qi is full, the numinous light enters the body, separating from the mother to become human.

In terms of inner and outer, the interior lies within the channels and collaterals, while the exterior lies beyond the skin and flesh. To nurture life is to nurture the five viscera, for the five viscera are the root—when the root is firm, the leaves flourish naturally. To nurture form is to nurture the five qi, for the five qi are the source—when the source is preserved, the flow endures.

True qi follows the great celestial motion, while primordial qi follows the minor daily cycle. In spring, when the liver is strong and the spleen weak, nourish the spleen with sweet foods: among the five grains, non-glutinous rice; among the five fruits, jujube; among the five livestock, beef; and among the five vegetables, mallow. Calm the heart and avoid sorrow, for sorrow harms the liver. Sit in seclusion to avoid wind, as the liver detests wind. In daily practice, await the minor cycle at the *mao* hour, when the sun’s primordial qi is transmitted to the liver. Rest in stillness with eyes closed to nurture the liver; within ten days, results appear, and within a month, one may see as clearly as autumn down. For those engaged in advanced refinement, this is unnecessary.

In summer, when the heart is strong and the lungs weak, nourish the lungs with pungent foods: among the five grains, glutinous millet; among the five fruits, peach; among the five livestock, goose; and among the five vegetables, scallion. Calm the heart and moderate joy, for excessive joy harms the heart. Sit in quiet to avoid heat, as the heart detests heat. In daily practice, await the minor cycle at the *wu* hour, when the sun’s primordial qi is transmitted to the heart. Dwell in thoughtlessness to nurture the heart; within ten days, results appear, and qi flows through the hundred vessels. For those engaged in advanced refinement, this is unnecessary.

In autumn, when the lungs are strong and the liver weak, nourish the liver with sour foods: among the five grains, beans; among the five fruits, plum; among the five livestock, dog; and among the five vegetables, shepherd’s purse. Rest in stillness to avoid cold, for cold harms the lungs. Avoid excessive grief, for grief damages the lungs. In daily practice, await the minor cycle at the *you* hour, when the sun’s primordial qi is transmitted to the lungs. Sit upright in stillness to nurture the lungs; within ten days, results appear, and the skin becomes radiant. For those engaged in advanced refinement, this is unnecessary.

In winter, when the kidneys are strong and the heart weak, nourish the heart with bitter foods: among the five grains, wheat; among the five fruits, tangerine; among the five livestock, mutton; and among the five vegetables, water dropwort. Calm the heart and avoid fear, for fear harms the heart. In daily practice, await the minor cycle at the *zi* hour, when the sun’s primordial qi is transmitted to the kidneys. Sit upright with body gathered to nurture the kidneys; within ten days, results appear, the cinnabar field warms naturally, and qi becomes robust. For those engaged in advanced refinement, this is unnecessary.

During the four seasons, when the spleen is strong, nourish the kidneys with salty foods: among the five grains, millet; among the five fruits, Chinese yam; among the five livestock, pork; and among the five vegetables, leek. Calm the heart and avoid apprehension, for apprehension harms the spleen. Rest in stillness to avoid dampness, for dampness damages the spleen. In daily practice, await the minor cycle during the *xu*, *chen*, *chou*, and *wei* hours, when the sun’s primordial qi arises.

When fierce winds and crashing thunder penetrate the bladder, transforming into seminal essence, true qi scatters, and fire rises. The lungs open, the heart surges, the liver submits, the gallbladder rages, and the myriad spirits, scorched by true fire, abandon the body to wander outside. Bones dissolve, sinews stretch—no different from death. One emission weakens qi; a hundred emissions deplete spirit; a thousand emissions damage the viscera. When exhaustion is reached and the Four Great Elements lack a master, death ensues.

Thus, true immortals and perfected sages possess the method of returning essence. If one’s aspiration lies in the mysterious origin, kidney qi merges with heart qi, accumulating qi to generate fluid. Like suspended pearls or hanging dew, each droplet returns to the cinnabar field. With flawless firing times, it naturally congeals, forming a shape like a pellet, its color akin to a red tangerine. Qi generates qi, refining qi into spirit. A body exists beyond the body—transcending the mortal to enter the sacred.

If one has yet to awaken to the pure void and willingly serves as a beast of burden for descendants, with licentious and deviant thoughts unresolved, one must not delve deeply into the arts of the bedchamber. All such practices borrow yin’s appearance to lure heart qi downward into the Yellow Court, preventing kidney qi from ascending. Thus, when the dragon coils and the tiger recedes, before emission occurs, abandon desire and love. Sit alone with body gathered, hands clasping the navel, causing qi to congeal into an embryo.

Then, one rises, arching the spine and gathering the body, briefly causing the qi behind the elbows to ascend and fly into the Mud Pill Palace, replenishing the blood and brain, filling the hundred bones to abundance—here lies the verification of reverting age and returning to youth!

Alas, the young and ignorant seek to harvest the fluids and qi of women, mistaking them for "yin elixir." Others refine lifeless minerals and metals, extracting the essence of heaven and earth to forge an "external elixir," consuming it to replenish essence and fill the sea of marrow. If fortune favors and the medicine is potent, harm may be temporarily averted. Yet should original yang be dissipated and the cinnabar terrace left hollow, consuming it will invite incurable illness; taking from others will hasten one’s demise. Thus, the methods of immortals are turned to deception. Reflecting in stillness—who bears the fault?

**Supplementing Qi**
*The Jade Flower Spirit Book* states: Above the nine heavens, there is no yin; below the nine earths, there is no yang. Yang is born within the earth, and over one hundred eighty days, it ascends to heaven. That yang which does not surpass heaven arises from within yin. The primordial qi transmits its surplus to the spleen. In a quiet chamber, one closes the breath, inhaling deeply and exhaling sparingly. Within ten days, results appear: the limbs grow lustrous, the meridians flow freely. Yet for those cultivating the lower arts, such methods are unnecessary.

The five viscera each have their seasons—when one organ flourishes, another wanes; when one qi waxes, another wanes. One reduces excess to supplement deficiency. When the five viscera harmonize, the hundred bones govern themselves; when the hundred bones govern themselves, the myriad illnesses do not arise. When the myriad illnesses do not arise, a thousand years may be anticipated.

**Supplementing Essence**
*The Supreme Mystery Mirror* says: Pure yang ascending is called *qi*; pure yin descending is called *fluid*. When qi and fluid intertwine, infusing the spaces between bones, it is called *marrow*. When qi and fluid intertwine and emerge beyond the bladder, it is called *essence*.

Internally, there are the five viscera—heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, spleen—and the six bowels—large intestine, small intestine, bladder, triple burner, gallbladder, stomach. Externally, there are the four limbs—hair, skin, eyes, ears, nose, tongue, hands, feet, constructive and defensive qi, meridians, and acupoints.

Essence resides where the heart’s qi abides in the liver, and the liver generates its own essence. If liver essence is unstable, the eyes grow dim and lack luster. The heart’s qi abides in the lungs, and the lungs generate their own essence. If lung essence is insubstantial, the flesh becomes frail and weak. The heart’s qi abides in the kidneys, and the kidneys generate their own essence. If kidney essence is not full, spirit and qi diminish. The heart’s qi abides in the spleen, and the spleen generates its own essence. If spleen essence is not firm, hair and teeth weaken.

Among the five viscera, the kidneys are the sea of essence, and the heart is the hall of qi. True essence resides in the kidneys, while surplus essence returns to the lower field. True qi resides in the heart, while surplus qi ascends to the middle origin.

Anxious thoughts and sorrows deplete qi like steam escaping a leaking cauldron. Licentiousness and chaos scatter essence like removing firewood from beneath a boiling pot. The way to replenish essence below lies not only in abstaining from desire but, most urgently, in the arts of the bedchamber. Beware!

*The Record of West Mountain* says: Heaven and earth are the thieves of the myriad things; the myriad things are the thieves of man. For yang ascends and yin descends, and things receive the pure qi of heaven and earth. The essence of yin and the radiance of yang nourish man, who consumes the myriad things to sustain himself. With every drink and bite, it enters the stomach, merging with true qi to flow into the kidney palace. When qi is empty and fullness is sought, the mind arises in response to circumstances. Heart fire presses downward, preventing kidney qi from ascending. It coils left and right like yang bearing the fetus of yin, yang clinging to yang, yin pressed by yang—yet yin returns from heaven. Thus, the yin within heaven descends for one hundred eighty days to reach earth. That yin which surpasses earth arises from within yang.

Yin embraces the substance of yang, yin clinging to yin, yang pressed by yin—yet yang rises again from earth, cycling endlessly without loss. Yet even this is not without the fault of disturbance and imbalance.

Moreover, the corpse’s qi enters the kidneys, which are water. Qi is born within water, like smoke or a thread—touch it, and it breaks; disturb it, and it scatters. The six desires—eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mind—wound from without. The seven emotions—joy, anger, sorrow, joy, love, hate, thought—wound from within. Above, the tower of heaven loses its way; below, the golden turtle spills its essence. Like wind trapped in a leaking net, how can harm be avoided?

Without knowing the way to supplement qi, it is like fire consuming oil, day after day depleting what was once restored.

*The Record of West Mountain* says: Qi is originally formless, yet it relies on the body’s form. When form is whole, qi resides within, and one may cultivate and replenish it. Regardless of age, what matters is utmost sincerity, unwavering from beginning to end.

The sacred embryo of the Heavenly Sovereign, with its secret divine formulas, is the supreme method for supplementing qi. The profound principle of embryonic breathing from Bodhidharma is the middle method. Thereafter, the embryo abides in breath, and breath settles into the embryo. The *Spiritual Pivot* of Bian Que and Ge Hong’s commentary on *Embryonic Breathing* are the lower methods for supplementing qi—all else is not the true way.

**Supplementing and Benefiting**
*The Scripture of the Cavernous Spirit* says: The Dao of nurturing life takes "not depleting" as the art of extending life and "supplementing" as the priority. Dwell in safety yet contemplate danger, guarding against what has not yet sprouted. Do not dismiss small evils as harmless and neglect to remove them; do not dismiss small virtues as inconsequential and fail to cultivate them.

Externally, there are the seasons and times of day; in movement and stillness, there is the constant regulation of harmony. To harmonize sinews and meridians, there are methods of reclining and rising. To nurture the upright and expel the perverse, there are arts of exhalation and inhalation. To circulate constructive and defensive qi, there are techniques of supplementation and drainage. To moderate labor and rest, there are the essentials of giving and taking.

Restrain anger to preserve yin qi; temper joy to nourish yang qi. With clarity and emptiness, dispel reckless thoughts; with tranquility and leisure, cultivate true nature. Though youth may bring depletion, qi weakened and body withered, if one awakens in old age, guards against harm, and supplements what is lacking—supplementing qi with qi, qi will naturally become abundant; supplementing spirit with spirit, spirit will know no deficiency.

When qi flourishes, the form endures and lengthens; when spirit abides, life naturally extends. *The Record of Mount Xishan* states: "Those who comprehend the supreme Dao are not slain by Heaven; those who ingest primordial qi are not extinguished by Earth." The supreme Dao is not distant—it resides within one’s own body. With focused and subtle intention, life naturally prolongs.

*The Six Mysterious Principles* says: "To attain longevity, one must cultivate that which gives life. The root of what gives life begins with essence and qi." Essence and qi coalesce to form the body, and the body is the foundation of life’s reception; qi is the root of the formed. Thus, before noon, refine the Qian (Heaven); after noon, refine the Kun (Earth). Qi arises from the kidneys, beginning at the zi hour and ending at the wu hour, ascending and flourishing. To refine Qian: sit in stillness within a secluded chamber, close the eyes and quiet the mind, raise the body without movement, allowing qi to fill the four limbs, steaming and permeating the body until constructive and defensive qi harmonize. Over days, qi becomes radiant and spirit clear.

When kidney qi reaches the heart, accumulated qi generates fluid. Fluid arises from the heart, beginning at the wu hour and ending at the zi hour, descending and flourishing. To refine Kun: close the eyes and quiet the mind, gather the body in upright sitting, clasp the hands over the abdomen, descend heart-fire to the cinnabar field, steaming and refining the sea of qi. Over days, qi flourishes and spirit clarifies—this is supplementation of qi.

In winter, avoid cold; in summer, avoid heat. In cold, shun wind; in heat, shun warmth. In movement, do not exhaust the limbs; in leisure, do not idle the flesh. Bathe every five days; wash the hair every ten. When qi is abundant, do not move; when blood is abundant, do not rest—this is supplementation of qi.

Permanently sever cravings; encountering circumstances, remain unmoved. The heart is supreme: borrow the false to cultivate the real, seek life through death. Though the body may unite, qi does not; though the form may be impure, the essence remains unstained. If one must approach a woman, do not allow leakage. Temporarily set aside affection, withdraw afterward, and deceive the heart’s qi to supplement the lower origin—this can stabilize life, though it is secondary.

At thirty, yin and yang are balanced, and the essence of the five grains flourishes without depletion, yet desire remains. Engage once every five days. At forty, once every ten days; at fifty, once every twenty; at sixty, once a month. At sixty-four, the year when the hexagrams are exhausted, no further frequency is prescribed. For those of lofty and mysterious origin who seek immortality and deathlessness, such measures need not be discussed—this is supplementation of essence.

To supplement the form is not as good as supplementing essence; to supplement essence is not as good as supplementing qi; to supplement qi is not as good as supplementing spirit. In supplementing spirit, form and qi are eternally secure. From ancient times to the present, those of understanding have discoursed on the Dao of benefiting spirit, yet many fail to see results—not because they lack utmost sincerity, but because spirit is not made the master.

Formerly, the Perfected Liu Gang, on his birthday in the year jiazi or gengshen, offered sacrifices to his form and spirit, thereby gathering spirit and attaining deathless longevity. The Perfected Zhao, in a quiet chamber, regulated his spirit to exit the shell like a stalwart warrior stretching his arms, traversing thousands of miles, where yin ghosts dared not interfere, thus preserving his form in the world. How much more so for those who supplement scattered numinous qi and benefit the present soul and spirit? Foreknowing fortune and misfortune is the numinosity of spirit; eternally transcending life and death is the authenticity of spirit.

The Dao of supplementing spirit lies in purifying the body and nurturing life, cutting off thoughts and forgetting deliberation, neither losing the proper time in movement nor stillness, and refining in accordance with the method. When the elixir is accomplished, qi naturally becomes true; when qi is true, spirit naturally benefits.

*Miscellaneous Records of the Ten Continents* states: "Pure yin without yang is a ghost; pure yang without yin is an immortal; the intermingling of yin and yang is a human. Ghosts are the congealed qi of yin spirits; immortals are the undispersed qi of yang harmony, refined into substance. Humans become ghosts when yang is exhausted—ghosts are the return of humans; humans become immortals when yin is exhausted—immortals are the transformation of humans. In youth, when yang is abundant and yin scarce, if one does not cultivate, then in old age, when qi scatters and spirit declines, how can there be no depletion? The lofty and superior, vigilant before depletion and cautious after, preserve what is not yet depleted from becoming so, and supplement what is already depleted to prevent further loss. Without the great Dao of the lofty, this cannot be discussed."

*The Record of Mount Xishan* says: "Humans receive qi and are endowed with form; at three hundred days, the fetus is complete, and the body separates from the mother. At one thousand days, they are held in arms; at four thousand, they steal things, taking the reckoning of Heaven and Earth. At fifty days, qi is sufficient. Thus, at fourteen, a girl’s celestial water descends and true yin scatters; at sixteen, a boy’s true essence fills and yang qi spills. A man’s qi is eight hundred and ten zhang; a woman’s blood is three dan and six dou. Nine nines, eighty-one, is the number of pure yang, the fundamental count of qi; six sixes, thirty-six, is the number of pure yin, the fundamental count of blood. Beyond this, leakage and dissipation occur. Qi diminishes by nine nines; blood is exhausted by six sixes—natural depletion. How much more so when one ruins and neglects cultivation!

Consider the households of kings and marquises, with a thousand beautiful women; the families of ministers, with hundreds of concubines. By day, they drench their marrow with fine wine; by night, they drain their blood and qi in the bedchamber. Their ears indulge, their eyes wander, and they never rest. They rush about without repose, and with rich flavors and splendid garments, they enter the bedchamber in great drunkenness, unaware of how to govern spirit and preserve qi. Without moderation in living, and with limited essence and spirit, before reaching fifty, they are already withered and decayed. Thus, true immortals and supreme sages, in all their cultivation and nurturance, seek only to avoid depletion."

The daily prohibition: at dusk, avoid great drunkenness.
The yearly prohibition: at dusk, avoid distant travel.
The lifelong prohibition: at dusk, avoid kindling candles for the bedchamber.
These are the broad principles of replenishing what has been depleted.

The five flavors are indispensable to man.
Beware of excess in any one:
Sour harms the spleen,
Sweet harms the kidneys,
Salty harms the heart,
Bitter harms the lungs,
Pungent harms the liver.

Before the great elixir is achieved, hunger and thirst remain.
Take three meals a day, as the ancients did—eating lightly.
Avoid meat and fish, lest they defile the mouth and belly.

For stagnation in the five viscera, employ the six-qi method,
which is the practice of the *Huangting Tu*.
Zhang Chengdao used this to preserve his form and abide in the world;
Wang Wuzhen used it to cure illness and prolong life;
Sun Simiao used it to cultivate himself and heal others.

The subtleties of the six qi:
In spring, do not *hu*;
In summer, do not *yan*;
In winter, do not *he*;
In autumn, do not *xu*.
In all four seasons, *xi* is ever present.
Thus the Triple Burner is never deficient.
At the eight solar terms, do not *chui*,
for the kidney palace will not flourish.

When there is excess, draw upon its child;
when there is deficiency, restrain its ghost.
This is the subtlety unknown through the ages,
yet the supreme sages of Xishan grasped its essence.
No need for a hundred prohibitions—
merely ensure that mornings are not empty and evenings not full: this is best.
Next best is plainness without flavor, blandness without meat.
What worry then for the body’s lack of vigor and joy?

As for the six qi:
When qi is in excess, draw upon its child;
when deficient, restrain its ghost.
The liver’s sound is *xu*, but when in excess, use *xu* sparingly,
for *xu* cannot guide the liver’s qi.
To draw upon its child, use *he* to drain the heart’s qi.
Once the heart’s qi moves, the liver’s qi naturally follows.
If the liver’s qi is deficient, restrain its ghost.
The lungs—metal—are the liver’s wife,
but metal is also its husband, and the husband is the ghost.
If the liver’s qi is weak, it must be that the lungs are in excess.
Restrain the ghost with *yan* to drain it.

The wise, discerning the mutual generation and restraint of the Five Phases,
harmonize their qi without excess or deficiency,
and yin and yang naturally align.
Practicing in accord with the seasons and solar terms,
proceeding with hands-on work,
silently resonating with the celestial mechanism,
and merging with the mysterious principle—
how could one fail to attain longevity or achieve the Dao of immortals?

*Record of the Xishan Immortals’ Assembly of Perfected Ones, Scroll Three* (conclusion)
*Record of the Xishan Immortals’ Assembly of Perfected Ones, Scroll Four*

The *True Water and Fire* from *The Central Yellow Secret Teachings*, composed by Hua Yang Perfected One Shi Jianwu, styled Xisheng, and compiled by Tianxia Duxianke Li Lianquanmei of the Three Immortals Gate:

Yin gives rise to water, whose nature is ever cool and crystalline, yet within it lies Hua Yang—warm springs bathe it, yet cannot overcome its warmth. Yang gives rise to fire, whose nature is ever hot and blazing, yet within it lies Xiao Qiu—cold flames approach it, yet can never warm it. Even external water and fire possess such reversing natures; how could the inner yin and yang lack their proper inversion?

The kidneys are water, yet within water, qi is born—qi is fire! The heart is fire, yet within fire, fluid is born—fluid is water! Water can nourish and flow through the hundred vessels; fire can steam and permeate the four great elements. Such is the water and fire of humanity.

The *Tongxuan Treatise* states: The Dao originally split into one, then divided into the Two Modes. Heaven, by the Qian Dao, is light and pure above, employing yang in its function—yet it secretly embraces a single point of true yin within. Thus, after the winter solstice, yang is born within the earth, ascending to heaven by summer. Accumulated yang generates yin, and this yin, sensing yin, cannot dissipate. Scattered, it becomes mist; congealed, it becomes dew. The qi of mist and dew, born of heaven’s yin, is true water. Earth, by the Kun Dao, is heavy and turbid below, employing yin in its function—yet it secretly embraces a single point of true yang within. Thus, after the summer solstice, yin descends from heaven, reaching earth by winter. Accumulated yin generates yang, and this yang, sensing yang, does not scatter or dissipate. Rising, it becomes clouds; descending, it becomes rain. The qi of clouds and rain, born of earth’s yang, is true fire. Humanity is likewise: at the moment of conception, father’s essence and mother’s blood merge, their two qi uniting. Yang qi ascends, and the heart becomes the palace of qi, secretly harboring true water within. Yin qi descends, and the kidneys become the mansion of water, secretly harboring true qi within. Otherwise, how could kidney qi reach the heart, accumulating qi to generate fluid—a single yin born within two yangs? How could heart qi reach the kidneys, accumulating fluid to generate qi—a single yang born within two yins?

The *Record of Xishan* states: Every person possesses three fires and eight waters. Water is one qi transmitting to another, accumulating qi to generate fluid, and each of the five viscera has its own fluid, called colored water. Within kidney qi, the true one water is secretly concealed, called true water, the yin tiger. The flying golden essence from behind the elbow enters the upper palace, descending from above to meet true fire, achieving the completed union—this is called divine water. For all illnesses, close the mouth and draw in qi, one breath after another, directing it in stillness to the afflicted area—all can be cured and pacified. This is called dharma water. Water has many uses, and its names are not uniform. When the elixir is achieved, true qi is born, irrigating and becoming the method of bathing. Refining the form, true qi ascends, returning to become the method of returning the elixir. Liu Haichan said: "The two luminaries pour into the Seven Treasures Palace, its channels flowing with Eight Jade Nectars"—this is the jade fluid returning elixir. "When water and fire come together to question each other, ascending and descending, yang refines yin"—this is the state of upper and lower water and fire achieving union. Master Xiaoyao said: "Dharma water can court the secret pass, circulating day and night without cease"—this is dharma water treating illness. Such is the great scope of water!

The three fires are: the bladder’s ministerial fire, the kidneys’ ministerial fire, and the fire of ignorance—when one is disturbed by external things, anger and sorrow arise as the fire of delusion. If it descends and burns the cinnabar field without dispersing, guard it with utmost sincerity—this is called refining the elixir medicine. If it ascends and rises behind, passing the double passes, it is called the river chariot. Rising further, passing the multi-storied tower, it is called refining the form. When it fills the four great elements, blazing and scorching the body, the *Nine Immortals Classic* states: "For minor illness, use water and fire. For major illness, employ celestial spirits." This fire, in hexagram divination, flies to form Earth-Heaven Peace. Only when yin is exhausted does one fathom this profound principle—this is the heart’s sovereign fire. Before and after its ascent, it arises everywhere. Such is the great scope of this fire! For major illness, there is no fixed limit. If one errs or the body is unsettled, hasten to a quiet chamber, loosen the hair, drape the robes, close the eyes, and still the heart. Sit upright, clench the fists, and kindle the fire. With subtle breath retention, lower the fire wheel, vast as a bushel, its cover enclosing the entire body. In Buddhist teachings, this is the fire that subdues demons—knock the teeth to gather the spirits. Ascend the body with slow entry and gradual exit, silently envisioning flames rising from the navel in an instant, burning away yin ghosts and demonic influences—this is the Daoist fire that incinerates the body. One must long abstain from desires, the cinnabar origin firm and unshaken. Only then is this the fire of unified intent—day and night, one dares not approach ordinary conduct. Otherwise, water and fire will fail to unite, scattering instead of coalescing. One dares not approach until the dragon and tiger form the elixir. Once the elixir is achieved, yin spirits naturally retreat, and yang spirits will not depart. When spirit resides in form, yin recedes and qi is complete. When qi is complete, the form is firm—naturally, one may attain long life.

The *True Dragon-Tiger Elixir Classic* states: The true dragon and true tiger, wherever they meet and unite, have been kept secret from ancient times to the present. Only the *True Book of the Great One*, personally written by the Most High, and the *True One’s Original Explanation Entering the Spirit*, the second collection of profound sayings titled *True Dragon-Tiger Teachings*, reveal that one resides within the Five Cities of Kunlun, and another within the Great Abyss of the North Pole. They are stored in jade cases, inscribed on golden tablets, sealed with golden mud, and stamped with jade seals. Fierce beasts stand guard, divine beings attend nearby—mortals have no means to know of them!

The Perfected One of Mount Taibai said: "The Five Phases’ Inversion Technique: the dragon emerges from within fire. When the Five Phases do not proceed in order, the tiger is born from within water."

Few indeed are those who grasp it! Subtle indeed is its mystery! Yet this is how the mechanism of Heaven and Earth is revealed.

Master Lü said: "Reading *Master Cui’s Mirror for Entering the Medicine* clarifies the mind’s terrain. The yang dragon emerges from within *li*, the yin tiger is born upon *kan*. When these two meet, they form the root of the Dao. When the Five Directions’ movement is complete, the elixir is named. If a cultivator of truth knows this, he will surely ride the crimson dragon to the Jade Capital."

*The Mirror for Entering the Medicine* states: "Qi arises within the kidneys, and within this qi is concealed the True One’s water—this is called the yin tiger. Fluid arises within the heart, and within this fluid is concealed the correct yang’s radiance—this is called the yang dragon. Dragon and tiger are not the liver and lungs; they are the profound within the profound. Those who know this and refine it become sages."

*The Transmission of the Dao Collection* says: "Kidney qi transmits to heart qi, and as qi accumulates, fluid is born. Within this fluid is the correct yang’s qi—this is called the yang dragon, said to emerge from the *li* palace. Heart fluid transmits to kidney fluid, and as fluid accumulates, qi is born. Within this qi is the True One’s water—this is called the yin tiger, said to be born in the *kan* position. When these two meet, they give life to humans in others and to spirits in oneself."

From ancient times to the present, those who recognize dragon and tiger have been many. Some, though learned and widely read, know only that the dragon is not in the liver and the tiger not in the lungs. Yet how can they grasp the moment of their union and awaken to the method of gathering? Thus, few achieve longevity or ascension to immortality—this is the reason.

*The Record of West Mountain* states: "When water and fire achieve balance, dragon and tiger unite, though their uses vary. For example, when kidney qi transmits to liver qi and liver qi begins to arise, the kidney’s residual yin enters the spleen. As this qi passes through the liver, it becomes pure yang. Within this qi is the True One’s water, which reaches the heart. As qi accumulates, fluid forms—droplets like suspended pearls or hanging dew—returning to the lower field without following the urine to the bladder. If the fire timing is without error, refining them into one qi, qi generates qi, and one becomes an immortal of the earthly realm, undying through eons. This is the tiger uniting with the dragon, the kidney qi merging with heart qi.

When descending fire is applied, reduction and augmentation follow precise measures. Heart qi merges with kidney qi—this is the dragon uniting with the tiger. If the lower gate is penetrated and qi rises from the *Weilü* point, the left ascent is the dragon, the right ascent the tiger. Qi passes through the double gates of the spine, reaching the *Fendao* ridge. There, the yang dragon’s qi enters the inner courtyard, and the yin tiger’s qi enters the celestial pond. Spiraling left and coiling right, thirty-six cycles complete, and true water descends like sweet dew into the heart. This is the dragon and tiger uniting in the upper palace—no need to distinguish between heart and kidneys or between upper union and upper convergence.

Once the embryo is complete and true qi is born, guard against excess by balancing it with water, forming the jade fluid and golden fluid returning elixir. Over time, as the returning elixir circulates through the meridians, it transforms into yang butter and congeals in the central palace as accumulated white snow. Guard against excess by raising it with fire, refining the body and burning the form. Thus, when refining the returning elixir, the yin tiger acts alone, without needing to unite with the dragon. When burning the form, the yang dragon rises alone, without needing to unite with the tiger. The work of dragon and tiger is no small matter! The danger lies in not knowing their root.

If one recognizes the forms of dragon and tiger, understands the timing of their union, and masters the method of gathering, the inner elixir is nurtured in three hundred days. A luminous essence appears within life, and one’s lifespan equals that of Heaven and Earth."

**True Elixir and Medicine**
*The Record of the Grotto Heavens* states: "The Highest Primordial Lord, while still in the mortal world, transmitted the great Dao, illustrating the proper ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth and the cycles of the sun and moon, calling it *inner elixir*. When Guangchengzi taught the Yellow Emperor to practice accordingly, no results appeared after long effort. The emperor, distracted by myriad affairs and lacking a firm root, retreated to Mount Kongtong. There, he took inner practices as his method and combined metals and minerals, calling it *outer elixir*.

The medicine of the inner elixir is the true medicine, while the outer elixir can only treat illness and bring comfort. The inner elixir, in its lesser form, grants longevity; in its greater form, it transcends the ordinary and enters sagehood. It begins with the union of the two qi, which congeal in the elixir field, transforming essence into mercury, mercury into cinnabar, and cinnabar into the elixir—shaped like a pellet, colored like a red tangerine—from which true qi naturally arises. Refining qi with qi, qi unites with spirit, and one enters the Dao. When the Dao is complete, one enters sagehood. The sage, vast and transformative, is unbounded—how can the outer elixir compare?

Thus, the true medicine and true elixir are sought within, not without."

*The Record of West Mountain* says: "When dragon and tiger unite and the mysterious pearl is formed, with fire timing unerring, the great medicine is refined. Once true qi is born, ascending it refines the form, rendering one immune to cold and heat. When true qi gathers, absorbing it returns the elixir, forever banishing hunger and thirst. Is this not medicine for oneself?

When true qi is applied to others, its efficacy is proven: entering water makes it boil, blowing on wood makes it flourish, turning bitterness to sweetness and decay to vigor. Used to heal others’ ailments, none fail to recover. Concentrating spirit to dispel ghosts and demons, none fail to respond—this is the inner truth manifesting outwardly. Is this not medicine for others?

Some, neglecting inner cultivation and ignorant of true origin, rely solely on impure metals and minerals, adding fire day after day, consuming them in hopes of ascending to the immortal gates—this is mistaken!

Yet even ancient and modern adepts have discussed the outer elixir, not because it is unusable. For example, Guangchengzi took cinnabar as the elixir, refining it through nine cycles, calling it *divine elixir*..."

Chen Qizi refined the *Seven-Treasures Cinnabar*, cycling it nine times to call it *Numinous Elixir*; Prince Liu An used boys’ urine, cycling it seven times to call it *Returning Elixir*. Thus we know: the numinous gathers to become spirit, spirit scatters to become void; returning qi to the origin is called *Returning Elixir*. Later practitioners who used it also achieved success and ascended as immortals—this is because, at first, they refined it while simultaneously cultivating inner work, completing both inner and outer, thus attaining the Dao of immortality. If one relies solely on outer medicines, qi weakens and spirit declines, the celestial essence of heaven and earth cannot remain, and it instead becomes harm without end!

**True Lead and Mercury**
The *Mysterious Grotto Jade Edict* states: Long ago, Guangchengzi taught the Yellow Emperor to refine the outer elixir, using lead and mercury as ingredients—yet this was always modeled on inner work. When a person is first born, the kidneys form first; the kidneys belong to the northern *ren-gui* water, corresponding among the five metals to lead. Next, the heart forms; the heart belongs to the southern *bing-ding* fire, corresponding among the eight stones to cinnabar. Extracting silver from lead is like drawing the true One Water hidden within kidney qi; extracting mercury from cinnabar is like drawing the upright yang qi hidden within heart qi. Thus, combining the silver within outer lead with the mercury within cinnabar naturally forms cinnabar. With proper firing, it becomes the great treasure. This is analogous to drawing from the two principles in humans: from within kidney qi, extracting true One Water; from above heart fluid, extracting upright yang qi. Combining these two substances forms the elixir—just as outer substances reveal their treasure.

The *Anthology of Transmitted Dao* states: Embracing the quality of Heavenly One to become the chief of the five metals is *qi-lead*; lead generates silver, lead is the mother of silver. Receiving the qi of Great Yang to become the master of all stones is cinnabar; cinnabar generates mercury, mercury is the child of cinnabar. What is hard to obtain is the silver within lead; what is easy to lose is the mercury within cinnabar. If lead and mercury combine, refinement naturally yields treasure. This is the principle of lead and mercury as seen in the outer.

If speaking of the inner: the true qi of father and mother unite as one, then essence and blood form the embryo, congealing into the inner kidneys—this is lead. As kidney qi generates qi, and qi generates water, combining kidney water with the upright yang qi above heart fluid, congealing it in the Yellow Court to form the elixir—this is called *true lead*. Combining kidney qi with heart qi, accumulating qi to generate fluid, forming the mysterious pearl, then returning it to the lower cinnabar field—this is called *mercury*. When the elixir is complete, true qi ascends, kidney qi enters the crown, true water descends, rising and sinking before the Twelve-Storied Tower to achieve *Completion*. Once completed, it returns to the lower cinnabar field—thus it is called *true mercury*.

The *Formula of the Primordial Sovereign Lord* states:
*Lead and mercury dwell within the crucible,*
*Burned to form a priceless pearl.*
*All comes down to two words—*
*Enough to enlighten ten thousand households.*

The Orthodox Unity True Person said:
*Lead and mercury have been passed down for myriad autumns,*
*How many have awakened? How many have cultivated?*
*If this principle were known to common folk,*
*Immortals would flow through the world like water.*

Master Lü said:
*A single grain of golden elixir secures eternal life,*
*But true lead must refine *jia-geng*.*
*Fire draws the red phoenix marrow from the south,*
*Water seeks the qi-turtle essence from the northern sea.*

The supreme sages, in expounding the principle of lead and mercury, differ in their approaches, but all agree: lead corresponds to the kidneys, and true lead is the elixir; mercury corresponds to heart fluid, and true mercury is the medicine. True lead and true mercury achieve *Completion*. If one relies solely on outer explanations, it will not accord with the inner truth!

**True Yin and Yang**
The *Nine Heavens Secret Record* states: *"One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao; the unfathomable interplay of yin and yang—this is called spirit."* Among things, the greatest and most spirit-like: Heaven obtains one yang to guard the *qian* Dao; Earth obtains one yin to guard the *kun* Dao. Among things, the brightest and most spirit-like: the sun obtains one yang soul to respond to the Dao; the moon obtains one yin spirit to achieve the Dao. Thus, at the summer solstice, one yin descends from heaven—without true yang, the myriad things would die, unable to wither. At the winter solstice, one yang rises from earth—without true yin, the myriad things could not grow, unable to flourish. The sun possesses true yang, so the yang-burner responds and fire emerges; the moon lacks true yin, so the square vessel fails to yield water. Heaven and earth, sun and moon—supremely great and bright—possess true yin and true yang. How could humans be otherwise?

The *Record of Western Mountain* states: The kidneys are water; within water, qi is generated, called *true fire*. Within qi, true One Water is hidden—this is yin containing yang, yang containing yin. The heart is fire; within fire, fluid is generated, called *true water*. Within fluid, upright yang qi is hidden—this is yang containing yin, yin containing yang. The Three Flowers are the three yangs of kidney qi, yang within yin; the true qi within the elixir is yang within true yang. The qi of heart fluid is yang within yang—omitting the three yins, what is prized is the exhaustion of yin and purity of yang.

The *Jade Emperor’s Sacred Embryo Formula* states: One should constantly descend heart fire to the lower field, preventing external states from entering, extinguishing wild thoughts, not scattering a single qi, entrusting it to the qi sea. Kidney qi cannot ascend, breath gradually lessens, and when exhaled, it is subtle and imperceptible. Thus, later sages achieved *natural fetal breathing*!

When Bodhidharma expounded the supreme principle of fetal breathing, he said: Human qi ascends and naturally dissipates—better to inwardly observe the myriad worlds, roam one’s own celestial palace, transcend the wondrous realm of pure emptiness. The method values *non-leakage*: no thought arises, no intention moves. With non-leakage, good fruit ripens; with non-movement, the true sage appears. Facing the wall for nine years, not a hair’s breadth of qi escapes—spiritual yin gathers externally, and the body has its body.

The Easterners failed to comprehend, so he cast aside his alms bowl and returned west. Thus, the sage declared this *true fetal breathing*. When Bian Que elucidated the *Divine Pivot*, he taught that after the winter solstice, one accumulates a fraction of true lead, resembling playful medicine, to stabilize the cinnabar field. One draws pure qi through the nose, closes the mouth without exhaling, and counts twenty-four breaths as one *liang* of fire. After forty-five days, the fire advances to sixteen *liang*, refining the yang embryo. After the summer solstice, one accumulates three parts of mercury, resembling a brooding egg, to stabilize the Crimson Palace. Again, one draws pure qi through the nose, closes the mouth without exhaling, and counts twenty-four breaths as one *liang* of fire. After forty-five days, the fire advances to sixteen *liang*, refining the yin breath. When yin breath merges with the yang embryo, true qi is born; true qi generates the primordial spirit. Spirit and form unite as one, attaining longevity equal to heaven and earth. When separated into two, a body exists beyond the body, becoming a feathered immortal transcending the mortal world, returning to the Three Isles and Ten Continents.

When Ge Hong annotated the *Treatise on Fetal Breathing*, he said: The essence of fetal breathing is like being in the mother’s womb—when she exhales, you exhale; when she inhales, you inhale. Yet people today do not grasp this wondrous principle. Even if they can hold their breath briefly, they release it at once, panting without cease. Not only do they fail to retain the closed breath, but their primordial qi is depleted, seized instead by external yang qi. If the breath grows urgent before the body does, one may pause briefly, avoiding extreme urgency. As urgency approaches, first draw a breath of pure qi through the nose, then replace the old, trapped breath with this newly taken qi, thus seizing control of the breath. Accumulated thus, spirit and form become clear and refreshed, curing a hundred ailments. Yet forcibly holding the breath is not natural, hence considered a lower-grade fetal breathing. True immortals and supreme sages are thus ranked in three tiers.

Drawing in through the nose and exhaling through the mouth can dispel superficial cold, expel guest heat, unblock stagnation, and circulate the meridians. If the breath is stabilized, qi and blood do not intermingle, and yin and yang naturally unite. If ten thousand breaths are stabilized, qi abides and spirit conceals—this is the great achievement of the Mahayana, beyond words. The Dao of replenishing qi is supreme!

Some swallow qi to relieve hunger and thirst, circulate qi to strengthen the muscles and skin, gather qi to replenish the lower field, nurture qi to restore a youthful complexion, or move qi to benefit the blood vessels. Though minor effects may appear, none compare to fetal breathing for replenishing qi, whose power is swift and enduring.

Master Shi Jianwu of the Five Perfections of the Qingxu Cave Heaven, Hua Yang Immortal, composed this text; disciple of the First and Second Immortal Gates, the Idle Wanderer of the World Li Lianquanmei compiled it.

**Entering the Dao through Practice**
*The Record of the Western Mountains* states: To enter the Dao through practice is not difficult in itself; to seek immortality through the Dao is likewise quite easy. That seeking immortality is difficult arises from the Dao one studies not being upright. That studying the Dao is difficult arises from the method one practices not being authentic.

In ancient times, adepts could conceal their forms and alter their appearances, retain qi to return the hun-soul, walk unharmed upon naked blades, ward off venomous creatures without harm, cause nails to fall of their own accord, tread fire without scorching, make water flow backward, reverse wind and rain, cast a kerchief to the ground and send rabbits fleeing, or coil a belt to set needles in motion like serpents. They could make wild rice bear fruit in an instant or summon dragons and fish to sport in a moment. Such are their arts, yet they differ from the Dao.

Thus, the ancients, knowing that after winter’s end yang revives and that after the spring equinox lingering cold enters the intestines and stomach to cause cold damage, would, upon sensing its onset, swiftly retire to a pure chamber, sit cross-legged and upright, close their eyes and still their minds, stabilize their breath and abide in qi. Folding their hands, they would cup the outer kidneys and lean forward in prostration, repeating this no more than twenty or thirty times until sweat emerged and cold qi naturally dispersed.

When the ancients suffered from nocturnal emissions or lower origin depletion and cold, they would, after sunset, sit in quiet seclusion, cup the outer kidneys with one hand while rubbing below the navel eighty-one times. Then they would switch hands, cupping the kidneys and rubbing the navel, again eighty-one times, completing nine cycles. Thus, the cinnabar field would warm, and true qi become abundant and full.

The ancients, dwelling in seclusion and stillness, would banish thoughts and forget speech, directing the heart-fire downward. Closing their eyes, they would visualize fire blazing intensely. Over time, the qi-sea would solidify, their complexion transform, and after long practice, all impurities would be purged, rendering them impervious to cold and heat.

When the ancients overindulged in food and drink, causing fullness in the chest and diaphragm, or when cold and heat congealed into stagnation or pain and blockage, they would sit in stillness, draw pure qi through the nose, keep the mouth closed, inhale deeply and exhale sparingly, directing the breath to the afflicted area. Only when the tension became unbearable would they release the qi. After three to five repetitions, the obstruction would naturally dissolve, forever banishing all illness.

The ancients knew that the heart, being yang, cannot reach yin, while the kidneys, being yin, cannot reach yang. Thus, above the *yongquan* points, qi ascends but does not descend, while blood descends but does not ascend, causing heaviness in the legs and knees, yin congealing and yang dissipating. Moreover, constant exertion without rest exacerbates this. Though washing the feet in hot water at night offers some benefit, its effects are minor. Far better is to raise both feet high, causing qi to flow backward, streaming into the *yongquan* points and reversing its course to the cinnabar palace. In a single day, the feet become light, enabling one to run as swiftly as a galloping horse, steps as if flying.

For minor ailments of the limbs or mild disorders of the five viscera, or when stagnation and blockage arise, the ancients would sit in stillness, calm their minds, close their eyes, and banish all thoughts. Directing the heart-qi to the afflicted area, they would briefly hold their breath, and no ailment could withstand this.

All the above are methods, yet they differ from the Dao. The Dao encompasses all, penetrates all—how could it be limited to mere arts or the efficacy of curing illness? Through arts one recognizes methods; through methods one awakens to the Dao. The Dao is fundamentally the interplay of a single yin and yang.

Yin and yang intertwine and unite, giving rise to the four seasons of heaven and earth and the four phases of the moon—waxing, full, waning, and new. For humans, within a single day: at the transition from *chou* to *yin*, yang unites with yin; from *chen* to *si*, yang joins yang; from *wei* to *shen*, yin unites with yang; from *xu* to *hai*, yin joins yin. Once one grasps the union of yin and yang, how distant can the Dao be?

**Refining Form into Qi**
*The Record of the Western Mountains* states: Form is the dwelling of qi; qi is the master of form. Nurturing qi through form strengthens qi, and the form becomes firm. Circulating qi to refine form perfects the form, and qi naturally becomes true.

Thus, the great cycle of human true qi follows the heavens: in spring it resides in the liver, in summer in the heart, in autumn in the lungs, and in winter in the kidneys. The minor cycle of human primordial qi follows the days: at *zi* it is in the kidneys, at *mao* in the liver, at *wu* in the heart, and at *you* in the lungs.

The sages of old, discerning the workings of heaven, aligned the degrees of qi with the celestial degrees and daily practice with yearly practice. From *zi* to *wu*, when qi is in its ascending phase, they employed the method of gathering qi and returning the elixir. From *wu* to *zi*, when qi is in its descending phase, they employed the method of collecting qi and refining the elixir.

*The Formula of Immortal Peng Yu* states: Before noon, refine *qian*; after noon, refine *kun*. From *yin* to *wu*, rise and sit in stillness, close the eyes and forget speech, slow the nasal breath, and secretly visualize the heart palace as if in the ceremony of husband and wife meeting. With prolonged practice, one attains longevity and deathlessness.

*The Formula of Immortal Yuan Fang* states: From *chen* onward, remain silent. Stir the upper and lower palates with the tongue to gather turbid saliva, swallow it, and exhale the qi of accumulated joy, anger, sorrow, and delight from the heart. True qi ascends, lingering in the face and eyes, which are then massaged with the hands. Next, retire to a quiet chamber, sit in repose without speaking. Between *wu* and *wei*, when qi is abundant and spirit drowsy, lie on one’s side, close the mouth, and sleep. Over time, one attains peace, longevity, and the ability to preserve form and abide in the world. This is knowing the timing and awakening to union, yet lacking the method of gathering and refining.

The sages of the Western Mountains knew that at *zi* hour kidney qi is born, at *mao* hour liver qi is born, and at *wu* hour kidney qi joins heart qi, accumulating qi to generate fluid, which returns to the cinnabar field as the "mysterious pearl." If the firing times are precise, the great medicine is accomplished.

Within kidney qi lies concealed the True One’s water; above heart fluid rests the Correct Yang’s qi. With yin embracing yang and water bearing qi, this is the root of the Great Dao, the medicine of longevity. How to prevent its dissipation? Between *chen* and *si* hours, sit in seclusion within a quiet chamber, inwardly guarding spirit and awareness. Fill the mouth with saliva, neither swallowing nor spitting, and let the breath enter subtly through the nose, exiting slowly—continuous as if present yet not forced. Naturally, the two essences will merge, congealing like dew. After one hundred days without error, the medicine’s potency is complete; after two hundred days, the sacred embryo solidifies; after three hundred days, the immortal is perfected and true qi is born. Within qi lies qi, which may be refined into spirit.

Thus, Zhongli Quan said: "Of old, three perfected ones chanted the six verses of the Golden Elixir." If one fails to awaken through cultivation, this is the vain toil of worldly seekers. Another verse reads:
*In idle courtyards, thoughts drift to Jiangnan,
Spring blooms fill the city, waters brim the pools.
Should you see Yangzhou’s fine sights,
Best steer your dragon-tiger vessel steady.*

This is called the union of dragon and tiger, also known as the method of gathering the medicine. From *wu* to *zi*, the technique of collecting qi to refine the elixir is termed "firing times," though ancient and modern practices differ. Those who do not grasp the true principle or recognize heaven’s mechanism cannot align with the workings of creation. Only Bian Que understood the *Lingshu*, drawing pure qi through the nose and retaining it: four breaths make one *zhu*, twenty-four *zhu* make one *liang* of fire. After the Summer Solstice, with the *Xun* trigram’s celestial influence, proceed through twenty-five degrees to refine true mercury into the yin embryo. At the Winter Solstice, with the *Qian* trigram’s numinous tally, proceed through twenty-five degrees to refine true lead into yang’s growth. When yang’s growth enters the yin embryo, it transforms into the Golden Elixir. A single grain of Golden Elixir grants longevity and deathlessness.

Guangchengzi taught the Yellow Emperor: from dawn to dusk, sit in stillness, forgetting thoughts and banishing external concerns. Guard the spirit within, focusing the mind unwaveringly. Descend the heart’s fire to the cinnabar field, visualizing below the navel a vessel in contest. Within the vessel lies a pearl like a pellet, fired with blazing heat day and night. When the embryo forms and breath stills, one naturally feels no hunger or thirst, no fear of cold or heat, and may preserve form and abide in the world. This is timely firing but lacks the method of gathering qi.

The Western Mountains have a verse:
*Lovers in their prime, the year just right,
Petals fall at dusk, their meeting hard.
Unmindful of the lord’s heartbreak,
When the time comes, seal the Yang Gate.*

At the juncture of *xu* and *hai*, qi follows true fluid in the moment of returning the elixir. When yin joins yin, qi threatens to scatter. Sit in a quiet chamber, breath need not be held—only let it enter subtly and exit slowly. Descend the heart’s fire, focusing intent on the cinnabar field, lest kidney qi fail to settle and heart fire fail to stabilize. Gently press the abdomen, and the cinnabar field will warm, refining the medicine gathered at midday. First, one hundred days under the *Qian* trigram; next, one hundred days from the *Dui* to the *Qian* trigram; then, one hundred days from the *Kun* to the *Qian* trigram. When *Qian* and *Kun* meet, the great firing is flawless. If this is done with proper addition and subtraction, as prescribed, the "flying golden essence" will emerge behind the elbow.

Thus, the ancient perfected sages gathered the medicine under the *Li* trigram and advanced the fire under the *Qian* trigram. After three hundred days, the inner elixir is complete, becoming a terrestrial immortal—form and spirit both wondrous, enduring through eons without death. Therefore, the way of refining form cannot proceed without true qi.

**Refining Qi into Spirit**
The *Records of the Western Mountains* states: refining form with qi transforms the body into qi, making the bones light and strong—entering water without drowning, treading fire without burning. When dragon and tiger unite to form the great medicine, and the firing times are precise, the Golden Elixir is transmuted. Refining qi with spirit, and spirit with qi, does not lie in yang’s union with yin but in withdrawing lead and adding mercury, causing the two eights’ yin to dissolve and replacing the bones to refine the form, allowing the nine threes’ yang to grow. After three hundred days, the embryo-immortal is complete and true qi is born—no need to gather the medicine again.

The "flying golden essence" behind the elbow ascends from the *Weilü* point behind the kidneys, rising to the *Jiaji*, then through the double passes to the upper palace, not merely supplementing the brain with kidney qi. After noon, descend true fire to refine the elixir’s medicine, ensuring yin is exhausted and yang is pure. Thus, at *zi* hour when kidney qi is born, sit in stillness within a quiet chamber, calm the heart, close the eyes, and straighten the posture. Kidney qi will naturally gather. Gently raise the body, arch the chest, and straighten the waist. First, it reaches the *Jiaji*; next, the upper palace. From *zi* to *chen* and *si*, fix this for one hundred days. With one thrust, the three passes are pierced, and the heart’s true fire is accumulated to temper the lower cinnabar field’s inner elixir. Yin solidifies, yang congeals, and qi flourishes abundantly. This is called "qi within qi." The front ascends to the crown, the rear rises into the brain; both ascend together. Raise the body without moving, burning away yin ghosts. One firing increases one qi; ten firings increase one spirit; a hundred firings extend ten thousand years; a thousand firings transcend the mundane world.

The ancient perfected sages, fearing the fire might grow excessive, also employed a method of irrigation. First, gathering the medicine is the method of returning the Jade Fluid Elixir; next, the "flying golden essence" behind the elbow enters the brain, descending from the upper field back to the lower field—this is the method of returning the Golden Fluid Elixir, achieved by puffing the cheeks and swallowing qi in emptiness. When the elixir is complete and true qi is born, refine the qi of the five viscera with true qi.

The *Nine Immortals Classic* states: "The divine sword and golden hammer originate from the qi of the five viscera." The *Central Yellow Scripture* says: "Close the breath for a thousand cycles to refine the five viscera. Each viscus emits its native-colored qi, gathering above to pay homage to the origin. The three yangs unite and ascend into the crown." Thus, the five viscera are not transcended.

Yet without times of cultivation, there is no method of refinement. The Western Mountain holds a method for refining qi—subtle and profound indeed!

Gathering the medicine and advancing the fire, after three hundred days the Great Medicine is complete. Returning the elixir to refine the form, after two hundred days true qi is full. The Great Revolution need not follow heaven; one may simply use the Lesser Revolution to correspond with the days.

Closing the breath to refine qi: on *jia-yi* days, refine liver qi. On *jia* day, liver qi first advances to the *Gen* trigram; holding the breath until the *Xun* trigram is the term. When green qi appears, circulate it to the crown. On *yi* day, nourish liver qi—this accords with the *Bi Fa*. Whenever kindling the fire, recognize the mutual generation and restriction of the Five Phases.

On *bing-ding* days, refine heart qi. On *bing* day, heart qi first advances to the *Xun* trigram; holding the breath until the *Kun* trigram is the term. When red qi appears, circulate it to the crown. On *ding* day, nourish heart qi. Whenever kindling the fire, recognize the mutual generation and restriction of the Five Phases.

On *wu-ji* days, refine spleen qi. First advance it in spring, then hold the breath for one double-hour at *chen*; in summer, hold the breath at *wei*; in autumn, at *xu*; in winter, at *chou*. Whenever kindling the fire, recognize the mutual generation and restriction of the Five Phases.

On *geng-xin* days, refine lung qi. On *geng* day, lung qi first advances to the *Kun* trigram; closing the breath until the *Qian* trigram is the term. When white qi appears, circulate it to the crown. On *xin* day, nourish lung qi. Whenever kindling the fire, recognize the mutual generation and restriction of the Five Phases.

On *ren-gui* days, refine kidney qi. On *ren* day, kidney qi first advances to the *Qian* trigram; holding the breath until the *Gen* trigram is the term. When black qi appears, circulate it to the crown. On *gui* day, nourish kidney qi. Whenever kindling the fire, recognize the mutual generation and restriction of the Five Phases.

Every ten days, cycle once through the five viscera. After two hundred fifty days, each refined twenty-five times, true qi gathers of itself. Opening the River Chariot, one transports the five-colored essences—reed organs and female musicians, carriages and banners, each arrayed in ordered ranks, laughing and joyous, ascending to pay homage at the imperial palace and entering the celestial palace together.

Should yin ghosts obstruct or demonic forces hinder, simply sit upright in a quiet chamber, close the eyes, and still the mind. The true fire of samadhi arises of itself, burning once to disperse the demonic and ghostly. When the fire passes, all is cool and clear, utterly devoid of obstruction. The attendant retinue and music grow ever more splendid.

Sitting in silence all day, inner vision becomes luminous and penetrating, never satiated. Wondrous proofs and extraordinary signs defy full recording. One feels the body ever as if soaring, the spirit and qi buoyant and unrestrained, difficult to govern. This is the time to regulate the spirit and exit the husk, transcending the mundane to enter sagehood.

**Refining the Spirit to Merge with the Dao**
The *Western Mountain Record* states: The adept who cultivates the Dao sets their mind on the Mystery and willingly embraces solitude. Once qi is full and merit complete, the five qi pay homage at the origin, the Three Flowers gather at the crown, blood congeals and qi gathers, the myriad spirits attend the true—all abiding in the Upper Palace. Wealth and honor flourish, towers and carriages, scholars and maidens with reed organs—scarcely belonging to the human world. Yet one must not mistake this for the true realm, for it is but the Upper Palace of one’s own body. Unable to transcend the inner court, lingering without exit, one remains trapped in the gloomy thoroughfare. Though form and spirit are both wondrous, they cannot transcend, becoming but an earthbound immortal, unable to cast off the husk and return to the Ten Isles and Three Mountains.

The Western Mountain’s perfected ones, having fulfilled their merit, must not fail to record in detail the method of exiting the husk. Of old, Master Hai Chan, his merit complete and tally full, felt his yang spirit about to depart. Seated alone in the Upper Palace, it was as when a crane exits the Celestial Gate or a dragon ascends its ancient cave—with a mighty thrust, the Celestial Gate opened of itself, and he cast off the husk and departed.

Master Zhongli, his merit complete and tally full, sat in silent inner vision, ascending a seven-tiered jeweled terrace, level by level, from bottom to top. When the ascent was complete, he must not hesitate, lest the husk remain uncast and he become but an earthbound immortal. Having reached the summit, he closed his eyes and leapt down, as if in a dream just awakening. Outside the body was another body, the size of an infant, radiant and lovely. He must not wander far but swiftly return to his original frame. Entering without exiting, one’s years equal heaven and earth; exiting without entering, one dwells apart from the vulgar world.

Master Lü’s method of exit involved a seven-tiered jeweled terrace and a three-tiered crimson tower, much like Zhongli’s. As he engaged in inner vision, the Purple River Chariot transported his spirit upward into the celestial palace. Yet he lingered amid the purple splendor, unwilling to transcend. Thus he kindled true fire, and amid the smoke and flames, a fire dragon emerged, leaping forth from the gloomy thoroughfare—this was the method of casting off the husk, most wondrous indeed.

Though Master Shi Zu lacked the fire phases, his yin spirit did not scatter. As he engaged in inner vision, he departed amid the sound of a divine chime—this method allows exit but not reentry.

Of old, Bodhidharma and the Sixth Patriarch, though their yin spirits exited the husk, first made their forms like withered wood and their minds like dead ash. Once spirit was gathered and intent undivided, the spirit guarded within. From the ground of the heart, it surged upward, rising level by level, passing straight through the thirty-three heavens to the Palace of Transforming Joy, much like the Daoists’ Upper Palace. Kneeling in reverence, he advanced and exited through the central gate of the Three Gates—this too allows exit but not reentry.

The Western Mountain’s perfected ones, their merit complete and tally full, though their exit does not depart from inner vision, pass through the gate amid song and music. Thus, kindling the fire is transporting the spirit into the crown; passing through the gate is regulating the spirit to exit the husk.

As one engages in inner vision and kindles the fire, imagine amid the bustling splendor a secluded hamlet with two or three thatched huts. First emerge from within, then near or far, gazing back at the old homestead—desolate and forlorn. One longs to depart yet cannot look back, to return yet cannot mistake the path. All the sages transmit this method, each able to cast off the husk without difficulty.

A hymn says:
When merit is complete, one must exit the divine capital,
Amid inner splendor’s bustle, let nothing burden the body.
Gazing back, the old homeland’s scenes are fair,
Yet deep in the throng’s brilliance lies a secluded hamlet.

Alas! Those of little learning and no wisdom,
Who in stillness merely project their yin spirit,
Once they pass through Heaven’s Gate, cannot return to their original form—
This is called "corpse liberation" or "sitting transformation,"
Bewildering the world, to the scorn of those of true discernment!

For those who refine the Dao to sagehood:
*The Record of Grotto Heavens* states:
People fail to awaken to the great principle,
Mistaking fleeting glory and transient honor in this dusty world of spark and lightning,
Their minds enslaved, restless—
One day, their qi wanes and illness comes, their qi severs and death arrives.
Yet they remain unenlightened, drifting into other forms,
Their spirit passing into another husk,
Never grasping the proper way of life and death.

Now, to cultivate and nourish true qi:
Once true qi is perfected, refine the yang spirit.
When the yang spirit emerges, one leaves the dusty world,
Dwelling then on the Three Isles.
With merit complete and spirit ascended, the husk is cast off—
One must transmit and accumulate deeds among humankind.

When conduct is full and merit complete,
One receives the purple imperial decree and celestial writ,
Then resides in the Grotto Heavens.

*The Record of Zhi Chuan’s Reception of the Dao* states:
Those who achieve the Dao must transmit it.
To transmit to the unworthy brings calamity to seven generations;
To fail to transmit to the worthy invites disaster upon oneself.

Master Red Pine admonished the Yellow Emperor:
"The Dao must not be hoarded.
To seek it, one must offer something in return—
Its principle demands gold as pledge, to show constancy."

*The Record of the Western Mountain* says:
What is meant by "renunciation"?
It demonstrates the sincerity of those who receive the Dao.
At the highest level, one renounces the self;
At the middle, one renounces children and grandchildren;
At the lowest, one renounces fields and dwellings.
The highest renunciation is offered to those of the Dao;
The middle, to those who uphold the Dharma;
The lowest, to those who provide protection.

*The Admonitions of Lord Mao the Perfected* states:
Those who transmit the Dao must align with the teachings of the ancient sages.
When encountering one of resolute aspiration,
Do not refuse to transmit merely for lack of a gold pledge.
When encountering one without aspiration,
Do not force transmission even if the gold pledge is given—
This not only undermines the teaching and the Dao,
But also brings no benefit to either party.

The Jade Perfected One asked the Perfected Lord of Primordial Virtue:
When immortals enter the Southern Continent to transmit the Dao and establish teachings,
Why must they require oaths and produce gold or jade?
The Perfected Lord replied:
"The people of the Southern Continent bear heavy karmic burdens and meager blessings.
They do not trust celestial mysteries, valuing wealth over life,
Content to become lowly ghosts.
Without a gold pledge, they will surely have second thoughts;
Without oaths, they will surely leak secrets.
Thus, gold is taken as a token of constancy.
Alas!
Among the multitudes, not one in ten thousand keeps a heart pure and empty;
Among those pure and empty, not one in ten thousand is truly sincere."

Among those sincere in ten thousand, not one is enlightened.
Enlightened, they break celestial mysteries,
Yet value wealth over goods, abandoning their very lives—
Few indeed give this any thought!

For such people feign the Dao to seek riches,
Deceiving and deluding those of earnest aspiration,
Causing the faithful to see Daoists and cast them aside,
Thus leaving lofty Daoists helpless, mouths sealed, even in the face of death—unable to save.

If followers of the Dao discern others, knowing the wise from the foolish,
Cherish the Dharma, distinguishing true from false,
And proceed step by step, accumulating merit,
Then even if Mount Tai and Hua were turned to gold, it would not suffice to repay a teacher or friend in the slightest.
