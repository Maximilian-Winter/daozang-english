**Preface to *The Revealed Wondrous and Profound Collection of the Returned Elixir***

Those who fix their minds on the elixir and exhaust their thoughts on the Yellow Sprout, yet fail to comprehend lead and mercury, squander their treasures in vain. Some seek the frost of a hundred herbs, hoping to master refinement; others compound the five alums, striving for transformation. Yet they waste years of effort, never grasping the essence of lead and mercury.

From my youth, I have been deeply concerned for the talents of others. Beyond my thirtieth year, I encountered the supreme Dao. Having awakened to the subtleties of *xiyi* (profound stillness), I at last understood the mysteries of *huanghu* (the indistinct and evanescent). When the Yellow Emperor ascended and ruled by non-action, when Liu An rose and abandoned the rat—these were not empty legends, but truths confirmed by near evidence.

Thus, the enlightened have instructed me: The Dragon and Tiger are Metal and Water; Metal and Water are lead and mercury; lead and mercury are yin and yang; yin and yang are *kan* and *li*; *kan* and *li* are husband and wife; husband and wife are male and female. Though they originate from a single source, they diverge into many names—like the Sovereign, who is one yet called by different titles.

I have observed how people of this world seek the Tiger in *geng* and *xin*, pursue the Dragon in *jia* and *yi*, unaware that the Dragon dwells in *geng* and *xin*, while the Tiger resides in *jia* and *yi*. Fire blazes in *ren* and *gui*, while Water abides in *bing* and *ding*. The sages of old never recorded these matters plainly, for this Way is ultimately simple.

Hence the adage: *"The Dragon emerges from within Fire; the Tiger is born from within Water."*
And again: *"The Dragon does not dwell in the eastern Qi; the Tiger is not found in the western Rong."*
And further: *"When suddenly the Wood position transforms into Metal, this is the heart of the Great Elixir."*

Such is the truth.

Now, by unforeseen fortune, I have delved into the profound texts. Humbly offering my meager talents, I emulate Yuanyangzi’s *Collection of Golden Liquor* by composing *Thirty Poems on the Revealed Wondrous and Profound* to await later gentlemen who share my aspirations, that they may verify and reflect upon them.

*The Revealed Wondrous and Profound Collection of the Returned Elixir*
By Qianzhenzi of Shaoshi Mountain

**The Poems Say:**

**The Poems Say:**

At the first turning, arrange the Tiger to lead—
First you must deeply enter cultivation within Water.
After ten days, with intent refine Lead and Mercury,
Then fire-temper the River Chariot, seeking it in *jia*.

At the second turning, arrange and listen to the One Spirit—
Bring it back to be simmered within Water.
Diligently refine it in the Yang Cauldron,
Clad in blue robes, wed it to *geng*.

At the third turning, diligently cultivate in the North—
From this, once unite Yin and Yang.
Water steams, fire smelts—seventy-two times—
*Ren* and *gui*, husband and wife, emerge from the bridal chamber.

At the fourth turning, cultivate for not yet ten weeks—
Open the furnace, part the cauldron like floating clouds.
You must wash and change into fresh, pure garments,
Lest dust and grime taint and pollute.

After five turnings refining Lead and Mercury,
The Three Flowers exude fragrance like light crimson.
Open the furnace, draw forth the Water, then add more fire,
And again arrange them to enter the *kan* palace.

At the sixth turning, continuously for over five months,
*Geng*-husband and *jia*-wife are in close embrace.
You must ensure the sealing is firm and tight,
Lest Water flow within the furnace.

When Metal and Water unite, they are not one body;
Where Tiger and Dragon intertwine, there is but a single form.
The immortals left this divine elixir formula:
Grasp the white of the West and the blue of the East.

This single essence of numinous cinnabar belongs to the Four Spirits,
Within the furnace, a small Heaven and Earth.
The *Cantong Qi* clearly states it—
How many gates are there to the Divine Water and Flowery Pond?

From of old, those of resolve refine cinnabar,
But this Way first requires recognizing Horse’s Teeth.
When Dragon and Tiger unite, there is no other medicine—
Who knows that the Yellow Emperor’s Golden Flower is most exquisite?

The sages conveyed this matter in veiled terms:
Lead and Mercury originally belong to the true East.
The woman, though strong, and the man, though yielding,
At once harmonize and enter the Central Palace.

Only the numinous cinnabar holds the deepest principle—
The One Yang must be sought within Water.
Do not burn the hard, stubborn medicines of the world,
For surely you will fail and waste your gold.

The Crone of the West is a fetus within Fire,
The Vermilion of the East comes from within Water.
Only the Central Palace can achieve perfect unity,
Never tainted by even a speck of dust.

The Supreme Way is not for ordinary minds to presume to know—
Who has seen the Blue Dragon don a blue robe?
The Yellow Sprout is not resolved in the Black Quarter,
And the yielding maiden must ultimately follow Fire in flight.

The divine formula of Golden Liquor is not one path—
The Flowery Pond’s subtlety is hard to discuss.
Ruler and minister, father and son return to the Central Earth,
The Blue Soul, after years, is wed to the Spirit.

Lead and Mercury have ever been of one true essence,
Yet scholars have long been deluded and confused.
Rely on you, sir, to carefully seek North and South—
Water and Fire, though distinct in form, are the root of the medicine.

When pure Yin is exhausted, pure Yang remains;
Within Earth it conceals the body, within Water it hides.
If it does not harmonize with the Five Phases,
How can it become the king among medicines?

If common folk wish to refine the Golden Elixir,
First study the scriptures to recognize the Nine Returns.
Do not toy with the Four Yellows or Eight Stones,
For you will never in your life reach the Three Mountains.

First refine the Flowing Pearl into transforming cinnabar,
Then bring it into the cauldron to unite with the Golden Flower.
Fools do not believe in the art of longevity—
When the nine turnings are complete, do not boast.

The divine elixir is said to have many methods,
But swallows and sparrows cannot give birth to phoenixes.
Apart from true Lead and true Mercury,
All else fails to harmonize with the palace tones.

The *jia*-*yi* Dragon emerges from the *li* trigram,
The *geng*-*xin* Tiger is born from the *kan* village.
As husband and wife, they can guard each other,
Unchanging in their original nature and disposition.

The immortals left words praising the Yellow Sprout—
Metal and Water together form one cauldron’s flower.
Only after transforming into Dragon and Tiger
Do *kan* and *li* enter the Purple River Chariot together.

Before the *kan* boy and *li* girl were formed,
Heaven early paired them as the Two Modes.
Once transformed into husband and wife,
They are renamed the Sage of No-Knowing.

Every household’s *wangxiang* conceals Dragon and Tiger,
Everywhere the veiled hides *kan* and *li*.
From of old, people have been deluded and failed to recognize them—
How would the sages willingly reveal the subtle and recondite?

After long refining in the furnace, the essence of Lead appears,
Ruddy frost, light as powder, in profusion.
A hundred *hu* of pearls and jades are not worth its price—
Then you know the celestial realm is your future path.

Constantly, one grain is ground into dust,
Slowly mixed with Mercury over fire.
Who would envy halls filled with pearls and jades?
Shedding the mortal, you at once become a true person.

When alchemical talk is exchanged, it seems endless—
Which one attains the true within the true?
In vain they compound the Four Yellows and Eight Stones,
Unaware that the White Tiger and Dragon are kin.

Within *ren*-*yin* Water, draw forth the *geng* Tiger;
Within the *wu*-*ji* furnace, anchor the *jia* Dragon.
Thanks to the South’s *wuji*, they are
Diligently guarded, their forms crimson.

The middle boy and middle girl meet,
At sixteen years of age, their principles are one.
Moreover, the General serves as matchmaker—
Their harmony is entirely due to the Golden Mortar.

When Yin refines the essence of Lead through nine turnings,
A centenarian elder reverts to youth.
This time, the White Tiger will not return to the North,
And the Blue Dragon will no longer go back to the East.

*Geng*-*xin* is the cauldron, Fire the matchmaker,
Pure Yang of *bing*-*wu* conceals the child’s embryo.
Continuously, day by day, for three hundred days,
Who knows whence this Way originally came?

**The Purple Mist Immortal Explains the Great Elixir Ode**

Where do worldly people recognize the Yellow Sprout?
This thing is within Lead, and in my home.
Lead and Mercury together form the Qi of Heaven and Earth—
Only after shedding the embryo does the Purple Bright Sand appear.

The Two Qi’s cinnabar is the most numinous thing—
True and correctly formed Qi is the Yellow Essence.
Within Mercury there is something to be taken from Lead—
People wander lost on the road, unaware.

The Great Way is clearly before your eyes,
Yet people of this age do not grasp it before returning to the spring.
The Yellow Sprout is the Qi of Qian and Kun,
Its nature and will’s root is like Mercury’s continuity.

Unite with the Great Way, unite with the source—
When mother and child meet, they dare not speak.
First Mercury, then Lead—this is the true Great Way.
Do not let the companion be lost, like the crane coming to the carriage.

This thing all comes from the fullness of sixteen,
In an auspicious year and month, placed in the furnace.
For a thousand mornings, know the fire’s timing—
Do not let the sprout dry while Mercury remains wet.

The sun and moon prolong life, yet people perish—
The true Way is clear, yet they cannot force it.
Every household has Lead and Mercury—
Where do they wander lost in the overgrown grass?

Lead and Mercury dwell in the river, not on the mountain;
Day and night, pursue them in the Three Fields.
In past years, you may have indulged a careless nature,
But gradually your face will wither, becoming a ghost’s visage.

The Great Way leaves behind two scrolls of scripture,
Naturally matching to form a model.
Heaven has always had the female and male—
Why seek medicine names in other lands?

To use Lead, one must blend it with Mercury,
Two families unite as bride sings her song.
When refined to the Purple River Chariot, the earth trembles—
White clouds accompany the crane as it passes.

The Jia-Yi spirits drive the chart of creation,
The Azure Dragon knows it as the soft Lead of Zi.
Clearly wrought, how could it be hard to grasp?
Yet they say the immortals deceive my disciples.

True Dragon and White Tiger merge as an embryo,
Ten months of gestation until it fully opens.
This is the true oral formula for Lead’s sprout—
Where in the world do people seek the Three Powers?

The old woman’s daughter is born drunk as mud,
For a thousand mornings in the dark chamber, she neither rises nor sets.
With sincere heart, day and night, diligently tend the fire—
Do not let Mercury fall out of step with the times.

The sprout dwells in the Central Palace, Mercury in the South,
In ordinary measure, do not be greedy.
Returning Cinnabar is not hard to seek—
It is only that without the mechanism, the mouth stays sealed.

The market brims with Yellow Sprouts, yet none find their home,
People lightly treat them as dust and mud.
Even nobles recognize the true numinous medicine—
Yet for greed, they mingle and lose it.

When heaven and earth first parted, sun and moon rose high,
Shaped like a parrot’s egg or a peach.
The qi of yin and yang knows its season—
Only after three years does it shed its mother’s womb.

The Great Dao has never failed anyone,
Yet Lead and Mercury are cast aside like dust.
People simply lack discernment—
The two qi, Cinnabar, water, and fire are kin.

This thing is born of heaven, yet people do not know it,
The true qi of yin and yang resides in Dui and Li.
Kan holds the five colors—its true name and nature—
Recognize the Yellow Sprout, and return as a sage.

Clearly moving, it seeks itself—
The sprout is in the Central Palace, not the heart.
If primordial qi can become the Great Dao,
Know that the Great Dao does not sink into obscurity.

Do not say the human heart does not seek it—
The Lead sprout and sun-moon dwell in the Central Palace.
The maiden of the North is the numinous medicine—
With a companion, she departs for the great Penglai.

Lead and Mercury have been passed down for myriad ages,
How many have known them? How many have cultivated?
If common folk knew the numinous medicine,
Earthly immortals would flow like water.

*Qin Yuan Chun* explains:
Seven returns to the ordinary—within man,
First refine the self and await the time.

The work of seven returns is hard for people to grasp—
Return to the root, restore the original,
Seven turns gather in Dui’s yang nine.
Simply practice the six positions of yin,
What need to fear the three peaks buried in snow?
Sleep soundly within.

In cultivation, one must resolve the will,
Refine according to the season,
Do not let the heart wander outward.
Still as Li, pure and without filth,
Divine water frequently poured—
There is another sweetness.

When the first yang stirs,
In the deep night, the water clock endless,
The first yang arises at the Fu hexagram.
After midnight, rise, clothe yourself, grasp firmly,
Sit upright.

The Mysterious Female drives, rushing past the nape—
One strike through the three barriers,
Only then does one realize the work’s greatness.
Wood Lead’s pulp, Metal Mercury’s fire,
Within water and fire, there is an infant outside Dui.

In the endless night, the stars grind,
Only point to heaven—
Do not let the exchange go awry.
The Lead cauldron warms,
Light pierces the curtains,
Creation races onward.

At the fire’s first blaze,
Return to the Jade Chamber,
The cauldron full and warm,
The body traverses the Zhou Tian.
Water and fire drawn and added according to the great number,
All reaches the Cinnabar Field—
One must ensure the firing ceases,
Naturally, the light is not of day.

Admiring the light, it shines through the curtains,
Illuminating a thousand thousand steps.
Inner nurturing, the Returning Cinnabar forms itself—
The work of creation,
Divine and sacred as a sealed torch.

Tiger and Dragon mate,
The work of advancing fire still perilous.
Water generates Metal, the yin soul—
This fire grows the Azure Dragon.
The hun in the liver, Mao’s three sevens,
Within the numbers, no excess or lack.
Following one another,
Until the Mud Pill Palace.

Fire frequently added,
The work’s wondrous understanding brings long life,
The countenance forever without aging.
Able to fight demons and external paths,
It teaches me to roam freely,
Standing as an immortal’s title.

By the winding river, gazing at the moon’s radiance,
A crow flies.
Bright and resplendent,
The Milky Way curves,
On the clam’s surface, light shines,
Within grows the sala tree,
The Mao rabbit’s thousand-year fur like jade.

Within yin, yang is born—
One must only awaken to it.
The sun’s crow bears three feet,
Within yang, yin hides,
Originally dwelling in Li.

Two things gathered into one place,
Facing the scene, observe the form—
Do not let dust and defilement arise.
At that time, drink the knife’s edge yourself—
Who would believe
That within nothingness, a child is nurtured?

At the proper time, one must understand—
Recognize the knife’s edge,
In the palm, darkly fragrant.
Diligently drink the jade nectar, always sated,
Frequently refine the great medicine—
Do not idly cast it away.

The Dragon moves left, the Tiger strides right,
Within nothingness, the elder brother is born—
Those who are lost vie to know the Dao.
At Zi and Wu, silent—this work is best.
Without knowing how to cultivate,
One speaks emptily of a thousand thousand.

Discern the water’s source—clear or turbid,
Wood and Metal—ask of their separation.

Kunlun Mountain,
Where fierce waters surge,
A single stream bound,
Nine bends turbid to the bottom,
The lower flow blocked, nowhere to stop.
Stilled, cold and clear,
It reflects the body of divine light.

Metal and Wood—this is the wondrous principle,
Dragon and Tiger unite—
What need for shared origin?
Only fear that sentient beings will not comprehend,
Again raising yin and yang,
Deeply ashamed.

Without a teacher’s guidance,
This matter is hard to know—
The Dao’s essentials are profound and subtle.

Kan and Li’s root is Lead and Mercury,
Having seen through a thousand chapters,
The principle of seclusion is hard to grasp.
When the master bestows the wondrous principle,
Ten thousand scrolls are mastered,
The heart rejoices in another way.

Within being, nothingness arises,
Greatly embracing heaven and earth,
Smallly entering the tip of a hair.
The Primordial Beginning once spoke of it as a millet grain,
The numinous treasure clearly—
Only then does one realize it is truly direct.

The heavenly mechanism is deep and distant—
Begin swiftly, do not delay too long.

Earth’s qi rises, heaven’s rain descends,
All things sprout—
This is the image of the heavenly mechanism.

At the mountain’s peak, a spring, fathoms deep,
The rope too short to seek it—
To find it is surely difficult to hope for.

Cultivate in youth, the root strong,
In old age, Lead is weak, Mercury scant—
How then,
With senses all stilled, spirit scattered,
The root gone dry,
Can one ascend to the original?

The Penglai path,
Rely on three thousand deeds fulfilled,
Alone step into the clouds and return.

The sea waves inquire of Penglai Isle—
Those who fulfill their deeds and depart are rare indeed.
No path, no boat, vast and boundless,
Even Master Li Shi would find it hard to reach.
Cultivate harmony early, with youthful vigor,
Guard the profound and mysterious Dao.

Though seas shift and change, the body stays young,
The Jade Emperor hears and issues a golden decree.
He Xiangu’s hymn to Lü the True Man, to the tune of *Qinyuan Chun*:

Sevenfold Returned Elixir,
The cyclical elixir’s work is supreme.
Rely on north and south, west and east,
The Five Phases and Four Images all return to earth,
Restoring the root and original nature, then all is clear.

For one, first refine the self and await the hour.
Refining the self begins with rectitude;
Awaiting the hour, the elixir forms within.
Therein lies the subtle mystery—
Intercourse and union, Dragon and Tiger meet Lord Ding,
Embracing the dark turtle child.

At the first stir of yang, in the dead of night,
The water clock runs long.
As the yang struggles to rise, rely on the hexagram’s image to enter the Li trigram.
Thrice three, nine nines—the fire talisman proves true,
The elixir enters the belly, the heart cools of itself.

The gentle lead cauldron,
Light piercing the curtains.
The gentle lead cauldron enters the central source,
Placed in the Three Palaces to nourish the auspicious lotus.
Once the lotus blooms, the sacred principle is naturally understood,
Divine radiance step by step illuminates the immortals.

Creation races on, Dragon and Tiger unite.
The seven-return furnace fears only delay;
When the elixir is forged, one knows it of oneself.
Seizing the true workings of heaven and earth,
In the twelve hours, it is but a single moment.
The work of advancing the fire is perilous as combat.

The work of advancing the fire has its season,
Within the cauldron, the elixir’s snowflakes fly.
If one asks what craft I pursue,
I drink from the Nine Bends River’s jade-green pool.
By the winding river, the moon’s glow is clear and cold,
A crow takes flight.

The golden crow flies into the azure depths,
From the sea’s bottom, the wooden dragon is seized,
A night-shining pearl is grasped,
Its five-colored radiance illuminating the immortal palace.

Then one drinks the *daogui* of one’s own accord—
The *daogui* enters the belly, ghosts and spirits tremble.
Sitting alone in a quiet chamber, the room fills with light.
No longer drawn to the underworld’s ghostly allure,
One’s heart is set on hanging one’s name among the immortals.

Yet who would believe,
A child is nurtured from nothingness?
One’s own child is reared,
Neither cold nor hot, never hungry.
Then a pair—son and daughter—are raised,
Kept secret from all others.

Discern the water’s source, clear or turbid,
Wood and metal inquire of separation.
Wood and metal stand apart at the four directions,
Yet the center sees through the Five Phases whole.
To resolve it, seek only ancestor and origin,
Understanding yin and yang before and after noon.

Without a teacher’s guidance,
This matter is hard to know.
For long life, one must bow to a master’s transmission,
Grasping the heavenly mechanism is not difficult.
Mouth to mouth, passed down without written word,
Only those with prior affinity gain the enlightened master’s teaching.

The Dao is subtle and profound,
The heavenly mechanism deep and distant—
Begin swiftly, do not delay too long.

The Penglai path,
Rely on three thousand deeds fulfilled,
Alone step into the clouds and return.
The wondrous revelation of the Returned Elixir concludes *The Hidden Collection*.
