**Ten Eulogies from the Jade Flask**

The chamber is where the Green Dragon meets the White Tiger,
The sun is the Vermilion Bird, the moon the Dark Warrior.
To know the great medicine and establish the primordial foundation,
One must obtain the central soil of wu and ji.

The Green Dragon originally dwells in the cinnabar abode,
The White Tiger fundamentally returns to the guest of black metal.
Ancient immortals named it the essence of the divine dragon,
While Huainan called it autumn stone.

Divine water has always been the spirit of mercury,
The eastern Wood virtue heralds the spring of yang.
Coming from the south, it is the master within fire—
Scholars seek it to align with the true.

Dragon and Tiger meet within the mother’s womb,
The two essences unite, scattering blossoms in disarray.
Focus the mind to follow the initial yang’s rise,
At nine, you will know the Way self-catalyzes.

Yang reaches its peak, yin arises in the jia-wu hour,
Ji discards the six trigrams to enter the Qian palace.
The immortals’ wondrous art has long existed,
Yet people of this age remain deluded by the Dao’s winds.

Cinnabar is born of metal, mercury resides in lead—
The immortals forbid transmission to the vulgar.
Though I dare not speak of the reverted elixir’s art,
I fear the celestial tally will hold me accountable for past transgressions.

The two qi ceaselessly advance and retreat,
Yin and yang interact as if spiritually endowed.
Not only do they transform things and alter base substances,
But they can dispel a thousand calamities and ten thousand spirits.

From ancient times to the present, the matter is lamentable—
Time shifts and transforms, changing the years.
Those lost on the path wander endlessly,
Unknowing what to use to cultivate the yellow sprout.

In the tenth month, frost flies and snow thickens,
The yellow sprout ripens within, its color radiant.
For those who cultivate the true, seeing the yellow sprout mature,
How could they not revere the Golden Tiger and Dragon?

Ingesting it like sesame seeds, the true qi purifies,
Congealing stillness and calming the mind at will.
Not only does it transform and rescue the destitute,
From this, one attains longevity and avoids death.

**Qingxiazi’s Eulogy on the *Golden and Azure Dragon-Tiger Scripture***

The Golden and Azure Dragon-Tiger’s stem and face,
Though named, their form and body remain elusive.
The Tiger hides within the Dragon’s palace,
The Dragon moves while the Tiger embraces its trace.

Seeking one is not amiss,
Yet two are difficult to fathom.
Only when one attains unity,
Do nature and temperament never leave the body.

---

**The True Crucible**

To refine the elixir, first cultivate the true crucible—
Only when the work is complete will one become divine.
Common things do not enrich,
For they entirely deviate from yin and yang.

Harmonious union resembles a single qi,
Yet how can names be both alike and different?
The paths of south and north diverge,
Yet in obscurity, they form one family.

**Eulogy on Wei Boyang’s *Cantong qi***

Wei Jun’s three fascicles of the *Cantong qi*,
Within them, every word is a true principle.
It meticulously describes the reverted elixir—
The matter of the reverted elixir is not difficult.

What does its regulation resemble?
Yellow and white like a chicken’s egg.
Within this small matter,
The laws of Qian and Kun are mirrored.

---

**Clarifying Water and Fire**

Water and fire have always been the pivot,
In one direction, the king slays many.
True water and true yang,
From one source, difficult to alter.

One must thoroughly investigate the mysterious principle,
The character *yi*’s form should be thus:
Sun and moon do not abandon each other,
Kan and Li exchange positions.

---

**Clarifying the Fire Timing**

After the first yang arises, it becomes spring and summer,
When the first yin arrives, it turns to the hexagrams of autumn and winter.
When yang qi ascends,
Yin clouds darkly descend.

One must attentively listen to the water clock,
Lest it deviate from the constant rule.
The power of creation lies in the hand,
The body becomes a guest within the flask.

---

**Clarifying the Supreme Medicine**

Every household possesses the medicine of longevity,
Yet all people err in its acquisition.
Qi and timing seem to float and sink—
Where does one seek it?

Even when seen with the eyes, it remains unrecognized,
Handed over, it leaves no trace.
The great Dao is not a verbose discourse—
The gate of the Green Dragon and White Tiger.

**Song of the Inner Elixir by Lord Rongcheng**

Beneath the *shiqing*, the moon and the sun,
The *shiqing* is primordial qi; the moon belongs to yin, symbolizing the lower elixir field,
The sun belongs to yang, symbolizing the middle elixir field.
How do the two halves ascend and merge into one?

The azure qi, primordial qi, and fluids,
The three combine into one, forming the pearl.
Emerging from that jade pool to enter the golden chamber—
The jade pool is the mouth, the golden chamber the womb.
Fluids and qi, both within the qi sea,
Coalesce into a pearl, like an orange, golden in hue.

Large as a pellet, yellow as an orange—
The womb forms due to qi, the qi forms the pearl due to the womb.
Within it lies a fine flavor, sweet as honey—
Once the womb-qi forms the pearl like an orange,
Within the qi sea, each time one ingests qi,
Visualizing the qi enveloping the pearl,
One sees it, and the mouth’s jade pool naturally becomes sweet as honey.

Guard it well once obtained, never lose it—
Once the womb forms the pearl, beware of speaking of it to the uninitiated.
If one engages in intercourse with women, this mysterious pearl shatters,
Never to form again!

If one carefully cultivates it, the immortal Dao is complete—
Essence and qi unite, called the inner reverted elixir.
The fluids ascend and descend, irrigating the cinnabar field above the head,
Where the nine palaces reside—this is the nine-fold refined eight-jade elixir.
After nine years of cultivating qi, the work is complete, and the great Dao is achieved,
Equal to heaven and earth.

Essence becomes jade, qi becomes gold,
The primordial belongs to the mysterious pearl.
Envelop the mysterious pearl in white qi and enter the golden chamber—
The golden chamber is the lung, the womb,
The qi sea stores the three—the heart.
The great number is three.

**Cao Shengtu’s Song of Lead and Mercury**

Gold has a single body,
Its movement follows south and north.
Though a few know its tune,
All dwell beside Penglai’s shore.

In the vast sea, none encounter it,
And those who do fail to recognize it.
The sun, moon, and five stars,
All become wandering clouds.

If a humble man seeks longevity,
He will surpass the three sighs.
His aspiration lies in transmitting a single qi,
Transforming it into golden liquid.

Golden liquid connects to the immortals—
One must seek it within the five phases.
The five phases exist everywhere,
Yet the immortals do not hoard them.

To recognize true lead and mercury,
One water returns to one stone.
The central palace first serves as the master,
Water and fire unite to form the substance.

The two poles become husband and wife,
Husband and wife pair as counterparts.
For a hundred moments, reach the Li palace—
Cinnabar emerges from this.

It resembles a true pearl,
Cinnabar is not inherently red.
When it meets water, it returns to water’s nature;
When it meets fire, it becomes golden liquid.

The Great Sages each possess numinous medicines,
The Perfected call them "Precious Guardians."
Yet when the world’s scholars are asked,
They speak only of metals and minerals—
Metals and minerals are stubborn things,
How could they transform into golden liquid?

Shed the fetal husk, cast off the dark halo,
For the dark halo is but lead’s essence.
Primal qi replenishes primal qi—
How could vulgar cinnabar or stone suffice?

Realgar need not be dearly bought,
Cinnabar need not be sought,
Mercury vainly boasts of itself—
Yet who has ever truly attained it?

When bamboo splits, mend it with bamboo;
When wood breaks, graft it with wood.
For humans, beyond replenishing qi,
All other things are but guests.

If one can fathom water and fire,
Their name will surely enter the immortals’ register.
Lead and mercury bear many names,
Yet their root lies in the five phases.
Should one master the art of refinement,
Ingesting the elixir grants longevity.

Thus concludes the discourse of the Perfected on the secrets of Returning Cinnabar.
