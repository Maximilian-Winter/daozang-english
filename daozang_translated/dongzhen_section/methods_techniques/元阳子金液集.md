---

True yin and true yang are the true Dao,
Yet they lie before your eyes—why seek them afar?
The common crowd year after year burns and refines the Reverted Cinnabar,
And when they glimpse blue or yellow, they claim their elixir is fine.

**True yin** refers to the north’s *ren* and *gui* waters, the origin of the Five Phases. The Lord of Yin states: "The true qi of the north becomes the River Chariot; the east’s *jia* and *yi* generate golden sand." This single substance is the root of the Five Phases. The oral formula says: "In the north there is water; within the water lies metal. When the metal first takes form, it is called the metal of *geng* and *xin*, and its trigram belongs to *Kan*."

**True yang** is the Fire Star of the south. Born from *jia* and *yi*, it resides in *bing* and *ding*. The Fire Driller could kindle its light, transforming the raw into the cooked—this is called the essence of the Great Yang, and its trigram belongs to *Li*, containing cinnabar and mercury. The people of this age cannot comprehend it. Failing to grasp its principle, they take miscellaneous substances—even cinnabar and mercury—and refine them into a supreme medicine. When they suddenly see blue or yellow hues, they declare their elixir excellent.

A person of resolve must adhere to the method and model,
Lest they waste their spirit and mind—strive to perceive the Dao.
If only they knew to seek the true Yellow Sprout,
One who partakes of it shall live without aging.

**Annotation:** A person of resolve must understand the rules and follow them, for these rules are the mechanism of Heaven and Earth. The movement of the celestial patterns, the progression and retreat of the fire times—all must align like linked pearls or joined jades, now gathering, now dispersing, flowing in and out, threading through inner and outer, perfectly attuned without the slightest error. Timing the measurements precisely yields the supreme medicine. As the ancient formula says: "Failure lies in withdrawal and addition; success lies in receiving the radiance."

When the supreme treasure is attained, it is called the true Yellow Sprout. It is not crafted from several substances but is formed from the essence of Heaven and Earth, the subtle and wondrous qi congealed. Few can comprehend this, hence the admonition: "Lest they waste their spirit and mind—strive to perceive the Dao." The Yellow Sprout is not the same as worldly lead; vain effort and toil yield no result. Wasted time turns hair white—where then to seek the leisurely Red Pine?

The Yellow Sprout is not the black lead or yellow cinnabar of the world, refined through burning. It emerges from within the Great Yang, born of emptiness and nothingness, returning to the Central Palace, the position of the Yellow Emperor. As the *Daodejing* says: "Its form is like dust on a bright window." Thus, it is not a thing possessed by common households; only Huainanzi and Red Pine knew of it. Red Pine is none other than the Prince of Huainan. The formula states: "The Prince of Huainan refined autumn stone, summoned the Yellow Emperor, and praised the golden flower—there is no other Way." If a person of resolve does not know this true formula, they will vainly spend their life with white hair.

Therefore, one must receive it from a master of the body, for the master is the oral formula. The divine water and flowery pond are rare in the world, their transmission forbidden to the vulgar. Yet they are likened to worldly lead and mercury to prevent doubt. The divine water and flowery pond emerge from within the Great Yang, the essence of fire, gathered and used by immortals, called divine water and flowery pond. Its essence congeals white, like horse-tooth niter, before being subdued by fire. After refinement, it is called the golden liquid flowery pond, named true lead, also called White Tiger. Once refined, mercury loses its black color.

If one wishes to halt the fire, the response lies within a foot’s reach. This is an oral formula, difficult to transmit in writing. Immortals take black lead and mercury, extracting a divine talisman resembling white snow, to prevent doubt. But using black lead and mercury is not the true method. Even if one encounters a perfected person and follows them all day, if their nature does not align with the supreme Way, the secret formula of defense will never be transmitted. It is only that the person’s root nature does not harmonize with the supreme Way. Yet the sages do not wish to sever its transmission for later generations, so only one person is passed it every three or two hundred years.

Those who study the Way must broadly cultivate hidden virtue, revering their Daoist master as they would their parents, unwavering from beginning to end, sparing no effort. Only then may they receive transmission. As the *Cantong Qi* says: "To have only the name of loving the Way without the resolve to refine the elixir, to harbor great resentment over minor faults—such a person is far from the Dao."

The Green Dragon pursues the Tiger, the Tiger follows the Dragon; the Red Bird meets in harmonious song. Regulating qi and moving fire, they follow the Palace of Li; cinnabar enters the belly, and the body ascends of itself. The Green Dragon is wood, positioned in the Eastern Palace of Jia and Yi, governed by the trigram Zhen, containing within it the qi of Li, the essence of the Great Yang, the will of the Red Bird. Its nature is fierce and swift; the sages call it mercury. The White Tiger is the metal spirit of the West, positioned above Geng and Xin, governed by the trigram Dui. This metal has no form or substance; it is born in the northern waters of Ren and Gui. After forging and refinement, it forever loses its black color, named White Tiger, also called golden liquid. This substance can overcome the wood of Jia and Yi in the East. When the two natures clash, there is a sound like thunder, startling the senses, with stars and radiance flowing. At this moment, they naturally unite, their bodies like crystal.

Before their union, its color is congealed white. After consuming the essence of wood, its color transforms into that of Jia and Yi—the Green Dragon. Regulating qi and moving fire, they rise from the Palace of Li. From the first yang line of the hexagram Fu, they proceed in sequence, cycling endlessly, like linked pearls or joined jades, now gathering, now dispersing, threading through inner and outer without fixed abode. If the movement and timing err, retreat and do not proceed; regardless of years or months, it will never succeed. As the *Cantong Qi* says: "On the third day, the moon emerges at Geng, shaped like a hook. On the eighth day, the upper arc is level as a string. On the fifteenth day, the Qian body is complete. On the sixteenth day, it begins to wane. By the twenty-third day, it is the lower arc. By the twenty-seventh day, it vanishes—this is called extinction." These numbers are part of the oral formula.

When the Great Yang first rises over Peach Mountain in the Eastern Capital, it corresponds to the You hour in the Central Kingdom, when the cock’s crow ceases. Only the Xu, Hai, and Zi hours are the places of silence. Common people hear only a few sounds but do not discern the three-hour principle. If one understands the method of the cock’s crow, even the Milky Way will be a companion. When the moon first appears, it shines for only twenty-four days, with three days of dimness before and after. Those who study the Way but do not know this essential point will vainly expend their life’s utmost effort, lost beyond knowing.

The profound meaning of the Five Phases is hard to grasp; Dragon and Tiger lie hidden in Kan and Li. Though the arts of returning elixir number in the hundreds, the most wondrous requires the golden flowery pond. The Five Phases are metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. The Dragon is hidden in the Palace of Kan and Li. The Li trigram has two yang lines and one yin, its inner emptiness receiving the Dragon. The Dragon is fire, fire is mercury, named the Maiden. Upon seeing the White Tiger, she immediately conceives; after ten months, they naturally give birth, white metal born in water.

The Kan trigram has two yin lines and one yang; metal lies hidden in water, its form unseen. There is only one method to extract it, called true lead. This is the dual nature of water and fire, the yin and yang, with nothing else involved. As the *Yinfu Jing* says: "Though the methods of golden elixir number in the hundreds, the key lies in the formula of divine water and flowery pond."

When the Li Dragon flickers and sparks with golden stars, its profound radiance harbors the essence of supreme refinement. It responds to the four seasons, giving life to all things, and when its work spans three years, it preserves and extends life. Melting azure waters into soaring clouds, fire refines golden blossoms, blending qi into purity. Once the Flowery Pond is refined and the Tiger appears, the cyclical nodes advance and retreat, transforming into light yellow.

Such is the secret—fully revealed.

Cinnabar’s position is not inherently red; arranged through the four seasons, it resides in the southern abode. The flowing pearl’s nature has no fixed dwelling; if one recognizes its origin, it resembles autumn stone. Cinnabar here refers solely to white metal, not red, its position aligned with the south. The flowing pearl is quicksilver. Its nature is fierce and swift, requiring autumn stone to restrain it before it can be stabilized. Autumn stone’s flavor encompasses bitter, pungent, sour, sweet, and salty—the five tastes complete, its qi sufficient to manifest the five colors. An ancient song says:

*A single substance bears five hues,*
*Forever the immortal’s reward.*

The true qi of solar essence and lunar brilliance, conceiving and nurturing the child, is divinely wondrous. When transformation nears its end, you shall witness it yourself—clearly transmuting into bright window dust.

Solar essence is the essence of the great yang, born in wood and transformed by fire into earth. Earth is fire’s child, hence the Five Phases’ fire. Fire transformed into earth becomes the supreme medicine, known only to sages. Lunar brilliance is white metal, called the Jade Hare, born in water. The secret says:

*Lunar brilliance belongs to Kan, moving through emptiness,*
*When water nourishes it, the essence is attained.*
*Its refined qi enables transformations,*
*Resonating with the primordial substance, timely and efficacious.*
*Frost flies, the gorge gleams, congealing like snow,*
*The pristine body solidifies, its form like the night’s stars.*
*If true yin is refined and the Tiger appears,*
*The Wood Dragon harmonizes, their affinity profound.*

This speaks of white metal as the crucible’s qi, the waxing and waning of the two arcs. On the eighth day, the waxing crescent holds half a catty of metal, aligned with *ding*. By the fifteenth day, the *qian* body is complete, the three and five forming a perfect radiance. On the twenty-third day, the waning crescent holds half a catty of water, totaling sixteen ounces, each ounce twenty-four *zhu*, amounting to three hundred eighty-four *zhu*—corresponding to the three hundred eighty-four lines of the sixty-four hexagrams, each *zhu* matching a line. A year has three hundred sixty days, with twenty-four solar terms, aligning with heaven’s great numbers, called the celestial tally.

The crucible corresponds to the waxing and waning arcs, embodying *qian* and *kun*, giving birth to all things. The *Yinfu Jing* says: *"There exists a wondrous vessel, its qi explored to form the crucible, from which all phenomena arise."* The *Jinbi Jing* states: *"The divine chamber is the pivot of the elixir, not the world’s base metals."* When the elixir is complete, it resembles bright window dust. Ingested, it permeates the three cinnabar fields. Thus it is said: *"The Yellow Emperor obtained it, first fortifying the three palaces, then governing the myriad states."* Since ancient times, sages who consumed this medicine attained the Dao and longevity—no other medicine exists. Those of aspiration should practice accordingly.

Do not rely on the lead-mercury school;
The golden elixir’s secret is unknown even to sages.
Do not mistake worldly lead and mercury,
Debating fire times in vain contention.

Lead is the water of the north, the beginning of the Five Phases, its number one, its color black. The secret says:

*The essence of the Black Emperor of the north,*
*A formless body in constant flux.*
*If it encounters the Three Households’ substance,*
*The Maiden is instantly startled.*

This substance is true mercury. Lead is born in water, aligned with the *li* qi. The *Qiantong Jue* states: *"Metal does not reveal its form; mercury does not display its talent."* The sage’s secret method models the mysterious and profound qi, refining its wondrous essence into the medicine for eternal life. The unknowing refer to autumn stone—also called white metal. It flows and glides, thus it is no ordinary substance, not crafted from worldly materials. Those of aspiration, when refining the supreme medicine, should not use cinnabar or mercury—this is the most refined and wondrous method. It speaks solely of white metal, retaining the mysterious and profound qi. White metal and mercury are the sage’s true secret.

Heaven-born dual substances correspond to emptiness,
Serving as wife, child, and husband.
The gate of three and five is only sun and moon,
Dividing *mao* and *you* as their initial seats.

The heaven-born dual substances are yin and yang qi. The sage, through method and fire timing, names them the fire-seeker’s aliases. The subtle and wondrous qi solidifies into the supreme medicine—the essence of sun and moon. The sun is the husband, the moon the wife, the medicine the child, the child being the essence of sun and moon. Consuming this essence, one’s years equal the sun and moon. Three and five are the numbers of earth and wood. Three is wood, five is earth. Wood contains fire, fire transforms into earth—this is the supreme medicine. Ingested in the central palace, it distinguishes *mao* and *you*. *Mao* is the east’s *jia* and *yi*, its position in *bing* and *ding*. *You* is the west’s *geng* and *xin*, metal in water; after refinement, its color congeals as white, and it can consume wood’s essence, thus metal overcomes wood. The initial seat begins with the *fu* hexagram, the yang line first arising, its movement reaching the *li* palace, then vanishing in the *kan* palace. The great yang first emerges at Fusang, ascending to the *dui* palace, then setting in the west. The yang line gradually wanes, the yin line flourishes—this is called extinction. These principles are difficult to expound; since ancient times, not one Daoist practitioner has understood them. The key lies in oral transmission, hard to convey in writing—called the celestial tally, the spirit of great destruction.

The supreme medicine, nurtured by heaven’s natural endowment, forms a body from harmonious qi. Wealth and nobility arise from embracing the five colors; the heart knows lead and mercury unite as kin. The supreme medicine is harmonious qi. Nurturing metal with mercury, the existent merges with the nonexistent. One and none together are called the Dao. The existent is the Tiger; the nonexistent is the Dragon.

Master Tao states: Those who refine emptiness progress to refining cinnabar; those who refine cinnabar unite with the supreme Dao. An ancient formula says: *"A single thing bears five hues— / Forever the immortal’s fortune."* This speaks only of this one substance, white metal. When cultivated, it displays five colors, its radiance dazzling the eye. Through forging and refinement, its precious nature becomes manifest.

Master Tao, in refining treasures and discerning treasures, is called a Perfected One when the worthy attain the Dao. *"Heaven and Earth do not permit mutual avoidance— / The resolute know their place in the cosmos."* After ten months, mother and child separate; how could the worthy ever force the circulation of qi?

Heaven and Earth are the upper and lower crucibles. The lid symbolizes Heaven, holding half a catty of metal; the base symbolizes Earth, with its measure of three and five. Three hundred eighty-four grains make one catty—this is called Heaven and Earth. When Heaven is blocked and Earth sealed, water and fire arise spontaneously, and spirit-essence appears—no disorder or loss may occur. When the ten months are complete, the form naturally takes shape; how could one ever force the movement of qi? Once the medicine is perfected and the body formed, it enters the great *geng* crucible, circling the Red Crow for three years—then the Dao is fulfilled. Those who partake of it share the lifespan of Heaven and Earth.

The profound and obscure cannot be distinguished; the gate of lead and mercury is difficult to reveal. The world does not comprehend its origin—examine the utmost conduct, and it will naturally appear. The profound and obscure are the medicine’s fundamental nature. Though its names are myriad, the Dao practitioner must not mistake true and false. The gate of lead and mercury cannot be spoken of in terms of its origin. The Dao student must deeply grasp yin and yang, carefully observe the five phases—then the truth will naturally become clear.

When the resolute transmit this teaching, even father and son may not meet. Even if one finds the right person, they may not embody its truth—it cannot be sought through mere intention. Though some study the Dao, they only delight in smelting gold and refining silver, never seeking the Way of abiding in the world and attaining longevity. Some say this Way is utterly unknown. Such intentions are far from the truth.

*"The infant, vacant and unknowable— / In vain one wearies the spirit, suffering in delusion."* Only by comprehending the sage’s words does the luminous path to Heaven become clear. The deluded, clinging to their own ways, employ other substances in vain pursuit of the supreme Dao. Regardless of years spent, they never succeed, exhausting their spirits until their hair turns white. But if one grasps the words of the Perfected, follows the guiding principle, and refines the medicine to completion, ascending to Heaven is no difficulty.

Three and four dwell together in one chamber; one and two form a wedded pair. Only with a worthy matchmaker may they unite, their bond deepening through mutual exchange. Three is the spirit of Wood; four is the spirit of Metal. These two become husband and wife—mercury enters metal, dwelling together in one chamber, requiring a worthy matchmaker. That matchmaker is the fire spirit of the southern *bing* and *ding*. Without this essential knowledge, one labors in vain.

Floating and sinking, indistinct and elusive—how can the deluded discern its nature? They wait in vain, their years stretching far.

To know when the numinous medicine will be complete, the yang number must culminate in nine revolutions. Gold sinks and stone floats—common folk do not understand this, and the deluded find it even harder to approach.

When refined through nine revolutions, the number of utmost yang, it radiates crimson and violet, called the Great Return Elixir. Is this not effortless? The celestial mechanism unfolds, and one becomes deathless.

The obscure interplay of yin and yang defies comprehension; the Azure Dragon and White Tiger contend with one another. As the year draws to a close, their transformations unfold— the White Tiger subdues the Dragon, and the Dragon gradually wanes.

The Way of yin and yang is difficult to fathom at its source. If one trusts in a hundred methods, one will achieve nothing in the end. When Dragon and Tiger are formed, they consume one another. The White Tiger restrains the Dragon, and they engage in mutual struggle. The mercury seeks to flee, but is bound by water, unable to escape—thus it becomes the supreme treasure.

Heaven, the father, and Earth, the venerable mother— the Vermilion Bird of the South and the Dark Warrior of the North. As the year ends and time passes, all become earth. Where then shall one seek the Dragon and Tiger?

Heaven is the father, Earth the mother—this signifies that the white metal serves as the crucible. The Vermilion Bird of the South is the fire spirit, known as lead. When the refining is complete, all return to earth—this is the principle of the Dragon and Tiger’s respiration.

Three unite in righteous harmony as one clan, constantly drinking the radiance of the sun and moon within. Once the Three Flowers have passed and the gold reliquefies, nine revolutions require the work of years.

The "three persons" are water, fire, and metal. Their ancestral origin is the sun, the essence of great yang, and the moon, the essence of the Jade Hare. They come and go, illuminating within, leaving their essence in the crucible, transforming and returning to the chamber of Earth.

The Three Flowers is another name for fire; when it encounters the liquid gold, it must not be grasped. As the two unite and the years pass, the elixir is surely completed.

The Azure Dragon’s true nature resides in the Eastern Palace, paired with Heaven and Earth in the Thunder position. Once the White Tiger appears from this union, how could the flowing pearl refuse to follow?

The Azure Dragon is the east, *jia* and *yi*, dwelling in the Thunder Palace. Its number is three, its color azure, ruling the third month of spring. It is the yang qi of mercury, capable of spreading branches and flourishing. As heavenly qi descends and earthly qi ascends, within the Wood Palace lies its father—this is called the Azure Dragon.

The White Tiger is the spirit of the Seven Killings, able to overcome Wood. The Wood Dragon seeks to flee but is restrained by Metal and cannot escape. The Wood Dragon is true mercury. As soon as the fire qi stirs, it is gradually gathered and returned to its original palace—hence it is called the Returned Elixir. This is the principle of Metal and Wood’s mutual return.

When Dragon and Tiger are refined through five revolutions, the fragrance of chrysanthemums gradually arises in the furnace. Now is the proper time for refinement—do not regret the passing years.

In cultivating the Great Elixir, one’s will must be steadfast as a mountain valley. One abandons grain and ceases cooking, devoting oneself day and night with single-minded focus, timing each moment without error. One disregards gain and loss, hoping only for the elixir’s completion. When auspicious signs appear at the furnace, the fragrance is like that of chrysanthemums.

To recognize cinnabar as the essence of Wood, move it to the western position to join with Metal. Where shall ordinary people seek its traces? Within the indistinct and elusive, in the profound and obscure.

Cinnabar is originally the essence of Wood, its essence being the departure from darkness—thus it is called mercury. Vaguely indistinct, within it lies substance. Profoundly obscure, within it lies essence. This principle is profound and difficult to fathom at its root.

Those who awaken are like one who retraces their steps from a fork in the road, while those lost on the path find it arduous to seek the way. The three unite in operation from a single origin—how could their true nature ever depart from their ancestral source?

Awakening is not difficult, but the lost path is not easily found. The "three persons" are water, fire, and metal—affairs of a single origin, known only to the sage.

One person exists, and one does not—Metal Lord is the wife, and Wood is the husband. The profound mystery is unfathomable; how could a determined scholar ever dare to speak of diagrams?

The "one who exists" is Metal Lord; the "one who does not" is the Azure Dragon. This principle is so profound that it cannot be conveyed through diagrams. Those who study this must be diligent and steadfast, forgetting hunger and weariness, sparing no effort, and carefully heeding the master’s instructions.

Even if one encounters a perfected being and discusses it all day, if one’s own root-nature does not resonate with the supreme Way, how can one succeed? Before attaining the supreme Way, even determined scholars feel utterly lost. Once attained, finding someone to transmit it to is rarer than one in ten thousand.

Those who have mastered it must not conceal the great Way. Later learners, puffed up with arrogance, seek only silver to benefit the world and never pursue the medicine that sustains life. Such people are truly pitiable, wasting their lives in vain.

Some say this Way does not exist, but this is because their vital qi is not pure, and perverse qi mingles with it—thus they remain distant from the Way.

These thirty verses are resplendent in every line, each word revealing principle. Though I, in my foolishness, have annotated the text, the matter remains one and the same in its essence. It teaches people not to use mercury, cinnabar, or the five metals with tangible form in cultivating the supreme Way. The root of the supreme medicine is not among the few things of this world.

Later learners must carefully examine this matter. If they do not depart from its imagery, they may yet be loyal ministers and filial children. Those who do not seek the true are truly to be pitied.

The profound heavens vast and boundless pair with the yellow earth; male essence harmonizes and unites in the same chamber. The white liquid in the furnace transforms with the moon—those who ingest it become pure of heart and cool within.

Heaven and earth, profound and yellow, are the two qi of yin and yang. Male essence is mercury; white liquid is metal. United in one place, they become the yellow and white, resembling the form of a chicken. Placed in the crucible and refined, they then change color and become the elixir. Those who consume it can slay the Three Corpses, expel the Nine Worms, and remain free from affliction—such a one is called a true person.

Who can determine the origin of Metal and Wood’s mutual harm? The Five Phases return and connect of their own accord.

In the world, all conceal the white of yin-fire—
who can recognize the lead of yellow sprouts?
Metal can overcome Wood, yet fire lies hidden within Wood;
fire can dissolve Metal—
the Five Phases reverse and yet complete one another.

From *zi* to *wu* is mutual generation;
from *wu* to *xu* is mutual conquest.
Such cycles of connection and reversal
are contained in the oral transmission of the formula.

In the world, lead and mercury do not depend on each other—
the resolute know they reside in *kan* and *li*.
The wise conceal what others cannot see;
Huainan’s secrets were refined in the Flowery Pond.

When the world asks of lead and mercury,
they lie hidden in the viscera, unclassified—
those who ingest them pass with the dregs,
never entering the Flowery Pond of the cinnabar field.
This Flowery Pond is the divine water.

Within the formula, the Flowery Pond is white metal;
the method is not recorded in medical texts—it resides in the heart.
Bathing requires transmission; no other method exists—
the yang number returns, transformed into yin.

The golden body is mercury,
yet not in the form of mercury.
To refine the medicine, one must master the formula;
without a teacher, do not attempt the furnace.

If the method of divine water is not transmitted,
year after year, it flies away.
When the ninefold elixir nears completion as the year ends,
opening the furnace, one suddenly sees the red blossom of the medicine.

Water and fire transform together into earth—
where then can mortals seek the Golden Lord?
When the yang number is fulfilled and the furnace is opened,
it resembles the morning glow, its color crimson-yellow,
returning to the Central Palace—
the two substances, water and fire, both become earth.

Lead and mercury, passed down through the ages, are rare;
cinnabar of jade-like quality, clad in snow.
Vague and indistinct, it dwells within your own house—
day after day, you look yet do not see.

Cinnabar-mercury is not red;
the ancients spoke only of white cinnabar,
also called "white horse-tooth cinnabar"—
only the true Metal of the West is genuine.

When the returning elixir enters the mouth, the body becomes light;
it dissolves long-standing illness and expels demonic essence.
From this point, desire and attachment no longer cling—
it transforms the foolish, severing worldly passions.

When the supreme elixir enters the mouth,
the Three Corpses die at once,
leaving one free from contamination—
such a one is called a true person.

Who awakens to the numinous elixir transcending worldly dust,
where the Three Flowers converge and consort with the Dragon?
Behold those who have refined elixirs before and after—
thousands, even tens of thousands, have been led astray.

The Three Flowers are fire.
If one can harmonize and direct them,
the Azure Dragon arises of itself.

The Five Phases inverted in defense—
the Dragon emerges from within fire.
The Five Phases not proceeding in order—
the Tiger is born from within water.

Cast silver into water, pour water into silver—
it is both water and silver.

The *Gold Fluid* of Yuan Yangzi is now complete.
