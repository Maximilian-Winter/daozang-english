*Record of Wandering to Immortal Rock*
*By Bai Yuchan of Hainan*

Yellow leaves drift like clouds; fresh geese inscribe the sky. Garden orchids shatter jade; fence chrysanthemums forge gold.

A traveler arrived from Qiongzhou—hair unbound, beard flowing, face weathered, feet bare. His body was clad in coarse hemp, his scriptures half-exposed from their wrappings. A staff slung across his shoulder, his qi transcended the dust. He sought the Three Flowers of Upper Clarity, paying homage to Master Yun Gu at dusk.

Bamboo sealed the emerald mist; eaves bells summoned the wind. A lamp glowed faintly red; nesting magpies called their young. The guest loosened his heart, drinking from waterfalls and consuming lingzhi. At midnight, he took his pillow, lying down without dreams. At dawn, he leaned by the window, pursing his lips to sing:

*"On parasol branches, autumn winds rise;
Green waters merge with the sky, sky mirrors water.
A few crows dot the purple dusk hills;
The slanting sun’s shadow falls among reed flowers.
Bees end their court, frogs hold their market;
A staff rests on my shoulder as I sleep beneath peach mushrooms.
At daybreak, the moon’s trace fades—
Oh, when shall I find an extraordinary man
To roam Immortal Rock in freedom?"*

Master Yun Gu rose and sang in reply:

*"Wine just sobered, sleep just broken—
A guest’s long song echoes beyond jade screens.
I shall tune my voice to clarity, shake my jade collar,
Ride a single leaf on the wind, the azure pool clear.
Gathering the crisp qi of a thousand peaks and ten thousand gorges,
I return to recline high among pine lattices,
To forge a poetic pact with you."*

At dawn the next day, they moored a small willow boat beneath Carp Rock. Level fields spread in twilight; crows and egrets divided black and white. Jagged mountains unfolded; pines and bamboos sketched themselves in ink. Releasing the reins, they ascended Chicken Coop Stone—mountain blossoms dazzled the eyes; rock birds clamored in the ears. Wandering freely, they climbed Tianzhu Peak. The ancient temple stood with four bare walls; cypress seeds rustled in the deep hall. Crimson peaks touched the sky; green vines bridged the void. Gibbons howled at dusk; the moon hung over withered trees. Tigers roared in the clear night; wind howled through a thousand hollows. A sparse bell chimed into the cloud chamber. Holding a gourd, they sought the Cinnabar Well.

Seated on the dustless rock, they chanted a poem:

*"Atop the peak, a turtledove calls the morning rain;
Pale mist seals the path before the crag.
Last night, heavy dew dripped from cold pines;
Broken clouds, homeless, are torn by the wind."*

Staff in hand, sandals in order, they rode the wind, ready to depart. Here, Master Yun Gu bowed and spoke of the marvels of the elixir knife. The guest stroked the stone and sang:

*"In the crescent-moon furnace, crow and hare;
Within the cinnabar tripod, dragon and tiger.
Black mercury enters red lead—
In the red furnace, a single grain rounds."*

Master Yun Gu and the traveler from Qiongzhou then returned. Gibbons wailed in ancient ravines; cranes cried over tinkling springs. The watery realm had no boats; they dragged bamboo along the shore. A lone village where oxen slept; flowing water and white clouds—desolate as Mount Lu.

Later, Master Yun Gu returned to his former abode, but the guest had already wandered away. Thus, he recorded their journey.

**Record of Cloud Nest**

Wuyi Mountain is a grotto-heaven. Immortals may hide or appear. Long ago, Qian Keng consumed purple lingzhi here, mastering wind and qi. The divine maiden gathered yellow wood, summoning wind and commanding rain. Among the perfected like Zhang and Wei, thirteen men and women attained immortality. In some unknown year, on an autumn evening, the Jade Emperor feasted his descendants. After one cup, flutes and drums echoed in the void. Those present, clad in rainbow skirts and misty sleeves, had already become immortals.

Later generations spoke of Elixir-Refining Rock and Bone-Exchanging Rock—echoes of those bygone events. Legends tell of Daoist Li at Stop-Stop Hermitage, Li Iron Flute at Banner Peak Pavilion, and Li the Mirror-Polisher in Mao Bamboo Grotto—were they one Li or three? Below Ascension Cave lived Zhang Golden Toad; below Drum Cave, Zhang the Straw-Clad—one Zhang or two? Then there was Zhan of Drum Tower Rock, Ge of Spirit Rock, and the late Daoist Wu Huaiyu. All were seen in the mountains, now halting, now soaring on the wind, drifting on leaves across water. Crimson temples, green hair, steps swift as flight. Some shed their forms; some achieved liberation through the corpse. Some vanished; some remained. Those who longed for them could never speak with them.

Yet how startling—after a thousand years, immortal traces are few. Only green grass and white clouds endure. The cries of gibbons and cranes are too sorrowful to bear.

Then there was Master Chen of the Cinnabar Pivot. He abstained from grains, taking no sustenance. Though seventy or eighty, his eyes remained bright as lacquer, his hair black, his complexion youthful. No one knew his origins. All day, he sat in silent absorption, his waking and sleeping, laughter and speech unlike ordinary men. His only possession was a tattered sleeve. For a day, he lingered among the Five Bends, reciting Master Huiweng’s verse: *"The mountain is high, the clouds deep."* The misty rain over the level forest seemed as if from yesterday.

There, he felled bamboo and thatched reeds, building a hut. He named it *Cloud Nest*. Behind it rose the Great Hidden Screen; before it stood the Three Teachings Peak. To the left, Immortal’s Palm; to the right, Heavenly Pillar. Facing the Elixir Furnace Stone, resting against Iron Elephant Rock—shaped like dragons and tigers, wondrous indeed!

A hundred paces east reached Benevolence and Wisdom Hall; a hundred paces west, Immortal’s Journey Lodge. The pines were green, the bamboo emerald, the grass verdant. Cold gibbons called at dawn; azure mist curled. Tower crows hastened dusk; purple haze spread. Clouds flew like white blossoms; crows let fall their crisp cries. How much more the mountain’s blue, the water’s jade, the wind’s clarity, the moon’s whiteness—this land of no human traces.

If one asked a year of the world, it was but a day in this grotto. No exaggeration. Ah, true joy is enough! Fitting for the old man of the Cinnabar Pivot.

As for the hut becoming the man, the man the hut—merged with the streams and mountains, transformed with the wind and moon—there were matters of red simurghs and purple lips, blue crows and white cranes. The master knew them.

After *Cloud Nest* was thatched, on the fifteenth day of the ninth month in the *yihai* year of Jiading (1209), mist and rosy clouds lingered as of old.

**Record of the Hall of Lingering Sojourn**

Bai Yuchan thatched a hut on Wuyi Mountain. One morning, he felt the stirrings of lakes and seas. Staff in hand, sandals fluttering, he had not taken many steps when he turned back to his old hut—gibbons startled, cranes cried. After a few waves of his sleeves, he found himself already in Yanshan.

Encountering a Daoist in coarse robes, he led him back to the hall, following the old custom of burning cypress seeds in the hearth. Setting aside the tea bowls after battle, they spoke of the flavor of clouds and waters—so withered, so austere. They spoke, too, of the Way of learning: so arduous, so profound. Thereupon I said: "This place lies not far beyond eighty-four thousand miles, above which lies the capital of the Great Clarity, the Jasper Terrace and Cinnabar Mound, pearl forests and jade grottoes, precious blossoms and rare herbs, all resplendent to the eye. Exquisite birds and rare fowl fill the air with the music of *shao* and *hu*. There dwell a thousand long-robed, wide-sleeved immortals, their bodies light as goose down, who daily sport with blue simurghs and dance with white cranes. In a fleeting moment, they peer down upon the Five Defiled Worlds of suffering, where sentient beings spin through birth and death, death and birth, like ants on a millstone—unable to bear it, their noses grow sour with grief.

Thus they incarnate their spirits in the womb of dust, shape their forms within the realm of form. From swaddling to topknot, they never forget their former lives’ resolve to cultivate the true and nurture the primordial. Rousing fierce courage, mustering diligent effort, they cast off worldly garb and mar their appearances, seeking guidance among the followers of the Dao. Herein lies the beauty of their compassion for all beings.

Some wear filthy faces and pine-needle hair; others go barefoot with shorn temples. Some don crowns askew like *ruyi* wands; others don robes of serene simplicity. Some wear blue headscarves and paper jackets; others wield great swords or long zithers. Some carry single gourds or straw hats; others lean on ornate staffs and wear hempen sandals. They wander through villages, drift along country paths. The world’s people vie to gaze upon them, point at them with their fingers, elders tell the young, one neighbor informs another: *These are Daoists.*

Yet the Dao cannot be named or spoken; its vastness resides only in the human heart. Thus the ancients composed alchemical classics, then shaped them into songs and poems, treatises and dialogues—all to reveal the essence of the Golden Elixir, to serve as a bridge for later learners, guiding them toward the immortal throng. What is called lead, silver, mercury, cinnabar is but dragon and tiger, water and fire. What is called hare and crow, chamber and wall is but horse and ox, tortoise and snake. What is called husband and wife, male and female is but ruler and minister, parent and child. What is called *qian* and *kun*, *kan* and *li* is but heaven and earth, sun and moon. They are likened to Ding Gong and Yellow Hag, named as Infant and Crone, borrowed as yellow thatch and white snow—yet all reduce to the two words: *yin* and *yang*. Through gradual accumulation, one attains liberation from the corpse; through steady progress, one ascends in flight.

In essence: form and sleeve, body and mind, spirit and *qi*, nature and destiny—all are one principle. Boring through the Five Phases to gather the Five *Qi*, uniting the Three Essences to congeal the Three Flowers—such is the cultivation called the Elixir; such is the entry called the Dao. Thus the Daoist in heaven and earth is assuredly no ordinary being.

Alas! In years past, they hollowed earth to make huts, wove grass for nests. In cold, they sewed orchids; in hunger, they ate magic mushrooms. Dwelling in the forest, a few notes from an iron flute would unlock the boundless secrets of heaven and earth. Before ascending to the heavens, they nested their bodies and reduced their ambitions to ash, fearing only that idle fame might reach others’ ears, or that their strange forms might offend the eye. They forgot themselves among streams and mountains, fish and birds, merged with wind and moon, mist and rosy clouds. White clouds drifted endlessly; green grass spread lushly. Beneath towering pines and verdant bamboo, though they dared not hope for flesh to sprout wings, they at least aspired to sit for a thousand years, watching mulberry fields turn to seas, seas to mulberry fields—such were the Daoists.

Yet the world now suffers a degenerate age, its customs coarsened by the drumbeat of frivolity. Later generations, like fish and dragons, know only beans and wheat. Thus was built this abode of Lingering Clouds and Perching Cranes, to house such men, allowing them to recline in the forest of ropes, lounge on mushroom couches. Torrential rains and fierce winds cannot harm their bodies; freezing ice and piled snow cannot chill their frames. How fitting that body finds peace and the Dao flourishes!

Fortunately, within the palace gates there often appear extraordinary men, scholars with the hearts of great men and noble lords, who build halls to shelter these disciples, lend grain to feed them. Thus the essence of the Golden Elixir endures, its thread unbroken, generation after generation producing those who trumpet this Way.

The Daoist Hall of Yanshan has stood for ages. Zhou Daoming of Siming, a standout among gourd-and-hat wanderers, initiated its founding discourse. There were Huangfu Rubing and Ruqu, men of leisurely elegance who ardently admired purity and emptiness. Long had they harbored the intent to welcome immortals and greet transcendents, regretting only that a single hand cannot sound the bell. This sentiment resonated deeply with Zhou Daoming.

Carpenters wielded their axes, potters rolled up their sleeves, laborers and artisans worked in concert—all was swiftly accomplished. They named it *Lingering Clouds*. What delighted me most was that the Mysterious Net had revived, and the incense of the Wondrously Penetrating Old Man remained unextinguished. Upon inspection, the alchemical furnace stood in solitary splendor, the tea cauldron exuded carefree charm. There were rush cushions, leather mats, fresh *bo* boards, and plain walls—nothing strayed from ancient traditions. Morning and evening, congee was served in abundance; the fragrance of offerings lingered. Daoists gathered in quiet harmony, their headscarves and robes hung neatly on the walls.

Among those who split their forms to transform *qi*, who does not know the wonders of returning gold and mercury? Their comings and goings, their concealments and revelations—who can fathom them? Amidst poems and wine, they pluck a tune or two on the zither, dance three or four sword forms. Wild songs and rustic dances lead them homeward. Morning incense, evening lamps—all follows orderly discipline. Thus do the old men of rivers and lakes, the scholars of Chu and Yue, come in streams and settle in droves. Only then does Penglai’s Three Isles appear before one’s eyes, where feathered robes and rainbow skirts may be greeted face-to-face. Truly, the establishment of this Daoist hall is not in vain!

In former times, Prince Liu An of Han cultivated immortality; Prince Zhaoming of Liang pursued transcendence; Li Yuancao of Tang sought the Dao—all were extraordinary men from imperial clans. The master of this hall belongs to their lineage."

One day, perusing scriptures on Tiantai and refining the bones on Wuyi—all begins with today’s founding of this hall to gather scholars. The immortals of heaven, as spoken of before, manifest in the world as Daoist adepts, and so it is. Yet returning to the root and restoring the source, reverting to life’s origin—this alone does not suffice; there must be something extraordinary, rare in the world.

Why so? The fires of the elixir furnace burn bright; the crane of white clouds takes flight. Upon the head rests the *Yuling* crown of soaring jade; the body is clad in robes of *Baohua* black and white. Mounting the azure steed of the clouded midst, riding the rainbow phoenix of the celestial expanse, one ascends to the heavens’ zenith, pays homage to the Heavenly Emperor—at this moment, the immortal’s earthly mission is complete. Though not every seeker may attain the rank of Zhong or Lü, I suspect one or two among them shall.

If one possesses the discerning eye to encounter a youth with lacquer-black hair, who bears a *Boshan* censer and asks what path to pursue—such is the intent of this Daoist hall, such is the calling of the Daoist adept.

Written in joyful admiration to conclude this record.

On the second day after Rain Water in the *bingzi* year of Jiading, inscribed in haste by Juyin.

Within the Palace of Supreme Subtlety, the essence of the Star of Astral Legs transforms into the pine; the pine’s soul, the pine’s spirit—playing with the white dragon, soaring with the azure phoenix, lithe and luxuriant. Yet amid these, there dwells the Recluse of Seven Pines. The star of the Chamber Lodge in the Palace of Supreme Subtlety metamorphoses into the willow; the willow’s voice, the willow’s mystery—calling the golden oriole, entering the purple simurgh, trailing in gentle grace. Yet within the mist of light rain, there abides the Master of Five Willows. The ancients who concealed themselves among pines sought to manifest their lofty, unyielding integrity; those who hid among willows aimed to display their gentle, modest resolve. Yet who does not know that the Recluse of Seven Pines and the Master of Five Willows, such as these, endure in the annals of history, their names resounding through the ages? As for the orange—what manner of thing is it truly?

In Yangzhou, its boughs bear mandarins and pomelos; the tribute of Jiangling offers a thousand orange trees, their owners ranked with marquises of a thousand households—thus is the orange esteemed. The *Record of Local Customs* names the orange "barbarian citron"; the people of Ba speak of two elders concealed within an orange’s peel—thus is the orange deemed wondrous. The Xiang and Xiao rivers have their Orange Hamlets; Dongting Lake has its Orange Marsh; Yunmeng has its Orange Village; Pengze has its Orange Market—thus is the orange lauded. Lu Ji concealed oranges to present to his mother; Li Jing ate oranges and thought of his elder brother—thus may the orange embody filial piety and fraternal duty. Li Deyu composed the *Rhapsody on the Auspicious Orange*; Zhang Hua wrote the *Song of the Numinous Orange*—thus may the orange enter the realm of literature. Li Yuan had lines on "crimson fruit like hanging gold"; Shen Yue wrote of "golden raiment, not what I seek." In the sixth month of the ninth day, the Penglai Palace of the Tang bestowed oranges upon its ministers; on the first day of the first month, the E-pang Palace of Qin did the same. The abundance of oranges in Dan Lake, the profusion in Han Isle—who does not know the orange’s beauty is not easily obtained? Thus has it been recorded through the ages, for the orange is indeed a marvel.

Speak of the orange grove, and it is like stars scattered to the ends of the earth; behold its fruit, and it is like pearls strung upon the treetops. Its skin is thin, its segments plump; its fragrance delicate, its taste sweet. Liu Yuxi likened it to the "sweetness of *yu* and the coolness of *tuo* nectar"—how much more its blossoms resemble dragon’s spittle, its leaves duck’s topknots, its clusters like wax, its frost like jade? Thus did the Perfected Lü compare the Golden Elixir to a pellet "large as a pellet, its hue like the red orange."

Now I comprehend the orange in full. In the southeastern realm, upon the mountains of Wuyi, within the Cavern of Mysterious Transformation, at the Abbey of Divine Protection, the Hermitage of Serene Integrity—there dwells a Daoist. Chen Hongfan, styled Tianxi, with the Daoist name Rizaozhai, has, beyond his love of the qin and books, an eccentric fondness for oranges. He is passionately devoted to orange groves and has planted many. Yet I suspect what he truly cherishes is not the orange itself, but rather the Perfected Lü’s metaphor for the Golden Elixir. Thus, within his hall, the wind and moon reign; throughout his grove, mist and rain linger. From dawn’s chant to dusk’s libation, he dwells in carefree ease—within, he cultivates his inner power; without, he delights in his surroundings. In haste or upheaval, he ever holds fast to that single golden pellet of the Elixir, his resolve unwavering. Is it any wonder he has chosen this seclusion? Compared to the Recluse of Seven Pines and the Master of Five Willows, he is by no means their inferior.

His dwelling is named "Orange Hermitage." In broadening its meaning and illuminating its name, I do not err. Chen Tianxi’s bearing and demeanor are like autumn before the frost, like the first month of night, like the dawn-green of water, like the spring-blue of mountains. A single glimpse of his spirit is enough to evoke admiration. In his leisure, by the window’s lattice, his desk holds but a qin; he also tends to a sword—truly, it is the qin of Cangwu and the purple *xun*, the sword of Qingping and the red *jiang*. Often he burns tung resin to temper whale-glue, or binds rabbit’s fur to bamboo for brushes. For the most part, his gate is of pine, his walls bare; no vulgar visitor disturbs his solitude. Thus may he vie with the streams and mountains, the fish and birds, for tranquility; contend with the pines and bamboos, the mist and clouds, for purity of spirit and savor of life. This is why I so delight in Chen Tianxi’s intent.

One day, after playing his qin and singing a long ode, he raised his cup, then set it down, summoning Taohong and Maoying to beseech me for an essay—seeking to elucidate the meaning of "Orange Hermitage." Of old, the immortal of Mount Wei had a poem: *"Refining the Returned Elixir is bitter work— / I cannot bear to see sweet oranges."* The Old Man of Mount Qingcheng wrote: *"How many times have I mistakenly swallowed an orange, / Only to long to ascend the clouded heavens."* Such were the ancients’ subtle allusions. Thus does Chen Tianxi’s concealment among oranges embody the intent of these two sages of Mount Wei and Mount Qingcheng.

Moreover, as night deepens, the wind turns crisp, the moon bright; suddenly, a gibbon’s cry rings out, and a thousand groves awaken to dawn. In the pause between combing and washing, he cradles his qin by the orange grove’s edge—could there fail to be profound and wondrous meaning in this? At such a moment, I offer him a song:

*"The orange forms a grove, the orange forms a grove—
An acre of white clouds, hollow jade depths.
Within, an immortal elder cradles his qin—
Who knows this heart of his?"*

Thus may one glimpse the savor of "Orange Hermitage."

Recorded by the Daoist of Hainan, Bai Yuchan.

The Master of the Elixir Crucible built his hut in the recesses of the fifth bend of Mount Wuyi. His door remained shut, his grains untouched. One day, a female Daoist arrived from Dongyang, recounting her quest for the Dao. He tested her with trials of tranquility, spoke to her of the world’s shallow morals, and described the hardships of dwelling in mountain valleys, the arduousness of cultivating the Dao, the toil of clearing brambles, the difficulty of securing provisions. After a long while, he said to her: *"Coarse grains may be boiled into porridge; tattered robes may serve as rags. Flower buds may be eaten; kindling may be gathered for fire. All one needs is a patch of land to raise a thatched hut, weave orchids into a cloak, and strike flint for a fire. Let not the rain wet my head, nor the frost chill my skin. Before father and mother were born, what thought was there for cold or heat? After bones are reduced to ash, hunger can no longer be voiced. If life in the mountains is thus, then the Dao may indeed be attained."* Presently, the Dao was achieved, and phoenixes and cranes filled the sky in flight.

The master laughed and said: *"Entering the Dao is as easy as a trapped ape fleeing to the forest; abandoning the Dao is as easy as a fish leaping onto the shore. The Dao resides in the heart—where the heart is, there is the Dao. If you can persist to the end, how fortunate I shall be!"* Thereupon, he took her in as his disciple.

This Daoist was Liu Miaoqing. Some may doubt, for in her youth she was graceful and alluring, a sight to startle the heart and stir the eyes. Yet through the eye of the Dao, she was but a foul sack of festering pus, a vessel of bitterness and a bait for delusion. Thus, amid the red dust of the world, Miaoqing stood resolute, embodying the bearing of a steadfast hero. I believe her dreams of immortal wanderings and her spirit of Chan transformation enabled her to turn inward, to recognize her original face as her true destiny, and to somersault within the skull—like washing one’s face and finding the nose, requiring not the slightest effort.

Miaoqing built several thatched huts beside the master’s abode and named the place *Thorn Concealment*, borrowing the line from He Xiangu: *"In secluded mountain forests, thorns hide this body."* Amid green pines and emerald bamboo, she lived with carefree ease; the cries of cranes and gibbons echoed through the misty chill, while the spirit of wind and the soul of moonlight stretched boundless and free—such was the joy of *Thorn Concealment*.

What, then, occupied her mind within this retreat? I say: in establishing such a refuge, she must have aspired to join the ranks of those who don cloud-scarves and crane-feather robes—serene as a dragon coiled in silence before thunder, composed as a gull in deep slumber, limpid as a spring sky without clouds, still as an autumn pool with its moon, leisurely as a fish darting through waterweeds, unburdened as a crow perched in reeds, crisp as the evening breeze through parasol trees, desolate as morning rain on plantain leaves, fleeting as a daydream now faded, dissolving as a chronic illness shed from the body, clear as a long-standing lawsuit resolved, remote as the twilight path through bamboo, distinct as night snow on a lone pine, unperturbed as an elder nearing old age, unformed as an infant yet unborn, tranquil as Penglai’s three isles upon the sea, vast as the boundless expanse of the Yangtze’s heart, hushed as the first light over a thousand groves, expansive as the fullness of spring in all things, cool as duckweed drifting on water, distant as a single leaf adrift in the void, swift as a sharp blade cleaving bamboo, weightless as a thread suspending a stone.

Its subtlety defies description; its mechanism eludes comprehension—was this not the very purpose of *Thorn Concealment*?

Thus, if one seeks no use, one must place oneself in a realm of idle emptiness, allowing the self to merge with the streams and mountains, fish and birds, becoming a single mass of pure, ethereal qi. One must let the self be touched by the forests and springs, wind and moon, to acquire a trace of their wondrous, refined essence. Then, that person shall don the rainbow robes of Penglai and the feathered garments of the Weak Waters. Between Penglai and the Weak Waters, where birds never cease their flight and clouds and mist stretch endlessly, who but such a one could traverse a hundred or two hundred *li* in a single journey to reach that land?

The ancients compiled *Biographies of the Immortals* and *Biographies of Exemplary Women*—both records of heroic figures among women. Consider Zhang Daoling’s wife, who ascended in flight, and her daughter with her; Xu Jingyang’s wife, who ascended, and her daughter likewise; Ge Xianweng’s wife, who achieved liberation through the corpse, and her daughter as well; Liu Dongtian’s wife, who achieved liberation, and her daughter too. Those who refine the true and cultivate the primordial refine grain into essence, essence into blood, blood into marrow, marrow into qi, qi into spirit, spirit into the Dao, and this single-minded Dao into sagehood. Without inner cultivation and outer steadfastness, how could the women of old have achieved feathered transformation and ascension as they did?

Among the jade halls of the Heavenly Emperor stand immortal maidens: the celestial matrons of the Purple Tenuity Palace, the moon maidens of Guanghan, the cloud consorts of Penglai, the consorts who govern the peaks of the Great Cavern Heavens, the aged attendants who tend incense in the Miao Brahma Heaven—such as the Old Crone of Mount Li, the Xiao and Wang clans of Qingcheng, the Tong clan of the imperial house, the Ge clan of Huotong, the Hu, Li, and Yu clans of Wuyi, and He Xiangu among them. It is also told that in the Qin era there was Mao the Maiden, in the Han era Li the Maiden, and in the realms of Wu Mountain and Dongting Lake, divine maidens dwelled. Even Zhuangzi spoke of the maiden of Mount Miao Gu Ye in such form. Were such forms, such immortals, real or not? Many waver between doubt and belief. Yet the records of past and present, the accounts in ancient texts—surely female immortals exist.

If immortality can be learned, then why doubt that one may achieve the Dao? Once one reverses aging to return to infancy, one must be able to reverse yang and renew the bones; once one can preserve form and remain in the world, one must be able to transform and ascend in flight. With the heart of an immortal, believe in the affairs of immortals; study the Dao of immortals, and realize the fruits of immortality. Learning to be an immortal is not difficult—what is truly hard is transcending the dust and forsaking desire. Since the Dao of immortals, of long life and enduring vision, can be learned, then transcending the dust and forsaking desire—how could that be difficult?

Liu Miaoqing, having devoted herself thus, must surely be within reach. If the girl who played the flute could ride the phoenix, if the girl who picked mulberry leaves could mount the crane, then I nod in approval of her resolve and take up my brush to write what can be said.

**Three Quatrains Inscribed on the Wall of Thorn Concealment**

Moss lies dead in green coins,
The pine, dead, grows thin in its shade.

**From *The Upper Clarity Collection of the Ten Books on Cultivating Perfection*, Scroll Thirty-Seven (Conclusion)**

Beneath a hut woven into white clouds,
Cypress seeds crackle in the spring noon.
Hidden birds clamor in the valley’s throat,
Cold mist coils through tangled vines.

A golden toad-spider appears—
No one there, yet it laughs *hehe*.
Green grass sways in the spring breeze,
Bamboo weeps rain-clear tears after the storm.

A white bird suddenly takes flight,
Dotting the mountain’s emerald with a flaw.

*By Bai Yuchan of Hainan*

**Inscribed on the Rear Wall of the Three Clarities Hall**

A few stubborn stones, a thread of water—
The painter strains his eyes, squinting in disdain.
Then, in a flash, a pore of his heart opens:
Breath and chaos drawn onto the silk.

A white-haired, yellow-crowned adept flaunts his power,
Lifting Mount Wu-yi with a single hand.
In the Great Locust Palace, men crawl like ants—
Awakening, he hears this and his heart leaps with joy.

With straw sandals and bamboo staff, a snap of the fingers,
Thirty-six peaks tumble to his brow’s edge.
Was the King of Wei truly dead that Mid-Autumn?
His jade bones still linger, fragrant and trailing.

For eight hundred years, he sought but a single crane—
One leap, and he soars thirty thousand *li*.
Half a cup of wine wets his great-great-grandson’s lips,
The Pavilion’s old tales still echo in mortal ears.

At the ferry of New Village, he turns the tumbleweed,
A gibbon’s cry falls into the blue haze.
How many years has this old pine stretched its tips?
The hairy bamboo now bears grain again.

On the cliff, no one—yet flowers bloom crimson,
Hidden birds cry *wu wu*, then cease on their own.
Laughing, he lifts his iron flute to summon the clear wind,
White clouds drift past, leaving no trace.

Last night, the moon’s shadow hung on the parasol tree,
Moss carpets the ground in lush green.
At the red cliff’s height, the elixir furnace stands empty,
Before the cave, clouds pile a thousandfold deep.

I, too, come and go by chance—
One night of pattering rain on the river.

The Wind God rages, filling the sky with snow,
Before Heaven’s Pillar Peak, willow catkins fly.

**Inscribed on Master Dan Shu’s Thatched Hut**

A few jagged peaks like carved jade,
A stream of autumn water born in cold green.
Fortunate to find a thatch where white clouds probe,
And moonlit bamboo before the altar.

Clearing brambles, felling bamboo to build a lotus hut,
The mountains and waters here are ready for woodcutting and fishing.
Dwelling in the hills as fate allows,
Gathering *mani* wish-fulfilling pearls.

The thatched-hut Daoist is poor to the bone,
His hut empty, free, and spare.
Within him lies a treasure—he seeks no one,
Its price too great to bear, so he keeps it hidden.

Morning and evening, he settles body and mind,
Mountains bloom on their own, birds sing of their own accord.
He has yet to see mulberry fields turn to sea,
How many times has the evening sun locked the level woods?

Living in this thatched hut, no other defense—
All day, he sits in stillness, absorbed and vacant.
He is no immortal of the Ten Isles or Three Mountains,
Nor any buddha of the Ten Directions or Three Times.

Just a carefree, unburdened man,
His hut cradling a pot of spring.
Before the window, the moon’s thousand-year shadow;
Upon his pillow, the clear wind’s ten-thousand-kalpa voice.

Who is the master of this hut?
From ancient times to now, he claims this land of leisure.
Suddenly, he washes his face and feels his nose—
No eating, no drinking, no sleeping.

The hut stands empty, the man gone, mist curling,
A white crane calls to the clouds, filling the azure sky.
With one glimpse of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s face,
Everywhere a hut—everywhere the same.

This thatched hut, small and smaller still,
Is but a pore in the vast emptiness.
At its peak, not a blade of thatch hangs—
The ten thousand forms array themselves as its constellations.

Though kalpa-fire burns all to the last atom,
This hut remains unscathed, its dweller unchanged.

**For Zhao Daxu’s Painting of Bamboo and Stone**

The bamboo’s soul, the bamboo’s spirit,
Fallen to Xiao and Xiang, the Qi’s banks.
A thousand stalks, ten thousand stalks vie in verdant splendor,
Drinking wind, sipping dew for a thousand springs.

The master’s brush-tip moves like wind and rain,
Startling the bamboo’s soul—nowhere to alight.
A drop of ink transforms into a dragon,
The dragon’s offspring fly to E Creek to dwell.

The master wields his brush without hesitation,
Creation dares not hoard spring for itself.
New shoots, sturdy joints, a forest of cold jade—
Where can phoenix and simurgh perch their dream-souls?

The Jin immortals like Sun Ju—
Their bamboo paintings often summoned heaven’s rain.
The Tang immortals like Zhang Zhen—
Their bamboo paintings often heard wild geese cry.

The master’s hand has entered the divine—
One stalk, two stalks spring from his wine.
Drunk, he called for his ink-slave,
One stroke swept out a thousand *mu* of bamboo.

How could wine’s power usurp Creation’s work?
The master has refined his cinnabar elixir to crimson.
A grain of yang-light illumines his lungs and viscera,
The ten thousand forms arrayed within his breast.

Sometimes he holds forth a leaf of wind-bamboo—
The Silver Sea grows warm, all tremble in awe.
Sometimes he holds forth a branch from the snow—
As if frozen jade scorns the rippling waves.

He can also moisten his brush to shape stone,
Naturally steep and strange, ancient and rugged.
Tigers crouching in sand, rhinos in grass—
He bids men take them to Penglai to sell.

Bamboo’s purity, stone’s hardness—
Through these, he reveals true nature and life.
Let men gaze upon stone and love bamboo,
Knowing there is a true Zhao Yuanjing.

When the master is drunk, he is often wind-mad,
The world’s eyes hold no immortals.
I now treasure several of his paintings—
When the cloud-crane comes, you will ascend to heaven.

**For a Painter of Fish**

Long ago, the monk Xian painted fish,
Thirty-six scales clinging to emerald reeds.
Shen Xun’s paintings often featured fish,
Their fins flaring, manes waving—now captured in art.

The ancients’ wondrous paintings still endure,
The moderns’ marvels were unknown in ancient times.
Guo Danqing stands peerless across the ages,
The world’s foremost painter of fish.

At the height of his skill, hand answers heart,
His mind’s craft surpasses cunning, his wit runs deep.
On the paper, a limpid stream flows,
Releasing two or three iron bream.

Golden scales, brocade manes, crimson jade topknots,
They circle and glide, playing in the waves.
Tiny fish, needle-like, swim in formation,
Leaping to sip water, toying with duckweed.

Tossing heads, flicking tails in floating-sinking motion,
Now clustering, now scattering in their leaps.
His brush divides light and dark, counting ten thousand scales,
Etching whiskers, dotting eyes, evening the ink’s traces.

As if casting a ruler to measure rippling silk,
Or threading a shuttle through water’s patterns.
Vividly, mandarin fish nest in green algae,
The fisherman has yet to cast his line—already he blows his fire.

On the wall, fish leap, yet the water does not flow,
A child squints, tapping his needle-hook.

At the moment your brush reaches the realm of spirit,
This painting, once revealed, will resound even more.
Though fish have no guts, they brim with living intent,
Jade waves steep the talisman, cold isles grow limpid.

I fear that on some storm-lit night,
They may transform and soar as dragons through Yu’s Gate.

**For Guo Chengwu’s Reed-Waisted Geese**
Among painters, Guo Xi stood supreme,
And though he’s gone, his name remains unbroken.
His descendant, Guo Wanli, now appears,
His heart brimming with boundless ink and hues.

For whom did he craft this *Reeds and Wild Geese*?
For Yuwen Huan of the Southern Studio, its splendor unmatched.
Misty waters, rustling reeds in the wind’s grasp,
By the sands, geese and crows call at dusk.

This is the autumn scene of Xiao Xiang and Dongting—
Who in the world knows if such a painting exists?
Illusion conjures three or four crows on a tower,
Eight or nine reeds stretch across ancient shoals.

Hesitant to roost, their cries ring clear,
As fishing boats moor by the shore, mountain mists darken.
Autumn winds strip the wutong leaves to gold,
Migrating geese return again to Hengyang.

Writing characters across the void, none can decipher,
Their shadows glide past, sinking into the deep.
Evening glow dips into the river, a village at dusk,
A few wheel and circle back to ancient waves.

Necks stretched, beaks raised, they peck at lotus blooms,
Then soar beyond the western watchtower’s edge.
Cold clouds, pale moon—autumn at Xisai,
A few plaintive cries stir melancholy.

By the bank, they fly with falling maple leaves,
Gathering in flocks to visit the sandpipers.
Such scenes, such sentiments—
For you, painting them is no difficult task.

A few sheets of *Exi* silk, cold as ice and snow,
Yet in an instant, you sweep out a market of reeds and geese.
Though many in the world study painting,
Few can compare to your skill.

I long to store these in a bamboo basket,
Where crisp autumn chill would fill its depths.
But I fear your paintings may go unseen—
Who among those who hear of them would dare compete?

Hang them in a quiet chamber’s plain white walls,
And one would gaze upon them a hundred times a day.

**Pure Void Hall’s Ode to Snow**
The vast sky darkens, day turns to night,
Fierce winds tear clouds into shreds below.
Cold gibbons cling to trees, too afraid to cry,
Plum blossoms shy from blooming, fearing frost’s swift blow.

Countless mountains drown in fallen leaves’ sorrow,
Everywhere, frozen mist clings to thatched eaves.
Withered and stiff, life seems beyond revival,
As if the Spring Decree were barred by Feilian’s might.

Hungry tigers call their cubs to rocky dens,
Birds dart like shuttles through the leafless grove.
Gardens and groves stand desolate, stripped bare,
After nights of frost’s relentless, wanton force.

Threatening rain, yet only sleet descends,
The sky’s deceit weighs heavy in the air.
Willow fluff takes flight like a chariot’s wheels,
Frozen for days, refusing to melt away.

Before my eyes, a jade-white tower appears,
Yet I dare not ascend, left only to sigh.
Goosebumps rise, my nose runs cold,
While in the village, fresh wine’s price soars high.

By the stream, fishermen laugh as they haul their nets,
Unknowing that the hooks bear musk’s scent.
They wash the pot, stoke the fire, brew snow tea,
Lower the blinds, cross their legs, and speak of purity.

They call a boy to shatter the inkstone’s ice,
Warm their hands, form a circle, and found a poetry club.
The poem captures this scene—yet still it falls short,
How I wish Wang Wei could paint it true!

**Pure Yang Assembly**
A breath of warm wind dances through green locusts,
Zhurong’s fire rolls in from the south.
Crabapples scatter, bees and butterflies depart,
The pondside pavilion stands empty, lotuses yet unopened.

A single handful of pure harmony’s essence,
The pure Yang has already turned to mare’s form.
The mountains and rivers gather this heroic qi,
Sealing it suddenly in a gourd.

Before the steps, fourteen pods of *jiaomu* grow,
The censor dreams of qilin at night.
The old immortal, robed in carelessness, laughs from his nose,
His celestial spring yet unborn in the womb.

Lü Dongbin’s cleverness turns to clumsiness,
On Penglai’s path, only the bright moon remains.
Plum blossoms cling to the wall, wax drips from branches,
By the pond, pomegranate flowers bleed within their leaves.

Born with an unyielding spirit,
His nature and passions exhaust the heavens’ truth.
Suddenly, he grasps the mechanism of lead and mercury,
Daring to say the great Dao knows no Chu or Qin.

In an instant, the golden elixir completes nine cycles,
The ten-month gestation ripens—yet none inquire.
It shakes heaven and earth, startles ghosts and gods,
Only the blue clouds and white cranes find solace.

Later ages long for the true man,
Ever celebrating his birth.
On the day the cherry kitchens open,
Even Buddhists wish to craft wax figures.

Who first began this custom?
Truly, it began in Qiaoling during the Five Dynasties.
Wang Shen held gatherings, donning the scholar’s cap,
White cranes flew in, uncounted.

Next, the Xiao family built their immortal abode,
In the Seven Min lands, ten thousand households birthed auspicious mist.
One prefecture, then two, gradually embraced the custom,
Swiftly they came to know Dongbin’s worth.

How many times did they traverse the city’s north and south?
Yet none knew the old man had returned.
They only saw an ancient pine speak in human tongue,
Asking, "To whose house does the master carry his ink?"

Within Taiping Temple, he composed a poem,
Then scoffed at those who polished mirrors, calling them fools.
In Yueyang’s marketplace, he let out a long whistle,
The iron flute fell silent—how long has it been?

There was a man, a son of the Pan family,
Content with his lot, his heart filled with joy.
From his extravagant years of devotion to this day,
Pilgrims from the four seas swarm like ants.

Amid the throng, a jade toad appears,
Unashamed of tattered robes or humble garb.
He inscribed a poem to urge steadfastness like metal and stone,
Morning incense and evening candles heighten reverence.

The wondrous Elder Miaotong clapped in secret,
Wondering when he might dream of such radiance.
Waiting for him to rise like Yi, towering and bold,
He would arrange the robes and alms bowl—blessings boundless.

Five hundred white cranes call to the blue clouds,
In their depths, jade plums bloom anew.
If one asks of the matter of ascending to immortality,
Simply gaze upon the sun and moon at heaven’s edge.

**For Xie Zhitang of the Western City**
On Penglai’s peak, a divine immortal,
His Daoist bearing tall and straight as a pine.
Eyes gleaming, blacker than lacquer,
Cheeks faintly flushed like peach blossoms.

At times, he throws back his head and laughs,
Gathering Kunlun in his right hand.
Suddenly, he tumbles from the empty void,
Unknowing that his belly holds the stars.

At times, he startles an old dragon into roaring,
In one breath, he drains the Canglang’s waves.
Shattering the primordial chaos, he extracts its bones,
Plucking a mustard seed to contain mountains and rivers.

In the crescent moon’s furnace, he boils heaven and earth,
Refining the sun’s soul and the moon’s marrow.
Laughing, he wields his gourd to bind ghosts and gods,
His staff hoisting mountains and waters alike.

**For Le Ba and Others**

Le Ba’s rice grains take flight as bees,
Zuo Ci’s mugwort shears transform to dragons.
In summer, plum blossoms; in winter, lightning—
Such feats make even Lü and Zhong ask questions.

Scooping earth for incense is but illusion,
While qilin from the water’s depths serve as delicacies.
Ghosts and gods’ eyes bulge in astonishment,
Beneath the rootless tree, he rides an iron horse.

When skill reaches its peak, play becomes profound,
Tossing and shaping creation like a child at play.
Somersaulting on the tiger’s tongue,
He laughs at Vajra learning to paint eyebrows.

Nüwa seeks to mend the western heavens’ flaw,
Yet her smelted stones fail to amuse Fuxi.
Qin Shi Huang carved mountains to link the four seas,
The Han Emperor’s grasp elicits but a long laugh.

The master wields his bottomless basket,
Moving from being to non-being with ease.
Clutching this Dao-guard, he surveys the four seas—
Dongbin now seeks a fellow practitioner.

In cups, cotton swells and scatters,
Fish swim in fire, while water holds obstructions.
At Yellow Crane Tower, deep in drunkenness,
He widens his eyes to show Zhongli.

Stirring a basin to scatter five-colored sands,
He writes dragons and serpents across the earth.
With a single cup left as parting wine,
Dare he transform it to tea before others’ eyes?

Behind the bamboo fence lies a single path,
Piercing the azure clouds beyond.
At the crossroads, he spreads his mat,
With a flip of his hand, clouds and rain arise.

Nowadays, none in the world can match him,
For his Dao-guardian’s skill is truly divine.
How many springs has he wandered rivers and lakes,
Becoming one with the cloud-and-water life?

**Fifth Month Reflections**

On Fangying Mountain, the wind howls,
Where the fifth and sixth months feel like autumn.
Pine blossoms fall as cranes take flight,
Endless white clouds drift over emerald peaks.

Midnight’s toad descends into the cinnabar well,
Jade forests locked in twilight’s cold mist.
Dew blankets the sky, dotting the moss,
Frog markets disperse, and all sounds fade.

Three or two trees where gibbons cry,
Their branches home to sleepless birds.
A few fireflies linger on sandy paths,
While mountain streams weep with cold springs.

The bell’s toll severs the path to dreams,
Unknowing where butterflies now flutter.
Rubbing my eyes, I fold paper streamers—
Today is the fifth day of the fifth month.

Morning rain clears, plums grow plump,
Young dragons shed their shells as new phoenixes soar.
My mountain dwelling holds nothing,
Yet ginger and wheat suffice for the morning meal.

I recall the fourth day of the fifth month in years past,
Wearing a kudzu hat and feather fan at Luán Creek’s market.
Dragon boats split the waves with a thousand oars,
Drums shook the heavens as banners cleaved the water.

Paper money flew at Qu Yuan’s shrine,
Crowds moved like swarming ants.
Paulownia blossoms adorned temples, colored threads bound arms,
Every household warded off plague with peach branches.

Before the hall, green mugwort shaped green tigers,
Finely chopped calamus steeped in green vinegar.
Succulent goose and carp graced the feast,
Glutinous rice wrapped in leaves, steeped in water.

This year, solitude in these empty mountains,
Where mountain rain and wind bring morning chill.
Mòān bids me cease sighing,
So I write this poem to express my mountain life.

Oh, to grow wings beneath my arms,
And fly with you to the boundless void,
Spared the bitterness of this world’s sorrows!

**Journey to Immortal Rock**

Drunk, he seizes a seven-foot frost-bitten bamboo,
Before Cloud-Brocade Mountain’s winding bays.
Autumn rain at the stream’s head deepens the chill green,
A jade pot where dragons play.

Dream-flowers along the brocade shore, red as flowing blood,
Rice fields rise and fall like a game of *sai*.
Emerald cliffs soar halfway to the azure sky,
Birds dare not fly, tucking their feet in fear.

An ancient grotto, empty, with stone wine presses,
Sheer cliffs house immortal granaries, heaped with celestial grain.
The old pine’s gesture still draws gasps,
As gods and ghosts carve paths through valleys.

The sound of pounding medicine dries the air—man already ascended,
A ten-thousand-foot cinnabar well, a single spring’s gleam.
Wind strikes ancient pines, their jade canopies soar,
Sunlight forges green coins on moss.

Vines and creepers drag trees through wispy mist,
Since the yellow crane’s departure, how many years have passed?
The sky leans toward dusk, cicadas cry in vain,
The mountain moon turns full toward man at night.

A desolate temple’s old halls hold a few oaks,
A lone monk gone, the brushwood gate left ajar.
Iron statues face the wall, silent and still,
Before the ancient hall, a cold brazier stands.

Crows alight on the eaves, dripping water,
Evening clouds and withered grass make the mountains seem gaunt.
The quilt is thin, warmth flees, sleep eludes,
Tiger roars and gibbon cries fill the ear.

A few sparse stars fall on the parasol tree,
Cinnabar peaks and purple ravines vie in height.

---

**Journey to Yan Rock**

When shall I wander carefree on a green ox,
Dawn’s dew glistening at White Jade Tower?
A guest arrives from Tianzhu Peak,
Catching a single pole’s wind at the ferry.

Autumn wind lends strength to the journey,
Blowing into Wu Rock’s pines and bamboos.
Pines and bamboos mourn, the sky turns autumn,
Floating empty, coming and going in the void.

Towering cliffs rise ten thousand feet into the azure,
The immortal master rides a crane, leaving no trace.
The alchemical furnace cold, grasses overgrown,
A few rock huts shrouded in cold mist.

Below lies a dragon pool, fathomless green,
A thousand-foot waterfall hangs from the cliff.
Night’s moon casts shadows across the mountain,
A stone bell’s chime stirs autumn’s chill.

Wang Wu danced here in years past,
Transforming into rain that filled the sky.
They say this rock teems with immortals,
A white crane’s touch turning the mountain green.

Mist veils the mountain, stones always damp,
Moss carpets the earth, endless emerald.
One day, I’ll refine elixirs here,
Seizing a thousand years of leisure from the mortal world.

A lofty man, Master Lu Rock,
Holds his zither, playing *Zhong Lü* for me.
He urges me to return in years to come,
Lest this rock be buried in mist and clouds.

**Fragrant Brocade Pavilion of Hu Dongyuan**

The Eastern Emperor splits open Goumang’s belly,
Revealing a brocade heart, embroidered guts, and fragrant richness.
For a hundred springs, the crimson capital’s winds and rains held sway,
The flower’s spirit, masterless, yet full of vigor.

The oriole’s first call opens the willow’s eyes,
On crabapple branches, spring mist lingers.
A few red dots emerge,
The wall’s red-cheeked breeze smiles faintly.

After Dongyuan’s departure, the flowers lost their master,
Even Spring’s labor grew lazy at the loom.
Suddenly, a poet-immortal appears before the pavilion,
And the flowers exhale dragon’s spittle.

Wind urges, rain drills, yet the flowers remain indistinct,
The courtyard blooms with fragrant splendor.
Peonies breathe fire, flowers ablaze,
The sun spreads brocade upon the mossy felt.

**Poetic Madness and Dream-Drinking with the Flower Spirit**

Drunk with poetry, I dreamt of drinking with the Flower Spirit;
Wine-sodden, I would not sleep with the Flower Spirit.
As the wine ebbed, I recalled Dongyuan—
Though the flowers and trees remain, my heart aches for the man.
This poem was never meant for flowers,
Yet I grieve for Dongyuan in these hills and vales.
Now, when I admire flowers, I see no one—
Only bees and butterflies flitting through the idle pavilion.

**Two Songs of Cloud-Wandering**

Cloud-wandering is hard, oh so hard,
Ten thousand miles of misty waters, the four seas so wide.
Speak of such bitterness, and who would not weep?
First parting from home, leaving kin behind,
Three hundred coins jingling at my waist.
I pondered, sought, and found the Way so arduous—
Tonight, where shall I rest my head?

Unknowing, I walked two or three stages,
And was told this place was Zhangcheng.
My robes sold off, my clothes all pawned,
Yet not a soul did I meet upon the road.
Arriving at a riverside village, I lodged in a lonely inn—
Crows cawed, flowers fell, a thousand groves at dusk.
At dawn, I rose again to walk the road,
With naught but a single umbrella in hand.

Gradually, I drew near to Xinghua Prefecture,
Where wind and rain whispered of spring’s departure.
All I had left was this bare, emaciated frame,
And a few coins still tucked in my pouch.
My steps grew heavy, my feet weak,
My body wracked with itching, lice crawling everywhere.
Stripped bare, I stood at last,
Longing to return home—yet home was beyond reach.
How could I endure ten days of gnawing hunger?
Hiding my name, concealing my face—who would know me?

I came to Xingfu Temple in Luoyuan,
And there became a servant.
Not half a month had passed before I parted ways with the abbot.
Fire-clouds soared above Zhiti Peak,
The road’s stones scorching like embers.
The blazing sun seared the sky,
And my bare feet could not bear the burning path.
A mound of flesh, sweat streaming down—
Not even a fan to stir the wind.

Fortunately, the triple heat of summer passed,
And my steps led me once more to Jianpu.
Truly, I was poor to the bone, to the marrow—
A night in the wilds, rain pattering on the parasol trees.
At dusk, I looked around, tears streaming,
No hat, no raincoat—how could I not despair?
I huddled beneath an eave, waiting for dawn,
But the village elder would not let me stay.

Hearing that the people of Jianning were kind,
I came seeking food and clothing.
Yet all I heard were whispers of shame—
Who would meet me with eyes of mercy?
I recalled my days of wealth and ease,
And now, head bowed, I knit my brows in sorrow.
House after house, I stretched out my hand—
Not one soul pitied this beggar.

From Fujian, I made my way to Longhu,
To the Upper Clarity Palace, to seek an audience with the master.
Before we met, I begged for shelter,
But the temple keeper scorned my tattered robes.
It was just like my first arrival at Wuyi,
Where the yellow-capped Daoists berated me.
A bowl of stale rice, a ladle of cold water—
They called me a wretch, a disgrace to their kind.

East and west of the river, north and south of the lake,
Zhejiang’s borders touching the western reaches of Shu,
Guangdong, Fujian, Huai, and the seas—tens of thousands of miles,
A thousand mountains, ten thousand waters, all in vain.
Years passed in cloud-wandering,
And my fellow Daoists laughed at my folly.
I revisited old haunts, came and went again—
Great matters slip by, yet I do not blame Heaven.

If I truly have the destiny of an immortal,
There must be someone to guide me.
Now, my training has reached its peak,
And not a trace of vexation lingers in my breast.

I remember the flames of war rising in Huaixi,
Frozen corpses stretching for miles.
Fortune granted me a thread of life,
Yet hunger and thirst brought me to the brink of despair.
I remember the snow in Wulin,
My clothes in tatters, the wind piercing my bones.
Though my essence and qi remained whole,
Still, my skin split from the cold.

I recall an ancient temple in wind and rain,
No fire in the incense burner, paper money scattering in the gale.
Ghosts wailed, spirits howled, the sky grew grim,
Dew dripped, clouds thinned, and apes cried through the night.
I think of straw sandals on frost-hardened ground,
Moonlight on green moss, fallen leaves turning yellow.
Not a moment of true ease—
How could I endure such bitter cold?

Then, one day, Heaven opened its eyes,
And Master Chen Niyuan saw my laziness.
On the Mid-Autumn of the *guiyou* year, beneath a clear sky,
I sat alone in the pine’s shade, speaking of this and that.
It turned out the true gold was at home all along—
My past toil had been in vain.
I recalled the *Long Life, Preserve the Life-Spark* formula,
And built a thatched hut to sit in stillness amid the deep clouds.

Refining the golden elixir is easy—
Whether in the mountains or the marketplace.
I write these *Songs of Cloud-Wandering* in passing,
Lest others fail to grasp their meaning.

**Again**

I recall a night of rain on Dongting,
No raincoat, no hat—
Huddled beneath an eave, waiting for dawn,
But the village elder would not let me stay.

I recall seven days of snow in Wulin,
My clothes torn and tattered—
Had I not been Bai Yuchan,
He would have frozen till his skin split and blood flowed,
For the cold pierced to the bone.

I recall the summer heat east of the river,
The road’s stones burning like fire—
Where could I rest?
No fan to stir the wind,
Barefoot, I could not bear the path.

I recall an autumn moonlit night on Qingcheng,
Alone beneath the pines,
A *bu xu* hymn sung—
Mouth and heart conversing,
Cold mist veiling all, the world hushed.
Only then did I truly arrive at the mountain.

I recall a gentle breeze on Xiaoxiang,
Turning my *Huaxu* dream,
The sun crimson at the mountain’s edge,
A crow’s cry—
The cry faded, leaving no trace,
Such fleeting joy—with whom could I share it?

I recall the troops rising in Huaixi,
Rows of bleached bones stretching for miles,
Hungry, yet no food,
Thirsty, yet no water.

I recall a year in a village,
Plague raging,
People came begging for talismanic water,
Yet I had nowhere to turn.
The divine generals manifested,
Seizing ghosts and spirits at will.

I recall walking beneath the northern mountains,
Ancient graves overgrown with autumn grass,
Paper money still damp from the rain,
White poplars sighing in the wind,
A desolate terrace bathed in moonlight,
Ghosts and spirits weeping all night—
Saved only by a scroll of scripture to deliver the dead.

Again I recall—
where outstretched hands met the thoroughfare,
a thousand households cried *"Ashamed!"*,
ten thousand households muttered *"Karma!"*.
Leaning on doorways, eyes fixed on noses,
they repeated, *"Just pass by, just pass by."*
Faces full of scornful smiles,
shouting curses to drive me away.

Again I recall—
entering halls to seek shelter,
they scorned my ragged robes.
The head monk and the abbot,
the senior monk said I was unfit.
After barely two days of inquiry,
I wandered the streets in circles,
then reentered the almshouse,
mingling with beggars in the mix.

Again I recall—
years lying in frost-covered weeds,
nights under bright moonlight, collapsing alone,
days of ceaseless rain,
sitting solitary in an ancient temple.
Enduring all cold, suppressing all hunger,
yet glimpsing neither a trace of *Chan*
nor a hint of the *Dao*.

How virtuous was Master Cuixu!
At first sight, he took pity on me,
speaking a single word that struck like a needle to the pain,
teaching me to practice for but a moment—
chilled to the bone, my heart’s flower
congealed into a single crimson grain.
He said, *"This alone is the Golden Elixir.
Ten thousand sutras are but idle chatter.
A thousand, ten thousand *Dao*s may be tamed,
but who knows the True Eternal Way?
No need for convoluted schemes,
no need for secret signals."*

It is difficult—
like an eighty-year-old gnawing an iron plate.
It is easy—
like a single stroke of a sharp bamboo knife.

He asked me,
*"How many springs have you wandered, cloud-like?
Disheveled, barefoot, filthy—
who would recognize you?"*

**Song of Joy**
Joy, joy—true joy!
All at once, I cast it all away.
With hands unbound, I sing a mighty song and return—
ginger and pepper are indeed spicy!
Now, joy is great joy,
sometimes wild, sometimes unruly.

Within this body, I have my own spouse—
tell this to others, and they’ll surely laugh.
Once, joy was but small joy,
like uprooting a shadowy tree, root and all.
A man truly capable of conceiving,
mother and child in one form, vividly alive.

Joy, joy—true joy!
The vast emptiness shattered like an autumn hair’s tip.
Countless lives of birth and death overturned—
only this great death brings true life.
The old rut of existence, now utterly cast off.
Only now do I see—
*"Father was only ever father,"*
bewildered, entangled in my own roots.

Recently, I’ve sorted the tangled threads,
seven times seven, back to forty-eight.
Like a dragon nurturing its pearl, never forgetting,
like a hen brooding her eggs, breath unbroken,
like a cicada sipping the dawn wind,
like an old clam holding the autumn moon.

A carefree man between heaven and earth,
a great laugh shakes the vast expanse.
Clothing: one robe for all four seasons.
Food: one bowl from a thousand homes.
In a three-house village, I play the madman,
on a ten-house street, I cause a stir.
One husband, one wife, with six children—
whether walking or sitting, ever steadfast.

Gather and release, move freely as you will—
this is the Buddha of the ten directions and three times.
One cup of wine, then another,
one song, then another.
At midday, three clear meals,
after eating, a sound sleep.
Laying down the ten thousand greens, all cast away—
only when freed and at ease is there true joy.

Exhausting all cleverness to learn foolishness,
in this moment, the scene transforms, ascending the morning’s secret.
Ordinary people don’t understand flipping somersaults—
like eating salt when hungry, only increasing thirst.

By chance, I roamed to Mount Lu,
my body amid the white duckweed and red dreams.
Ascending the Pavilion of Heavenly Music,
the yellow crane had not returned—spring rain was cold.
How many in this world feel the heart’s bitterness,
not refining the Golden Liquid, the Great Return Elixir?

Forgetting form to nurture *qi* is the Golden Liquid,
facing scenes with a heart devoid of intent is the Great Return.
Forgetting form, transforming *qi*; *qi* transforming spirit—
this is the Great Dao penetrating the Three Passes.
The Crimson Palace, a blazing crescent furnace,
the Spirit Terrace, a silent altar of the Great Mystery.

Cinnabar is the blood of the red phoenix,
quicksilver is the liver of the black tortoise.
Golden lead gathered into the earthen crucible,
wooden mercury flying to dwell in the *niwan*.
The Flower Pool lies within the Sea of *Qi*,
the Spirit Chamber within the Yellow Court.

Scattered, the eyes, ears, nose, and tongue are busy;
gathered, the meridians and protective *qi* are at ease.
The five viscera and six bowels each have their spirits—
ten thousand spirits pay homage to the One Spirit.
This One Spirit is the Primal Essence,
pre- and post-heavenly *Qian*’s prosperity.

The sage gathers this as medicinal material—
gathered, it exists; scattered, it vanishes.
Day and night, the River Chariot never pauses,
silently aligning with the Great Creation’s movement.
Every person inherently possesses a drop of gold,
gold essence and wood liquid, each half a catty.

The twenty-eight constellations return to one furnace,
one water, one fire—must be harmonized.
One phase hard, one phase soft,
one line firm, one line yielding.
The heart’s sky determines the seasons,
the nature’s earth divides the lands like Chu and Qin.

In a day, eighty-four thousand miles,
naturally, the Dipper’s handle revolves the heavens.
When a person sheds their shell beyond yin and yang,
one must refine mercury into silver.
Only when the Yellow Woman arrives at the Purple Court
do the golden male and radiant female unite in marriage.

Green Dragon and White Tiger encircle the golden tripod,
the yellow sprout—a branch of spring at midnight.
At the bend of the Nine-Curved River, white snow flies,
at Kunlun’s peak, purple clouds soar.
Ding Gong silently guards the jade furnace,
in union and nurturing, the fetal infant forms.

Divine water extinguishes the Three Corpses’ fire,
the wisdom sword sweeps away the Six Bandits’ troops.
From nothing, one arises—a grain of elixir,
within the dung pellet, the transformed maiden’s form.
Truly, once attained, it is forever attained—
in but a moment, it can be congealed.

Suddenly, the four great elements birth emptiness,
unaware, the One Spirit ascends the Great Clarity.
Even if skillfully merging mercury with lead,
without knowing the fire’s timing, it is futile.
It largely depends on the Zhou Tian fire—
only after ten months does the sacred embryo begin to round.

Though the elixir’s head may form, it will dissipate—
fire’s timing must solidify it.
Movement and stillness, life and death—bathe appropriately,
fortune and misfortune, advance and retreat—value withdrawal and addition.
After nine cycles of gentle fire,
the medicinal substances can form the fetal immortal.

One hour and eight quarters make one celestial cycle,
twelve hours correspond to one year.
From each yang union after,
refine the work until the six pure *Qian*s.

The spirit’s ebb and flow mark the tides’ timing,
qi and blood wax and wane like the moon’s soul.
A single hub ever holds thirty spokes—
the mystery lies in the waxing and waning crescents.

Refining qi to softness is the highest benevolence,
ritual, justice, wisdom, and trust fuse into *ren*.
When true earth returns to its place, it is most authentic,
water, fire, metal, and wood all merge in perfect wholeness—
essence-water, spirit-fire, and intent-earth.

Refine to return hun and po to their root,
the primordial qi now abides eternally,
scattered through the ten thousand things and the human body,
flowers bloom in spring winds, birds sing of their own accord.
Who knows the Creator’s heaven as spring?
The common folk use it daily yet remain unaware.

Qi enters the four limbs, but in vain they wither,
pine and bamboo, hollow-hearted, receive qi in full,
defying frost and snow to stay verdant through the years.
How much more so the human primordial spirit, which never dies?
This qi is the yellow sprout and lead,
old pines may rejuvenate, the sick may heal,
the scattered may gather, the brief may extend.

The heart enters emptiness to enact the fire’s timing,
inner visions, inner images—a heaven within the flask.
Know that each mote of dust is Penglai,
each drifting leaf is a transcendent’s boat.
Spirit is fire, qi is the medicine,
the heart is the furnace, the body the field—
self-cultivating, self-planting, self-refining,
each day a grain like millet.

Once lingzhi sprouts, sweet dew descends,
tortoise and snake coil through the ages.
One morning, thunder shakes the mountains and rivers,
one spark becomes the sun, ten thousand turn to smoke.
Within the sun flies the golden crow,
each night at midnight, one enters the Moon’s vast cold.
Children and grandchildren, hundreds of millions—
in the crucible, even chickens and dogs ascend to heaven.

The Great Dao passed through thirty-two transmissions,
reaching Tiantai’s Zhang Wuzhen,
four transmissions later, to Bai Yuchan.
With eyes empty of the four seas, he sighed at the lack of true seekers,
until he chanced upon Taiping Xingguo Palace,
where an aged Daoist, surnamed Chen,
had spent half his life vowing to master lead and mercury,
traversing ten thousand waters and a thousand mountains in vain,
until one day, beneath Mount Lu, he met his fate—
laughing, he brushed the dust of the mortal world from his sleeves.

On a jade-green bed, through wind and rain at night,
the method of the elixir was imparted, restoring his origin.
What is a human life but a cup of wine?
What is a human life but a flickering lamp?
Where lie Penglai and Fangzhang?
I long to return on white clouds with a crane’s grace.
Joy! Joy! True joy!
For you, I speak these final words—
the very last phrase is personally entrusted,
to reveal clearly the path to Penglai
for all under heaven who seek immortality.

---

Though the patched sleeve is torn, it can be mended,
for within the body lies the treasure of longevity.
Why lean on a staff of tangled vines?
Why wear sandals woven from field herbs?

Now raving, now still,
now standing erect, now lying supine—
people call me mad,
but I am not mad—who truly knows me?

In heat, I drink only the snow of Hua Pond,
in cold, I turn to the fire within the elixir.
When hungry, I crave the black dragon’s liver,
when thirsty, I long to sip the green dragon’s brain.

The Crimson Palace blooms with peonies,
the Spirit Terrace sprouts fresh mugwort.
Yet I laugh at Yan Hui for dying young,
and Peng Keng for not being truly old.

A cup of central-yellow wine tastes sweeter,
a thousand verses of inner visions are finer still.
The stringless zither needs no strumming,
the song of non-being finds no chorus.

Morning and night, I strike at delusion,
yet not a trace of idle vexation remains.
Corpse-liberation and ascension are but trifles,
death and life, life and death—nothing is forbidden.

I eat when others offer food,
no need to raise silkworms or plant rice.
Frost and snow are not true cold,
hunger at dawn and dusk can be endured.

I imagine heaven has immortal offices,
but on earth, I disdain the title of Perfected One.
The golden tiger’s cap is my lead brother,
the dragon-riding maiden is my mercury sister.
Within the Niwan Palace dwells the Yellow Dame,
who cradles the infant in her embrace.

The Pass of Spirit, the Black Pass, the Heart’s Pass—
all three gates are traversed as one.
The Six Bandits burn like raging fire,
the Three Corpses swell with gall like the heavens—
yet without wielding weapons, in an instant,
the Diamond Guardians are shattered and searched,
bound to the furnace’s edge,
crushed to dust, ground to fragments.

Now, at last, I delight in a single red grain,
as if Ding Gong had wed the old crone.
Had I not once doubted Master Cui Xu,
how could I now break free from the locks of the pass?

Pluck the tender shoots when young,
refine them with fierce fire into purple polish.
I reflect: had I begun earlier, it would still have been too late—
Master Cui Xu is now hard to find,
and I no longer see Zhang Ping Shu,
so I might as well revile the *Awakening to Reality*.
How could I have known the ancient sages’ hearts?
Their compassion instead invited calamity for descendants.

If mortals wish to refine the golden elixir,
seek the medicinal herbs within the body.
Proceed slowly over ten months,
fearing only that none will teach the fire’s timing.
Know only advance and retreat, withdrawal and addition—
seven returns and nine reversions all stem from impatience.

Fish and birds in streams and mountains grow weary of carefree wandering,
wind and moon in forests and springs fuel my laughter and pride.
With unkempt hair and soiled robes, I roam the world,
after three thousand merits fulfilled, I return to Peng Isle.
Sometimes in the marketplace, sometimes in the mountains,
sometimes laughing uproariously, sometimes collapsing in mirth.

Clouds fill a thousand peaks—where to seek me?
I am in the city’s dust, yet who knows me?

---

In the end, I sing:
I never believed in immortals,
nor knew of the Great Brahma Heaven.
How could I bear to hear others speak of Penglai?
I cover my face and laugh at their madness.

The seven-return elixir is often false,
and people say its tales are mere fiction.
The world claims immortals can ascend,
that they live forever, defying death.
But flesh has no wings—how could it not fall?
No one lives a century—how could life extend?
With my own eyes, I see birth and death together,
life and death cycling endlessly.

Master Cui Xu told me:
his insights were not like this.
Fearing others’ roots are shallow, their allotments meager,
they lack the lifespan to return to the Yellow Springs.

The human body holds only three things—
essence, qi, and spirit—preserve them all.
This essence is not the essence of intercourse,
but the saliva from the Jade Emperor’s mouth.
This qi is not the qi of breath,
but the mist of primordial simplicity.
This spirit is not the spirit of thought,
but one that stands shoulder to shoulder with the Primordial Beginning.

Hearing his words, I trembled—
trembling, doubting, clenching my fists.
I knew only to ask about daily movements,
how one thing dwells with us in constant unity.

This thing’s root and stem are essence and qi,
essence and qi that may fill the body.
Yet how could I know this essence, this spirit, this qi
originated before father and mother conceived me?
The three never once parted,
knotted into one boundless mass.

Man’s birth and death are but empty illusion—
this thing remains serene, untouched.
I turned inward to ponder,
and the elder’s words rang true.
This must be the beloved practice he revealed,
his discourse unfolding its meaning.

On the Mid-Autumn night of Kai Xi’s first year,
incense burned, I knelt to receive the oral transmission.
After three days of practice,
heaven and earth, sun and moon softened like silk.
Suddenly, I bit through empty space and shattered it—
only then did I grasp that Zhong and Lü had plumbed the mystery.

Had I devoted myself in youth,
I would not still be mired in dust.
I think of the eight hundred and three thousand,
cloud-cranes descending in graceful pairs.

**Song of Contentment**
Do you know what the immortals’ work entails?
If you knew, you would not seek so carelessly.
First turn inward and measure yourself—
only speak when your heart is free of deceit.

The immortals guard their arts, not out of secrecy,
but because few possess the karmic roots.
Were it so easy for all to attain,
would the celestial mechanism be so lightly shared?

To study the Dao or seek immortality, fix your will,
hold fast to one resolve without doubt.
Steady your heart from beginning to end—
as gold is tested by fire, so too is the Way.

Your mind is thick with brambles,
good roots sprout only to become demons.
If you first align with the immortals’ intent,
your portion is set—what more can be done?

A clouded mind breeds wicked words and deeds,
and every act becomes a mistake.
Seek nothing from others, desire nothing for yourself—
better to have never begun at all.

Reflect on this truth,
and let your heart rest firm.
Look at those who’ve attained through the ages—
their minds were never thus.

I long to meet a true seeker,
yet when I do, their hearts shift like shadows.
Why speak of transmission as easy or hard?
It is the gate of mystery that remains untested.

Ask yourself why you do not reflect—
leave your fate to the vault of heaven.
Simply tend your heart and follow your nature,
for musk’s fragrance needs no proclamation.

The Jade Toad was once a mountain hermit,
yet a kindred spirit is hard to find.
Now, while my straw sandals are still sturdy,
my face flushes like peach blossoms, my eyes dark and clear.

Jade Toad, why do you still scheme?
Better to brush your sleeves and depart.
If there were a place to save others,
Zhong and Lü would already be flaunting their prowess.

No one knows—
I go alone,
white clouds stretch a thousand miles, unturning.
I return to guard my three-legged cauldron,
simmering the bright wind and clear moon.

**Tea Song**
Willow eyes steal glances at flying plum blossoms,
a hundred flowers bow to the east wind’s breath.
Spring arrives in the valley’s source unnoticed,
until a thunderclap startles the dawn branches.

The branches dare not unfurl their banners,
first offering jade and gold in marvelous display.
Sparrow-tongue buds hold spring but cannot speak—
only the morning dew and mist understand.

Plucked with dew and mist, they are taken home,
steamed, then pounded thousands of times.
Shaped into three hundred moon-round cakes,
fire’s art tempered with both civil and martial skill.

At the mill’s edge, jade dust swirls like flying catkins,
pearls scatter from the grindstone like golden threads.
A small cauldron of Shou Shan bronze,
fresh spring water boiled over a lively flame.

Crab-eye bubbles vanish, fish-eyes rise,
the wind and rain whisper through scraping pine.
A flowered bowl of Dingzhou red jade,
brimming with auspicious snow and floating white foam.

Green clouds enter the mouth, birthing fragrant winds,
a boundless orchid and angelica perfume.
Cool breezes rise beneath the arms, pores open—
all worldly cares washed from the withered gut.

Have you not seen
Meng the Remonstrator,
whose tea startled Lu Tong from sleep?
Or Bai Juyi,
whose gift of tea roused Ma Xi from drunkenness?

Lu Yu wrote the *Classic of Tea*,
Cao Hui composed the *Inscription of Tea*.
Minister Fan, the upright, smiled over tea,
his gauze hat askew as he brewed stone sprouts.

Su Xu saw rain like cinnabar,
dotting each cup with calamus blossoms.
Su Dongpo mastered the art of boiling water,
often seeking a sip after wine’s end.

Zhao Zhou dreamed of meeting Nanquan,
lovingly kindling incense to steep tea’s green.
We brew tea with savor,
first blending it with the divine water of Hua Chi.

A plot in the cinnabar field, self-cultivated,
golden lads and maidens gather the harvest.
Heavenly furnace and earthen tripod follow the seasons,
refining yellow sprouts, boiling white snow.

Its taste like sweet dew, finer than aged wine,
drinking it, one feels lingering illness vanish.
The body lightens, ready to ascend the celestial road—
who knows if heaven has tea?

**Song of the Great Dao**
Crow flies gold, hare runs jade,
the three realms a single grain of millet,
mountains and rivers, the great earth—how many years of dust?
Yin and yang inverted, plunging into the mysterious valley.

Man’s life flickers like stone sparks and lightning,
a few guest magpies lodging in the branches.
Sang fields and blue seas shift through spring and autumn,
heaven and earth never release Kan and Li from their embrace.

In the high nine heavens, wind and moon chime,
the immortals’ bellies hold no idle sorrow.
Those who study immortality in the world
transform their hearts to purity and elegance.

Unread in alchemical classics, they yearn for ascension,
pointing at shadows, prattling of emptiness to deceive and frighten.
Sometimes they gallop with their three-inch tongues,
or feign muteness on the street corners.

Amid the upright, beware of the crooked;
within the true, discern the false.
If you are a person of clarity and detachment,
yourself beyond all things, utterly unburdened.

Gather qi and concentrate spirit,
to refine the golden elixir—how many will you fool?
Luring thieves into your home to open the treasure vault,
unaware there is another self beyond the self.

Seek the self within the self,
where harmonious qi and emptiness are a spring in a pot.
Capture the six thieves with your hands,
chew the three corpses alive in your mouth.

The three corpses and six thieves were never real—
they arise only from the heart’s frantic busyness.
The Jade Emperor does not merely cherish his edicts,
but demands the guarding of spirit and qi.

This spirit and qi congeal into true essence,
called Pure Yang, the ninety-nine cycles complete.

At this moment, the sacred embryo is complete,
a somersault off the ten-thousand-foot cliff.
Lead and mercury are but dung and dust,
dragon and tiger mere chickens and dogs.
White gold and qi, tin in countless forms,
quicksilver and cinnabar entice each other—
white snow and yellow sprouts take no shape,
the divine pool’s waters flow without a spring.

Failing to turn back with that single move,
you rush through wind and rain in all directions.
Rushing in all directions to seek a master,
when you find a false teacher’s guidance,
you follow blindly—how pitiful!
The great Dao is never far from the square inch of the heart,
its workings subtle, its practice steadfast.

Not through visualization,
not through intention,
not by circulating essence and qi within the body—
seal one pass, and a hundred are secure.
Turn the body, and the path becomes truly easy.

The heart without a heart has no form,
within the formless, the infant’s spirit is nurtured.
To learn immortality is to reach the infant’s state—
the moon shines bright in the cold pool’s stillness,
withered wood blooms with fragrance beyond,
by the sea, pledging vows with the white gulls.
A moment’s effort is easily done,
the great elixir is but a moment’s achievement.

Clinging to strange words and marvelous speech,
countless metaphors are just like this.
Let life take its course, let death take its course—
only ensure you are master of yourself.
Clouds in the sky can be bound,
the moon in water can be grasped.
The two words "body" and "heart"—
are both fire and medicine.
Tortoise and snake, crow and hare—all idle talk,
husband and wife, male and female—cast them all aside.

Have you not seen?
From emptiness arises the natural,
from the natural arises the one qi,
from the one qi, things are formed,
when qi is full, heaven and earth divide.
Heaven and earth have no mind,
the two qi are naturally so.
All things flourish and wither,
the great reckoning has its end and beginning.
Grasp the precelestial’s natural origin,
and you hold the true root of nature and life.

The *Dao De Jing*’s five thousand words,
the *Yin Fu Jing*’s three hundred characters—
form and spirit, nature and life,
body and heart, spirit and qi,
their union forms the great treasure,
this is the principle of the golden elixir.
Most cling to the world,
mistaking effort for effortlessness,
but the resolute man can comprehend.
Chew on these words in quiet moments—
if even the ancient sages and worthies
established teachings to guide others, how could they be wrong?
If you can stride straight down the direct path,
a single road leads straight to the Three Pure Ones’ pavilion.

Beneath the Three Pure Ones’ pavilion lies a mass of marrow,
day and night its radiance gleams like jade.
Cloud Valley Daoist, an immortal among men,
his bones refined, his qi flourishing—truly noble.
Yet for years he was bound by the red dust,
sixty-four years of error.
Scraping away the dust and grime, his eyes open wide,
he lets out a long whistle and returns.

Immortals rely on but two things—
just a touch of foolishness among men,
and suddenly they too reach Penglai.
The Master of Mount Wuyi speaks to you,
seeing in you the true bones of an immortal.
Now I no longer refine form and spirit,
sometimes wild, sometimes unruly—
in cold, the elixir field’s fire warms me,
in hunger, I feast on the snow of Jade Lake.

Last year, my immortal teacher sent word:
my name is recorded in the Golden Tower.
A vain name in the world, hard to escape,
now my heart and conduct stray even further.
How can I bear the Jade Emperor’s pity?
His summons to return—I have not yet complied.

**Prayer for Rain**
Heaven and earth are deaf,
sun and moon are blind,
the world suffers drought, yet no rain falls,
mountains and rivers wither, grasses and trees parch.
The carefree in heaven hear the people’s suffering—
I shall ride a crane down to Fusang,
rouse the weary dragon with a single strike,
bind the scorching yang spirits below the Star of Kuí.
With iron chains, send them to Deng’s estate.

Command the Thunder Lord,
dispatch the Lightning Mother,
in an instant, the world is transformed,
wind and clouds swallow and exhale.
The old general of divine martial prowess,
a single drop from heaven’s golden vase,
threads through the sky like a shuttle’s weave.
It becomes frozen rain across the four heavens,
sweeping away the world’s heat.

If some wag reports this to the lord,
soon they’ll seek the rain-bringing immortal—
but he is already on the Yangtze, a single oar’s sound.

**Five Poems on Mount Wuyi**

**I**
No rainbow bridge spans to Manting Pavilion,
only lingering emerald waters and verdant peaks.
Guests arrive to uncover rare wonders—
at the fifth bend of the stream, the great hermit’s screen.

**II**
Dragon-brewed wine from the Immortal’s Palm crag,
crane cries in the clouds above Manting Peak.
With but a spoonful of dust from my bright window,
I would leap to pay homage to the Lord of Wuyi.

**III**
Fragrant grasses part the flowing green waters,
ancient pines borrow the distant mountains’ blue.
Alone, I lift my iron flute by the stream,
playing for the immortals deep in the cave.

**IV**
The Perfected One of Manifest Dao has gone, never to return,
Manting’s old towers are no more.
His descendants lean against cold pines,
as the sun sets and the wind mourns with the apes’ lament.

**V**
Peaks rise in a thousand layers of jade-green kingfisher,
the stream flows for ten thousand acres of azure glass.
Visitors come here, drunk, and depart—
how many have truly reached Wuyi?

---

**Inscribed at Purple Mushroom Abbey**
Before Mount Wuyi, a single whistle—
clouds darken, mists thicken, wild apes startle.
Leisurely, I part tattered sleeves to hold wind and moon,
drunk, I clutch my gourd to bind ghosts and spirits.
Brandishing the silver toad, I stir heaven and earth,
by night, I boil the golden cauldron to cook the stars.
Lost in slumber, I forget the path of schemes—
my body is a wheel of crimson flame.

---

**Inscribed in Master Zheng Tongmiao’s Chamber**
A few games of uncontentious chess,
a cup or two of self-poured wine.
Let it be—flow with the world as it is,
and when the elixir is complete, cloud-cranes will come of their own.

---

**Miscellaneous Verses on the Nine Bends**

**First Bend: Cave of Ascending Perfection**
Eagerly, I seek the immortal’s abode,
at the mouth of the Cave of Ascending Perfection, bees hold court.
A spring stream ripples with cold jade-green,
carrying petals of red peach blossoms.

**Second Bend: Jade Maiden Peak**
A singular peak, flower-adorned by the water,
its jade bones and crystalline flesh like a maiden’s form.
Mist-sleeved, clad in rosy clouds, spring veiled in rain,
her cloud-coiffed, mist-tangled hair combed by the dawn wind.

**Third Bend: Rock of the Immortal’s Loom**
Woven into rainbow skirts to fend off the chill wind,
the jade shuttle, with a flick of the hand, transforms into a dragon.
The Weaving Maiden returns to the Milky Way’s edge—
the cave’s white clouds and empty loom remain.

**Fourth Bend: Golden Rooster Rock**
The cold pool brims, reflecting the moon in its depths,
the hollow valley swallows the mist.
The golden rooster first heralds dawn within the cave,
with a single *yi-wo* cry, it soars into the sky.

**Fifth Bend: Iron Flute Pavilion**
A vast expanse of night’s essence stirs the pure wind,
a white crane alights upon the verdant pine.
The moon chimes in the empty mountains as the iron flute plays—
a single note awakens the dragon of Jade Abyss.

**Sixth Bend: Immortal’s Palm Peak**
The immortal, grasping vines, ascends the jade-green cliff,
where an ancient alchemical terrace once stood.
To this day, the stone bears the imprint of her palm—
ten spring-onion fingers, layered with green moss.

**Seventh Bend: Stone Tang Temple**
The high monk penetrated Zhaozhou’s Chan,
uprooting the temple to relocate it to Tusita Heaven.
In the second month of the second year of Tiansheng,
a single night’s thunderstorm shook the mountains and rivers.

**Eighth Bend: Drum Tower Rock**
A towering cliff, a stone tower soars ten thousand feet,
cloud-wrapped, mist-bound, overlooking the cold stream.
Long ago, the Manting Pavilion hosted the descendants’ feast—
the stone drum was carried away to the ancient ferry.

**Ninth Bend: New Village Market**
The setting sun moves the boat to the azure shoal,
beyond the peach blossom grove, green mountains appear.
Suddenly, the sounds of chickens and dogs reach my ears—
without meeting Master Liu, I refuse to return.

---

**Ten Boat Songs of the Nine Bends**
*Mount Wuyi*

**Thirty-Six Peaks of Wuyi**
Thirty-six peaks in wondrous array,
one cleft reveals nine bends in jade-green sway.
White clouds veil the eyes—where to gaze?
Who says immortals dwell in Wuyi’s maze?

**First Bend**
Beneath Manting Peak, the immortal boat glides,
jade blossoms at the cave-mouth, emerald mist abides.
Since the King of Wei ascended to the crimson gate,
the apes on the ridge still mourn their fate.

**Second Bend**
How many generations have passed below the hill?
The pipes and drums of old now silent, still.
The cinnabar furnace sprouts spring grass again,
before Jade Maiden Peak, white clouds remain.

**Third Bend**
The immortal boat moors at the cliff’s brow,
how many autumns since the yellow crane flew now?
Peach blossoms fill the grotto, yet none appear,
for whom does the green stream flow here?

**Fourth Bend**
A thousand acres of autumn light, nowhere to stay,
the limpid pool gleams like polished bronze’s ray.
The golden rooster’s cry topples the moon on high,
cold mist drifts, the wind sighs.

**Fifth Bend**
Who plays the iron flute’s resounding tone?
The stone cliff splits, the old dragon starts alone.
The man of old has swallowed elixir and gone,
through endless ages, autumn grass grows on.

**Sixth Bend**
Before Immortal’s Palm Peak, the immortal’s home,
guests arrive—living water brews fresh tea’s foam.
The host points afar where blue smoke swirls,
a waterfall hangs from the cliff, snipping snow like pearls.

**Seventh Bend**
Still autumn mist veils the emerald bay,
once here stood a Chan gate, now swept away.
The river god moved to the Dragon Palace deep,
one night’s wind and thunder shook the mountains from sleep.

**Eighth Bend**
A few sandpipers drift on the azure stream,
reeds and flowers on both banks, dusk’s sorrowful gleam.
From Drum Tower Rock, a flute’s single note—
startled, the phoenix tree sheds autumn’s coat.

**Ninth Bend**
Mountain market bathed in sunset’s glow,
a village of chickens and dogs in fading light’s show.
Rice fields rise and fall like a chessboard’s play,
a few crows and egrets take flight this day.

**Eleven Poems on Wuyi’s Scenes**

**Spring**
Rain clears, mist congeals in the setting sun,
the cuckoo’s cry breaks how many hearts as one?
The east wind stirs no sentiment here,
countless fallen blossoms—spring’s fragrance clear.

**Summer**
Orioles call the green willows to sprout new leaves,
butterflies urge the lotus to bloom, fresh and brief.
A sudden waft of warm wind arrives,
as the sun sets, crows clamor in hives.

**Autumn**
Rain’s aftermath—moss like brocade heaps,
sunrise gilds morning sunflowers in golden deeps.
Facing the scene, a clear whistle rings,
startling the wild apes in green willow springs.

**Winter**
Snow buries the mountain path at dusk’s close,
a single plum branch heralds spring’s repose.
Last night by the stream, the water ran cold,
wind rolls crimson clouds as dawn unfolds.

**Dawn**
Wind stirs a thousand trees, waking roosting magpies,
the moon sets west, the apes’ cries rise.
Clouds part to reveal the temple deep in green,
a bell tolls before the jade cliff serene.

**Dusk**
Green clouds, red trees—evening’s query,
the sun sinks, crows scatter, the sky grows weary.
The herb-gatherer strays, lost in return,
the thatched hut stands empty, the brushwood gate shut in concern.

**Journeying**
Rain’s trailing feet retreat with evening’s haze,
straw sandals, bamboo staff tread verdant ways.
The east wind unbinds spring’s intent,
loosing fallen blossoms, crows cry as they’re sent.

**Abiding**
Moon bright, wind clear—three paths of bamboo,
apes cry, cranes shriek through a window’s gloom.
Opening the door, the mountain’s green pours in,
testing the stars with burning cypress within.

**Seated**
A thousand peaks, apes call beneath moon’s glow,
ten thousand sounds, wind howls—autumn’s show.
Mist dampens moss, smoke drifts in haze,
white clouds drift, dreams cross Penglai’s ways.

**Reclining**
Deep in descending mist, no one comes near,
white clouds hush, moss veils the ear.
Pine flowers fall, the crow’s voice stills,
a pillow of pure wind returns dreams’ thrills.

**Closing**
The Daoist’s heart transforms with all things’ flow,
facing scenes without thought, poems naturally grow.
Verses spontaneously reveal creation’s art,
once composed, creation falls silent, apart.

---

**Inscribed at the Meditation Hut**
Here at dusk, the wind sighs cold,
before the cliff, the alchemy furnace lies empty, old.
Unbearable—the flowers fall, mist takes flight,
again, the cold ape weeps for Master Hui in the night.

---

**For Daoist Chen of Lin’an’s Tianqing Temple, Traveling to Wuyi**

The seven Min lands teem with hills and streams,
the two Huaidong regions favor wind and moon’s dreams.
Xiang’s mist and clouds, Ba and Guang’s snow,
gathered in Wulin—tell your master slow.

---

**Ode to Snow**
The Frost Maiden’s breast holds snow’s brew,
snow as wine, dew as its brew.
When the snow ripens, Feilian’s drunk,
the east wind’s sour, raging all night long.

---

**Inscribed at the Verdant Pavilion**
Sun strikes fresh moss, casting green coins,
mountains rise like flowered screens, grass like felt joins.
Spend the moss-coins on wind and moon’s grace,
mountain screens low, grass-felt bed’s embrace.

---

**Inscribed on the West Pavilion’s Wall**
Through wind and rain, how many days of ease?
No need to toil in the world’s web, at peace.
Morning drinks a flask of vermilion phoenix marrow,
evening feasts on eight ounces of black dragon’s sorrow.
Breaking free from the vulgar net, nothing to do,
binding time to preserve youth’s hue.
Last night, dreaming of heaven’s ascent,
jade towers and halls—intolerable cold, heaven’s rent.

---

**For Recluse Pan**

At winter solstice, refine cinnabar bright,
at summer solstice, refine mercury’s light.
Keep them in an earthen crucible’s hold,
lest lead and mercury part ways untold.
Mother and child in mutual embrace,
fire’s warmth constant in its place.
Thus, through endless time’s span,
the work complete, ascend on purple clouds’ span.

**Again**
Dragon and tiger battle through cycles dire,
crow and hare meet in seven and nine’s fire.
Kan and Li align at tiger and dragon’s hour,
Gen and Xun govern rabbit and rooster’s power.
A single grain like a crimson tangerine,
through a thousand ages, it ne’er declines.
On the fifteenth night of the eighth moon,
three cups of winter solstice wine—fortune hewn.

---

**For Magistrate Zhao**

Half a catty of thunder-fire roasts red apricot,
a drop of dew congeals on the jade lotus picked.
Within the brocade curtains, hide the jade dog,
in the treasure vase, nurture the golden goose’s log.
Lead flowers bloom like green herbs’ array,
mercury leaves sprout crimson branches’ display.
Ask not of infant boy or maiden fair,
seek the old Yellow Woman without care.

---

**For Zhao Cuiyun**

The Golden Duke and maiden reach the Yellow House,
seizing the dark turtle and red snake’s drowse.
In the crescent moon furnace, jade elixir’s brewed,
in the cinnabar tripod, golden flowers imbued.
Rushing to the Sea of Qi, named Vermilion Steed,
flying to the Muddy Pellet, the White Crow’s creed.

---

**For Qu Yizhen**

Earth’s essence, heaven’s soul, sun and moon’s might,
seized in the tripod, cooked in timely light.
Tortoise and snake vie in their arts below,
soon dragon’s roar and tiger’s growl will show.
Divine water and flowery pool first unite,
yellow sprout and white snow come to light.

These are where the medicinal spoon is sipped,
gradually drawn, gradually added, gradually ripened.

**For Elder Huang Xueyu**

To cultivate rank is right—to cultivate Heaven’s rank,
but choosing office pales beside choosing Heaven’s court.
Blue steeds may roam the imperial capital with ease,
yet white cranes flying to the crimson palace prove hard.

**For Clerk Chen**

Before the brocade-weaving hall, all affairs grow still,
turning your head, you enter the Wuyi Mountains.
Had Zongfang of old learned as you have done,
white cranes and azure clouds would pose no challenge.

**Three Poems for Master Chen**

Bright as twin awls, those ancient eyes of yours,
wielding the great hammer of ascent in hand.
Suddenly you meet old Zhongli,
seizing his long beard to ask, "Who are you?"

In the wooden man’s grasp, a mud-sword swings,
on the stone maiden’s brow, iron flowers bloom.
In the first year of Longhan, winter’s Shangsi day,
we meet and share a cup of Zhaozhou’s tea.

Turning over, you rush toward the jade gourd,
the divine water and flowery pool dry in a night.
Suddenly, walking by night, you see the moon’s shadow—
a bright pearl rolls within a crystal tray.

**To the Tune of *Man Jiang Hong*: Ode to Mount Wuyi**

I recall Qin’s time—mid-autumn day,
Wuyi’s nine bends lay.
Mist still, slanting sun scarce spans,
cold crows on withered wood.
Thirty-six peaks congeal dawn’s emerald,
a stream’s flow births autumn’s green.
Just as osmanthus blooms scatter heaven’s fragrance,
golden grains take flight.

Divine guests—gold elixir ripe.
Jade pipes descend, clouds gather thick.
The stone sheds its bones anew,
yet clings to crimson flesh.
Midnight’s moonlight bright as day,
the Jade Emperor spreads silken tiers.
Laughing, I turn to see the curtained pavilion—
only pines and bamboo remain.

---

**To the Tune of *Nian Nu Jiao*: Ode to Snow**

Within the Moon Palace,
heaven’s blossoms drift,
speckling the void like willow fluff.
Everywhere, towers and terraces gleam jade,
midnight’s wind unceasing.
Ten thousand li of jade-walled cities,
a thousand homes of pearl-tiled roofs—
no trace of Penglai’s isle.
I call my boy:
go, seek the plum blossoms,
climb that tree.

The blind dares not be lifted,
the lion’s form just shaped.
A beauty steals a glance,
a fisherman by the stream,
his straw cloak layered thick,
a few sandpipers silent.
Bamboo snaps in the courtyard,
pines stiffen by the path—
all the world is thus.
Ask when it will clear:
only when the drifts melt,
and no rain falls.

---

**To the Tune of *Shui Diao Ge Tou*: Ode to Tea**

A spring rain in February,
last night’s single thunderclap.
Spears and banners vie to unfurl by Jianxi,
spring’s hues claim the lead.
Plucking sparrow-tongued buds from the branch,
with dew and mist they’re pounded fine,
refined into purple-gold mounds.
Ground to boundless fragrance,
green dust takes flight.

Draw fresh spring water,
brew with living flame,
put it to the test.
Set down the rabbit-hair brush,
the bowl’s savor lingers on the tongue.
It rouses the Green State’s envoy,
vanquishes a million sleep demons,
leaving no dream of Yang Terrace.
A breeze stirs beneath both armpits—
I would ascend to Penglai.

---

**To the Tune of *Shui Diao Ge Tou*: Ten Self-Reflections**

The formula for golden liquid and returning elixir:
nurture the child within the void.
No other guard is needed,
only divine water entering the flowery pool.
Gather celestial true lead and mercury,
in a moment they naturally unite.
A single drop of purple-gold fat,
ten months of celestial fire,
the jade crucible births a mushroom of jade.

Do not be foolish—
now the secret is revealed,
doubt not.
The workings of heaven and earth
are but the interplay of Kan and Li.
Why does green jade hide in stone?
Why does the pearl nest in the clam’s belly?
By this, the celestial mechanism is revealed.
How much more the mystery within mystery—
not easily shared with you.

To the Tune of *Shui Diao Ge Tou*: Ten Self-Reflections (III)

Enduring hardships untold,
I’ve learned but this small measure.
Unkempt hair and bare feet—
through streets and alleys I preach the effortless Way.
No straw cloak or bamboo hat,
through how many winds, mists, rains, and snows?
This is living hell itself:
a skeleton of bones,
enduring hunger beyond count.
Hair unbrushed, face unwashed,
yet pity the fool in his own house,
where gold lies scattered on the ground—who knows?
Here, a cry of shame;
there, a sigh of fate’s decree.
My face breaks into laughter.
A white crane soars above the azure clouds—
remember this moment.

(IV)

Who knows the bitterness of bitterness?
Hardship upon hardship—truly hard.
Seeking and inquiring after the Dao,
I know not how many mountains I’ve crossed.
Enduring every wind, rain, and storm,
witnessing frost’s congealment and snow’s freeze.
Hunger only deepens the cold.
No one in sight to ask—
where to knock at the mysterious pass?
A fortunate cause,
a transmitted oral formula,
refining the golden elixir.
Through streets and alleys,
wordless, I inwardly rejoice.
Though disheveled and unwashed,
now in my ninetieth year,
my face remains that of a child.
The celestial decree for ascension has not yet come—
for now, I embrace this serenity.

The world’s wandering travelers,
their qi and temperaments by chance aligned.
For a time they gather,
then suddenly scatter like clouds, like flowing water.
Sated with the wind and moon of Min,
fond too of Zhe’s mountains and rivers,
with staff and sandals they roam carefree.
The Supreme embraces high and low—
all find this freedom from care.

Right and wrong,
fame and profit—
let them all cease.
Once awakened to oneself,
one must not slacken, burying one’s head.
Be it southern prefecture or northern commandery,
whether Zhang the great or Li the small,
passing through, they stay.
Just eat the rice that comes,
and cast not the world’s worries.

(V)

Those who have not met a true master
suffer day and night in fear and dread.
Yet when they do meet one,
receiving some oral formula, they forget all else.
Alas, time slips by unheeded,
heedless of essence’s decline and qi’s exhaustion,
frittering life away in vain.
Why not turn back and set to work,
gathering and refining the elixir?

People of the world,
though they know the Way,
cannot practice it.
Pitifully buried in oblivion—
how can they not awaken?
They only speak of it with their lips,
while their hearts hold not a trace,
ever poring over alchemical classics.
Hell’s gates stand open—
hasten, prepare your journey ahead.

(VI)

How laughable, the world’s wayfarers,
all lost in the drifting stream.

Entangled in karmic bonds,
reckon it not your romantic fate.
Failing to seek the living path,
you bear the yoke like a willow bound to the eaves,
unwilling to let go.
Thirty-six thousand days,
enduring a century’s sorrows.
Having gained this human form,
do not waste it—
hasten to cultivate.
As the crow flies and the hare runs,
in an instant, death draws near.
This fleeting pleasure before your eyes
cannot escape the two words: impermanence.
How can you remain a prisoner of the dust?
Refine the Golden Elixir and depart—
through ten thousand kalpas, you shall be free.

(VII)

There is a method of practice,
no need to ask a master’s transmission.
Simply teach yourself:
when hungry, eat; when tired, sleep.
No need to move essence or circulate qi,
nor to perform exercises or sit in meditation—
just tend to the field of contention.
All day without thought or worry,
this is the living immortal.

Be neither deluded nor cunning,
neither reckless nor mad.
Follow nature’s nourishment,
for fate is entrusted to heaven.
Let nothing be subject to calculation—
the Creator arranges all well,
and mortals should yield to nature.
The world’s flavors are but this—
how many millennia shall you cling to them?

(VIII)

A carefree wanderer,
with no affairs weighing on the heart.
Wrapped in a cloth turban and paper robe,
a single gourd and straw hat—
thus he roams at ease.
Taking only the wind and moon that accompany him,
he makes them his own enjoyment—
what more could he seek?
Pointing backward, two or three years,
he has traversed a hundred lands.
A hundred lands—
clouds vast, waters long.
As waters flow and clouds scatter,
how many autumns of withered blossoms have passed?
Let the crow fly and the hare run—
I know not cold or heat,
and all things are at rest.
If you ask me for the secret of the Golden Elixir,
the stone maiden rides the golden ox.

(IX)

No need to seek divine water,
nor inquire of the flowery pond.
Yellow sprout and white snow—
reckon them all but empty names.
This earth-ox and heaven-horse
are but the departing dragon and arriving tiger—
no need for further doubt.
The medicine has no weight,
the firing times no fixed hour.

The crescent moon furnace,
the cinnabar tripod—
all are not so.
True lead, true mercury—
what use is refining if not already refined?
Your own golden lord and jade maiden,
gradually forged into one,
breathing like an infant in the womb.
If you do not believe Zhang Ping Shu,
then whom else shall you ask?

(X)

To become an immortal, the work seems idle play.
At the first stir of yang, the jade furnace ignites—
refining the returning elixir.
Seize heaven’s soul and earth’s spirit,
no need for dragon’s leap or tiger’s bound—
the tripod brims with dry mercury blossoms.
Let the river chariot turn as it will,
the path leads straight to the Mud Pill Palace.

Gather golden essence,
harvest wooden fluid,
passing the three barriers.
Yet gold and wood remain sundered—
how then ascend Jade Capital Mountain?
Find the vein of Cao Creek’s path,
take the divine water of the flowery pond,
and forge the Purple Gold Pill.
No more hunger or cold—
in heaven, men will ask of you.

*Water Melody on Cultivation*

The earthen crucible, gentle fire,
the sacred key stirs like spring thunder.
The three fields rise and fall,
a single path leads to the numinous terrace.
Here dwells the true dragon, true wisdom.
Here, a sigh of shame;
there, a chant of numbers—
all the while, a face wreathed in smiles.
The white crane soars on azure clouds—
remember this moment well.

(III)

Who knows the bitterness of bitterness?
Difficult, oh so difficult.
Seeking the Dao, I know not
how many mountains I’ve crossed.
Enduring wind’s slant and rain’s lash,
facing frost’s grip and snow’s freeze.
Hunger, then cold again—
no one to ask, nowhere to knock at the mysterious pass.

Yet a fortunate cause,
a transmitted oral formula,
refining the golden elixir.
In streets and alleys,
silent, unseen joy arises.
Though unkempt and soiled,
now in my ninetieth year,
my face remains a child’s.
Before the edict of ascension descends,
I’ll enjoy this tranquility.

(IV)

(V)

Wanderers of the world beneath heaven,
whose qi and tastes chance to align—
for a fleeting moment, they gather,
then suddenly scatter like clouds, like flowing water.
Sated with the wind and moon of Min,
enamored of Zhe’s mountains and streams,
they wander free with staff and sandals.
The Supreme embraces high and low,
yet all one gains is freedom from care.

Right and wrong,
fame and profit—
let them all rest.
Once awakened to oneself,
one must not slacken, head buried in the earth.
Be it southern prefecture or northern commandery,
whether great Zhang or petty Li,
passing through, they are detained no more.
Just eat the rice that comes,
and cast not the sorrows of the vulgar.

(VI)

Those who have not met a radiant teacher
suffer day and night in anxious dread.
Yet once they meet one,
receiving some oral formula, they forget all passion.
Alas, time slips by unheeded,
heedless of essence’s decline, qi’s exhaustion,
frittering life away in vain.
Why not turn back and set to work,
gathering and refining the elixir?

People of the world—
those who know the Way
cannot put it into practice.
Pitiful, buried in oblivion,
how can they not awaken?
All they do is speak with their lips,
while their hearts hold not a trace,
ever poring over alchemical classics.
The gates of hell stand open—
hasten, then, to prepare the journey ahead.

(VII)

How laughable, the travelers of the dusty world,
all lost in the current of delusion.

Entangled by karmic bonds,
reckon it not your romantic fate.
Failing to seek the living Way,
you bear the yoke like a willow bound to the eaves,
unwilling to let go and be free.
Thirty-six thousand days—
a hundred years of sorrow endured.
Having gained this human form,
do not squander it; hasten to cultivate.
As the crow flies and the hare runs,
in an instant death draws near.
This fleeting pleasure before your eyes
cannot escape the two words: impermanence.
How can you remain a prisoner of the dust?
Refine the Golden Elixir and depart,
for ten thousand kalpas you shall roam free.

(VII)

There is a method of practice—
no need to seek a teacher’s transmission.
Simply: when hungry, eat; when tired, sleep.
Why trouble with moving essence or circulating qi,
or bother with exercises and seated meditation?
Just tend to the field of contention.
All day without thought or care—
this is the living immortal.

Be not deluded, cunning, or erratic.
Follow the natural course of eating and drinking,
for fate is entrusted to Heaven’s decree.
Let nothing be governed by calculation,
for the Creator arranges all well;
simply yield to nature.
The world’s flavors are but this—
how many millennia shall you cling to them?

(VIII)

A carefree wanderer,
with nothing to weigh upon the heart.
Wrapped in a paper cloak and cloth headscarf,
a single gourd and straw hat—
thus he roams at ease.
Taking only the wind and moon that follow him,
he makes them his own enjoyment;
what more could he seek?
Pointing backward, two or three years,
he has traversed a hundred lands.
A hundred lands—
clouds vast and distant, waters long and flowing.
Waters flow and clouds scatter;
how many autumns of withered blossoms have passed?
Heedless of the crow’s flight or the hare’s run,
I know not cold or heat;
all things are utterly stilled.
Ask me of the Golden Elixir’s secret—
a stone maiden rides the golden ox.

(IX)

No need to seek divine water,
nor inquire of the Flowery Pond.
Yellow sprout and white snow—
all are but empty names.
This earthly ox and heavenly horse
are the departing dragon and arriving tiger;
no need for further doubt.
The medicine has no weight,
the firing times require no set hour.

The crescent moon furnace,
the cinnabar tripod—
all are not so.
True lead and true mercury—
what need is there for refining if not refined?
Your own golden lord and jade maiden,
gradually forged into one,
breathing like an infant in the womb.
If you do not believe Zhang Ping Shu,
then ask someone else.

(X)

To become an immortal, the work seems idle.
At the first stir of yang, the jade furnace ignites,
refining the returning elixir.
Seize the celestial soul and earthly spirit—
no need for dragon’s leap or tiger’s bound,
the mercury flowers fill the crucible, now dry.
Let the river chariot turn,
the path leads straight to the Mud Pill Palace.

Refine the golden essence,
gather the wood sap,
pass the three barriers.
Yet gold and wood remain apart—
how to ascend Jade Capital Mountain?
Find the vein of Cao Creek’s path,
then take the divine water of the Flowery Pond,
forging the Purple Gold Pellet.
No more hunger or cold—
in heaven, men will ask of you.

*Water Tune Song on Cultivation*

The earthen crucible, gentle fire,
the sacred key stirs like spring thunder.
The three fields rise and descend,
a single path leads to the Spirit Terrace.
Here dwell true dragon and true tiger,
naturally harmonized lead and mercury,
the infant forms the true embryo.
Within water, grasp the bright moon;
in the heart’s earth, flowers bloom.

One revolution of the work,
thirty days,
ninety days.
Withdraw and replenish the qi’s seasons,
refining until the sun’s blood replaces the skeleton.
The four images and five phases gather,
congealing in one place,
the square inch free of dust.
Man resides in the Mud Pill Palace,
the return path leads to Penglai.

*Spring in Qin Garden on Cultivation*

To become an immortal,
the elixir work seems idle.
The jade maiden rides the dragon,
the golden lord mounts the tiger;
the jade furnace blazes,
the earthen crucible grows cold.
Lead conceals silver,
mercury is drawn from cinnabar,
divine water and Flowery Pond lie above and below.
Within the three fields,
a single path pierces straight to the Mud Pill Palace.

A thunderclap shakes Kun Mountain,
the true key flies, surging through the twin passes of the spine.
Behold white snow filling the sky,
yellow sprouts covering the earth,
tortoise and serpent entwined,
crow and hare overturned.
Since ancient times, heaven and earth—
these are the Kan and Li,
ninefold refining forges the Great Return.
The numinous elixir complete,
before ascending to the celestial palace,
remain yet among men.

*Again for Hu Baoyuan*

To become an immortal,
what difficulty lies in the elixir work?
At the thunder’s roar,
yang returns;
the jade furnace blazes,
the golden crucible smokes cold.
The startled maiden rides the dragon,
the golden lord straddles the tiger—
in an instant, the Great Return is achieved.
Within the cinnabar field,
a white crow flies into the Mud Pill Palace.

The river chariot carries it to Kun Mountain,
passing this barrier without the slightest stir.
Seize the tortoise and serpent, crow and hare,
capture them alive—
in a moment, clouds and rain,
a single point becomes the elixir.
White snow fills the sky,
yellow sprouts cover the earth;
ingest this knife’s edge to preserve youth forever.
Constantly nurture it,
so the embryo may shed the bones,
the body dwell among the clouds.

*Courtyard Full of Fragrance on Cultivation*

The crucible uses heaven and earth,
the medicine requires crow and hare;
when idle, refine the golden elixir.
The tiger roars in water,
the red dragon coils in fire.
Moreover, dui lead and zhen mercury,
from the original valley,
ascend to the Mud Pill Palace.
A trifling matter—
Kan and Li reunited,
reversing age to become a child’s face.

The five phases complete the four images,
without regulating the firing times,
it seems idle, yet not.
The six heavens manifest their signs,
jade emerges from Kun Mountain.
Without stirring the slightest cloud or rain,
in an instant,
it pierces straight through the three barriers.
Within the Yellow Court,
yang returns—
the elixir is complete in a moment.

*Again*

Two kinds of mercury and lead,
the Yellow Dame mediates their union,
true tiger and true dragon in suchness.
A year’s transformation,
compressed into a single moment.
Within the furnace, the seed is gently nurtured,
the mysterious pearl’s qi-like image penetrates the three palaces.
At the juncture of metal and wood,
red water is refined,
white blood flows freely.

Within nothingness, the embryo takes form—
tortoise and serpent, crow and hare,
meet in vagueness.
But Kan and Li achieve balance,
intermingling in conception.
Having attained the life vein of true emptiness,
within heaven and earth,
all things are spring wind.
Beyond yin and yang,
the natural couple—
a single point brings success.

*Moon Over the River – Winter Solstice for Hu Taixian*

Watching the Dipper’s handle turn,
the celestial revolution,
suddenly I grasp the immortal’s wondrous secret.
A single point of true yang,
born in Kan’s position,
fills Li’s palace’s gap.
Creation is soundless,
fire arises in water,
the wonder lies in the Void-Danger Grotto.
This year’s winter solstice,
plum blossoms still congeal in snow.

The ancient sages on this day sealed their gates,
allowing no comings or goings,
all for the early birth of beings.
Things contain the intent of generation,
precisely at the hour of zi’s beginning and hai’s end.
Since ancient times, heaven and earth—
these are the Li and Kan,
unceasing day by day.
Now that I’ve seen through it,
the golden crow flies into the toad’s cave.

*Water Tune Song*

Once in the Palace of the Void Emperor,
I chanted and sang amid purple clouds.
I know not what transgression
caused me to be exiled with you.
By chance at the mouth of Golden Flower Grotto,
I suddenly saw Helan Xi,
Laozi standing tall among the crowd like a dragon.
Hand in hand, we returned to immortal seclusion,
laughing and talking, summoning the celestial wind.

Suddenly we met,
in a fleeting moment,
the wine cup was empty.
When shall we meet again,
singing in harmony, pouring golden goblets?
I fear within Mount Wuyi,
through the ages, apes will cry and cranes shriek,
before we tread the flying rainbow.
You wish to return to the immortals—
I will follow in your footsteps.

On the eighteenth day of the seventh month in the bingzi year, rain fell; a great wind arose in the afternoon, prompting these reflections.

*Where does the lone leaf fly?*
*The heavens and earth stir with the western wind.*
*Waking from wine at night,*
*a thousand acres of moonlight drench the curtained chamber.*
*Beyond the frontier, the guest geese have come—*
*ten li of green lotus fragrance fills the land,*
*while in the marshlands, the reeds bloom red.*
*All things grow crisp and fresh;*
*autumn rain drips on the parasol trees.*

By the Fishing Terrace,
a man casts his line—
what deep delight!
On the waters of the vast river,
mist-chilled waves shear the crimson maples.
Time steals away unseen;
gazing in the mirror, my ruddy face remains,
yet turning back, the swallow’s nest is empty.
A single note from an iron flute at dawn—
it rouses the dragons of the Five Abysses.

*Again*

A man of extraordinary mettle,
all things beneath heaven settle in his heart.
He studied calligraphy, he studied swordplay—
neither brought him success.
Then he resolved to don the black robe and learn the Buddha’s Way,
striking out with one swift fist
to shatter the Great Void.
Yet in the end, his temples sprouted gray;
he bowed again to the Jade Purity Lord.

Twenty years—
wasted, worn away,
a tumbleweed adrift.
This time, returning,
to the third peak beneath Mount Wuyi.
He will dwell in his old hermitage,
a bowl of water, a bundle of firewood, a measure of rice,
a lively fire to brew a thick brew.
Laughing, he points to the path of his return—
beyond the Weak Water, bound by the sea.

On the Abbot’s Birthday

Twin temples still threaded with black,
a pair of eyes—dark, square pupils.
All call him Zhaoqing’s old immortal.
For a time, he left Penglai’s Weak Waters,
donned his star-crowned robe and moon-woven quilt,
jade pendants swaying in the balmy breeze.
Drunk, he wandered into Peach Blossom Spring,
vanishing without a trace.

Clouds aloft, he scoffs,
blows his iron flute,
plucks the zither’s strings.
Before him, ranks of sword-bearing warriors
bow in reverence, proffering golden goblets.
Tall as pine, poised as crane,
he awaits the sea’s transformation to mulberry fields,
while the elixir in his cauldron glows crimson.
The Jade Emperor descends with a radiant decree—
alone, he rides to the Heavenly Palace.

*Man Jiang Hong: Ode to the White Lotus*

Last night, Chang’e
strayed from her grotto, drunk, returning to the celestial gates.
Why did her jade hairpin fall to earth?
The Water Spirit kept silent.
She took it to the Crystal Palace,
and by dawn, it emerged—full of chatter.
Scented winds blew it into a sky of fragrance,
who could tell the difference?

Fragrant and moist,
pure and immaculate,
white as jade,
colder than snow.
Surely the Jade Emperor’s rear garden
holds no such treasure.
I can only compose a poem in vain admiration,
warning others not to pluck it lightly.
Laughing at the plum’s gaunt frame,
unaware of its true marvel.

*Ruan Lang Gui: Boat Journey, Impressions*

Pale mist congeals in emerald, veiling the chill moor,
the setting sun hangs on the verdant parasol tree.
On the sand, two or three crows call to each other,
as the wind rustles through the reeds.

Where does that flute play a lone note?
By the shore, a man fishes.
A swift sail moors for the night at Tonglu—
I ask if anyone sells wine.

*Xiuzhen Shishu Shangqing Ji, Volume 41 Concluded*
*Xiuzhen Shishu Shangqing Ji, Volume 42*

White Jade Toad of Hainan’s *Ode to the Lazy Old Man’s Studio*

Su Sen of Meishan, old in idleness, named his studio the "Lazy Old Man’s." Was the Old Man truly lazy? Though gulls shunned mandarin ducks, how could he ignore the people’s desperate gaze?

I hear that in his youth, he was not so indolent—whipping his heart with yellow silk, binding his hair in a green robe, gazing at mirrors for glory, and wielding his pen like a blade. He moved with grace within the bounds of Zhou and Kong, soaring beyond Han and Liu. The common folk then pointed and stared, hoping this "lazy" one would take Yu or Gao as his model.

Why, then, did he grow lazy? Before his rank was revealed, his ambition for office was already sated. The scholarly groves grew thin as mist, the sea of learning chilled as waves—how could he not disappoint the hopes of his gowned peers?

Since the Jia Tai era, when he retired to Junyang, then served as the Marquis of Hengyang, and later sought reclusion in Wuyi, the Lazy Old Man had no heart for office, his official passions fading like autumn. Among the gentry, none could sway him with flattery, so he coiled like a dragon, refusing to bring rain.

Now past the age of following his heart, he is even lazier than before, content to idle away his days amid clouds and waters. He has a floating home in Jinhua, the former residence of his late father, the Minister. Before the hall, a space of over a zhang was roofed with eight or nine beams. Three sides were fitted with windows, barely enough to kneel in. Planks replaced bricks, lime smoothed the walls. He kept a single flower, stood a zither of green paulownia, and hung a three-foot sword of Wenyan green jade.

When the Old Man wished to sleep, he transformed into a butterfly, flying to the Land of Hua Xu. When he wished to drink, he stretched his neck like a jade rainbow, draining the sea of wine in one gulp. When he wished to chant, jade trees stirred in the wind, scattering pearls and gems upon the page. When he wished to play chess, the stars scattered in disarray, the sound of carved jade chilling the air. When he wished to dance, the Valley Spirit shifted the jade mountain, his flying sword pointing to the azure sky. When he wished to roam in joy, he dragged his seven-foot staff, letting out a long whistle among the pines. When he wished to sing wildly, a single note from his iron flute summoned the dragon of Jade Abyss.

If streams and mountains gained fame without harming grass or trees, the Old Man wrote poems in kind. If flower spirits wandered lost and moon souls failed to return, he drowned them in wine. He was lazy only in worldly affairs, for in these, his laziness knew no laziness.

At leisure, he played chess; in high spirits, he drank; when elated, he sang; when drunk, he slept. Life was his to command, his will his own. He entrusted each matter to its proper place, his heart free of care, his mind free of affairs—this was the Old Man’s laziness.

To sit in oblivion like Xi Yan, to lose his reflection like Qi, to merge with the void, to transform with all things, to reach the point of forgetting sleep and food—this was true laziness.

The Old Man’s heart, sovereign of his palace, gazed with cold eyes upon the red and purple of the world, like a cuckoo scolding swans and geese, or thorns mocking the finest timber.

In his studio, he followed only his lazy whims. Rain provided ink-water, bamboo supplied winds to sweep his couch, clouds unfurled as curtains to veil the mountains, and grass served as a mat upon the rocks. By day, green serpents coiled from the incense burner; by night, silver lamps floated like red millet. He drank wine and swallowed wind and moon, chanted poems and bit clouds and water, hewed bamboo to fell spring winds, and moved flowers to uproot the dawn moon—these were things even his laziness could not neglect.

A guest from Wuyi, seeing how lazy he had become, visited the Lazy Old Man’s studio and, drunk with inspiration, wrote with unbridled ink. He asked the Lazy Old Man:

*"The east wind parts the willow’s eyes,
The golden crow scolds the peach blossoms.
Spring dwells within your studio—
Why seek joy beyond the fields?"*

Was the Old Man too lazy to tread the green at this time?

*"The rain passes through the secluded pavilion,
A bright moon over a pond of lotuses.
A fragrant breeze rises from the brush—
This heart knows no heat."*

Was he too lazy to enter the grove then?

*"Fallen leaves follow the lone crow,
Calling frost to test the cold.
Autumn’s light fills heaven and earth,
All things at ease and free."*

Was he too lazy to climb heights at that moment?

*"Water soaks the shadow of plum blossoms,
A gibbon’s cry through a frosted tree.
Taro embers warm the earthen stove,
Tea brewed from melted snow."*

Was he too lazy to seek the plum blossoms then?

The Old Man replied: *"Indeed."*

Alas! Dust stings the eyes, fame and profit burn the heart—how could one suddenly become as lazy as the Old Man? His zither gathered dust for days, his inkstone dried without water—all due to his laziness. He shut the door to the clear wind, left the moon to wait for his couch—his laziness knew no bounds.

The Lazy Old Man’s abode could shelter from wind and rain, his fields could provide gruel, his son could inherit his robe and bowl. He mingled not with the vulgar, spoke not to others, his body as light as a feather—truly an old Chan master in life.

Upon meeting White Jade Toad of Wuyi, he delighted in their endless conversation. Jade Toad, overjoyed, composed this ode to his studio.

This occurred on the fifteenth day of early summer in the Jia Ding Bing Zi year. Attended by Mao Ying Xuan, Tao Hong, and others.

**Preface to the Treatment of Abscesses and Fistulas**

Goose fat and phoenix eggs heal carbuncles and boils—this is the art of Bian Que. Unicorn wax and tortoise toes cure abscesses and fistulas—this is the learning of Yu Pi. If the method is not esteemed, the medicine is not deemed cheap; if the learning is not mastered, people deem it wondrous. When the wondrous is deemed unattainable by learning, the method becomes precious, and the medicine no longer inexpensive—all the work of Yu Cun and Bian Que.

The Daoist of Wuyi, Huang Jichang, in his youth roamed the wilds of Chonggang, where he once encountered an extraordinary man who taught him the remedies for abscesses and fistulas. He guarded the formula closely, sealing it in his arm pouch, never to be shown to others. Yet observing the man himself—his spirit soaring and untrammeled—one could well believe in his encounters.

The human body is a vessel of flowing qi; should it harbor stagnation, pus and clotted blood congeal, spreading and thickening, until one cries out in pain, unable to endure. Some suffer from the wasting of blood in fistulas, others from the seepage of internal decay, soaking their clothes and corroding their flesh—who would desire such afflictions? Of the four hundred and four diseases, none wrings the heart like abscesses and fistulas.

Huang Jichang is a man in the lineage of Yu Pi and Bian Que. The medicines he employs are goose fat, phoenix eggs, unicorn wax, and tortoise toes. One day, when I visited his Cloud Nest, he spoke of his learning, his remedies, and the countless patients he had treated. It seemed he wished for me to compose a piece in praise. Alas! Musk does not rely on wind to diffuse its fragrance, nor pearls on oysters to gleam—why must I wield my brush to amuse him?

Since I know his skill, I told him this: Sun Simiao said, *"At first, an abscess is a fleshy knot; once formed, it is a pearl of congealed flesh. When it first bursts, it is like a split melon; when fully ruptured, like a peeled tangerine."* Reflecting on these words, one cannot bear the suffering of those afflicted with abscesses. Yet if I were to stand before such a patient, my brows would furrow in distress, my face contort in aversion—even as I longed to knead the wound, I would recoil from sucking it. Is this how a physician should act? You, sir, must emulate the true healer.

You should cultivate the blessings you sow and the deeds you accumulate, for they are no less than the labors of the woodcutter Su or the surgeon’s skill in lancing boils. Did you know that the First Emperor of Qin carved into human flesh, and Emperor Wu of Han flayed human skin? You, however, treat abscesses and fistulas without decoctions or cauterization, without needles or scraping—only with medicine to attack the illness within and salves to apply without, until the affliction falls away like a leaf from a branch or a flower yielding fruit. Such is the depth of your care.

This is written for all to see.

**Essay to Banish the Sleep Demon**

Man is not granted a hundred years—how many days does he truly have? A hundred years contain thirty-six thousand days, each with a hundred thousand moments. Yet in the span of a single moment, a finger’s snap, morning rises and evening falls—such is the constant of time. Within a hundred years, seventy-seven million five hundred thousand moments are spent in social obligations, and another seventy-seven million five hundred thousand in sleep. Subtracting sleep, man has but fifty years of waking life—how much less for those who do not reach a hundred?

Yet some indulge in slumber as if unaware even of grass and trees. The primordial spirit flees its abode, scattering without return; true qi departs the body, leaving breath without anchor. Clouds veil the heart’s sky, waves muddy the sea of nature. The mirror of wisdom gathers dust, the sword of intellect grows dull. Wakefulness becomes slumber, clarity turns to obscurity. One drifts like a ghostly mountain, darkens like a spectral valley. In stupor, one is as insensate as a drunkard; in torpor, as dazed as one drugged with mandrake. The taste is like a parched fish ensnared in a net; the longing, like a starving rat coveting a painted cake. The snores roar like thunder shaking a thousand peaks; the struggle is like waves crashing into a cliffside well.

No blade of wisdom can pierce it, no rope of intellect can pull one back. What of the stillness of a bright window and a chaste desk? The purity of a plain mat and a small pillow? Within, the empty valley cradles a myriad spirits; without, the great earth houses a hundred bones. The eyes seal shut like lacquer, the limbs grow heavy as stone. Then the Sleep Demon arrives, consorting with the heart’s monkey and the mind’s horse. It defies the sovereign of the heart, spurns the spirit of the valley. It seizes the jade towers and golden palaces of the body, turning them into its own fortress—looming ten thousand fathoms high, weighing a thousand pounds. It plunders the soul, buries the spirit, steals the cinnabar from one’s home, and robs the treasure vault.

It conjures illusions, transforms appearances. No talisman or charm can chase it; no libation can appease it. Thus, I demote the Minister of Qingzhou, summon Black Sweetness, call forth Yellow Slumber, and dispatch the Cloud-Cream Envoy, arming him with a sword to strike. Yet still, the Sleep Demon rages unchecked, unmoved by war, unshaken in countenance.

Then I command the Ink-Pine Censor, the Rabbit-Hair Secretary, the Black Jade Cavalry Officer, and the Ke Creek Commander to drive dragons and tigers into battle. I seal the nose, bind the tongue, listen with the ears, see with the eyes—yet the Sleep Demon nestles in the land of Hua Xu, hides in the realm of the locust tree, transforms into a butterfly, shifts into an ant. Between the pillars, it murmurs in delight.

So I weave a willow carriage and mend a grass boat, fill paper money into bags and bundle bamboo-wrapped millet. I paint an ox to pull the cart, draw a dragon to pole the boat. With three bows, I address the Sleep Demon: *"I have long heard of your desire to depart. I have chosen the day and prepared the vessel. You and your companions should take your leave. Here is rice to fill your bowls, wine to fill your cups. Go with your friends, linger no longer. Flee swift as clouds, vanish quick as lightning. Search your hearts—do you truly wish to stay?"*

Holding the breath to listen in silence, turning the gaze inward to observe its form—tears and laughter fail, disquiet and restlessness arise. Shoulders hunch as the neck strains, eyes bulge as the tongue lolls. At first, one doubts its very existence; now, one knows it for the Sleep Demon.

As if in speech, it says: *"Sleep itself has no demon—your heart is the darkness. You shiver, yet I wear no cloak; you hunger, yet I eat no food. I bear you no grudge, not even the slightest, yet our bond is as glue and lacquer. Now you bid me depart, but I have no home to return to. Though I take leave of you, how can I not weep? I am a ghost, not a man—what need have I for carriage or boat? What use are food and drink to me? I would eat, yet have no mouth; I would dress, yet have no body to bare. I would ride, yet there is no road; I would sail, yet there is no shore. If you would but turn your thoughts inward, you would see I am no affliction of yours. Wash your heart clean and cultivate stillness—then you may seal your form and close your spirit."*

Again I address it: *"You merely see me sit in silence and peer through my windows; you merely see me lost in thought and scale my palace walls. I am no Chen Tuan dreaming his way into the vast wilds, nor King Xiang of Chu dreaming his way into Gaotang. Do not bewitch me—lest I cleave you with the Heavenly Axe."*

Four or five Sleep Demons turn to one another, faces aghast, and speak in reply: *"Though we are called the essence of sleep-demons, we are but one spirit of your own self. When the spirit is clear, the Sleep Demon departs; when the spirit is dull, the Sleep Demon arises. Sleep only the body, not the spirit—that is the way. Gather us into primordial essence, store us as the one numinous spark, melt us into the Great Void, release us into the Great Clarity. If you but keep us in your dwelling and preserve your form, you may escape death and attain long life."*

I laugh and say: *"Do I drive out the Sleep Demon—or does the Sleep Demon drive me out?"*

**Admonition on the Study of the Dao**
When Sima Ziwei first sought immortality, he placed a hundred pieces of tile before his desk. For every scroll of the *Scripture of Salvation* he read, he moved one tile beneath the desk. Each day, through all one hundred divisions of time, he studied a hundred scrolls. Through such diligence and toil, sustained over time, he ascended to become the Perfected of Supreme Clarity, Keeper of the Registers, and the True Person of the Cinnabar Prime of the Grand Empyrean.

Likewise, when Ge Xiaoxian first refined the elixir, he always held a rosary in hand. Each day, seated by the alchemical furnace, he recited the full name of the Jade Emperor ten thousand times. Through such diligence and toil, sustained over time, he ascended to become the Perfected of the Purple Spirit of the Jade Void, the Mysterious and Tranquil True Person of Universal Transformation.

What manner of men are we? Born in the Central Kingdom, raised in noble households, our six senses complete, our nature and intellect keen—we ought to kindle the resolve for diligence and swiftly ascend the steps of the Most High.

The crow soars over Fusang, the hare flies to the Broad Cold Palace. The swallow returns to the Black Robes, the wild goose crosses Mount Heng. Xihe drives the sun and moon, and the sun and moon hasten the years. Human life is but a dream, death no more than a night’s slumber. How many times have we scratched our heads in vain, drowned our aspirations in poetry and wine, utterly heedless of the Dao, the mind-monkey left without a master?

From this day forth, I sever all ties. Turning back to survey the path ahead—youth does not return, time must not be squandered. One day, when I gaze down upon the mortal realm, my eyes will look down upon the cosmos. I shall ride the white clouds, tread the Purple Pole—all beginning today.

Exert yourselves! Exert yourselves!

*On Dreams*

The Divine Farmer dreamed that the Heavenly Sovereign bestowed upon him the Jade Book of Herb-Tasting; the Yellow Emperor dreamed of journeying to the land of Huaxu and the Great Court; Shun dreamed of bowing before his ministers; Gao Huangming dreamed of attaining the teachings of the Zhi Zong lineage; Confucius dreamed of meeting the Duke of Zhou; Lao [Laozi] dreamed of traveling to Śrāvastī—all these were dreams. Yet they were not the sleep of sleep, nor the dreams of dreams.

Consider Zhuang Zhou’s dream of becoming a butterfly, or Lü Dongbin’s dream of being an ant—vastly different paths indeed. The *Nanhua Sutra* states: "In their slumber, no dreams; in their waking, no cares." This arises from the undivided concentration of spirit and the undispersed gathering of qi. For they had penetrated to the primordial mind-ground of Fuxi, and thus what they called "dreams" were but the communion of spirit and the union of sincerity—not the deluded fantasies of sleep.

If one fails to grasp the principle of dreamlessness within dreams, the wandering consciousness and drifting soul will float aimlessly, lost and unrecoverable, manifesting in the realms of perception and cognition, only to return to the cycles of womb, egg, moisture, and transformation. How much more so when, amidst the myriad affairs of the world and the ceaseless clamor of thoughts, the mind is ensnared by external things, its tranquility shattered? This is the waking dream—how much deeper the dream of sleep?

Su Dongpo said: "In this world, there is no Chan of the sleepless; only the snoring slumber of one deep in repose." Alas, people today drown their numinous spirit in fermented dregs and sully their inherent nature with dust and grime. How true the words of the ancient worthies: "This illusory body is but a dream."

*Gèn Ān’s Verse in Gift to Vice Magistrate Lu Ziwen*
*"Gèn its back, not grasping its body; walking its courtyard, not seeing its person—no blame."*
The *Tuan* says: "Gèn means stop. Stop when it is time to stop, act when it is time to act; in movement and stillness, timing is never lost—thus the Dao shines. 'Gèn its stop'—stopping where it should stop. Above and below oppose and do not respond, hence 'not grasping its body'; 'walking its courtyard, not seeing its person'—no blame."
The *Xiang* says: "The doubled mountain of Gèn: the noble person reflects without overstepping his position."

The elders said: "To study the entire *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* is not as good as reading the single hexagram Gèn." For the *Avataṃsaka* speaks only of cessation and contemplation, while Gèn embodies the meaning of the doubled mountain. The mountain is the character *chū* (出, "to emerge"): though it halts in obscurity, it emerges into clarity. This is what is meant by: "Walking to where the waters end, sitting to watch the clouds arise."

**Inscription and Eulogy by Bai Yuchan of Hainan, Praising Wang Linfu, Master of the Palace**

A pillow in the hall of the fragrant mother—crimson light enters the bosom;
Dragon crags and tiger stones—auspicious *qi* knits the divine embryo.
The Perfected Lord of the Northern Dipper—wielding the Dipper’s handle, governing the stars;
Born in the *bingzi* year.

On the Orchid Pavilion’s purification day—the *Xu* star descends upon the courtyard locust tree.
The *bingzi* year aligns with the Northern Emperor;
Moreover, the Northern Spirit’s birth is the locust wood—essence of *Xu* and *Wei*.
Born with divine spirit—pearl-browed, sun-angled;
Smoke-like whiskers, awe-inspiring—eyes flashing like lightning.

Prodigious in speech and calligraphy—his mind vast and erudite;
His heart yearns for the solitary cloud and lone crane.
In azure robes, shedding his mortal form—he meets his master in the jade palace;
From the Nine Heavens, rain and dew descend—he dons a feathered cap, assuming the posture of transcendence.

Jade chimes resound with celestial chant—his voice pierces the Great Void;
He serves in office, clarifying records.
In the Hall of Medicines, he collates maps and texts—green scrolls, cinnabar script;
Later, he oversees the registers.

Refining white lead blossoms—red furnace tempering snow;
The Valley Spirit formless—autumn moon on a jade pool.
His teaching mat and seat—his reputation reaches the celestial court;
He serves as vice-official.

Piercing ignorance, severing vulgarity—his teachings scatter like flying jade fragments.
In his sleeve, a green serpent—beyond his spine, azure bronze;
Wearing through iron shoes—he nurtures purity in the bamboo palace.
Paying homage to grotto-heavens, he returns to the Great One.

At court, eloquent—before the throne, he enjoys celestial rank;
As the Imperial Talisman-Water Dharma Master.
His brush roars like thunder—his alms-bowl conceals dragons.
He sings of returning to his native mountains—ancient pines, cold chrysanthemums;
Gathered disciples brew wine—steaming millet porridge for the masses.
He urges them to uphold official oaths.

Flying *gang* transformation incantations—the Orthodox Unity Heavenly Heart Method;
Perceiving the subtle, listening to the void—the Lingbao Central Alliance Thread.
Clad in rosy clouds, pearl pendants—holding the jade tablet, he gazes upon the Mysterious Altar;
Overseeing the tally of ordained disciples.

Black hooks, dark inlays—flowers on paper chill the ghosts’ courage.
The Mysterious Realm revives—propping up the fallen, lifting the sunken;
The Three Realms bow in reverence—myriad spirits tremble in awe.

Abiding in truth, dwelling in immortality—together with the potter’s kiln and catalpa;
Ornate eaves, dragon-carved beams—flowered tiles pave Ruan’s poetry.
Constructing halls and pavilions.

Imperial bestowal of the *pu* beast—morning and evening, its jade tones resound;
A hundred affairs restored—ancestral principles rise anew.
In death, he praises his bones’ conduct—unrefined yet unadorned.
Rosy cheeks, white teeth—sixty years, a full cycle of *jiazi*;
Temples sprouting black threads—people say he appears forty;
The golden elixir ripened—he becomes a man of heaven, a crane among immortals.
A man of heaven—self-styled "Clumsy Hermitage."

Laughing at the Three Flowers—all directions cease their homage;
His dwelling is the Hall of Three Flowers.
Incense from Boshan’s flying serpent scripts—opening jade bamboo to recite sacred texts;
Feather fan, silk headband—dust whisk stirring pure discourse.

During his discourse, a visitor from beyond the world arrives and sings:
*"Blue cloth robe, jade-green staff,
Poems chant white peonies, melodies sing purple hibiscus.
A game of chess ends—worldly affairs awaken;
Seven strings plucked—mundane illusions shatter."*

Now drifting a leaf beyond the azure sea;
Now soaring a feather in the void.
Iron flute blown—old dragons weep;
Golden goblet overturned—jade flowers bloom red.

Solitary gibbons howl beneath the night moon;
Faint dew drips in autumn wind.
Cloud-brocade stream, deep and bottomless;
Heaven’s blue, mountains lush—verdant without end.

White cranes cry beyond Penglai’s east;
Green youths turn their heads, pointing to the mightiest among divine immortals.

**Eulogy for the Portrait of Prefect Chen Lüyun**

Gazing upon the master’s spirit—a sliver of moon in the cold sky;
Knowing the master’s heart—snow touched by a red furnace.
Hearing of the master’s virtue—ice-pure, jade-clear;
Witnessing the master’s deeds—frost’s heat, ice’s flame.

The master’s words—cutting nails, severing iron;
The master’s conduct—slaying men, drawing blood.
A heart attuned to wind and moon—bamboo’s integrity, pine’s resolve.
The Dao’s methods submerged—disciples scattered like shattered tiles;
The master wields the prefect’s decree—thunder roars, lightning flashes.

In the Grotto Palace, he initiates grand rituals—
Chariots of *geng* and *nan* wood, clay vessels, cracked bowls;
Adorned with splendor, embellished with elegance.
Within a year, the azure river bends;
Crossing with the Five Divine Feet—rosy skirts arrayed in ranks.

Order restored, harmony achieved—
Why, like a cloud-crane, does he suddenly return to the imperial court?
Mountains and streams lose their hue—gibbons and crows mourn in sorrow.
Scattering verses at the jade shrine—a single cypress seed burns.
Yearning and admiration fade—leaving one choked with grief.

**Master Xu Jing**

Who lacks the seven-return elixir?
The master departs—who recognizes him?
If one wishes to see the true Xu Jing,
Look to the west of the Northern Dipper—a single point of light.

**Inscription for the Portrait of Master Zhu Wengong**

Heaven and earth are coffins; sun and moon, the burial.
Where has the Master gone?
The beam collapses, Mount Tai crumbles—the wise man withers.
The dream of two pillars has passed; the wondrous subtlety of "one sound" is lost;
Bamboo slips gather dust, the Apricot Altar overgrown with grass.

Alas! Master Wen at seventy-one—jade-pure, ice-clear;
Yet empty are the thirty-six peaks of Wuyi—gibbons wail, cranes cry.
The strains of pipes and strings still linger;
The torch of elegance—who now bears it?
Gazing up, ever higher; delving deeper, ever firmer;
Listening, one hears nothing; looking, one sees nothing.
Faintly, a semblance appears—this culture is not lost.

Only those who rectify the heart and sincerely intend know;
Those who seek to preserve spirit and probe the ultimate speak.

---

**Eulogy for the Portrait of Master Wen**

The Imperial Ultimate falls to earth—the Master returns to heaven.
Wuyi’s pines and bamboos—setting sun, chirping cicadas.

---

**Self-Eulogy**

A thunder official in the divine palace—Bai Yuchan of Qiongshan.
The true face from the beginning—ink on frosty silk.

---

**Another Self-Eulogy**

A disheveled head, bare feet through the ages;
A life of swallowing *qi*, dining on rosy clouds.
Laughing, pointing to the foot of Wuyi Mountain—
Where white clouds run deep is my home.

---

**Eulogy for Ni Meichuang’s Spirit Portrait**

Swallow’s jaw, tiger’s head—ancient Ban Chao;
Dragon’s countenance, phoenix’s bearing—Ji Kang of Jin.
A noble man’s heart—originally formless;
Wind pure, moon bright—Ni Meichuang.

---

**Eulogy for Zhou Boshen’s Spirit Portrait**

An old immortal guest in a square yard;
A heart the size of a drop of water.

**Eulogy for a Spirit Portrait**

Cinnabar-red cheeks, twin dots of black lacquer for eyes.
Hmph!—white beard stroking palm, laughing heartily,
A white crane gone, none to recognize.

**Memorial for the Wuyi Daoist Community’s Petition of Names, Transmission of the Dharma, and Rite of Thanksgiving**

The sacred casket unseals its secrets—Lord Lao opens the gate of the teaching.
The Jade Bureau manifests auspice—Jingying reveals the path of the flowing Dao.
With the eight poles, refine the hun to save the suffering;
With the nine numina, tread the flying steps to ascend the celestial writ.
The Heavenly Heart transmits the Three Talismans and Two Seals;
The Thunder Palace responds with the Five Societies and Ten Barbarians.
Thus are calamities and illnesses driven away,
And gods and spirits summoned through these rites.
We, the faithful, offer incense and sincerity,
Each receiving the essentials of the Dharma,
Drinking the cinnabar spring to swear our oaths,
Perpetuating the true wind forever.

**Petition of the True Lord in Straw Cloak**

Nine simurghs’ chariot, nine phoenixes’ palanquin,
Adorned with yellow clouds, shielded by purple mists.
Eight cranes’ team, nine dragons’ retinue,
Harnessed to the Crimson Register, journeying through the Cinnabar Mound.
These are the majestic rites spoken of in the scriptures,
Yet how could the worldly know the splendor beyond the world?
Now, as the Two True Lords Zhang and Wei depart to pray for rain,
The noble gentlemen Wang and Xie should prepare carriages in advance.
Sichuan brocade and Wu silk may shield from wind and sun;
Qin hemp and Yue ramie should be cut like snow, tailored like mist.
A single stroke of the brush—dragons and serpents;
Endless in the void—thunder and rain.

---

**Petition for Merit and Virtue Through Transformative Painting**

The Dao is originally formless—how could it rely on painted forms and adorned images?
Yet people must see things before their hearts are stirred by them.
Thus, one paints what cannot be painted,
To enlighten those who have never understood.
Azure simurghs and vermilion phoenixes dwell before the mighty wind and vast qi;
White cranes and azure dragons soar above floating mists and boundless skies.
Within, there are primal images—
These beings defy forced names.
If heart and mind can conjure them in vision,
How could mere gilding and pigment be amiss?
Vaguely, indistinctly—
As if the worthies and sages gather in clouds;
Vastly, profoundly—
Thus do blessings and auspices flow like rivers.

---

**Petition for the Construction of a Refined Abode**

Grooming the carriage, feeding the horses—to seek the immortal’s trail;
Sacrificing tripods, spreading mats—yet still unsatisfied is the wanderer’s heart.
We wish to carve a realm of creeping vines and mossy rain,
To expand a hut of pine winds and bamboo moonlight,
Banishing the woes of leaky roofs and damp floors,
With a few beams, a few pillars—left leaning, right propped.
By the boat’s shore, all linger in wine’s warmth and flushed ears;
Before the falling petals in the courtyard, poetry’s fervor and heart’s madness peak.
If we meet and do not seize the moment,
When shall we gather again?

---

**Petition for the Bestowal of Ordination Certificates**

We humbly submit: a thousand bolts of azure silk
Need not await the crane that soars over Yangzhou.

**Three feet of white silk—must await the capture of the unicorn in the western hunt.**
Though our lips dare not claim such karmic affinity, fate bears this burden all the same.
Cloud-dragons and wind-tigers—truly a meeting of propitious times;
Star-magpies and rosy-finned fish—what fine, leisurely Daoists they make.
A true friend but lifts a hand, and good fortune arrives at once.

Again: the white-haired elder passed through Hangu Pass, yet only Yin Xi awaited him;
The yellow-crowned Zhuangzi roamed the Painted Garden, but only Ji Yi received him.
The subtlest truths are never passed from father to son—
Yet true friends and alms-giving patrons bring them to fruition.
All comes down to this: a meal voucher,
Casually dubbed a "talisman of protection."
The Jade Dawn Crown—moonlight of the canopy pavilion above;
The fragrant silk robe—spring clouds at the edge of Heaven’s Pillar.

We rely solely on the ancestral transmission of the Supreme Lord,
To repay the generosity of worthy and noble benefactors.
If but a soaring crane arrives at Whitewater,
Why need one ride to Yangzhou?

**Petition from the Hall of Realization**
Daoist companions come and go—who can count their number?
Yet when we inquire of our dilapidated hut, not a grain of porridge remains.
With this as our topic, we ask all lovers of the Dao:
Let us bind this green thread together.
To abstain from grain is but a trick of the trade—
Empty the heart, fill the belly, and return to one’s original livelihood.
Beams sag, pillars lean—how long can they endure the slow erosion of years?
Incense cools, embers dim—exposed to the assault of wind and rain.
We newly invite a master of wind and moon,
To once more continue this tale of clouds and waters.
A bowl of round jade-like grains,
Half a skein of fine silver threads.
Mouths agape, awaiting sustenance—how can they feast on mist and dew?
Brush in hand, ink on paper—yet still they hope for water to freeze at a shout.

**Ordination Certificate Text**
Seas turn to mulberry fields, mulberry fields to seas—
In a single instant, a hundred years may pass.
Turn the lock in the crown of your head—
Who among you is not a Celestial of the Great Brahma Heaven?
Thus it is said: a candle in the wind, duckweed on water,
A vine on the bank, a tree by the well,
Fire beside stone, lightning’s fleeting glow—
Prepare the mulberry before the rain, dig not the well when thirst already strikes.

Now, at this hour, we, the officiants of this fast, turn our gaze
From the realms of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind,
And from the profound, wondrous, and mysterious teachings of the Dao, scriptures, and masters—
We recognize true friends.
We prepare a feast of jade scrolls and bamboo slips,
Summon the star-capped and cloud-robed singers,
Transforming heaven and earth into a sacred realm of fragrant silk.
This, once more, is the first kalpa of the Dragon Han era.
Lamps burn with dragon-fat oil, drawing down the stars of the southern sky;
Incense from Oxhead Mountain blackens into clouds over the distant peaks.
Not only in one or two heavens, but in boundless heavens,
Do celestial blossoms dance;
From kalpa to kalpa, through as many kalpas as grains of sand in a river,
May blessings and merit flourish abundantly.

Though this bridge exists,
How shall we provide proof?
Thus, we raise the certificate and proclaim:

"O all you kindred spirits, this is the eye of ten thousand sages and a thousand worthies,
A stairway to the Three Voids and Four Brahma Heavens.
Its plain silk—condensed clouds of the azure vault;
Its black script—sealed in the purple empyrean.
In the end, what single phrase is entrusted?
How shall it be spoken?
In the day, there is the crow; in the moon, the hare;
In water, behold the tiger; in fire, the dragon.
One day, riding cranes and borne on winds,
You shall ascend to Penglai’s first peak."
