**Breaking Delusion and Rectifying the Dao: A Song**

Were it not for celestial matters sealed by talismans,
I would reveal the Heavenly Mechanism’s secret to you.
A few words, half a phrase—no excess characters,
Yet a single utterance unites ten thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures.
One secret alone reveals affairs beyond the heavens,
Sweeping away all heterodox paths without a trace.
Should you call this principle the Dao of immortals,
Heaven and earth are void, above and below are empty.
The revelation shatters the barrier between wood and metal,
For true lead and true mercury possess no form.
Who comprehends this celestial mechanism’s principle?
Once grasped, the sun and moon ascend in lofty flight.
No Kan and Li, no dragon and tiger,
No crow and hare, each to west and east.
Neither liver nor lung, neither heart nor kidney,
Unrelated to spleen, stomach, gall, or essence.
No thought, no contemplation, no action,
Beyond the three fields—upper, lower, and middle.
How could it concern the spine’s path to Kunlun?
It is not essence, saliva, dark blood, or fluid.
Not the spirits of the bladder or the five viscera,
Yet this thing emerges within the human body.
Through the four seasons—spring, summer, autumn, winter—
Who recognizes the precelestial and pre-earthly?
Two substances harmonize, weighing one catty,
Waxing and waning, new and full moons align with their original number.
Circling day and night without cease,
Timely harvesting discerns their age.
In a fleeting moment, between *jia* and *geng*,
It arises in the southwest, at its native position.
Gently harmonize and enter the *Gen* Palace,
Test the Heavenly Mechanism with a light touch.
True *qi* gathers in the great void at all times,
Forcing heaven and earth to serve as the crucible.
Inverting the cosmos at will, traversing freely,
The southern star shifts to the northern star’s place.
The golden crow flies into the jade toad’s palace,
The sun’s surface conceals the jade hare.
The great yin waxes and wanes, naturally harmonizing.
After the first quarter, seek the medicine;
Before the last quarter, refine the *qi* evenly.
Between the two quarters lies the moment of harvest.
First and last, preserve the ancestor and lineage—
It is the host of the hour, while I am the guest.
When I rise, you sink;
Adjust until rising and sinking unite in one place.
Bathing and concealment are all emptiness.
*Li* and *Kan* originally have no south or north.
*Zhen* and *Dui*—how could they be fixed in west or east?
If you encounter an immortal who imparts the secret,
Seize the Northern Dipper’s wheel of the celestial cycle,
Gather yin and yang into your palm.
In an instant, the myriad things are born.
These are the secrets of golden liquid and returned elixir—
Without an immortal teacher, do not forcefully pursue them.
If you truly harvest the precelestial *qi*,
The sun and moon are captured in your hands,
Day and night clashing, merging into one.
Naturally, the dragon’s roar and tiger’s laughter resound.
At first, wind howls above and below,
Gradually congealing, purple clouds arise,
Filling the mountains, veiling the sun and moon.
At this moment, a haze descends like twilight.
Silently, the clouds and mist stir,
And within stillness, thunderclaps are heard.
Purple phoenix and dark crow, hare and toad intertwine,
Golden crow and jade hare contend of their own accord,
Tiger coils and dragon entwines, seeking the supreme treasure.

The Golden Lord and the Jade Maiden wed in marriage,
This union of mother and child within.
The sacred *qi* returns to its root, merging with true essence,
A single spark—the primal seed of origin.
Entering the cinnabar field, eternal spring arises,
The precelestial and pre-earth converge as one.
Before the chaos divided, how could there be trace?
Generation unfolds, naturally aligned with sacred principle.
Verdant shoots and crimson blossoms renew as one hue,
Above and below, water and fire irrigate themselves.
The two *qi* intertwine, birthing the fetal infant,
Naturally, the white sun gives rise to divine form.
Beyond the mortal, transcending life and death,
Indeed, a hundred days guard against peril.
Blood transforms to cream, the body like silver,
Truly, a hundred days without loss.
Jade cream flows, suffusing radiant light,
True *qi* steams, banishing cold and heat.
One may become the supreme Daoist adept,
Blazing refinement through three hundred days.
Sudden storms and howling winds fill the vast sky,
Lightning flashes, countless and dazzling.
Thunder shakes the celestial gate, startling gods and ghosts,
The cosmos upends, white snow flying.
Inverting heaven and earth, an endless spring,
Exchanging bones, returning yang—body undying.
Nine returns, seven reversals refine true form,
Ten months of toil, all in all.
Within and without, emptiness and clarity,
Gathered, it takes shape; scattered, it is *qi*.
Returning to the origin, merging with the great void,
Transforming and journeying—none can fathom.
Ancestors transmit this from ancient times to now,
A single principle aligning with heaven and earth.
The immortals’ oral secrets are not false,
If preserved for one or two more years,
Through a hundred thousand myriad kalpas without end,
Mastering the method of golden liquid and shaped elixir.
Riding phoenixes and cranes, soaring freely,
Exiting existence, entering non-existence without hindrance.
Roaming the three isles of Penglai at will,
Even after ten thousand years and a hundred thousand kalpas,
Seas turn to mulberry fields, yet the visage remains unchanged.
Alas for the countless aspiring immortals—
All follow paths unlike the celestial Dao,
Deluded by the drool of wild foxes,
How can one heed demonic words and bewitching speech?
Wandering the four seas to seek mysteries,
All are but heterodox arts and minor practices,
The foolish and obstinate, difficult to enlighten,
Ever the blind leading the blind.
Like consuming pine needles and swallowing elixirs,
How can one escape the root of life and death?
Like forgetting form to cultivate breath-holding,
How can the hundred meridians all return to their source?
Like focusing breath to visualize the cinnabar field,
Yet failing to complete the fetal immortal’s training.
Like deeming breath as the precelestial,
Aging without achievement, all in vain.
Like taking mouth and nose as the mysterious female,
Like casting a net to catch the wind.
Like fixing the mind as the square inch,
How can one return to the origin and meet the ancestral master?
Some accumulate essence as lead and mercury,
Yet this differs from the golden elixir’s work.
Some grasp *qi* and spirit as mother and child,
Still a myriad miles from the celestial immortal’s path.
Some open the crown for refinement,
Wasting effort, wearily straining the spirit.
Some retract the turtle and refine the breasts,
These are but heterodox arts and minor practices.
Some circulate *qi* as the fire-timing,
Nine years, three years—waiting for enlightenment.
Closing the nose to absorb primordial *qi*,
Drawing in perverse winds that rumble in the belly.
Even if one recognizes the mind and sees nature,
In the end, one becomes but a yin spirit.
Who knows how many idle gates there are?
Futile labor, moving the skeleton’s form.
Halting thoughts, calming the mind for purity,
Yet the outcome remains but stubborn emptiness.
Day and night, practicing the midnight-noon method,
Does heaven and earth have inauspicious hours?
Solitary cultivation, breath-holding, and visualization,
Fixing the tongue as the crimson dragon.
Some circulate *qi* through the trigrams,
Some plant the crown to create the yellow court,
Some point to the kidneys as creation’s source,
Fixing the tailbone as the life root.
Some return to the origin by ingesting water and fire,
Some practice absorption, drawing in lewd essence,
Some face the sky to inhale sun and moon,
Claiming earthly *po* as heavenly *hun*.
Some sip saliva as creation’s work,
Abandoning the five flavors as true cultivation.
Day and night, one meal for daily use,
The body emaciated, ghostly in form.
Curving the body, lying prostrate, knocking the jade door,
Embracing the origin, guarding the one, moving both eyes,
Hunching shoulders, retracting the neck, contemplating the spine,
Circulating the flowing pearl, visualizing the great yin.
Some inscribe talismans and chant incantations,
Breaking contracts, parting rings to learn invisibility,
Massaging and exhaling the six-word formula,
Gazing at stars, worshipping the Dipper with toil.
Expelling the turbid, inhaling the pure as the elixir’s root,
Tightly restraining the yang pass, fire soaring,
Blazing heat suffusing the body,
Calling this the root of the celestial true Dao.
Reading, reciting, praising, upholding rituals and registers,
Setting up altars, performing rites, hoping for ascension.
Three thousand six hundred heterodox methods—
None recognize the form that moves day and night.
If by fate one encounters a luminous teacher’s guidance,
In an instant, creation arises,
A single *qi* circulating without obstruction.
Scattered in the myriad things and the human body,
The enlightened one gathers the precelestial *qi*.
One night, thunder ceaselessly roars,
Lightning flashes, countless and dazzling.
The two *qi* intertwine—how could there be form?
Shattering the celestial gate, beyond compare.
Thunder, lightning, wind, and rain arise together,
Inverting and reversing, exchanging positions.
Boundless fiery *qi* rages tumultuously,
Tigers coil around the medicine furnace, contending for creation,
Dragons entwine the golden tripod, seeking to soar.
The four images and five phases return to *wu-ji*,
Refining the golden liquid into primordial crystal.
Ten thousand purple clouds shroud the northern sea,
A thousand meridians surge against Kunlun.
True *qi* gleams, outshining the stars,
Crimson light blazes, dimming the sun.
Increase and decrease naturally distinguish advance and retreat,
The waxing and waning crescents determine the true.
The elixir’s head—old or tender—must also be discerned,
Withdrawing and adding, applied in an instant.
The fire-timing for gestation has its moments,
True fire blazes, scorching the cosmos,
Heaven and earth above and below glow crimson.
One water, one fire divide the hexagrams,
One ascent, one descent, floating and sinking.
One coming, one going distinguish host and guest,
One before, one after, lord and minister.
One yin, one yang form heaven and earth,
One firm, one yielding, naturally balanced.
Winter and summer solstices mark the seasons,
Spring and autumn equinoxes determine cold and warmth.
Coming and going, rising and falling—no form,
Circulating day and night, following the hours.

Without the earth-ancestor’s transmitted secret,
How could one know the Dao’s momentary work?
Driving back the Dipper’s handle governs the Mysterious Pass,
Turning the Celestial Pivot unites the ten thousand images.
In a fleeting instant, dragon and tiger wage ceaseless battle,
The two substances unite in a single breath.
Seizing the gibbons, all is chaos and confusion,
Vague and indistinct, not yet clarified.
Here lies the method of wood and metal’s union,
True lead, true mercury—crystalline as heaven and earth.
This alone is the fire-timing’s golden elixir secret,
Wholly dependent on their conjoining within the Yellow Court.
The Primal One’s single breath—an elixir of a thousand years,
Eternally enduring through ten thousand kalpas, an endless spring.
Within three thousand moments appears the infant-brother image,
A hundred days’ work refines the numinous transformation.
After ten months, the pure yang body is forged,
Naturally immune to cold and heat’s intrusion.
Auspicious qi and colored clouds veil the fivefold form,
Phoenixes and cranes dance in welcome before one’s face.
Jade maidens, in pairs, bear the purple decree,
Proclaiming the name and title of the perfected one.
Golden light envelops the body, unseen by mortal eyes,
With regulated dignity and majesty, one moves to left and right.
Cranes escort the ascent toward the origin,
In broad daylight, one soars to the celestial capital.
*The Song of the True Dao to Dispel Delusion* concludes.
