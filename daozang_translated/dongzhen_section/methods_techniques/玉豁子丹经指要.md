**Preface to *Jade Creek Master’s Essential Pointers on the Elixir Canon***

My ancestral home lies east of Yichun Commandery’s city. My distant forebear, having retired from office as Court Discussant, devoted himself to the Dao and styled himself the Jade Creek Old Man. Today, our great clan no longer invokes the commandery’s prestige but is known simply as the Jade Creek family.

Twice he encountered the Perfected of Pure Yang yet failed to awaken. Once beneath the pines of Yue Mountain, again at Yueyang Tower, where he heard the sound of a flute at night.

Later, on a second journey to Southern Marchmount, he sought to meet Lan Yangsu. On the road, he encountered a man carrying a set of nails and hinges, who addressed him: “Are you not Master Li? Are you bound for Yue Mountain to see Yangsu?”

He replied, “Indeed.”

The man said, “Then I trouble you to deliver a message to Lan: ‘The Recluse Liu sends his regards to the Master. How does one emerge from the ten-month gestation?’” With that, he made a deep bow and departed.

After walking several *li*, my forebear felt unsettled. He reflected: this man knew my name, discerned my purpose, and spoke in a manner unlike the common folk.

Having sought him out further, he could no longer be found. Upon meeting Lan, he recounted all that had been said. Lan asked, “Did the man between his brows bear a white mole?” He replied, “Yes.” Lan said, “That was Liu Haichan. I have nurtured the sacred embryo, yet without him, I could not have attained fruition.”

He then repeated the message for Lan: “The Recluse Liu sends his regards to the Master: ‘How does one emerge from the ten-month gestation?’” Lan clapped his hands and laughed heartily. Suddenly, a rumbling like thunder resounded from above, and a figure radiant as snow and moonlight—indistinguishable from Lan—ascended straight into the heavens, while Lan had already departed. My forebear burned incense, sighed, and withdrew. Today, he is known as the “Master of Eternal Laughter” of Yue Mountain. See *Records of Our Family’s Extraordinary Encounters* and *The Annals of Yichun*.

Upon returning home, he gathered hagiographies of immortals, Daoist scriptures, and various philosophical texts, shutting his door to visitors and poring over them day and night. Before long, he too passed away without illness. His *Collection for Manifesting the Ancestors* circulates in the world. I am his descendant, having studied the Confucian classics in youth. Though I did not achieve my ambitions, I devoted myself to the canons of Daoism and Buddhism, as well as astronomy, mathematics, medicine, and divination. Yet of all these, the elixir of golden cinnabar captivated me most.

Thus, I traversed rivers and lakes, journeyed across mountains and plains, and even bowed to beggars to seek their counsel. Unwavering in my resolve, Heaven guided my steps, and I encountered a perfected one within the Temple of Prince Wang in Guixian Alley, and later again in Jiangling Prefecture. A single word of instruction awakened me to the essence of the seven reversals and nine refinements.

I once sojourned on Mount Wudang, and along the Xiang and Han rivers, the Jiang and Huai—no place I did not visit. Yet few I met were enlightened or possessed the round mechanism of Dao, so I sealed my lips and spoke not a word of the Mystery. By the *guihai* year of the Jingding era (1263), traveling from Jingxiang to Xingsha, my homeland was not far. There, I met old acquaintances from my village, and in conversation, learned that the strong had grown old, and the old had passed away. Unbidden, tears flowed, and I reflected: The Perfected of Purple Yang had said, “To plan for oneself is to succeed.” To sever the bonds of Heaven’s Dao is the gravest transgression.

Thereupon, I opened my heart in prayer to Heaven and, assembling the golden key and jade lock, composed *Essential Pointers on the Awakening to Reality*, *The Book of Longevity and Everlasting Vision*, *On Dispelling Delusion*, and *Dialogues on the Dharma*. Fearing the symbolic imagery remained incomplete, I further elucidated the workings of the Primordial Sovereign to clarify the advance and retreat of tally and fire—truly, I have revealed Heaven’s secrets. Those who aspire to the Dao must cherish this. My hope is that all may cultivate and refine themselves, each attaining perfection, fulfilling their virtue and completing their merit, to together realize the fruit of immortality. Should any treat this lightly, calamity will swiftly manifest. The language herein is plain, yet it conveys the true matters of the inner chamber. Noble seekers of the Dao, ponder it deeply. If enlightenment comes, it is Heaven’s gift, not through my humble oral transmission.

Written on the full moon of the fourth month in the *jiazi* year of the fifth Jingding era (1264), by Li Jianyi of Yuxi, Yichun.

**Preface to *Essential Pointers on the Alchemical Canon* (Volume One)**
Compiled by Li Jianyi of Yuxi

**Essential Pointers on *Awakening to Reality*: The Diagrams**

**The Three-Five Unification Diagram**
**1. The Nine Returns and Seven Reversions**
"Returns" and "reversions" signify the principle of inversion—merely the cyclical interplay of metal and fire. Master Ziyang states:
*"Seven reversions: cinnabar returns to its root;
Nine returns: golden liquor reverts to truth.
Do not fixate on the reckoning of *yin* and *zi*;
Simply observe the five phases as your standard."*
Metal’s number is four; multiplied by earth, it becomes nine returns.
Fire’s number is two; multiplied by earth, it becomes seven reversions.
The *Triple Concordance Canon* speaks of the "secret in lead and fire"—this is the Golden Elixir, the Golden Elixir is the divine water of the Flowery Pond.
The *Ancient Dragon-Tiger Classic* states: *"No alchemical art is more luminous than metal and fire."*
It further says:
*"Within the divine chamber, essence is refined;
Fire and metal mutually propel.
The male yang is the azure water of mystery;
The female yin is the ochre gold."*
The *Canon* declares:
*"Pound, refine, and conjoin them,
Then bear them into the vermilion gate."*
The esoteric essence lies therein.
Master Ziyang says:
*"The White Tiger’s primary scripture is the supreme treasure;
The Flowery Pond’s divine water is true gold."*
Now, I elucidate this directly, hoping to awaken understanding.
Metal is true lead; fire is divine mercury.
True lead is the primordial *qi*, born from the kidneys—thus the alchemical canons proclaim: *"How sublime! True lead, the forerunner of heaven and earth."*
Divine mercury is the true nature within the heart.
The *qi* within the kidneys conceals true water;
The true nature within the heart stores true fire.
Master Shi states:
*"The medicine is drawn from the primordial *qi*;
The fire is sought in the essence of the great yang.
If one knows how to gather the medicine and seek the fire,
Within the cauldron, the elixir will surely form."*
Without true earth, they cannot unite.
Thus, the return and reversion of metal and fire are the paramount essentials of the inner elixir. Seek them within the body—beyond this, all is not the Dao.

**2. The Crucible**
The crucible is the yang furnace and yin tripod, the jade furnace and golden cauldron. It is also called the divine chamber, the upper and lower cauldrons, the yellow chamber, the recumbent moon furnace, the *kan*-*li* enclosure, or the Mysterious Pass—a single aperture with countless names.
This is the pivot of the returning elixir, the repository where spirit and *qi* converge and are stored.
In truth, there are two:
One is the inner crucible and divine furnace;
The other is the outer crucible and its symbolic representation.
Within the body, it lies at the central axis, aligned with the navel in front and the kidneys behind. When lead and mercury merge, a single point descends into this place.
Master Ziyang says:
*"To ensure the Valley Spirit never dies,
Rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the foundation.
Once true essence returns to the golden chamber,
A luminous pearl will never depart."*
This is what is meant by "establishing the foundation in a hundred days."
The outer crucible’s symbolic representation follows the principles of yin and yang: water above, fire below. It observes the waxing and waning of the moon, aligns with the eight trigrams and four seasons, manipulates the five phases, harmonizes the four images, refines dragon and tiger, restrains hun and po, and ensures inner and outer correspondence through inversion, ascent, and descent.
Heaven and earth serve as parents;
*Kan* and *li* as husband and wife.
Dividing the 384 lines, one circulates the fire phases;
Moving the five stars and twenty-eight constellations, they encircle the crucible.
Sealed and fortified, not a moment’s deviation is permitted.
Master Ziyang states:
*"First take heaven and earth as your crucible;
Then gather the crow and hare to refine the medicine.
Once you drive these two into the Yellow Path,
How could the Golden Elixir fail to form?"*
Another verse from the *Canon* says:
*"Cultivate and nourish the capital;
Congeal the spirit to form the body."*
It further states:
*"The true person lurks in the deep abyss,
Floating and wandering within the compass."*
This is the Mysterious Pass.
The inner and outer crucibles, with their symbolic representations, are thus clearly expounded.
If one seeks externally or clings to lust, desire, or delusion, attempting to fabricate in the realm of form, they will be separated by ten thousand miles.

**3. True Lead**
True lead is the *kan* male, the infant, the lunar essence, the yin tiger, the metal lord, the silver within lead, the white within black, the yang within yin. Though its names are many, it is called true lead—yet in truth, it is the primordial unity of *qi*, gathered before the Great Simplicity.
Master Ziyang says:
*"Simply capture the earth’s *po* to subdue the vermilion mercury."*
It meets true mercury to form the elixir and is governed by true earth.

**4. True Mercury**
True mercury is the *li* female, the solar essence, the radiant maiden, the yang dragon, the mercury within cinnabar, the female within the male, the yin within yang. Though its names are many, it is called true mercury—yet in truth, it is merely the liquid of wood.
Master Ziyang says:
*"Naturally, the celestial soul restrains the water-metal."*
It meets true lead to form the elixir and is governed by true earth.

**5. True Earth**
True earth is *wu*-*ji*, the central palace, the *kun* palace—it is not the spleen. When lead is cast into mercury, without true earth, they cannot fuse and congeal. It wields the sword and inverts the spear to stabilize the four directions.
The *Ancient Dragon-Tiger Classic* states:
*"The four seas converge like spokes to a hub,
Establishing great peace—all through the virtue of earth in the central palace,
The achievement of the Yellow Emperor."*
The *Canon* says:
*"The three substances form one household,
All returning to *wu*-*ji*."*
Master Ziyang says:
*"Send them back to the earthen cauldron, firmly sealed."*
As the linchpin of metal, wood, water, and fire, the work of the five phases is complete.

**6. The Knife and Scepter**
Master Ziyang says:
*"If *li* and *kan* lack *wu*-*ji*,
Though they contain the four images, the elixir will not form.
Only when both embrace true earth
Can the Golden Elixir return."*
Master Yu states:
*"The great medicine never departs from true *wu*-*ji*;
Thus, the immortals call it ‘a knife and scepter.’"*
The knife is a metaphor for metal; the scepter, for the two earths. To "drink the knife and scepter" is to flow *wu* into *ji*.
Master Shi says:
*"To know when lead and mercury unite,
You may then drink the knife and scepter."*
The *Restoration of Life* states:
*"When dragon and tiger embrace in mutual longing,
*Kan* and *li* unite to form the embryo.
A single handful of the marrow of heaven and earth—
With intent, seek and seize it."*

At that very moment, one drinks the knife and scepter.

**2. The Matchmaker**
The matchmaker is a metaphor for union. To cast lead and merge with mercury, none but the matchmaker will suffice—this is the Yellow Dame. Yet she is not the spleen.

Master Ziyang says:
*"If true lead is to retain mercury,
The minister must never leave the sovereign’s side.
When wood and metal stand apart without cause,
Only the matchmaker can draw them together."*
This, too, is the meaning of flowing *wu* into *ji*.

**3. Gathering and Seizing**
To gather is to gather without gathering; to seize is to seize without seizing. It cannot be sought with intent, nor attained without it.

Master Shao states:
*"At winter solstice’s midnight,
The heart of heaven remains unchanged.
Where the first yang stirs,
Before the ten thousand things arise—*
Here lies the point of action."

The *Book of Changes* says:
*"The Dao of Qian becomes male;
The Dao of Kun becomes female."*
Thus, a man at sixteen is filled with true essence, corresponding to Qian; a woman at fourteen receives celestial water, corresponding to Kun. Qian embraces *jia* and *ren*; Kun embraces *yi* and *gui*—such is the origin of creation.

Master Ziyang says:
*"When lead meets *gui*, gather swiftly."*
This is the end of Kun and the beginning of *Fu*, before the Great Simplicity’s qi appears. Wait for the first yang to stir, then gather without delay. *"Gold, when distant, is unfit to taste"*—lest the delicate blossom scatter carelessly.

Master *Fuming* of *Restoration* says:
*"Gathering must be secret,
With sincere heart, discern beauty from ugliness.
The thread of intent is hard to trace—
Lose it, and the cold spring slips away."*

Master Ziyang says:
*"Knock the bamboo to summon the turtle to swallow the jade mushroom;
Pluck the zither to call the phoenix to drink the knife and scepter."*
This is the pivotal mechanism for drawing lead into the crucible—far from the art of "refining gold through the jade woman."

**4. Fusion and Coagulation**
An ancient song says:
*"The sun is *Li*, the moon is *Kan*;
Their essences devour each other."*
Master Ziyang says:
*"The two things arise from the child producing the mother;
The five phases must all enter the Central Palace."*
This is the five stars strung like pearls, the sun and moon conjoined as one.

The late Master Ma Danyang said:
*"Fire arises in water—banish the heart’s scenery;
Flowers bloom in snow—extinguish the spring of intent."*
Such is the scene of fusion and coagulation. Those who study the Dao should savor it deeply!

**5. Refining and Smelting**
The *Triplex Unity* states:
*"Below lies the qi of Great Yang,
Steaming in but a moment."*
And:
*"Rising and roasting upon the mountain of rice,
The blazing fire is set below."*
And:
*"The wailing cries are most sorrowful,
Like an infant longing for its mother."*
And:
*"When Mars guards the west and Venus traverses the sky,
Wherever the killing qi descends, what does not topple?
The fox guards the mouse; the sparrow fears the crane."*

*Restoration* says:
*"Having seized the essence and marrow of crow and hare,
Hasten to gather and smelt it within the crucible."*

An ancient song says:
*"The divine fire refines the lead’s qi by night,
The old turtle devours the soul of the Fire Spirit."*
This is the principle of natural refining and smelting. Those who do not understand creation should not lightly discuss it.

**6. The Union of Metal and Wood**
Metal is the sentiment of lead; wood is the nature of mercury. In the profound and indistinct, it defies description.

Metal within the body is firm, strong, and pure, coursing through the four limbs—this is metal’s true sentiment, not the sentiment of desire. Wood within the interior is soft, yielding, and compassionate, like sweating at the croak of a frog—this is wood’s true nature, the very root of benevolence.

Metal’s sentiment grows through lead; wood’s nature congeals through mercury. When lead and mercury unite, their congealing and nurturing cause sentiment and nature to long for each other. As the *True Unity Master* says: *"The male’s sentiment and the female’s nature, mutually seeking and containing, gather to generate and transform true essence into the divine medicine."*

Master Ziyang says:
*"Wood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness;
Metal’s sentiment cherishes wood’s kindness.
Devouring each other, they grow intimate—
Only then does the man conceive."*

The *Triplex Unity* says:
*"When metal returns to its original nature,
It may be called the Returned Elixir."*
And:
*"Metal fells wood, yet wood flourishes."*
Without the matchmaker’s harmony, there would be the peril of separation.

**7. The Clarity and Turbidity of the Water Source**
The water source is a metaphor for the heart’s source and the sea of nature. When the dragon coils and the tiger crouches, clouds disperse and mists clear—this is called the waves of the sea of desire stilled, the surges of the river of love ceased. In stillness, heaven and earth are vast; in leisure, the sun and moon are long.

Whether turbid or clear, it will be seen in due time.

**8. Warm Nurturing**

To eliminate passions and dispel desires, withdraw the gaze and reverse hearing, abandon the limbs, dull the senses, and remain foolish all day—this must not be departed from even for a moment. Like a dragon nurturing its pearl, allow no interruption; like a hen brooding her eggs, keep the warmth unbroken.

Laozi said: *"Concentrate your qi to attain suppleness—can you be like an infant?"* And: *"Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish."*

The secret says: *"Forget the form to nurture qi, forget qi to nurture spirit, forget spirit to nurture emptiness."* The true person guards the center, and qi is like spring within the flower. When the seasonal cycle is complete, the embryo sheds its form, and spirit transforms.

**9. Fire and Timing**
Fire is the fire of spirit; timing is the alignment of signs. Model the cauldron and furnace on heaven and earth, use yang as charcoal, yin as water. As the sun and moon move, there is cold and heat. The central sovereign issues commands, carefully regulating and harmonizing. Though the numinous medicine is formless, it can subtly follow the mechanism of transformation, ascending and descending in reversal.

Master Cao said: *"When the qi of Li is reached in a hundred moments, cinnabar emerges from it."* There are rhythms of withdrawal and addition, advance and retreat, bathing—if even a hair’s breadth is amiss, regret and misfortune arise at once.

Master Ziyang said: *"Even if you recognize cinnabar and black lead, without knowing the fire and timing, it is as if idle. All depends on the power of maintenance—if even a hair’s breadth is amiss, the elixir will not form."* This is a matter of heavenly mechanism, not to be lightly discussed. The general meaning has already been seen in the works of Fuxi. The wise, reflecting nine times daily, will naturally awaken.

Of old, Lord Laozi’s *Twelve Secret Verses on the Fire and Timing of the Golden Elixir* were recorded as follows:

The secret says:
*"Sun and moon are the essence of Qian and Kun,
The hexagrams cycle in clear sequence.
From Kun’s end to Fu’s beginning, like tracing a linked ring.
Three-five before, three-five after—these are the waxing and waning crescents.
Five-six makes thirty, returning to life—this is the monthly seasonal node.
Born and extinguished, cycling through twelve—this is the yearly seasonal node.
Twelve divided into twenty-four—
The twenty-four qi complete the fire and timing of a year.
The twenty-four qi mutually shift and change, cycling endlessly.
All phenomena, every ounce and grain, are contained herein.
Mercury, one flavor divided into two, transforms into yin and yang.
Once transformed, they reunite as husband and wife—
Only then does one perceive heaven and earth within the crucible."*

These verses were spoken by the golden mouth of the Most High, revealing the subtlest principles of medicinal substances and fire timing. They are decreed for later learners of the Dao, who should treat them with reverence. If treated with disdain, calamity will swiftly follow—everywhere, divine spirits are present! One cannot be careless.

Master Pure Yang’s postscript says: *"Great indeed are the twelve verses, harmonizing with the Five Thousand Words."*

**10. Bathing**
The *Triplex Unity* says: *"In the second month, the elm dies; in the eighth month, the wheat sprouts. When punishment and virtue approach the gate, beware of danger."*

Master Ziyang said: *"In the months of the hare and rooster, when the time arrives and the signs of punishment and virtue approach, this is when the golden cinnabar should be bathed. If fire is added instead, peril will surely follow."* Thus, during the hours of Mao and You, one should bathe to balance them, not advance the fire timing.

**11. Shedding the Embryo**
Gradually growing larger, gradually becoming numinous, gradually forming.

Master Ziyang said: *"Fruit on the branch will ripen in time—how is the child in the womb any different?"*

Master Yunfang said: *"The child is young and not yet grown; it must rely on the nurturing kindness of father and mother. After nine years and three years, worldly affairs are exhausted—then it may roam heaven and earth, no longer bound to its parents."* Looking back at the old body, it is but a heap of dung and dirt. When merit is complete and the fruit is full, one ascends to pay homage to the Primordial Sovereign. This may be called *"form and spirit both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth."*

The *Song of Breaking Delusion* by the Perfected of Great Unity says:
*"By the roadside, you meet a fish, still flicking its red tail—
If you wish to save it, quickly return it to the water’s depths.
On the path, you meet a person whose life is slipping away—
If you wish to save them, swiftly give them the Dao’s principle.
Side doors and minor methods have a thousand strands and ten thousand threads,
But the true Dao’s affairs are not many—they do not extend beyond oneself."*

To save those lost in delusion, I briefly present one or two:
*"Circulating qi is not the Dao—breathing disrupts the constructive and defensive.
Swallowing saliva is not the Dao—saliva is not the water of spirit.
Visualization is not the Dao—painting cakes cannot serve as food.
Absorbing yin is not the Dao—when essence is exhausted, life follows in death.
Avoiding salt is not the Dao—food will lack savor.
Fasting is not the Dao—hunger and emaciation harm the intestines and stomach.
Abandoning one’s wife is not the Dao—yin and yang lose their proper positions."*

What, then, is the Dao?
*"The Great Unity contains true qi—
Qi intermingles yet does not intermingle, ascending and descending in imitation of heaven and earth.
Two things unite in harmony, arising from the primordial beginning.
The marvelous maiden and the infant boy, matched to achieve completion.
These are true yin and yang—husband and wife share one principle.
Thus, there is no need to abandon—how can solitary yang accomplish anything?
This is revealed to be the way of immortals—how could the golden elixir be easy?
The steadfast scholar does not speak of truth; the Great Cavern conceals profound meaning.
The five phases do not proceed in order—tigers are born in water.
The art of inverting the five phases—dragons emerge from fire.
These words are truly wondrous—they are the power of the Great Unity."*

Master Ziyang said: *"Abandoning one’s wife cuts off yin and yang; fasting merely leaves the intestines and stomach empty."* He cited the words of the *Song of Breaking Delusion* by the Perfected of Great Unity. While fasting is not the ultimate Dao, the principle behind abandoning one’s wife is profound.

In this world, those bound for hell, upon seeing Ziyang’s words, hastily annotate them with the *Three Peaks of Golden Flower* and the arts of bedroom cultivation, misleading later generations and casting scholars and gentlemen into hell. They fail to understand that the intent of the Perfected of Great Unity and Master Ziyang refers to the union of true yin and true yang within the body.

Thus, the *Triplex Unity* says: *"The male does not dwell alone; the female does not live in solitude."* And: *"Things without yin and yang violate heaven and turn against the primordial. A rooster hatching eggs alone will not produce complete chicks."*

Cloud Chamber said: *"Do not claim this body is wholly the Dao—cultivating but a single element is solitary yin."*

Bai Yuchan said: *"Within this body of mine lies husband and wife—speak of this to others, and they will surely laugh you to scorn."* This is precisely the point.

Master Ziyang said: *"If you can seek the Way by inverting daily use, the sands of the earth shall all turn to treasure."* And: *"Should you reverse this mechanism of life and death, disaster shall transform to blessing in the palm of your hand."* He also warned: *"I urge you, when facing the battle, do not take the enemy lightly—lest you lose our priceless treasure of the house."* And: *"If you grasp the killing mechanism and understand its reversal, you will know how harm conceals grace."*

Later, he admonished: *"If you have not refined the Returned Elixir, refine it with haste; once refined, know when to cease and be content. Should you persist in greed without restraint, you will inevitably meet ruin and disgrace."* This discourse guards against peril and contemplates danger—it is the pivot of reversal.

If the mind clings to sensual desire and the fire of lust burns below, the Great Treasure will be lost, the foundation of life will crumble. When that time comes, how can regret avail?

I write this again to warn those who study the Dao: may all tread the true path together, ascend the immortal ranks as one, and guide those who come after. Let not the blind lead the blind.

The *Song of Flowing Pearls* by Immortal Ge Xian says:
*"Flowing pearl, flowing pearl,
Cast to me, so earnest and small.
Wandering the four seas, traversing ten thousand scrolls,
Restless, tireless—forgetting sleep and food.
I sought counsel from all friends, burned cinnabar to ash.
For thirty years, each day I sighed in longing.
Now at sixty, I fear descending the Three Wretched Realms.
By my teacher’s transmission, I grasped the primordial qi of emptiness and nothingness.
First, stabilize the golden crucible; then, the jade furnace.
The fire of Li stirs; the water of Kan takes form.
Jade nectar irrigates, flowing suet fills the chamber of the Grotto.
The Perfected One ferries me—only the great man shall pass.
Hold this in mind, entrust this to memory."*

From this, we see that the ancients who studied the Dao did so with utmost diligence—none failed to meet a perfected being who enlightened them.

The path of internal elixir refinement employs no more than lead and mercury as its ingredients. First, cultivate the human Dao, taking loyalty and filial piety as the foundation, and aiding others as the priority. Treasure this body, harmonizing inner practice with outer conduct. Eliminate cravings, stabilize the mind and qi, moderate diet, and reduce sleep.

The supreme medicines within the body are essence, qi, and spirit. If essence is not recklessly discharged, primordial qi will blend harmoniously; when primordial qi blends harmoniously, the primordial spirit finds ease. Once these three are secured, the crucible gradually takes form. Only when the crucible is complete may one speak of refinement.

Someone asked: *"What does it mean that following the natural course gives birth to man, while reversal becomes the mother of the Elixir?"*

The answer: *"Following the natural course is the great principle of human relations. Essence and qi are divided to form a person—essence becomes matter, the wandering soul undergoes transformation. With a body comes suffering, and afflictions arise from this. Reversal inverts the Five Phases, harmonizes the Four Images, gathers the undivided qi of primordial chaos, and seizes the primal essence of dragon and tiger at their first union. Entering the Yellow Chamber, it produces the supreme treasure. This may be called generating form from the formless, creating a body beyond the body. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, one attains the rank of superior immortal!"*

*Concluding the Upper Scroll of Essential Pointers on the Elixir Canon of Master Jade Creek*

*Beginning the Middle Scroll of Essential Pointers on the Elixir Canon of Master Jade Creek*

Master Li Jianyi of Jade Creek compiled this *Book of Longevity and Everlasting Vision*. The *Yellow Emperor’s Hidden Talisman Classic* states: "Above lies the Dao of immortals embracing the One; in the middle, the methods for enriching the state and pacifying the people; below, the arts of strengthening the army and securing victory." Its three sections unfold in mere hundreds of words—its text profound and recondite, its Dao deep and subtle. Though commentaries abound, interpretations vary. In ancient times, the Perfected One of Huayang transmitted the Dao to the Perfected One Yang in the valley, concealing its essence in three precepts, all pertaining to the arcane principles of inner refinement. Master Jade Creek explored its subtleties, elucidated its chapters and meanings, and thus composed the *Book of Longevity and Everlasting Vision*.

Now, the design of the human body mirrors the image of a state: the heart serves as sovereign, essence and qi as the people. To empty the heart and house the spirit is to nurture one’s nature; to cherish essence and treasure qi is to nurture one’s life. When essence and qi are firmly established, the spirit does not wander recklessly. Naturally, blood and qi flow unimpeded, constructive and defensive energies harmonize, the five viscera and six bowels, the four limbs and three barriers, the twelve hundred numinous spirits and twelve thousand deities—all encircle the body, silently serving as its guardians and sovereigns. By exhausting the meaning of the *Hidden Talisman Classic*, practicing the teachings of purity and quiescence, shutting out the allure of the ears and eyes, forsaking the desires of the mouth and belly, establishing the Five Constants to govern the framework, and deploying the Seven Governances to oversee the myriad spirits—with the sovereign abiding in the Central Palace, none dare indulge in excess—one draws upon oneself and attends to the root of the body. Weeding and tilling, one cultivates the fertile ground. Thus, purple mushrooms sprout in the cinnabar field, yellow sprouts grow in the mysterious garden, the numinous terrace and spirit chamber become golden bodies and jade flowers, the inner gardens and Penglai Isles bear intertwining pears and fiery jujubes. The Three Luminaries align in measure, the Four Seasons remain ever spring-like, and all things flourish while the people dwell in peace—just as in the land of Hua Xu!

There was a Perfected One of Cinnabar Origin, whose feathered robes trailed as he approached the sovereign. The sovereign invited him to the seat of honor and, bowing respectfully, asked: "Perfected One, you have come from afar—what teachings do you bring?" Cinnabar Origin replied: "I dwell within the compass, not far from you at all." The sovereign asked: "What is meant by 'within the compass'?" Cinnabar Origin answered: "The *Canon* states: 'The Perfected One lurks in the deep abyss, floating and roaming while guarding the compass.' It refers to the center of the precious pearl. From before the Great Simplicity, I was born with you; after the Supreme Ultimate, I stood with you. In movement and stillness, speech and silence, I am ever with you. Yet what you now practice are merely the methods and arts of the middle and lower sections of the *Hidden Talisman Classic*. With these, one may govern the state and achieve great peace, or cultivate the body and extend one’s lifespan. But if one can practice the Dao of immortals embracing the One, ascend to the Jade Void, and attain the rank of Perfected One—when merit is complete and virtue perfected—one may serve as a minister in the Three Realms!"

The sovereign said: "I have long fixed my spirit upon this Dao. Though I have sought instruction far and wide, it has never resonated in my heart. Your arrival, Perfected One, is a blessing from the heavens!" He bowed again and entreated him for the Dao. Cinnabar Origin said: "The Dao of immortals embracing the One is the Dao of inner elixir and golden fluid refining the form. I did not know it from birth. Just as those who carve the jade of He and bore the pearl of Sui are master craftsmen, so too is the Great Dao’s returning elixir! Without encountering a teacher’s transmission, there is no principle by which one may awaken on one’s own. Your nature and principles are somewhat clear, but your destiny remains unmastered. Destiny must be refined through the inner elixir; once the inner elixir is complete, the Dao of nature and destiny is fulfilled!"

The sovereign pressed further, wishing to hear its essentials. Cinnabar Origin said: "The Dao of the inner elixir first takes Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel, then Kan and Li as the medicinal substances, with the remaining sixty hexagrams as the firing times. There are stages of gathering, refining, and tempering, as well as proper moments for warming and nurturing, bathing and washing. One seizes the divine workings of creation and transformation, embodying the functions of Heaven and Earth. The oral transmissions and mind-to-mind instructions of immortals and sages are governed by the strictest regulations—this is no trifling matter. Those who possess the Dao must revere it accordingly."

The sovereign asked: "May I inquire how the inner elixir takes Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel, and Kan and Li as the medicinal substances?" Cinnabar Origin replied: "The *Book of Changes* states: 'Heaven and Earth take their positions, and the Changes operate within them.' The crucible, vessel, and medicinal substances are all contained therein. An ancient song says:
*The crucible is no metal crucible,
The furnace no moonlit furnace.
Li rises from beneath Kan,
Dui dwells within the crucible.*

The Immortal Wei also said:
*Model the crescent moon for the furnace and crucible,
The White Tiger serves as the pivot for refining.
Mercury, the sun’s flowing pearl,
Accompanied by the Green Dragon.*

This is the method of taking the Yin crucible and Yang furnace, with water above and fire below, arranging the twenty-eight constellations, aligning the eight trigrams and four seasons, drilling and clustering the Five Phases, harmonizing the Four Images, refining the dragon and tiger, restraining the hun and po, ensuring inner and outer correspondence, inverting ascent and descent, wielding the authority of creation and transformation, and gestating the mysterious pearl. How vast is the crucible!"

The Master inquired: "The alchemical classics speak only of lead and mercury—yet what are lead and mercury truly?"

The Elixir Origin replied: "These are the very medicinal substances. They bear many names—Dragon and Tiger, Crow and Hare, Water and Fire, Metal and Wood, Husband and Wife, Infant Boy and Maiden Girl—too numerous to list. I shall point directly to their essence, that you may awaken!

Consider this: Heaven’s One generates Water, and within Water lies Metal. Outwardly Yin yet inwardly Yang, it resembles the Hare within the Moon—lead containing silver, black enclosing white gold. This is the essence, the true Lead. Earth’s Two generates Fire, and Fire arises from Wood. Outwardly Yang yet inwardly Yin, it resembles the Crow within the Sun—cinnabar yielding mercury, the masculine enfolding the feminine. This is the Wood’s sap, the true Mercury.

True Mercury emerges from the Li Palace, the Dragon issuing from Fire. True Lead is born in the Kan position, the Tiger arising from Water. These are not the common cinnabar or quicksilver, sulfur or black tin, nor any of the Five Metals or Eight Stones. They are nothing but the true Yin and true Yang within the body—neither seminal essence, saliva, qi, nor blood, but that which nourishes the vital essence so the medicine may daily grow.

The practitioner takes the Yang Lead from the Kan position and unites it with the Yin Mercury of the Li Palace. With fire timing unerring, the Elixir must form."

The Perfected One of Purple Yang said:
*"Take the solid core from Kan’s center,
Transform the Yin within Li’s belly.
From this, the firm Qian body is born—
Hidden or soaring, all lies within the heart."*

The Master asked: "What does it mean to ‘gather on the proper day, harvest at the right time’?"

The Elixir Origin replied: "The *Cantong Qi* states:
*From darkest night to dawn’s first light,
Zhen arrives to receive the mandate.
The Fu hexagram begins its sprouting—
The eldest son succeeds the father’s form.*
All operations commence here. As the *Book of Changes* says: *Fu reveals the heart of Heaven and Earth!*

The Master asked: "What is meant by ‘union’?"

The Elixir Origin replied: "The Sun is Li, the Moon is Kan—their essences devour one another."

The Master asked: "What is meant by ‘refining’?"

The Elixir Origin replied: "The alchemical classics say:
*Rising to boil upon the Rice Mountain,
Fierce flames spread below.*
And again:
*The Vermilion Bird blazes in the void,
Purple radiance illumines the sun.
Molten gold does not flee,
Scorched earth sends up clouds of smoke.*
The Perfected One of Cloud Chamber said:
*The White Tiger, fierce and unruly,
The Green Dragon, wild and untamed—
But once plunged into the Cauldron of the Flowery Pool,
True Fire erupts to shatter the heavens.*
This conveys the essential meaning."

The Master asked: "What is meant by ‘warm nurturing’?"

The Elixir Origin replied: "Like a dragon nurturing its pearl, like a hen brooding her eggs—morning in *Tun*, evening in *Meng*, daily employing the two hexagrams."

The Master asked: "What is meant by ‘bathing’?"

The Elixir Origin replied: "*Guan* and *Dazhuang*—yin and yang first part, punishment and virtue stand at the gate; one must guard against peril."

The Master asked: "May I inquire what *true earth* is? What does the *spatula* resemble?"

The Elixir Origin replied: "What is called ‘not departing from true *wu* and *ji*’—the immortals speak of a single *spatula* per day. The *Cantong Qi* says:
*Kan* is *wu*, the essence of the moon;
*Li* is *ji*, the radiance of the sun.
Sun and moon form the Changes,
Hard and soft in perfect balance.
The *spatula* and true earth
Are wholly contained therein."

The Master asked: "What is meant by the *matchmaker*?"

The Elixir Origin replied: "What is a matchmaker? The union of lead and mercury—without a matchmaker, it cannot be done."

The Master bowed again and said: "I have roughly grasped the workings of internal elixir cultivation. Yet the subtleties of the firing times remain obscure—pray impart the true teaching."

The Elixir Origin replied: "This matter belongs to the celestial mechanism; it must not be recklessly divulged. Yet since we have met, it cannot be left unspoken. Now, human nature is like water: water gives rise to wood, and wood governs benevolence—thus is nature perfectly good. Wood gives rise to fire, and fire governs the heart; when the heart congeals into spirit, it becomes *spirit-fire*. With this spirit-fire, one refines the silver within lead. Thus the *Cantong Qi* holds its deepest secret in the two words *lead* and *fire*—the power of spirit-fire is not small!

Yet this fire is no ordinary fire. As Master Ziyang said: ‘Within the cauldron, if there is no true seed, it is like boiling an empty pot with fierce flames.’ To apply the firing times without the medicine is but to burn one’s own body. Thus the *Yinfu Jing* says:
*Fire is born of wood,
Disaster erupts and must be subdued.*
*Zealotry arises in the state,
When the time moves, it must collapse.*

Ziyang also said:
*Fire is born of wood, its edge concealed—
Without skill to drill and temper, do not force the attack.
Disaster strikes only because it harms oneself;
One must seek to subdue it with the Golden Duke.*
The Golden Duke is true bismuth.

As for the firing times:
On the third day, *Zhen* stirs;
On the eighth day, *Dui* moves.
When the virtues of the three and five are complete,
The body of *Qian* is formed.
*Xun* inherits its lineage,
Sealing and holding fast.
*Gen* governs advance and retreat,
Not missing the proper moment.
*Six-Five Kun* receives,
Binding the beginning and end.
Warmly nurture the child-pearl,
And it shall become the mother of all kinds.

When yin is exhausted and yang is pure,
One transcends and transforms spiritually—
This is *formless giving rise to form*,
A body beyond the body,
Enduring through vast kalpas,
Transforming from mortal to sage.

This Dao sweeps away the three thousand six hundred heterodox paths.
The Great Ultimate generates the Three Powers through it;
Parents nurture our bodies through it;
We must perfect our true selves through it.
Conceived in primordial chaos,
Born in *Kun* and *Gui*,
Vast and indistinct, elusive—
Those who awaken grasp it for themselves."

Having spoken, the Elixir Origin rose from his seat and entered the compass, suddenly vanishing without a trace. The Master broke into a cold sweat, as if drenched by morning dew, or as if just awakened from a daydream. He sought out Master Yuxi and recounted all that had transpired.

Regarding the Elixir Origin’s words, he sighed deeply and said: "The Dao lies near, yet one seeks it afar; the matter is easy, yet one seeks it in difficulty. The Elixir Origin’s words existed before the Great Simplicity, born with me; they arose after the Great Ultimate, standing with me. Entering the compass and vanishing into silence, yet the numinous terrace gains truth—is this not the ‘I within me’? If one recognizes this as true, then there is yet another within!

May I ask: which is greater, you or I?"

Master Yuxi replied: "The Elixir Origin to the Master, the Master to Yuxi—like the moon in water: vast as rivers and seas, small as a dish or bowl. Divided, countless moons appear; gathered, they return to one. Have you not heard the *Lingbao Jing* say: ‘The Primordial Beginning suspended a single treasure-pearl, large as a millet grain, in the empty mystery, five feet above the earth. The Primordial Beginning led the Celestial Perfected, the Great Spirits, the Lofty and Venerable, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the boundless hosts of the Ten Directions and the Utmost Realized Great Spirits—all entered the treasure-pearl.’ Thus this pearl, vast, encompasses the three thousand great thousand worlds; small, it enters the tip of an autumn hair. Vigorously, it is swallowed into the mouth of the pearl—this is the myriad returning to one. How could it stop at three?"

The Master asked: "What is the analogy of the treasure-pearl for humans?"

Master Yuxi replied: "It is precisely the Dao of golden liquid internal elixir and spirit-refinement of which the Elixir Origin spoke. The Yellow Emperor sought the mysterious pearl at Red Water, yet without *Wangxiang*, he could not obtain it—this is that pearl. Regardless of high or low status, every person possesses it, yet it does not depart from within the body. As the ancients’ poem says:
*A priceless night-luminescent pearl, unrecognized by men—
Fools waste thousands of lives in vain.*
This laments their loss and ruin. The profound meaning of the treasure-pearl is indeed the secret essence of the *Lingbao Jing*. It is not something lower scholars may hear; even with cultivation, mere recitation is futile. Though one hears it at dawn and dies at dusk, not one person has truly seen it. Now, the celestial mechanism is revealed—clearly, I tell it to you."

The Primordial Beginning is the black ancestor of the primordial azure, the root of Heaven and Earth, the mother of the myriad things—it is the white within black, the silver within lead, the true lead. The Great Floating Li Earth is likened to the palace of Kun and Gui. At first, the divine wind is still and silent, mountains and seas conceal clouds, and qi ascends to the mysterious void. This void is the mysterious of Heaven, born in the Kun palace, growing into the yellow sprout—thus the yellow of Earth. The mysterious of Heaven is the qi of wood-mercury, while the yellow of Earth is the color of metal-lead.

The *Cantong Qi* says:
*The male, yang, scatters the mysterious;
The female, yin, transforms the yellow embrace.
Chaos intermingles and joins,
The foundation is firmly established.
Tending and nurturing the bud,
Spirit congeals to form the body.
The multitude treads forth,
All things wriggle and move by this.*

Illuminating the qi of the mysterious and the yellow, they interact and conceive the precious—this is the insubstantial giving birth to substance, called the Returned Elixir. It is also named the Black Pearl, the Mysterious Pearl, the Treasure Pearl. Those who encounter and refine it do so by the rarest of karmic fortune.

The Master asked: "Then where is your treasure pearl?"
Yuxi Zi pointed above Kun and below Qian, where indeed there was a thing, the size of a millet grain, radiant and translucent, illuminating within and without.

Yuxi Zi said: "This is the elixir of a single day. With my true essence, I seize the workings of creation to generate it. From the subtle to the manifest, success comes in three years. One who enters this transcends the reckoning of the Five Phases!"

Yuxi Zi led the Master to follow and enter. Once within the pearl’s mouth, enlightenment dawned in a flash.

*Disquisition on Resolving Delusions*
The essence of cultivating the true lies solely in the Golden Elixir. The Golden Elixir is lead-fire; lead-fire is metal-wood; metal-wood is emotion and nature. Stillness is nature, movement is emotion. The *Cantong Qi* says: *"When metal returns to its original nature, it is then called the Returned Elixir."* Clarifying emotion to restore nature, nature returns to the Great Simplicity. When nature returns to the Great Simplicity, life is complete.

If one only illuminates this nature without cultivating life, it is called solitary cultivation—like the moon after the full, waning day by day, its brightness unseen. When it reaches darkness, it is like a person’s sudden passing. Though the person passes suddenly, nature remains as it was, but life ends and things decay; nature cannot abide and drifts away of itself.

Su Dongpo’s poem, citing Chan metaphors, says:
*Like the cold moon clinging to bright day,
Only a solitary light lingers in old entanglements.*

Even if the mind’s ground ascends to perfect clarity, it is merely guarding a stubborn emptiness. If one can attain flawless thoroughness, one may directly transcend to the Buddha-realm. As the *Heart Sutra* says: *"No increase, no decrease; no defilement, no purity; no arising, no ceasing"*—returning to your original face.

If leakage is not yet exhausted, one will emerge again, not losing the human form. Fortunate indeed! Yet this is because life remains unresolved.

Once, Liu Haichan sang:
*"True indeed—Buddha-dharma is the Dao,
One child held by two."*

Master Ziyang said:
*"The Śākya teaches cultivation for Sukhāvatī,
Yet Sukhāvatī is but the Golden Land."*
How could one fathom what is meant by the Golden Land?

The *Cantong Qi* states:
*"White is the essence of metal,
Black is the foundation of water.
Water is the pivot of the Dao,
Its number is called the One.
The master of the five metals
Is the River Chariot of the North."*

It further says:
*"Metal is the mother of water,
The mother conceals the child in her womb.
Water is the child of metal,
The child shelters in the mother’s belly."*

Laozi said:
*"Know the white, guard the black,
And become the model for all under heaven."*

True lead is born in the northern position of Kun and Gui,
The ancestor of primordial qi.
To gather it, one must act before the Great Simplicity reveals qi—
Only then can it be used!
Combine the silver within this lead with the mercury within cinnabar,
Generating being from non-being—
Thus is it called the Reverted Elixir.

Above, it aligns with the crowing of the cock;
Below, it harmonizes with the tides.
Humans dwell as one of the Three Powers,
Between heaven and earth.
The primordial qi spans eight hundred and ten zhang.
The great cycle follows heaven;
The lesser cycle follows the sun.
Inhalation and exhalation are the plain key,
Responding to the opening and closing of qian and kun.

Thus, with each exhalation, the pulse moves three inches;
With each inhalation, the pulse moves three inches.
One breath—one cycle—strikes the life-sustaining belt.

The *Huangting Neijing Jing* says:
*"The two kidneys, lords of water, face the Gate of Life,
Where the sun and moon enter and exit, and breath is stored."*

This is the true center of the body’s upper and lower realms,
The pivot of warp and weft.
Before, it faces the navel;
Behind, it aligns with the kidneys.
It is like chaos—
Heart and kidneys merge into one vessel,
White as a thread,
Linked like a ring,
A span of one cun and two fen,
Enveloping the essence of the entire body.
Here, the primordial qi strikes.

For those who cultivate the truth,
Gathering lead and casting it into mercury,
A single drop falls into this center—
This is called "establishing the foundation,"
A hundred days’ work.

Once this foundation is laid,
It is named the Mysterious Female.
The Mysterious Female is neither mouth nor nose,
Nor any aperture with form or image.
Laozi said:
*"The gate of the Mysterious Female
Is called the root of heaven and earth.
Subtle, it seems to exist;
Its use is never exhausted."*

Zhuangzi said:
*"The true person breathes from the heels."*
Yet it is not the feet—
This is the meaning implied.

The *Bian Que Ling Gui Jing* states:
*"Above, the Mysterious; below, the Female—
Mother and child embrace in intimacy."*
Thus, the Mysterious Female is the source of yin and yang,
The dwelling of spirit and qi.

Once the Mysterious Female is established,
It is like a fetus in the mother’s womb:
When the mother breathes, so does the child;
When the mother inhales, so does the child.
Hence, "mother and child embrace in intimacy."
Ordinary people cannot fathom this.
When the inner elixir nears completion,
The primordial qi naturally abides here—
What need is there to ask of cold or heat, hunger or thirst,
Or of the span of years?

Bodhidharma sat facing the wall for nine years
Without the slightest loss—
His breath abided of itself,
No other technique was needed.
For he had attained this Dao.

To establish the Mysterious Female,
First secure the root.
The root of the root
Is primordial essence.
Primordial essence is the transformation of primordial qi—
Thus, essence and qi are one.
When the primordial spirit dwells within,
The three unite as one!

Master Shi said:
*"When spirit resides within qi,
The elixir path naturally forms."*

If essence is depleted, qi is exhausted;
When qi is exhausted, spirit departs.
The *Book of Changes* says:
*"Essence and qi become things;
The wandering soul undergoes transformation."*
This is the revolving of life and destiny.

What the true immortals cultivate
Is nothing but returning to this root,
Restoring life and destiny.
The medicine of life and destiny
Is none other than spirit, qi, and essence.
Spirit is the wandering soul;
Things are essence and qi.

The *Book of Changes* says:
*"Heaven and earth intermingle,
And the myriad things are harmonized.
Male and female unite their essence,
And the myriad things are born."*

When the untransformed primordial qi of primordial essence
Is used to refine the supreme spirit,
The spirit gains radiance
And its transformations become unfathomable—
This is called "spirit immortal."

Thus, cultivation begins within one’s own body,
Not through external things.

Yet those who study the Dao today
Refuse to investigate life and destiny to the utmost,
Instead chasing side doors and miscellaneous arts,
Ingesting metals, minerals, herbs, and plants in vain hope—
This is truly forgetting the root!

Moreover, there are those seeds of hell
Who falsely cite the songs and verses of immortals and sages,
Using deception to obscure truth,
Deluding scholar-officials,
Dragging them into the ledgers of ghosts.
For instance, they distort Master Ziyang’s poem:
*"Cease from wife, vainly severing yin and yang,"*
Twisting it into the "Three Peaks" technique of bedroom arts,
Slandering the earlier true ones—
How dreadful!

I have traveled rivers and lakes for years
And witnessed such people,
Like sheep led to the butcher’s block,
Dying one after another—
Too many to count.
How pitiful!

Do they truly grasp Master Ziyang’s profound intent?
For within one’s own body lies true yin and yang.

An earlier worthy said:
*"Within this body are husband and wife—
Tell this to the world, and they’ll surely laugh."*

For within, kan and li flow from wu to ji.
Once the foundation is established,
One must not speak of "gathering medicine"!

Master Ziyang said:
*"Before refining the Reverted Elixir, refine it urgently;
Once refined, know when to stop.
If you persist in grasping without restraint,
You will one day meet with ruin."*

This is not done willingly,
But to emulate heaven and earth, father and mother,
Seizing creation within oneself.
Issuing forth from you, then returning to you—
Like a raft crossing the river or a ladder ascending the sky,
Once there, all are discarded.

If you attain the Mysterious Pearl and form its image,
If the Great One returns to truth,
Then investigate true emptiness,
Merge with the Dao as one.

How can the seeds of hell
Be spoken of in the same breath?

Someone asked Master Yuxi:
*"In your *Discourse on Resolving Doubts*,
Do you speak of the Mysterious Female thus?"*

Master Yuxi replied:
*"It seems so, yet not so.
Do not cling to it as existent,
Nor fixate on it as formless."*

Purple Yang the Perfected One said:
*"To keep the Valley Spirit ever undying,
You must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root.
When true gold returns, the golden chamber stands—
A single luminous pearl, immovable forever."*

This merely points to the foundation of creation.
Apart from your own body,
Where else could it be settled?

Yet within it, substance and function, the provisional and the false,
Are fundamentally no different.
As with Qian and Kun modeling heaven and earth,
Kan and Li embodying the sun and moon.

Laozi said:
*"The Valley Spirit does not die—
This is called the Mysterious Female.
The gate of the Mysterious Female
Is called the root of heaven and earth."*
The "valley" signifies utmost emptiness;
"spirit" is a metaphor for the self—
In truth, it is but one’s nature.
Establish the enclosure as a dwelling,
Then spirit and qi have a place of storage,
Not scattered in disorder.
Turn the light around, return the gaze,
And come back home—
Even in haste, never depart from it.
For one who abides thus,
The Mysterious Pearl forms of itself,
The sacred embryo takes shape naturally.

The *Ancient Dragon-Tiger Classic* states:
*"The Spirit Chamber holds cavernous emptiness,
Where the Dark and White give birth to the Golden Duke."*
It also says:
*"The Spirit Chamber has its image—
A hen’s egg as its form."*
The *Canticle* declares:
*"The true person lurks in the deep abyss,
Floating and roaming within the compass."*
The *Song of the Cauldron* sings:
*"Coming and going, wandering without leaving the door,
Gradually the great nature matures, the temperament purifies."*

Those who delve into the profound mysteries
Should truly establish destiny upon the heart-ground of Fuxi,
Dwell within the primordial chaos—
Then they shall arrive at the inner realm!

What is *"establishing destiny upon the heart-ground of Fuxi"*?
Before the trigrams were drawn,
At the very moment of their inception—
Like the moon at the heart of heaven,
Or the wind upon the water’s surface—
A single taste of pure clarity,
Few indeed can fathom it.

What is *"dwelling within the primordial chaos"*?
Alas!

Last night, within the depths of Seven Stars Pool,
A divine sword clearly transformed into a dragon—
Wait but for its form to emerge in full,
And I shall show it to all.

Hmph!
Fill the gourd to the brim with mercury,
Seal its mouth and plunge it into deep water.
The mercury is the intent within my gourd,
Sinking and floating as the water yet breathes—
Here lies a wondrous principle,
Only the enlightened grasp its true essence.

Master Stone Immortal says:
*"The horse of intent returns to the spirit-chamber,
The ape of the heart guards the cavern-room.
Spirit, essence, soul, and will,
Gather to form purple-golden frost."*
Truly, this is the single aperture of the mysterious pass,
The serene spirit-chamber—
Neither within nor without,
Yet clearly pointed out.

*Dharma-Speech of the Elixir Chamber*
Congeal the mind as the sun, and the spirit unites;
Congeal the spirit to return to qi and refine the elixir.
Emotions revert to nature, nature returns to the root to nurture life.
The foundation of the returned elixir lies in lead and mercury alone.
Primordial essence is the ancestor of life—cherish it, and true lead arises of itself;
Primordial spirit is the origin of nature—conserve it, and true mercury is born.
Thus, secure essence to nourish qi, secure qi to nourish spirit.
Lead and mercury meet in due time,
Breath flows ceaselessly as the fire-tending.
Spirit and qi never part for an instant,
Forgetting thoughts over time, the golden elixir forms.

If true lead flees,
And true mercury withers,
Primordial essence scatters, primordial spirit weeps—
To seek return then, is it not difficult?

Master Liu Haichan transmitted to Master Ma Ziran the *Formula of the Golden Elixir*, saying:
*"I once received the true adept’s oral transmission,
Who split my belly and opened my bowels to instruct me.
He split the lotus but left its heart unbroken,
Drawing forth the red blood from my very body.
It surged straight to the Palace of Great Oneness,
Where within the crucible the true sun and moon appeared.
Yin and yang intertwined, crow and hare united,
A single luminous pearl shone with radiant clarity.
It burst through two paths to pierce the Gate of Heaven,
Plowing the three fields to sow purple snow.
At Kunlun’s summit, it scraped the sky bright,
Shaking the Sea Gate as if the earth split.
Thirty spokes converge like the dharmadhātu’s wheel,
Upper and lower arcs meet the recumbent moon.
The work of advancing fire is but stillness,
As sun and moon cycle without pause.
Refined into a cinnabar orange the size of a pellet,
One rides the crane and phoenix to court the imperial palace."*

Master Yuxi says:
*"The words are simple yet essential—only those who truly encounter it
Shall know the wondrousness of life’s foundation, all contained herein.
It cannot be attained through language or script."*

*The Practice of Fuxi*
The *Golden Fluid Treatise of the Daoist Canon* states:
*"The ancients all consumed the Great Elixir of Golden Flower and Dragon Embryo,
Thereby attaining transformation and flight, ascending into formlessness.
Yet in that age, there were no crucibles, no firewood,
No five metals or eight minerals—
Clearly, this was internal alchemy!"*

The sage Fuxi, perceiving heaven’s mechanism, drew the trigrams,
Embodying creation to inaugurate the *Book of Changes*.
The *Changes* begins with the drawing of trigrams.
The *Book of Changes* says:
*"Heaven and earth take their positions,
Mountain and marsh exchange qi,
Thunder and wind contend,
Water and fire do not oppose one another."*
Nine returns and seven reversions—
These are the principles embodied in practice.

Tracing back to Qian and Kun, Kan and Li,
The bellows of the female and male—
All are fundamentally one, fundamentally one.
By inverting their symbols,
The crucible and medicinal substances are revealed.
At the first stirring of the night’s qi,
When the initial yang begins to sprout,
The sea waves seethe,
The black turtle sprays its mist,
Metal and water align,
Like the toad spewing its wheel.
Gather it in an instant,
Bind it in a moment.

The Yellow Center issues its decree,
The nation knows no harmful ways,
Weapons rest, punishments cease,
Heaven is clear, earth is tranquil.
Sun and moon traverse east and west,
Water and fire govern south and north.
Dragon coils, tiger crouches,
Metal strikes, wood flourishes.
At the turn of yi and gui,
The first dawn of *fu* responds.
The hun is born in Zhen’s geng,
Dui receives ding—
This is the upper arc, eight taels of metal.
At the fullness of the fifteenth,
The peak of jia and ren,
The po grows in Xun’s xin,
Gen receives bing—
This is the lower arc, half a catty of water.
At the sixth and fifth returning to darkness,
The northeast loses its companion.
Cyclical and endless,
Advancing and retreating with the fire’s rhythm.
The host within the dwelling,
Concentrating inwardly,
Withdrawing sight and returning hearing,
Abiding in effortless ease.
Encompassing the ten thousand images,
Perfecting the utmost spirit—
At the two solstices and two equinoxes,
Warmth, coolness, cold, and heat,
Day and night, hours and moments,
Follow without forcing.

When mao and you govern punishment and virtue,
Bathe and cleanse.
In a single day,
Myriad transformations arise.
Uplifted, harmonious, and joyous,
The hundred meridians flutter gently,
Dripping like spring rain,
Flowing like melting ice.
From the head, it streams to the feet,
Then ultimately ascends again.
The flute and reed pipe sound hollowly,
Like the autumn cicada’s rising and falling song.
True qi swims and drifts,
Overflowing the heart—then oppression,
The navel and abdomen ache in yin’s pain,
Endured with hesitation and stumbling.

At this time,
Regulate breath to be ceaseless,
Focus attention within the compass.
The yin pain is no true pain,
Endure it with gentle intent,
Like the tender feelings of a maiden,
Or the spring slumber of the crabapple.
One feels the two kidneys as if boiling,
Then the bladder as if scorching—
This is the spirit and qi of the spirit-chamber becoming substance,
One’s own wandering soul undergoing transformation.

Thus,
Draw in a single breath to circulate,
Stir the numinous spring to flow.
Unrefined butterflies scatter like blossoms,
Falling unevenly in all directions,
Transforming into jade liquid.
Again, like sweet dew at the crown,
About to split the three yangs,
Gathering spirit and qi to fill the chamber,
None can retain it.
Those who guard it prosper,
Those who lose it perish.
The essence of the three and five,
The utmost spirit of heaven and earth,
Pure and unobstructed,
Its spirit never wearies—
Thus one knows the true nature of Qian’s vigor,
Returning to become an infant.

In silent sitting,
The empty chamber generates brightness,
Snow and moon shine together,
Flowing pearls and golden medicine,
Lightning and cinnabar oranges—
All appear as if outside.
At times, one sees the old dwelling,
Clear and distinct in every part.
The clods of earth and dust,
Neither rejoiced in nor surprised by,
The mind steadfastly fixed—
Suddenly, one’s body is embraced,
A cinnabar serpent coils around the heart.

One may also see strange beings,
Revealing their forms,
Beautiful women or mad spirits,
Weeping and pleading in sorrowful longing.
Some foretell future events,
Others claim to be heavenly messengers,
Departing only to return,
Stirring delusive thoughts.
Remain unmoved,
Let them live or die—
Since the heart does not receive them,
In time, they vanish of themselves.

All are spirits within the body or external demons come to test—if one fears, the mind becomes entangled and loses its steadfast hold. Only by severing ties and withdrawing from worldly affairs should one first entrust governance to those of virtue and power.

A year has three hundred sixty days, totaling four thousand three hundred twenty hours. Subtracting the seven hundred twenty hours for bathing, only three thousand six hundred hours remain. Thus, the true qi of these three thousand six hundred hours responds to Qian’s one hundred forty-four counting rods and Kun’s two hundred sixteen, forming the function of the sixty hexagrams. The four hexagrams of mating—Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li—are not included. These four hexagrams of mating, Qian and Kun, Kan and Li, together comprise three hundred eighty-four lines, corresponding to three hundred eighty-four *zhu*, matching the weight of one *jin*, with intercalary time included.

The counting rods of the two *pian* total three hundred sixty. Each hour corresponds to twenty-four *zhu* of fire, one *liang*. In a month, excluding *mao* and *you*, this amounts to seven thousand two hundred *zhu*; in a year, eighty-six thousand four hundred *zhu*, equaling two hundred twenty-five *jin* of fire. Within this, the tenfold multiplication yields eight hundred sixty-four thousand of true qi, totaling two thousand two hundred fifty *jin* of fire, which transmutes the body inherited from one’s parents into a body of pure yang. Truly, formlessness gives rise to form, and a body exists beyond the body. At first, one step, then two; later, a hundred steps make a mile. After three years and nine cycles, one roams freely through heaven and earth—treading water and fire, penetrating metal and stone. Though faced with Yao’s floods or Tang’s droughts, the calamities of yang-nine and yin-six, all pose no peril.

When the Dao is perfected and virtue accomplished, one conceals oneself to await the time. The Supreme Unity then summons, relocating one to the Central Land. When merit is fulfilled, one ascends, receiving the register and chart. Yet one must choose successors wisely to transmit the teaching to posterity, thereby serving the Supreme Clarity and becoming free of imperfection.

**Zhang Ziyang’s Song for Daoist Liu of White Dragon Cave**

Hare runs, crow flies—both suns hasten,
First blooms the flower, then autumn frost descends.
Vainly boast of a thousand years’ wealth and longevity,
Yet all is but a lightning flash amid the clouds.

A lightning flash—how fleeting!
A hundred years, thirty-six thousand days,
Through scorching heat and freezing cold,
Unseen, youth’s glow fades in darkness.
Though children and grandchildren fill one’s sight,
All become bonds of love, entangling ever tighter.
When essence is exhausted and the body withers,
Who can devise a way to briefly stay the course?

No way to stay—no plan remains,
Inevitably, the body follows the flowing waters.
Behold the sages and worthies of old—
How many knew the art of abiding in the world?

Yet abiding in the world has its method,
Only because men of this age misjudge.
They scramble into the mountains seeking herbs and trees,
Refining lead, restraining mercury, concocting cinnabar yang.

Concocting cinnabar yang—how different the task!
One must seek crimson blood in the Kan palace,
Then take it to the Li position to refine yin essence.
Kan embodies Kun’s body, Li embodies Qian’s body.
Qian’s yang unites with Kun to form Kan—
This is called "flowing wu."
Kun’s yin unites with Qian to give birth to Li—
This is called "returning ji."
All things gestate in the *zi* hour;
Qian’s *ren* and Kun’s *gui* meet in the north,
Hence called the Kan palace—
The Kan palace is the Kun palace.
The southwest is the native land,
Not the positions of *wei* and *shen*.
Primal qi arises from this.
Crimson blood is the single yang essence within the body,
Also called yang lead—
Truly, the primordial unity of qi.

The Classic says: "How sublime!
True lead, prior to heaven and earth,
This is true lead."
The Li position is the Qian palace.
Know the time to gather this yang lead,
Use it to refine the yin essence of the Li position—
Yin essence is yin mercury,
The liquid of wood.
When these two substances unite,
They form the inner elixir—
Not the cinnabar or mercury of the world,
Nor the metals, minerals, herbs, or tangible things.

The blending must follow its season,
The medicine’s flavor mild,
Gold and water in equal measure.
The Yellow Dame serves as matchmaker,
Seeking union in marriage.
The key lies in knowing the season—
The season requires the matchmaker.

*The Kinship of the Three* says:
"From the dark of the moon to dawn,
Zhen arrives to receive the tally."
This is the time when the first yang stirs.
At this moment,
The female dragon hums,
The male tiger roars.
With the matchmaker, they unite of themselves—
The matchmaker is the Yellow Dame.

An ancient song says:
"Three and four dwell together in one chamber,
One and two, husband and wife, become a pair.
Only with a good matchmaker may they wed,
Thus their union deepens in affection."

Ziyang says:
"Originally, wu and ji served as matchmakers,
Thus husband and wife remain in joyful union."
He also says:
"One must rely on the matchmaker’s guidance."

Master Shi says:
"Who understands the workings?
The gist lies with the Yellow Dame."
Thus, the Yellow Dame is true earth,
True earth is the Yellow Dame.
When the male and female unite,
Hard and soft intertwine inseparably—
None but the Yellow Dame can accomplish this.
She is the pivot of the returning elixir,
The embankment of metal and water,
The center where the Way flows freely,
Rightly positioned within the body,
Beauty dwelling therein.
The Yellow Dame, true earth—
Her great outline is now revealed!

The Golden Duke and the Radiant Maiden wed.
The Golden Duke and the Radiant Maiden—
Their meanings are explained below.
Their union is the merging of lead and mercury.
The Golden Duke favors riding the White Tiger.
The Golden Duke is lead,
Embracing the essence of Heavenly One,
Born of the moon and lodged in the west’s *geng* and *xin* metal,
Emerging from the Kan position.
Thus it is said: "The tiger is born in water"—
Silver within lead,
White within black,
Gold within water.

*The Kinship of the Three* says:
"Metal is the mother of water,
The mother conceals the child’s embryo."
Water is metal’s child,
The child hides in the mother’s womb.
It also says:
"Clad in coarse cloth, yet holding jade,
Outwardly a madman."

True lead is indeed the primordial qi.
The Radiant Maiden ever rides the Crimson Dragon’s form.

The Radiant Maiden is mercury,
Bearing the essence of pure yang,
Born of the sun and lodged in the east’s *jia* and *yi* wood,
Emerging from the Li palace.
Thus it is said: "The dragon issues from fire"—
Mercury within cinnabar,
Yang within yin,
The sun’s flowing pearl.

*The Kinship of the Three* says:
"Mercury is called the flowing pearl,
The Green Dragon accompanies it."
Another scripture states:
"Crimson marrow flows as mercury,
The maiden plays with brightness at dawn."
This is true mercury—
The liquid of wood!

The tiger comes to sit quietly in the autumn river,
The dragon stirs its body in the azure pool.
The autumn river is the western river’s azure pool,
The true dragon of the eastern sea—
At the sight of the true tiger, one rises as the other sinks,
Both covetous, each devouring the other.

The two beasts meet in battle,
Waves surging like a seething cauldron.
An ancient song says:
"The Green Dragon pursues the tiger, the tiger seeks the dragon,
The red birds unite with clamorous cries."
As dragon contends with tiger,
Water clashes with fire,
The cauldron seethes and roils,
Inversion and restraint arise,
And the infant’s cry is heard.

The Yellow Dame and Elder Ding lend their mighty power.
The True Stone Man says:
"The Yellow Dame’s twin breasts are fair,
Elder Ding’s single heart is kind.
As dragon and tiger wage war,
The lord remains unaware."
The Yellow Dame was explained earlier;
Elder Ding is the gentle fire.

Master Yin Zhen says:
"I am the Dao of boundless worlds,
Yet know only to subdue the infant’s heart."
This truly reveals heaven’s secret.

The quaking shakes heaven and earth, startling gods and spirits.
An ancient song says:
"The sage seizes the workings of creation,
Grasping sun and moon to place within the furnace.
Gently inverting the essence of heaven and earth,
Gathering yin and yang to rouse gods and spirits."
Gods and spirits are the celestial soul and earthly spirit.

In an instant, the battle ceases and the mists disperse,
Clouds withdraw, rain scatters, all returns to silence—
Within the palm, fortune is transformed.
A mysterious pearl is planted in the mud’s depths.

*The Return of Life* says:
"At night, chaos falls to earth,
The myriad forms vanish without trace."
This is the single point descending into the Yellow Court—
The Yellow Court is the central palace, the Yellow Chamber,
The mysterious pass, likened to the mud’s depths.

Master Ziyang says:
"Within one double-hour, the elixir is complete"—
The elixir is achieved in a single day.
Day by day, it grows by a grain of millet,
Gradually forming the mysterious pearl.

The Yellow Emperor sought the mysterious pearl in the Crimson Waters,
Yet without Vast Image, it could not be obtained—
This is that very pearl,
Vast Image being thoughtless and carefree.

From this, the root and sprout gradually mature,
Constantly nourished by the embrace of true essence.
The Three Valleys Master says:
"Establish the foundation for a hundred days,
Then nurture it through the full cycle of the stars.
Simply guard the essence, spirit, and sound,
Water will naturally moisten, fire will naturally nurture,
Waiting until the qi is full."

After ten months, the embryo is shed, and the elixir is swallowed into the belly,
Suddenly, the mortal frame is felt to possess spirit.
Master Ziyang also says:
"A grain of the sacred elixir is swallowed into the belly."
Again, it is called "shedding the embryo,"
And "communing with the divine and sagely."

*The Kinship of the Three* says:
"Golden sand enters the five viscera,
Mist scatters like wind and rain."
If this is the inner elixir,
How can it be said to enter the belly, the mouth, the five viscera?
Later generations, doubting this, took it for an external elixir.
Yet they did not know that from formlessness comes form—
This is called the Returned Elixir.

The True Unity Master said:
"First, plumb the primordial chaotic qi of heaven and earth as the foundation;
Then, gather the essence of qian and kun, subtly moving their traces to form the image;
Follow the numbers of kan and li, pi and tai to establish punishment and virtue;
Steal the mechanism of yin and yang’s transformations to complete winter and summer.
Yin arises after noon, yang stirs at midnight’s beginning.
Thus, qian and kun serve as the crucible and vessel,
Kan and li as the medicinal substances,
The remaining sixty hexagrams as the fire times.
Refining, nurturing, and subtly seizing the work of transformation—
Like fruit growing on a branch,
The child within the womb,
After ten months, the fire times and qi are full,
Then suddenly, the spirit sheds and enters the true embryo,
Uniting with heaven!"

Thus it is said to enter the mouth, the belly, the five viscera.
*The Kinship of the Three* says:
"Like a chicken’s egg,
White and black align,
A span of one inch in length and breadth,
As the beginning.
The four limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones are all complete,
After ten months, it emerges from the womb."
This is truly from formlessness comes form,
A body beyond the body.
Clinging to the old frame traps one in darkness,
Emerging from the ninth mud is to roam heaven and earth,
Inscribed in the immortal register,
Titled as a True Person—
The moment when the great man’s work is accomplished and his name is achieved.

This matter is rare in the world,
Not known to ordinary people.
If one lacks the immortal’s bone from past lives,
How could it be easily encountered?
Having encountered it, refine it swiftly—
The passing scenery flies like an arrow.
To catch the fish, one must cast the net;
Do not stand by the pool and sigh in vain.

"I have heard you have known the medicine for many years,
Why not gather your heart and refine mercury and lead?
Do not let the candle be blown out by the wind,
For the six paths of rebirth leave no room to blame heaven."

These words admonish Immortal Liu,
Urging him to gather his heart and refine mercury and lead.
From this, it is clear that the inner elixir must be refined within oneself,
Not relying on external medicines for distinction.

Lately, worldly people are full of deceit,
Competing to don Daoist robes and claim the Way.
Ask them what metal and wood are—
They fall silent, mute and ashamed.

Metal and wood are explained in *Essential Pointers* under "Metal and Wood Intermingling":
"Without knowing this, one cannot speak of the Returned Elixir."
Yet they say it is about breath control and fasting,
Claiming another school with profound principles.
Have you not seen *The Song of Breaking Delusion*?
"The method of Embracing True Unity is strongest."

Side paths and minor arts number in the thousands,
Yet they have no relation to the Dao of the Golden Liquid’s return.
What is the Dao?
Embracing the true qi of Unity,
The five stars aligned in a string,
The sun and moon conjoined—
The inner elixir is formed from this,
The Dharma-body emerges from this,
There is no second gate.

Do not fault my words for their crudeness—
It is only that the world lacks discernment.
Only when your heart aligns with mine
Do I dare pour forth my thoughts to you.

**Preface to the Twelve-Character Secret of the Regulated Center Diagram**

Three thousand six hundred methods,
Tens of schools for nurturing life—
All are side paths, nothing but crooked trails.
Take, for instance, breath-holding to inflate the belly,
The "Flying Golden Essence" behind the elbow,
Absorbing and grinding to move the River Chariot,
Breath retention as the fire-timing,
Inhaling clarity and exhaling turbidity,
Connecting with realms to channel flows,
Guiding the turtle and rotating the perch,
Mirroring form to seek transcendence,
Preserving the top vent,
Guarding the space between the brows—
All are piling heads upon heads,
Creating affairs where none exist,
Disordering the sequence,
Deviating from the utmost truth.
Thus they cause the hundred vessels to seethe,
The Three Fields to erupt in chaos,
Hoping for eternal life,
Yet only harming their own.
This stems from opposing the harmony of Heaven and Earth,
Failing to align with the principle of spontaneity.

After thirty years of simplifying and reviewing the *Can Tong Qi*,
I have grasped its mysteries.
Comparing it with other alchemical classics,
I distilled its essential threads
To compose the *Twelve-Character Secret of the Regulated Center Diagram*,
Transmitting it to those who study the Dao,
To rectify the heart and sincerify the will,
Making them the central pillar,
The axis within that governs the without.
Eight characters serve as auxiliaries,
Regulating the four seasons,
Responding from without to within.
Above, it harmonizes with the heart of Heaven;
In the middle, it examines human affairs;
Silently conforming to creation,
Following the track of yin and yang,
Externally modeling the Five Phases,
Internally ordering the Five Viscera—
Thus it becomes the endless cycle of daily use.
No action is taken,
No visualization is held.
In serene great stability,
The primal mechanism is grasped.
Only require:
Cutting off desires,
Stilling the heart and qi,
Reducing thoughts,
Moderating diet,
Regulating breath,
Guarding against drowsiness,
Restraining sight and sound,
Nurturing Heaven’s harmony.
Within the four dignified postures,
Align with spontaneity—
No complexity or difficulty exists.

For those who have established the *yinqie* (silver enclosure),
This serves to harmonize with the fire and nurture the sacred embryo.
For those who have not yet established the *yinqie*,
This strengthens the primal qi,
Nourishes the spirit,
And serves as the gradual foundation for establishing the *yinqie*.
When depletion, loss, or illness assails,
This drives away sickness and secures the primal,
Serving as a method for supplementation, longevity,
And the art of nurturing life—
Truly the simplest of gates!

**The Regulated Center Diagram**

The "Regulated Center" is like dwelling within a compass’s circle—
Neither inside nor outside,
Neither clinging to images
Nor attaching to things.
It is the center within the body,
The center within the mind,
Like the "I" within a great round mirror.
Simply rectify the heart and sincerify the will,
Making them the central pillar.
When all thoughts are extinguished,
The true person appears—
Like a fish dwelling in the deep abyss,
Swimming freely yet never leaving the square inch.
Thus the true person lurks in the deep abyss,
Floating and guarding the Regulated Center.

When joy, anger, sorrow, and delight have not yet arisen,
At this time, one can reside in the Regulated Center,
Floating and swimming to govern the four seasons,
Rectifying creation.
Within the four dignified postures,
One must not lose proper measure!
When things come, respond and let them pass,
Then return to the center—
But never disturb the central pillar.
Within the center, maintain emptiness,
Not a speck of dust arises.
Over time, neither indulgence nor restraint,
One naturally attains its benefits.
Its subtlety lies in:
The six yin returning to Kun,
The myriad things returning to the origin,
The *Fu* hexagram’s first sprouting,
The eldest son inheriting the father’s body,
The solitary yang stirring in concealment—
The time before the myriad things arise.
All begins here—
This is the point of application.

At this moment,
Sit cross-legged in great stillness,
Concentrate the spirit and inwardly illuminate,
Regulate the breath to be continuous and soft,
Silently guard it.
Then the qi arises from the formless,
Vast and obscure,
Without color or shape,
Emerging in the profound darkness,
The region of Kun and Gui,
Born within the kidneys,
To nurture the primal essence,
Supplement and continue the primal qi,
Unceasing and unexhausted,
Growing stronger day by day.
First, it dispels illness;
Next, it returns to infancy.
Accumulated, it becomes the foundation of the inner elixir!

Master Tuzhen said:
"This is the primal qi,
Supplementing the primal qi—
How could it be mere common cinnabar?"
This is the supreme method of supplementation.

**Morning Layering (Zhaotun):**
The body of the noble one begins its governance,
The first sprouting of the myriad things,
The inception of benevolence.
At the *zi* hour, the qi of initial generation resides in the kidneys—
It comes unbidden, so treasure and nurture it.
Regulate the breath so the ears do not hear,
Simply listen to its gentle, continuous flow,
Aligning with spontaneity,
Resonating with the key of Heaven and Earth.
Over time, kidney qi merges with heart qi,
The two qi interact,
Descending as sweet dew,
And producing the mysterious pearl!

**Evening Enveloping (Mumeng):**
Enveloping to nurture correctness—
The sagely work,
Not losing the heart of the infant.
At the *wu* hour, the qi of initial generation resides in the heart.
Without thought or worry,
Still and unmoving,
Inwardly illuminate in profound silence to unite with it.
Sit in stillness to gather it.
Over time, heart qi naturally merges with kidney qi,
Achieving the work of *Jiji* (Completion).

Humans reside within the Three Powers,
Their body equaling Heaven and Earth,
Thus their qi corresponds with Heaven and Earth,
Their true unity’s essence conforms.
A person’s primal qi spans eight hundred ten *zhang*,
Resembling the bellows—
The great movement of primal qi follows Heaven,
The lesser movement follows the sun.
Yet people cannot embody and model Heaven and Earth,
Leading to severance, damage, and ruin,
Spirit and essence confused and disordered,
Deviating from them on their own—
How could Heaven and Earth deviate from them?

If one can follow its principles,
Grasp its mechanism,
Then one can align with the work of creation
And engage in the Dao of inner refinement,
The path of long life and enduring vision.
Apart from humans, all else is endowed with turbid confusion,
Existing within the primal qi,
Merely transformed things—
How could they govern the primal qi?

The *Can Tong Qi* states:
"In spring and summer, rely on the inner body,
From *zi* to *chen-si*;
In autumn and winter, act externally,
From *wu* to *xu-hai*."
It also says:
"Rewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn,
Dawn and dusk follow cold and heat.
The hexagram lines contain benevolence and righteousness,
Timely expressing joy and anger.
Thus responding to the four seasons,
The Five Phases attain their principles."

Thus, *zi*, *chou*, and *yin* correspond to spring; *mao*, *chen*, and *si* to summer; *wu*, *wei*, and *shen* to autumn; *you*, *xu*, and *hai* to winter.

*Zi*, *chou*, and *yin* align with spring, when Wood prevails. Wood governs benevolence, the time when the myriad things sprout forth. Hence, the two words *xi* (flourishing) and *he* (harmony) nurture it—*xi* as in the radiant joy of spring’s ascent to the terrace. *He* means beauty: the golden mean penetrating principle, dwelling in its rightful place within the body, flowing through the four limbs, manifesting in one’s undertakings—this is the perfection of beauty. Like an infant not yet able to laugh, crying without hoarseness, this is the perfection of harmony. Unaware of the union of male and female, yet the genitalia stir—this is the perfection of essence.

*Mao*, *chen*, and *si* align with summer, when Fire prevails. Fire governs ritual, the time when the myriad things flourish in order. Thus, the two words *zhong* (centeredness) and *he* (harmony) nurture it. Once harmony is achieved, there is neither excess nor deficiency—this is called *zhong* (the mean). Only then can the emotions and nature roam freely without turbulence.

*Wu*, *wei*, and *shen* align with autumn, when Metal prevails. Metal governs righteousness, the time when grasses and trees yellow and wither, and the myriad things are harvested. Hence, the two words *lian* (restraint) and *jing* (stillness) cultivate it, fulfilling the nature of the myriad things.

*You*, *xu*, and *hai* align with winter, when Water prevails. Water governs wisdom, the time when the myriad things return to their roots and the primal *qi* begins its solemn retreat. Thus, the two words *lian* (restraint) and *su* (solemnity) conceal it, aligning with the *qi* of Heaven and Earth.

The *Can Tong Qi* states:
"The true person abides in the deep abyss,
Floating and roaming, guarding the compass within."

The "true person" is none other than the one true self: when congealed, it is spirit; when in use, it is the heart; when still, it is nature. Neither moving nor still, empty yet spiritually penetrating—it is also called the true heart. It swims within the compass, within the square and circle of the rules, master of creation, moving without deviation, centered and responsive to the four seasons. Nurtured by trust, it becomes true Earth. Issuing commands and decrees, it nurtures the primal *qi*, governs and cultivates the primal essence, transforming and giving birth to purity. It harmonizes the Five Phases without coercion, thereby connecting the harmony of Heaven and Earth. Thus, rectifying the heart and making the intent sincere, one can achieve impartiality. Only then do *Qian* and *Kun* unite in peace, *Kan* and *Li* intermingle, yin and yang harmonize, and the myriad things flourish. The three luminaries align in proper measure, bringing about great peace. Thereafter, the nation prospers, the people are at ease, and the hundred bones are all in order.

**Explanation of the Pure Yang True Person’s "Spring in the Garden"**

The Pure Yang Perfected’s *Qin Yuan Chun* is a lyric that distills the ultimate principles of the returning elixir, circulated throughout the world. Though many commentaries exist, they often stray into pedantry. How could they know that this bit of immortal method lies not within the three thousand six hundred gates? Thus, one must meet heart with heart, intent with intent. Only when one reaches the delight of this realm does one truly trust that it arises from spontaneity.

One might say the essential Dao is not complex, the work is easy—freeing oneself from the web of doubts to enter the gate of myriad wonders. I have composed sixteen seven-character quatrains, pairing each with a verse by Master Tongning, totaling twenty pounds in weight, and appended direct annotations to reveal the profound mechanism. May the reader savor them carefully, for grasping one corner reveals all others alike.

*Written in the late spring of the bingyin year of the Xianchun era, by the late learner Yuxizi of Yichun, during the Xiuxi festival.*

**Qinyuan Lyrics**

Lifting the topic at hand is the very matter of the Dao-heart.
Hark!
In the fine night of clear brightness,
In the chaos of the infant’s uncarved state,
One finds the delight of the stringless zither—
No notes of *gong* or *shang* may outsiders know.

The sevenfold return of the elixir,
Gold restored to its original nature,
This is the sevenfold return,
Achieving success through earth,
Called the ninefold restoration.
Passion returns to the sea of nature, termed the union,
The furnace refines golden radiance, named the return.
Nurtured wholly by the power of true earth,
Refined into a spirit-body, one emerges from the dusty world.

In man, the great Dao resides only within the self;
The inner elixir must be refined a hundredfold.
The Great One divides into three, yet man attains the one;
The great medicine is sought only within the body.
Pitiful are the ten thousand thousands,
Who take all this as mere pleasure and ease.

First, refine the self and await the moment.
Refining the self begins with subduing the heart;
The gathering of medicine has its own season.
Turning the mechanism sets one apart from the vulgar,
The heart serene and still as an infant.
Look closely: creation’s root is no-thing—
When spring arrives in Jiangnan, flowers bloom of themselves.

At the first stirring of the true yang,
*Kun* transforms into *Fu*—
Is this not the heart of heaven and earth revealed?
Sitting in stillness upon the rush mat, thoughts stilled,
The spirit’s abode breathes in and out, ever more slowly.
Warm, misty qi returns to the celestial valley—
Know this as the moment when yang begins its return.

In the deep of night, the water-clock endures;
Midnight is the hour when the night’s watch feels longest.
Steaming qi rises, all sounds hushed in clarity—
Within the body, winter solstice aligns with the third watch.
Who can fathom such delight?
Only the sound of the bronze clepsydra’s dripping remains.

Gently warmed, the lead crucible—
The crucible is no metal crucible,
The furnace no moon furnace.
*Li* arises from beneath *Kan*,
*Dui* resides within the crucible.
The jade hare’s decoction boils and surges,
The golden furnace’s fire blazes, its light growing bright.
Who perceives the existence within nothingness?
Within lies golden radiance—the foundation of the sage.

Light pierces the curtain,
The original spirit generates yang,
Divine light flickers—
The heart in profound stillness illumines inwardly,
All returns to the primordial void.
At first, the qi is azure, a color yet no-color,
Emerging from the dragon’s tower to return to the phoenix’s palace.
Beneath the lapis lazuli screen, candles glow in mutual brilliance,
By the river where women bleach silk, the rain has just ceased.

Creation’s pace hastens—
Husband and wife return to the chamber.
The moon reaches the yang palace,
Within the waves of peach blossoms,
Dragon and tiger meet.
Red and black unite, the world cannot guess—
All depends on *wu* and *ji* as the matchmaker.
A full ladle of the marrow of heaven and earth—
Seek it with intent and drink it in.

The work of advancing the fire is like treading a perilous path.
Fire arises within water,
Flowers bloom amid thunder—
Single-minded vigilance,
Steady and skillful.
Within the realm of primordial chaos, qi swirls and steams,
On the branch of red apricot, spring in its second month.
But keep the golden pass firmly sealed—
The turning mechanism is the treasure within the house.

By the winding river, the moon’s radiance gleams still—
A crow takes flight.
The oxherd and weaver girl’s bond,
The Dao’s root in tortoise and snake,
Innately so—
The yang crow meets the new moon, uniting in beauty,
The two qi mutually sustain and revolve.
This is the union of lead and mercury—
Do not mistake it for the nine bends of the small intestine.

Master Xiaozhen’s verse says:
Above the winding river, the magpie bridge spans,
The bond of oxherd and weaver girl—
This is the Dao itself.
The great medicine, the golden elixir, is born from this.
If you doubt, but knock at the *jia-yi* gate,
The twin youths will naturally guide you on your way.
The *jia-yi* gate is like the *wu-ji* portal.
Within this principle lies profound depth,
Beyond the reach of brush or tongue—
Yet it is merely a matter within the self.

Hark!
To know the path beneath the mountain,
Ask those who come and go.

At that time, one drinks the *daogui* of one’s own accord—
The two earths are *wu* and *ji*,
The golden blade is lead and mercury.
Dragon coiled, tiger crouched, guarding the center,
*Li* and *Kan* merge, the light of sun and moon.
After drinking, one awakens and returns to the grotto palace—
The flowery pond, lush with lotus fragrance.

Who would believe a child is nurtured within nothingness?
Within the body, yin and yang;
Within the pot, sun and moon—
All immortals and sages,
Originally no different.
If not one of those within,
How could I explain it to you?

Refine essence to nurture the spiritual root,
Refine qi to nurture the spirit—
Lead and mercury transform and nourish the true body.
Suddenly, one pierces through the mud-pill palace—
Only then does one trust that immortals do not deceive.

Discern the clarity and turbidity of the water’s source,
The separation of wood and metal—
Without a teacher’s guidance,
This matter is hard to know.
Lead sinks, silver floats—
The clear above, the turbid below.
The clear is golden radiance,
The turbid is lead’s essence.
To unite golden radiance with the liquid of wood—
This is the wondrous method of employing lead.
When the two meet, passion and nature merge;
When the millet pearl forms, wood and metal separate.
Without a teacher’s guidance,
This matter is hard to know.

The clear and turbid, sinking and floating, share a single source—
To take the clear and discard the turbid is even more profound.
The merging and separation must be distinguished—
The wonder lies in a single word from a true teacher.

The Dao is subtle and mysterious,
The celestial mechanism deep and distant—
Begin practice swiftly, for time is fleeting.
Only when one reaches the point of shame
Does one know one’s skill is not yet refined.

As Master Baiyun said:
Those who slander it are like grasping a giant melon stem to sweep Mount Kunlun;
Those who savor it are like swans and cranes drinking from the vast sea.
The views of the well-frog and fence-sparrow—
How could they know the vastness of sea and sky?

Diligence without encounter—
One must encounter it;
Encountering it without refinement is still folly.
Cherish each moment,
Do not let time pass in vain.
Awaken swiftly,
Practice urgently—
When will the precious pearl in hand shine clear?
If the hut is ruined, how can it be rebuilt?

Within the millet pearl, the world is vast—
The immortal true ones surge within.
How many gaze in vain,
Sighing at the heavens’ height, deeming it unattainable?

Master Changchun’s verse says:
Sun and moon swiftly fly overhead,
Time swiftly passes before one’s eyes.
Turning to look back, one is already old—
To begin practice swiftly is still too late.

During the Shaoxing era, in the southern part of Yichun, the household of Prefect Wei of the Wei clan harbored many secrets. One day, an extraordinary person entered directly into his study and called out, "Prefect Wei, come forth for a word." At the time, Wei was napping during the day, and his attendants dared not announce the visitor. The stranger left a *ci* poem on the wall before departing, titled *Sumuzhe*. When Wei awoke and saw it, he deeply regretted the missed encounter and sent men to search, but the visitor could not be found. The poem read:

Within the waters, gold aligns with Ox and Dipper,
Jade locks and golden gates,
Guarded by divine youths of the Dharma.
Red River’s cinnabar terrace—
Dragons and tigers roam,
Myriad forms in solemn array,
Vigorously casting forth the pearl.

Drink from the numinous spring, refine the fire’s timing,
The Great One’s furnace opens,
The elixir ripens, divine radiance pierces through.
Fleeting fame and profit soon fade—
Swiftly begin practice,
Exhaust the "nothing" to attain the "something."
The path to Penglai—
Rely on three thousand deeds fulfilled,
Then stride alone upon the clouds to return.

The *Scripture of the August Void* states: "Those who wish to cultivate the Dao must first establish merit. Thus, the Celestial Emperors of the heavens, the exalted Heavenly Emperors, the Perfected of the heavens, and the Divine Immortals of the heavens all ascend to the sagely and perfected ranks through meritorious deeds. The heavens record merit, and worldly scholars who cultivate the true resolve, once their merit is complete and virtue perfected, shed the mortal to become immortals, transform from immortals to Perfected, and the Perfected attain boundless freedom, merging with spontaneity. When dissolved, they become qi; when at rest, they become human. With spiritual penetrations and self-mastery, they transform without form, soar through the Three Realms, and traverse the hidden and obscure. Cultivators must first cherish essence and treasure qi, anchor the mind and concentrate spirit, establishing the foundation for nurturing the elixir. Then, entering seclusion for three thousand days, the inner work must not be the slightest bit deficient, until the embryo is fully formed, transcending to the primordial origin. Yet external conduct is also essential to accord with the Dao of Heaven. Thus, merit cannot be too abundant, and conduct cannot be too broad. With three thousand merits fulfilled, one becomes an immortal of the Great Veil; with three thousand deeds of conduct fulfilled, one becomes a guest of the Great Veil."

Master Zhongli said: "Merit without conduct is like having no feet; conduct without merit leaves the feet unable to advance. Only with both merit and conduct complete are the feet fully prepared—who then can say one has no share in becoming a divine immortal?"

Moreover, those who cultivate the Dao and attain the Way first dwell in Penglai, Fangzhang, or Yingzhou, becoming unbound immortals. The Primordial Sovereign of the Great One then summons them to receive the chart, their names inscribed in the immortal register, ascending step by step to the sagely ranks, paying court to the Jade Emperor, and receiving the title of Perfected. They must further guide and transform later generations, universally practicing and enlightening, until reaching the state of "no cultivation, no attainment," which is called spontaneity.

A poem by a High Perfected reads:
In the tenth month, the fire’s timing is cast aside,
The inner work’s hours have reached three thousand.
Further relying on external conduct to accord with Heaven’s Dao,
One transcends the primordial origin to verify the Upper Immortal.

When Master Quanzhen Wang and Zhang attained the Dao, they composed the *Ci of Untying the Girdle*, which says:
Cultivators,
Their meritorious efforts are no small matter,
Discerning the reversal and inversion of the five phases,
The wondrous principle is profoundly abstruse.
Within the jade furnace, dragons coil and tigers crouch,
In the golden tripod, the supreme treasure is refined.
The yang spirit departs the body,
Vast and obscure,
In an instant, it roams the three isles.
Once entry and exit are mastered,
Restrain and hold fast,
Seek further mysteries,
Merge with true emptiness—
The Great Void is the culmination.

Five Esoteric Poems:

*Hiss and blow*—three feet, yet no trace,
Release and gather, swift as the wind.
Among a hundred thousand, select one or two,
To entrust this Dao to you.

The second:
Extended like lightning, round as the moon,
Not for men—do not draw near.
To verify Buddhahood or attain Perfection, this is needed,
These subtle wonders require a master.

The third:
Cutting nails and severing iron, cleaving delusion,
The wondrous function, freely applied, comes from the master.
Returning at will, filling the sleeves,
Caress and nurture it as a grandson.

The fourth:
Radiance blazing, pressing upon the body,
Bones tremble, hair stands on end—what to do?
If you are truly a man, you will not fear,
With one stroke, the truth is revealed at once.

The fifth:
Among a hundred thousand, one or two,
With one stroke, it must align with the sages’ minds.
The red youth manifests numinous auspices,
Withered wood blooms, iron turns to gold.

In Praise of the Immortal of Pure Yang:

Supreme virtue defies naming,
Primordial merit does not govern—
What need for gathas or praises?
Heaven is impartial,
Only virtue is aided,
The sagely teacher is never far.

Phoenix-like bearing, a spirit of the age,
A true Confucian of the moon’s visage and dragon beard,
A scion of Tang officials.
Awakened by the Yellow Millet Dream,
He severed the endless cycle of life and death.
Once the elixir was formed, he sought only to deliver others,
His rank exalted, ever aiding the drowning.

In the southern lands, he refined gold lead and wood mercury;
In Bianjing, he savored the jade nectar of Suka.
When he manifested as Quanzhen,
Countless living beings relied on his grace.
Wielding three swords as admonitions,
He nurtured hundreds and thousands of disciples with love.

At times, white duckweed and red reeds;
At times, the Purple Palace and Clear Capital.
Letting go of all, he beheld the Great Void,
Yet still stood in attendance at the Hall of Luminous Understanding.

The realm revered his noble demeanor,
The world witnessed his numinous traces.
Master Guo on the turtle’s back longed to return—
The master spoke of himself thus.
Daoist Peng still awaited enlightenment—
This was Peng Chongyang.

For kalpas, I have been foolish and deluded,
Entangled in habitual tendencies.
Since gaining discernment,
I have never measured my strength,
Indulging in every inclination—
Only the Dao of immortals and Buddhas
Have I not yet inquired into.

My senior, Yue Junsucan of Changsha’s official lineage, shared my passion,
And we became friends despite the difference in age.
I knew he was a dharma companion of Peng Chongyang and Hu Gucan,
All three having received the oral transmission of the Golden Elixir from Master Yuxi.
One day, as we conversed, I broached the subject,
And he spoke with fervor, recounting his lifelong quest for friends and teachers,
Sparing neither body nor life.
Later, he encountered Master Yuxi, who said,
"Our past friendship was but casual discourse and miscellaneous discussions.
The time for learning the Dao has its own season and cause.
Now that you have reached this point, the time is ripe!"
He bade me wait for an auspicious day to transmit the teachings.
Thus, in the *chen* hour of the *jiazi* day,
He secretly imparted a few words,
And I tentatively practiced.
Within a month, the elixir’s efficacy was verified—
The so-called golden radiance suffusing the body,
Jasper towers and crimson palaces,
Dragon and tiger, infant and maiden,
All fleetingly appearing in vision.
When Yue heard of this, he sighed, wiping away tears:
"Since I first heard the Dao,
My body and temperament have been afflicted,
Unable to settle my steps.
Thus, in the work of advancing the fire, I have yet to begin."

The child has long possessed the bone of an immortal—this is no trifling matter. I dare not presume to be your master. Instead, I shall point you to one among them who bears an uncanny resemblance to Master Yuxi. Simply clothe him in robes and cap to capture the likeness of the master, and take him as your teacher. I hereby entrust to you all of the master’s handwritten manuscripts and these ten volumes, with solemn injunctions.

Later, I heard from the modestly learned steward Shu Zongguan: "The master once served in my family. When my father, the Pacification Commissioner, completed his term, we traveled together back to Huai. The master lodged and dined in the kitchen boat, which was tethered to the stern of our vessel with an iron chain. As we neared Zhenzhou, suddenly a great storm arose, and the iron chain snapped. The kitchen boat, with all its people and belongings, was swallowed by the surging waves. Two days later, the master arrived at Yangzi Bridge, clutching a small bundle of clothes. As our boat was being woven together anew, he bid farewell to my father in person and departed. Only then did we realize the master had attained the Dao of entering water without drowning. The Gao family sighed in awe without end."

Since receiving the transmission, fifty-five years have passed, and now I have reached ninety. I have labored to depict the immortal’s likeness at the end of the preface to these ten volumes and have had them engraved to ensure their wide circulation.

On a certain day and month in the fourteenth year of the Zhizheng era, Wang Gui Junzhang of Zhongyang, with incense burning, respectfully inscribed this.
