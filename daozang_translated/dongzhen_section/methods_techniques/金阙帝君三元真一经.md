**The Sutra of Jinque Emperor’s Three Primordial Oneness**
*Transmitted by Qianzǐ to Qingtong Jun of the Eastern Sea*

The reason the True Person reveres *Oneness* as *True* is this:
The *Upper One* is the Heavenly Emperor of one’s own body,
The *Middle One* is the Vermilion Palace’s Danhuang Sovereign,
The *Lower One* is the Yellow Court’s Primordial King.

Together, they oversee the twenty-four *qi* within the body,
to correspond with the twenty-four True Ones of *Taixi*.

For *qi* is the condensation of empty vapors into spirit.

Each of the Three Primordial Lords commands ten thousand chariots and myriad cavalry,
with cloud-chariots and feathered canopies,
constantly entering the Purple Palace to ascend to *Shangqing*,
registering in the Primordial Diagram,
ranked as True Persons, soaring through the Nine Heavens.

If one preserves this with unwavering steadfastness,
then the Three Onenesses shall manifest.

When the Three Onenesses manifest,
then the ten thousand chariots and myriad cavalry arrive.
The feathered canopies may be commanded,
the cloud-chariots may be ridden,
ascending to Heaven in broad daylight,
to construct *Taixi*.

Within *Taixi* are the twenty-four *qi*,
mingled and congealed in yellow chaos,
about to coalesce and transform—
sometimes suddenly dividing into streams.

Within the *qi* are the twenty-four True Persons,
all emanations of the Three Onenesses’ *qi*,
thus achieving division and transformation.

If one preserves the Three Onenesses within the body,
then the Three Onenesses of *Taixi*—the Sovereign Lords—
descend and appear before you, speaking with you.

Within the body, there are also twenty-four True Persons,
formed by the division and transformation of the body’s pure, luminous *qi*.
If the cloud-chariot comes to welcome you,
ascending to *Taixi*,
the twenty-four True Persons of *Taixi*
shall all merge with the body’s spirits in the Yellow Chaos,
together witnessing the division and ascent,
harmonizing the virtue of inner and outer.

They enter and exit *Shangqing*,
rest in *Taixi*,
and must also traverse the *Dòngfáng* [Inner Chamber].
Within the *Dòngfáng* are rooms of golden gates, purple doors, and dark essence—
the abiding place of the Three Onenesses’ august Lords within the body.
Those who traverse it shall see one spirit more swiftly.

The True Person of the *Dòngfáng* must preserve *Oneness* as the root,
and those who preserve the True Person must regard the *Dòngfáng* as the canopy.
Thus, the Three Onenesses rely upon each other,
the *Dòngfáng* awaits in harmony—
though their dwellings differ,
their attainment of the Dao is equally interdependent.

If one merely obtains one method
and fixes the mind with unyielding resolve,
one may enter *Taiqing* alone,
becoming a *Taiqing* Xianwang,
but cannot roam *Taixi* or float to *Shangqing*.

The *Upper One* is the ultimate of True Emperors,
the *Middle One* is the supreme of True Sovereigns,
the *Lower One* is the marvel of True Kings.

The Heavenly Sovereign attains the ultimate,
thus ascending to *Huangji* [Supreme Polarity];
The Earthly Sovereign attains the supreme,
thus ascending to *Zhengyi* [Upright Oneness];
The Human Sovereign attains the marvel,
thus ascending to *Zhongmiào* [Multifarious Wonders].

The Three Sovereigns embody the True and preserve Oneness,
thus Oneness hides no form—
its truth is ultimate.

The Three Onenesses are all illuminated;
from Oneness, life is born—
thus, all who study the Three Sovereigns’ teachings
hold Oneness as supreme.

Preserving True Oneness,
the mind is pure, the spirit condensed,
the essence profound, the perception divine—
thus, no stray thoughts arise,
and the essence-intent does not scatter.

But if, within three months, one gazes inward,
fixing the mind on a single spirit,
the spirit’s light generates outside the body,
and one plays with it—
this is the concentration of thought,
the unification of *qi* in harmony,
the utmost purity—
and swift attainment.

Since the dispersion of purity and the separation of the True,
falsehoods have gradually arisen,
competing minds and chaos have generated—
thus, Oneness does not manifest fully,
and the spirit does not respond immediately.

It is not that one does not wish to dwell upon it;
those who preserve it are not focused,
those who ponder it are not discerning—
thus, even after years of effort,
only a faint resemblance is achieved.

If one can practice *heart-fasting* and distance from the world,
concentrating the mind without distraction,
then within three months, one shall sense Oneness
and behold it face-to-face.

The Three Primordials are the jade-like True Ones of the Nine Heavens,
the orthodox Dao of the Most High.
Thus, the Great Dao of *Zhengyi* emerges from the True Emperor,
the orthodox True Dao generates the Great Spirit,
and the Three Primordials resolve transformation—
thus, all True Ones return to Oneness,
and the mysterious work is accomplished.

This is the origin of the orthodox Dao,
the primordial root of *yuanqi*.

The method of the Three Onenesses
encompasses the Dao within the Three Primordials,
summarizing the numinous scriptures,
grasping the precious spirit-sutras.

The first key is *The Great Cavern True Sutra*,
the second key is *The Great Marvelous Sutra*,
the third key is *The Most High Subtle Spirit*.

Thus, the *Upper One* Emperor treasures *The Great Cavern True Sutra*,
the *Middle One* Danhuang Sovereign treasures *The Great Marvelous Sutra*,
the *Lower One* Primordial King treasures *The Most High Subtle Spirit*.

These three texts are the utmost essence of the True Dao,
the ultimate chapters of the Three Onenesses,
and the forbidden keys of *Shangqing*.

Mysterious and nameless,
its Dao is not distant.

From preserving Oneness, the Three Onenesses manifest.
Since you have seen Oneness,
you may seek this sutra
and shall be secretly instructed in the method of preserving the Three Onenesses.

This is the first scripture of the True Writings of *Shangqing Jinque Emperor*,
the marvelous keys of all True Ones.

If you can preserve Oneness,
Oneness shall also preserve you;
If you can see Oneness,
Oneness shall also see you.

In all your comings and goings,
in myriad affairs,
always remember Oneness.

In eating and drinking, remember Oneness;
In joy and sorrow, remember Oneness;
In grief and anger, remember Oneness;
In sickness and health, remember Oneness;
In peril and danger, remember Oneness;
In crossing fire and water, remember Oneness;
In riding chariots and horses, remember Oneness;
In haste, remember Oneness.

When humans remember Oneness,
their movements and gazes are countless—
yet if their thoughts are concentrated,
the virtue is complete.

Alas, most people lack steadfast resolve,
and thus cannot endure.
They know the name of Oneness but cannot preserve it,
and though they preserve it, their resolve is not firm—
many boast in their hearts
yet cannot maintain their preservation.

Thus, when the Three Oneness departs, the **正气 (Zhengqi/True Vitality)** leaves.
He who loses the True Vitality falls prey to **邪气 (Xieqi/Perverse Qi)**,
and when Perverse Qi enters, the day of death draws near.

Common folk who study the **Dao (Way)**, often seek vain superficiality,
and do not believe that the True Oneness is most precious.
Though they may initially have resolve,
later they must falter and fail—
for their resolve is not steadfast,
and thus Perverse Qi invades.

The **戒 (precept)** of guarding Oneness lies in its lack of concentration;
concentration, though brief, cannot last long,
and when it cannot endure with precision,
the Three Oneness departs.
The body becomes an empty dwelling without master—
how long can such calamity endure?

**Qi** congeals into **精 (Jing/Essence)**;
Essence coalesces into **神 (Shen/Spirit)**;
Spirit transforms into the **婴儿 (Infant)**;
the Infant ascends to become the **真人 (Zhenren/True Person)**;
the True Person ascends to the **赤子 (Chizi/Red Boy)**—
this is the True Oneness.

The heavens possess the **三玄 (Three Mysteries)**, namely the sun, moon, and stars,
and also hold **三精 (Three Essences)**, which are the means of longevity.
Humans possess **三宝 (Three Treasures)**, the three **丹田 (Dantian/Elixir Fields)**,
also called the **三真 (Three Truths)**, which are the means of eternal existence.

The *灵宝经 (Lingbao Scripture)* states:
*"Heavenly Essence, Earthly Truth—
the Three Treasures endure eternally."*
This is the meaning.

The space between the two brows is the **上丹田 (Upper Elixir Field)**, called the **绛宫 (Xianggong/Crimson Palace)**;
three inches below the navel is the **下丹田 (Lower Elixir Field)**.
Together, they form the **三丹田 (Three Elixir Fields)**.

The **赤子 (Red Boy)** dwells in the Upper Elixir Field’s palace,
the **真人 (True Person)** in the Crimson Palace of the Middle Elixir Field,
and the **婴儿 (Infant)** in the Lower Elixir Field’s palace.

Above the space between the two brows,
retreat inward one inch to reach the **明堂 (Mingtang/Bright Hall)**,
two inches to reach the **洞房 (Dongfang/Chamber of Mystery)**,
and three inches to reach the **丹田泥丸宫 (Dantian Nihuan Palace/Elixir Field’s Mud Pellet Palace)**.
To retreat inward means to turn toward the back of the neck.

The **丹田泥丸宫 (Elixir Field’s Mud Pellet Palace)** is centered at one inch in each of the four directions,
where **紫气 (Ziqí/Purple Vitality)** surges heavenward,
illuminating the outer realm for **九万里 (90,000 li)**.
It covers the **北斗七星 (Big Dipper’s Seven Stars)** as a canopy,
with the **杓柄 (Ladle Handle)** pointing forward to the east.

Its transformations—great and small—
its shifting form and elusive presence—
are sustained by the mind’s intent.

The **上元赤子 (Red Boy of the Upper Primordium)** resides within,
beneath the Dipper’s canopy.
The Red Boy’s taboo name is **玄凝天 (Xuanning Tian/Mysterious Congealed Heaven)**,
his given name is **三元先 (Sanyuan Xian/Three Primordial First)**,
and his rank is **泥丸天帝君 (Nihuan Tian Dijun/Mud Pellet Heavenly Sovereign)**.

To his right stands a **帝卿 (Dijing/Imperial Minister)** in opposition,

His taboo name is **肇勒精 (Zhaole Jing/Originating Restraining Essence)**,
his given name is **仲玄生 (Zhongxuan Sheng/Middle Mysterious Birth)**,
and he ascends to become the **帝卿君 (Dijing/Imperial Minister)**.

These two govern the Mud Pellet Palace together,

their appearance like that of an infant just born.
The **天帝君 (Tian Dijun/Heavenly Sovereign)** holds the **上清神虎符 (Shangqing Shen Hufu/High Purity Spirit Tiger Talisman)**,
while the Imperial Minister wields the *大洞真经 (Dadong Zhenjing/Great Chamber of Mystery Scripture)*.
They sit facing outward, or sometimes toward each other.
Internally, they subdue the realms of the Mud Pellet, face, mouth, tongue, teeth, ears, and nose;
externally, they command the **六天万鬼 (Liutiān Wànguǐ/Six Heavens’ Ten Thousand Demons)**,
dispelling the malevolent forces of evil.

The **三魂 (Sanhun/Three Souls)** and **五日 (Wuri/Five Spirits)** come to pay homage every three days,
and receive their duties.

The heart is the **中丹田 (Middle Elixir Field)**, called the **绛宫 (Xianggong/Crimson Palace)**.
It is centered in the heart’s core,
one inch in each of the four directions.
**朱烟 (Zhuyan/Red Mist)** ascends to the heavens,
illuminating the outer realm for **三万里 (30,000 li)**.
Its transformations—great and small—
its shifting form and elusive presence—
are sustained by the mind’s intent.

The **中元真人 (True Person of the Middle Primordium)** resides within,
named **神运珠 (Shenyun Zhu/Divine Rolling Pearl)**,
given the name **子南丹 (Zinan Dan/Southern Elixir Son)**,
and ranked as **绛宫丹皇君 (Xianggong Dan Huangjun/Crimson Palace Elixir Sovereign)**.

To his right stands a **辅皇卿 (Fuhuang Qing/Assisting Sovereign Minister)**,
the **精神 (Shenling/Spirit-Essence)** of the four **藏 (Zang/Organs)**—
congealed and transformed.
He enters the Crimson Palace as the Assisting Minister,
taboo name **光坚 (Guangjian/Luminous Firmness)**,
given name **四灵 (Siling/Four Spirits)**.

These two govern the Crimson Palace together,
both wearing **朱锦衣 (Zhujinyi/Scarlet Brocade Robes)**,
their appearance like that of an infant just born.
The **丹皇君 (Dan Huangjun/Elixir Sovereign)** holds **荧惑星 (Yinghuo Xing/Mars, the Wandering Star)** in his left hand,
and the *太保经 (Taibao Jing/Great Protection Scripture)* in his right.
The Assisting Minister wields the *大有妙经 (Dayou Miaojing/Great Possession Scripture)* and its **八景 (Bajing/Eight Scenes)**.
They sit facing outward, or sometimes toward each other.
Internally, they subdue the realms of sinews, bones, the five **藏 (Zang/Organs)**, blood, flesh, and marrow;
externally, they dispel the **万邪 (Wanxie/Ten Thousand Malevolences)**,
nurturing light and calming spirit,
to prolong life and extend vision,
and ascend to the **太霄 (Taixiao/Exalted Clouds)**.

The **三魂 (Sanhun/Three Souls)** and **七魄 (Qipò/Seven Spirits)** come to pay homage every three days,
and receive their duties.

Three inches below the navel is the **命门丹田宫 (Mingmen Dantian Palace/Life Gate Elixir Field Palace)**,
where the **下元婴儿 (Infant of the Lower Primordium)** dwells,
one inch in each of the four directions.
**白气 (Baigi/White Vitality)** surges heavenward,
illuminating the outer realm for **七万里 (70,000 li)**.
Its transformations—great and small—
its shifting form and elusive presence—
are sustained by the mind’s intent.

The **下元婴儿 (Infant of the Lower Primordium)** is taboo named **始明精 (Shiming Jing/Initial Luminous Essence)**,
given the name **元阳昌 (Yuan Yang Chang/Primordial Yang Flourishing)**,
and ranked as **黄庭元王 (Huangting Yuanwang/Yellow Court Primordial King)**.

To his right stands a **保镇弼卿 (Baozhen Biqing/Protecting, Subduing, Assisting Minister)**,
the **神 (Shen/Spirit)** of **精气 (Jingqi/Essence-Qi)** and **津液 (Jinye/Body Fluids)**—
congealed and ascended through transformation.
He enters the Elixir Field Palace as the Assisting Minister,
taboo name **归上明 (Guishang Ming/Returning to High Luminosity)**,
given name **谷下玄 (Guxia Xuan/Mysterious Beneath the Valley)**.

These two govern the Lower Elixir Field together,
both wearing **黄绣罗衣 (Huangxiu luoyi/Yellow Embroidered Silk Robes)**,
their appearance like that of an infant just born.
The **黄庭元王 (Huangting Yuanwang/Yellow Court Primordial King)** holds **太白星 (Tai Bai Xing/Jupiter, the Great White Star)** in his left hand,
and the *玉晨金真经 (Yuchen Jin Zhenjing/Jade Dawn Golden Scripture)* in his right.
The Assisting Minister wields the *太上素灵经 (Taishang Suling Jing/Exalted Supreme Scripture of Subtle Spirits)* and the **九庭生景符 (Jiu Ting Sheng Jingfu/Nine Courts’ Emerging Scene Talisman)**.
They sit facing outward, or sometimes toward each other.
Internally, they subdue the **府 (Fu/Palaces)** of the four limbs, body fluids, intestines, stomach, and bladder;
externally, they dispel calamities and scatter misfortune,
repelling the **万邪 (Wanxie/Ten Thousand Malevolences)**.

The **三魂 (Sanhun/Three Souls)** and **七魄 (Qipò/Seven Spirits)** come to pay homage three times a day,
and receive their duties from the Primordial King.

The method of guarding Oneness begins on the **立春 (Lichun/Start of Spring)** day,
at the **夜半 (Yeban/Midnight)** hour.
Sit facing east, upright and still.
Blow **气 (Qi)** nine times through the **九过 (Nine Passages)**,
and swallow **津液 (Jinye/Body Fluids)** thirty-five times.
When complete,
focus on the **北斗七星 (Big Dipper’s Seven Stars)**,
as they descend slowly upon your head.
Turn your gaze upward to the heavens,
with the **杓柄 (Ladle Handle)** pointing directly forward to the east.

Store the **阴精 (Yin Jing/Yin Essence)** and **真人 (Zhenren/True Person)** stars,
close to the crown of your head.
The **阳明 (Yangming/Bright Yang)** and **玄冥 (Xuanming/Mysterious Darkness)** stars
should be stored above them.

The **阳明 (Yangming)** and **阴精 (Yin Jing)** stars are behind the others,
while the **玄冥 (Xuanming)** and **真人 (Zhenren)** stars are in front.
Thus, the positions of storage and contemplation are fixed.

Again, focus on the **三一之尊君 (San Yi Zhenjun/Venerable Sovereign of the Three Oneness)**,
and suddenly transformations arise.
The three appear together within the Dipper’s canopy,
and in an instant,
the **三卿君 (San Qingjun/Three Ministers)** emerge like the **三尊 (San Zhen/Three Venerables)**.
In another instant,
you see all six ascend to **玄冥 (Xuanming/Mysterious Darkness)**,
just as they depart to the east,
reaching the **天关 (Tianguan/Heavenly Pass)** before halting,
all facing your mouth.

Again, store and observe:
The **上元 (Shangyuan/Upper Primordium)** holds the **上卿 (Shangqing/Upper Minister)**,
the **中元 (Zhongyuan/Middle Primordium)** holds the **中卿 (Zhongqing/Middle Minister)**,
and the **下元 (Xianyuan/Lower Primordium)** holds the **下卿 (Xiaqing/Lower Minister)**.

I now swallow my **qi** in one breath, and after a long while, the two of the **Upper Primordium** emerge from the **qi** and enter my mouth, ascending back to the **Nihuan Palace**.

Next, I swallow my **qi** in one breath, and after a long while, the two of the **Middle Primordium** emerge from the **qi** and enter my mouth, descending to hover within the **Jiangong Palace**.

Next, I swallow my **qi** in one breath, and after a long while, the two of the **Lower Primordium** emerge from the **qi** and enter my mouth, descending to hover within the **Lower Elixir Field**.

I then visualize the **Heavenly Pass Star**, positioning it seven *chi* away from my mouth, aligning it directly before me, as the **Three of Oneness** enter my **Three Palaces**.

When complete, I focus and meditate on the **True One** in its proper place, sitting or lying down, keeping it ever in mind. Whatever desire arises, I let it unfold in my heart, and whatever I seek, I let it unfold in my heart as well.

I focus my meditation, keeping it still and silent—like a quiet chamber at night, yet also possible to practice by day.

At the **Establishment of Summer**, I focus on the **Three of Oneness**, facing south as I did at the **Establishment of Spring** with precise meditation.

At the **Establishment of Autumn**, I focus on the **Three of Oneness**, facing west as I did at the **Establishment of Summer** with precise meditation.

At the **Establishment of Winter**, I focus on the **Three of Oneness**, facing north as I did at the **Establishment of Autumn** with precise meditation.

I focus on the **Three of Oneness**, each in their proper station. When complete, I softly recite:

*"The Five Directions command the Dipper,
The spirits gather the Seven Stars,
The Three Venerables condense and transform,
Ascending to summon the Purple Court,
The Six Spirits wander,
The Three Palaces form the Elixir City,
The Emperor of Mysterious Passage descends,
The Yellow Tranquility of the Lower Cavern is pierced,
The Celestial True Ones guard and defend,
Summoning the Six Ding,
Divine Immortals ascend together,
Riding the smoke to the Three Pure Ones,
The Four Limbs tempered and refined,
The Five Viscera self-generated."*

Thus concludes the **True One of the Three Primordia Scripture**. The **Golden Threshold Emperor’s Three Primordia True One Scripture** is complete.
