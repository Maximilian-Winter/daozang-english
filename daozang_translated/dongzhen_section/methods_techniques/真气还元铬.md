**Preface to the Inscription on Returning the True Qi to the Origin**

From youth, I revered the classics and, in maturity, longed for the misty peaks. Though I leapt through the Dragon Gate and sought to pluck the cinnamon of the moon, I donned brocade robes in the world, rode prancing steeds among men, set snares and traps, and forced open the workings of creation—bringing glory to father and son, extending blessings to descendants. I embodied benevolence and righteousness as a model for the age, wielded propriety and wisdom as a rule for posterity. Yet my dreams did not align with Fu Yue’s, nor did my fishing meet with Jiang Ziya’s; thus, I despaired and turned my heart toward the pursuit of the Dao of immortality. Poetry and books were abruptly set aside, brush and ink abruptly cast away.

I saw the myriad conflicts of the world, beheld the endless gains and losses of court and market. Glory flashed like a spark from stone, nobility drifted like floating duckweed—no distinction of high or low, only fleeting gatherings and dispersals. Corpse-like steps and ghostly strides: none but the sagely could discern them. Moving flesh and living dust: none but the worthy could distinguish them.

Thereafter, I sought secluded grottoes and traversed famed mountains, braving peril and scaling heights for twenty years. From the *Zhenming* year of the Liang, while wandering beneath the towering pines of Mount Tai’s summit, I suddenly beheld a man—his form and countenance unlike the common, his speech extraordinary—who called himself the Teacher of Ten Thousand Generations, the sole master of the Nine Heavens’ Dao. I then bowed my head and knelt in reverence.

He said to me: “You bear the marks of an immortal; only thus have you encountered me.”

He bestowed upon you the gateway to immortal learning—are you able to receive it?
I again prostrated myself in long obeisance, my form and words filled with gratitude.

He then said: “I ask you to shear your hair and smear your blood to swear an oath, that I may transmit to you the arts of bending and stretching, exhaling and inhaling, and refining the body.”
He further said: “Within two cycles of twelve years, you must not transmit these to others. Should you pass them to the unworthy, they shall incur punishment.”
I again prostrated myself in long obeisance, and suddenly he vanished.

Thereafter, I consistently followed the prescribed order, never slackening in my efforts. Every subtle word proved divinely efficacious. Having received my teacher’s command, I was bound to conceal these celestial mysteries. As the two cycles neared their end, I was permitted to transmit them to the world. Thus, I meticulously revised the ancient precepts, recast them into a new scripture, inscribed them in the marketplace, and concealed them among mountain stones. May later scholars who obtain them be fortunate!

*Inscription on Returning Primordial Qi to Its Source*
*Commentary by Qiangmingzi*

Before the One divided, the One was where the Dao was established. Qi was born of the One, yet undivided—this was the primordial chaos. Though this qi derived its name from the Great Dao, it remained the undifferentiated chaos, unseparated into purity and turbidity. Thus, the nameless gave rise to the named, and the named gave rise to the myriad things.

The *Daoist Scripture* states: “The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth; the named is the mother of the myriad things.” The nameless refers to the Dao; the named refers to qi. The Dao is the father of the One qi, and the One qi is the mother of the myriad things. All that possesses form and appearance arises from the One qi.

Therefore, in cultivating life, one values the Dao; in cultivating the Dao, one esteems qi. Qi is the root of spirit, the source of nature and life, the master of divine illumination. Should one cultivate it according to the proper method, one may attain the rank of immortal.

Thus, the *Yellow Court Scripture* says: “Exhaling the pure and inhaling the mysterious, the two qi shine—should you encounter them, you shall ascend to the Milky Way.” It further states: “Why not consume the qi of Great Harmony? Then you shall not enter death but dwell in Yellow Tranquility.” The meaning is clear.

The Three Powers share a single source. The Three Powers are heaven, earth, and humanity. “Share a single source” means they all reside in the primordial chaos. Once purity and turbidity diverged—purity ascending to become heaven, turbidity descending to become earth—humanity came to dwell between them, and thus distinctions arose. Yet the primordial essence of each remains.

Heaven models itself after me; I model myself after heaven. Though the primordial essence persists, heaven’s modeling and humanity’s form are without duality. Humanity takes heaven as its model to complete its form.

Someone asked: “Earlier, you said heaven models itself after me, and I model myself after heaven. Why does the Way of Heaven never collapse, while the Way of Humanity knows life and death?”
I replied: “Though heaven possesses its pivot and mechanism, it is empty and without intent. Being empty and without intent, the primordial qi moves of itself. With the primordial qi moving of itself, the Five Phases encounter no obstruction. Without obstruction among the Five Phases, there is no mutual conquest. Without mutual conquest, there is only the Great Void. Being the Great Void, it merges with the Dao and thus does not collapse.”

I further replied: “Humanity’s life and death do not differ from the Way of Heaven but arise from humanity’s own doing. From the moment of conception through the union of parents’ essence and qi, to the formation of the body and birth, one is beset by sorrow, weeping, joy, anger, grief, and delight. Gradually, the mouth craves the five flavors, the ears heed the five sounds, the eyes behold the five colors, and the heart indulges in the five desires. Endlessly entangled in the ten thousand mechanisms, nothing is left ungrasped.

These four matters all stem from the movements of the intentful heart. Once intent arises, emptiness and purity are lost. Having lost emptiness and purity, humanity strays from the Dao and becomes as the myriad creatures, equal in their lot. They drift with the cycles of life and death, following the withering and decay of the green and the rot. Like the spark from struck stone or the floating duckweed, they form momentarily and perish in an instant. This is humanity’s own doing, not the work of the Great Dao.

Should one’s heart be without heart, one’s color without color, one’s taste without taste, one’s gaze without gaze, one’s desires without desire, one’s hearing without hearing, one’s mechanisms without mechanism—harmonizing light and merging with dust, abiding in serene constancy—then one merges with the Dao. How then could one not attain longevity like heaven?

My life rests with me. Human nature and life, life and death, are determined by oneself. Should one comprehend the natural Dao, move the qi of Primordial Harmony, externally absorb the Two Radiant Essences, internally ingest the Five Sprouts, dynamically govern the hundred spirits, and tranquilly stabilize the Five Viscera, then cold and heat, hunger and thirst cannot invade; the five weapons and blades cannot approach. Life and death lie in one’s hands, transformations follow one’s heart. Earth cannot bury, heaven cannot slay—this is what is meant by ‘my life rests with me.’

It does not lie with heaven. Human nature and life, life and death, do not depend on heaven. Those who misuse it perish prematurely; those who use it well extend their years. Qi harmonizes and the body becomes quiescent. Qi is the primordial qi; the body is the physical form. When the primordial qi is pure and harmonious, the physical form naturally becomes quiescent. Once the physical form is quiescent, the qi naturally harmonizes.

Guard the One, and the spirit becomes at ease. The One is the One qi; the spirit is the spirit and form. Should one but guard the One qi, the spirit and form naturally become at ease. The spirit is the child of qi; qi is the mother of the spirit. Know only to guard the mother, and the child will not stray. Know to guard the sovereign, and the spirit will not scatter.”

These all accord with the Dao of nature—like water moistening downward, fire flaming upward, clouds following the dragon, and wind following the tiger. The numinous fungus dwells within the body: the numinous fungus is the *zhi* herb, "within the body" means within the human body, referring to the primordial qi. It does not reside in famous mountains. It does not depend on gathering from renowned peaks.

Return to the One and guard harmony: the One is the singular spirit, harmony is harmonious qi. Earlier it spoke of guarding the One to still the spirit; here it speaks of returning to the One to guard harmonious qi. This is the mutual abiding of spirit and qi, an unbroken continuity of thought after thought, an unceasing flow.

The principle accords with the Profound Mystery: the principle is the Dao’s principle. The Profound Mystery is the Mystery upon Mystery—when one knows to return to the One and yet guard harmonious qi, this is called the Mystery upon Mystery. When essence reaches its utmost, clarity arises: essence is essential qi, clarity is spiritual illumination. This means that when one attains the method of embracing the primordial and guarding the One, essential qi becomes full, and one thereby connects with spiritual illumination. When spirit reaches its utmost, numinosity arises: spirit is the singular spirit, numinosity is the human capacity for spiritual communion. This means that when one masters the Dao of embracing the primordial and guarding the One, the thirty-six thousand spirits never leave the person, and one naturally attains spiritual communion. When qi reaches its utmost, purity arises: clear qi is spirit, turbid qi is form. Qi is primordial qi, purity is pure emptiness. This means that when primordial qi reaches its utmost, turbid qi naturally disperses, and the person becomes purely empty.

Decline follows qi: this means that when qi declines, the body declines. Flourishing follows qi: when qi is abundant, the body flourishes. Dissolution follows qi: when qi is exhausted, the body perishes. Life follows qi: all people arise from the intermingling of primordial qi to form the body.

Joy and anger disorder qi: when people experience joy or anger, they disorder the correct qi. Emotions and nature contend: when joy and anger arise, emotions and nature contend with one another. Obstruction and blockage give rise to illness: earlier it spoke of emotions and nature contending, which obstructs and blocks primordial qi. Once qi is obstructed and blocked, illness arises. How can spirit and form be at peace? Spirit refers to the myriad spirits, form to the physical body—how can the physical body find tranquility?

Refining yang dissolves yin: refining is like smelting, yang is yang qi, dissolving is like melting away, yin is yin qi. Earlier it spoke of spirit and form being unable to find peace; here it speaks of refining yang to dissolve yin—this is the gateway of restraint and the method of regulation. In general, those who seek immortality and study the Dao must know how to cultivate and nurture properly: one must refine yang qi to dissolve yin evil, and only then can one attain longevity.

Moreover, all human illnesses arise because the five flavors give rise to the body, yet also cause the body’s demise. When first practicing qi absorption, one should first accumulate heart-fire to burn throughout the body. Once the burning is complete, follow the method to absorb qi, and there will be no illness that is not cured. Guangchengzi said: "Accumulate fire to burn the five poisons." The five poisons are the five flavors. When the five poisons are exhausted, one can attain longevity.

Qi moves of itself, spirit becomes numinous of itself: this means that after yin qi disperses, yang qi moves naturally. Dispel the evil with the correct: the correct is correct qi, the evil is evil qi. This means using correct qi to expel evil qi. Illnesses naturally subside: "subside" means returning to a state of no illness. Earlier it spoke of using correct qi to expel evil qi—like hot water melting snow, like fire dissolving ice, one naturally returns to the original state.

Heaven and earth become clear and still: the following explains the sequence of qi-absorption methods. Heaven is *qian*, earth is *kun*—this refers to when heaven and earth are clear, without wind, clouds, mist, rain, or snow.

After midnight and before noon: *zi* is the midnight hour, *wu* is the noon hour. In general, for exhaling and inhaling to regulate and absorb primordial qi, one should take the time from midnight until before noon—this is called the qi of the six yang hours. From noon until midnight is called the qi of the six yin hours; one must not exhale, inhale, regulate, or absorb internal qi, as there is nothing that will not be harmed.

Close the eyes and sit upright: when the Dao of heaven is clear and still, after midnight and before noon, it is time for exhaling, inhaling, regulating, and absorbing. One must face the royal direction, close the eyes, sit upright, and regulate the breath—this is the ordinary method.

Grasp firmly and close the eyes in stillness: after closing the eyes and sitting upright, one must grasp firmly. "Grasp firmly" means to clasp the thumbs. "Close the eyes in stillness" means to close the eyes as if closed yet not closed.

Draw breath into the central chamber: the central chamber is the nose. Then draw external breath into the nose, gently guiding it in until the sea of qi is full. After a long while, this is excellent—it is called "absorbing the new."

Exhale through the celestial gate: exhaling is expelling breath, the celestial gate is the mouth. After guiding external qi into the sea of qi for a long while, one must then exhale—this is called "expelling the old."

Inhalation should be subtle: subtle means that when drawing external qi through the nose, one should guide it in gently, so that the ears do not hear. Subtle is the gateway of life, excessive is the path of death—thus, guiding and absorbing should be subtle.

Exhalation should be unbroken: use intention to guide qi. This refers to when drawing external qi through the nose—one must use intention to guide external qi directly into the sea of qi.

The organs and viscera revolve: this means that when using intention to guide external qi into the sea of qi until it is full, the qi of the five viscera and six bowels naturally revolves, gently moving and making a gurgling sound. Then exhale: exhaling is done through the mouth. Earlier it spoke of the organs and viscera revolving; when qi reaches its utmost, one must exhale and not forcibly hold it in.

Nutritive and defensive qi circulate freely: this means that after practicing the principles of exhalation and inhalation, nutritive and defensive qi flow without obstruction. If there is disharmony: when a person is unwell, the five viscera and six bowels are disharmonious. Dispel it before the heels...

Dispelling it before the heels—this was stated above; to properly dispel the pathogenic is before the heels. The *Nanhua Sutra* says: "The breath of the multitude reaches the throat; the breath of the perfected reaches the heels." The heel is like the sole. The *Scripture of Embryonic Breathing* also says: "The breathing of ordinary people differs from that of the perfected. Ordinary people’s breath enters and exits through the throat; the perfected’s breath resides in the sea of qi, which is the root of qi." I note that when it speaks of "exiting before the heels," the foot is the heel, and the heel is the sole of the foot. Here, "heel" refers to the root of qi. "Heel" (*gen*) is akin to "root" (*gen*), meaning the sea of qi is the root of human life. Thus, when there is disharmony, one must expel pathogenic qi, practicing embryonic breathing as previously described.

Exhale five or six times: "Exhale" refers to the six qi. Generally, the qi of the five viscera and six bowels all belong to the heart, and the heart belongs to exhalation. Thus, using exhalation for inhalation and exhalation is the superior method. After completing inhalation and exhalation, proceed to ingest and circulate qi according to the method. There is no illness that will not be dispelled. This means that by practicing exhalation and inhalation, no illness will remain unremoved.

Whenever one wishes to practice embryonic breathing—qi congeals as the embryo, and breath is called "breathing," so the embryo congeals within qi, and qi breathes within the embryo, hence the term "embryonic breathing"—one must begin with daoyin. After midnight and before noon, sit upright with eyes closed, hands clenched, and gaze fixed forward. The meridians will not be obstructed: this means that by first practicing daoyin, the qi of the meridians will flow without obstruction. The joints will not be troubled: this means that by moving the joints through daoyin, original qi circulates freely without obstruction, so the joints will not be afflicted.

Some movements resemble shooting a hawk: the following describes daoyin methods. This refers to the posture of turning the body like one shooting a hawk. Lean to the side and curve the body: this single phrase describes the "shooting hawk" posture. Some raise the waist and back: this is another method, where one lies supine, presses the backs of the hands to the ground, lifts the waist, and draws in the legs until the head touches the ground. Like a half-round toad: this describes the "raising waist" method. Interlace the fingers behind the head: this is a separate method, where the ten fingers are interlaced behind the head, grasping the "Jade Pillow." Rotate left and right: after interlacing the fingers behind the head, one must turn the head and back, rotating either left or right. Strengthen the hands and feet with qi: during daoyin, when the hands and feet are tensed, one senses the original qi. It emerges from the fingertips: after tensing the hands and feet, the original qi naturally flows from the tips of the ten fingers. Swing the four limbs: this means that during daoyin, one swings and moves the hands and feet, hence the term "four limbs." Grasp and gather the three passes: during daoyin, one may hold the breath or clench the fists, extending this to the ten toes—this is called "grasping the three passes." The three passes are the mouth, hands, and feet. Thoroughly rub the "foot-length dwelling": this means rubbing the face with both hands. The sea of qi is the same: one should also rub it with both hands. Knock the teeth to gather the spirit: in all cases of ingesting qi and practicing daoyin, one must first knock the teeth thirty-six times to gather the spirits of the five viscera. The teeth refer to the upper and lower teeth, called the "Heavenly Drum"; when the spirits hear the drumming, they gather. Close the eyes and secure the passes: the eyes are the "pupils," and the passes are the mouth, hands, and feet. When the three passes are closed, no pathogenic influences can enter. Calm the mind and relax the body: free the mind from all thoughts and relax the body. The body is the physical form. This means to quiet the mind, free it from all thoughts, and relax the body as if it were empty space. Allow qi to come and go: close the mouth and let qi circulate within the "spirit hut." Sense the qi becoming harmonious: feel the qi returning through the nose, becoming balanced. Obstruct the throat pass: when the throat qi is harmonious, during exhalation, hold the breath so that nothing enters from outside nor exits from within—this is obstructing the throat pass. When obstructed, swallow: after obstructing the throat, the original qi remains there; with nothing entering from outside nor exiting from within, one swallows it. Three swallows in succession: this describes the standard method of swallowing qi. Three swallows in succession form one breath-holding; swallow three times in a row without allowing saliva and qi to be swallowed together. Turn the tongue and rinse inward: while holding the breath, slightly exhale so that qi fills the mouth, then use the tongue to gently stir it before rinsing it inward. Swallow it down to the cinnabar field: this means to swallow the original qi directly into the cinnabar field. The lower cinnabar field is the sea of qi, three inches below the navel. Guide the qi with intention: after swallowing the qi, use intention to guide it into the cinnabar field. Let it make a gurgling sound: when swallowing the qi, it should produce a gurgling sound, like water trickling into a pit, clearly audible. One swallow to three swallows: when swallowing qi, one swallow to three swallows constitutes one breath-holding, with three consecutive swallows. Swallow again as before: after completing three swallows, let the qi circulate within the "spirit hut," and when the qi is harmonious, swallow three times in succession again as before. Thirty-six swallows: after each set of three consecutive swallows, wait for the qi to harmonize, then swallow three times in succession again, up to thirty-six swallows—this is the standard practice for qi. The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: "Thirty-six swallows in the Jade Pool." This is what it refers to.

If one has not yet ceased taking grains, one must eat sparingly, ensuring the abdomen remains empty, cool, and free of discomfort. When sitting, if the abdomen is empty, swallow the qi. From dawn to dusk, one may do this ten times, naturally reaching one hundred and sixty swallows. With prolonged practice, one may reach three hundred and sixty swallows at once, which is called "intermediate attainment." One thousand two hundred swallows is called "great attainment," also known as "grand breathing." For minor embryonic breathing, simply hold the breath and count to one thousand or one hundred breaths—this is also called "great attainment."

Yet if one cannot refine the form and transform the essence, even if one gains longevity, it is but a withered tree devoid of vital radiance.

Should one’s nurturing and care deviate from proper method and suddenly fall ill, one must swiftly follow the qi-swallowing practice to cure it. When swallowing qi, one need not always complete thirty-six swallows. From thirty swallows upward—fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety, to one hundred—once the qi within the abdomen stirs and the qi in the four limbs flows freely, one should then cease, relax the hands, close the mouth, and allow the qi to come and go through the spirit’s chamber, letting it be faint, ever so faint. Hold the breath long, exhale little—this is the method by which true embryonic breathing is achieved. Thus is embryonic breathing perfected.

Embryonic breathing is accomplished by three consecutive swallows, completing thirty-six swallows in total. The Great Dao is non-action; the Great Dao, likened to the human body, is non-action—it is without deliberate effort. When practicing embryonic breathing, whether sitting or lying, walking or standing, let the qi follow the embryonic breath, and release the body as vast emptiness. Only then does one attain non-action, which is to be without a body. Having no body, one has no chaotic thoughts; having no chaotic thoughts, primordial qi arrives unbidden, comes unsummoned. And there is nothing it does not accomplish. This speaks to dispelling the misconception of the Great Dao’s non-action, lest practitioners cling to non-action—hence it is said, "there is nothing it does not accomplish."

If one can be without action—
*(As the preceding note states: releasing the body as that vast emptiness is the way.)*
this is called "without thought."
*(As the preceding note states: being as vast emptiness, empty of self, is called "without thought.")*
If one can be without thought—
*(As the preceding note states: if one can be empty of emptiness, without mind, then naturally there is no thought.)*
the myriad things return of themselves.
*(The myriad things are the myriad people. The myriad people point to the primordial return. "Return of themselves" means they return naturally. It is said that if one can be without thought, primordial qi naturally returns to the body.)*
To seek primordial qi through deliberate effort is like climbing a tree to catch a fish. The method and image are not two—
*(This speaks of the Dao of returning primordial qi to its origin, which is the same in ancient and modern times.)*
it requires no forced action.
*(This speaks of naturalness; deliberate effort is not the way.)*
Neither cold nor hot—
*(This describes the efficacy of returning primordial qi to its origin.)*
with prolonged practice, one becomes neither cold nor hot.
Neither thirsty nor hungry—
*(This line speaks of the efficacy of primordial qi. With diligent practice, one reaches the state of neither thirst nor hunger.)*
Wondrous within the wondrous, subtle within the subtle.
*(These two lines praise the inconceivable nature of returning primordial qi to its origin.)*
Seen yet unseen, heard yet unheard, grasped yet unattained—it is one with the subtle and the imperceptible.

Serene and desireless—
*(Serenity is the flavor of no-flavor, ever constant. This speaks of the Dao as serene and constant, without desire.)*
one delights in the Dao.
*(Delight is joy. This speaks of attaining the Dao of returning primordial qi to its origin—my life is in my hands, not in Heaven’s. After fulfilling the practice, one ascends to Heaven in broad daylight, dies seated or standing, receives the homage of the ten thousand spirits, remains unmoved when mountains topple, and endures unharmed when the world crumbles. Thus one delights in the Dao.)*

Scholars of the Dao—
*(This refers to those who study the Dao.)*
engrave this and wear it close.
*(This instructs seekers of immortality to revere this text, inscribing it on stone or wearing it upon the body.)*

Here ends the *Inscription on Returning Primordial Qi*.
