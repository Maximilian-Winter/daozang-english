**Preface to the Gushen Chapter**

The ancient sage-kings who governed the world as public office first transmitted the Dao of immortals in silent succession. Those who governed the world as private inheritance did not pass on this Way. Thus, it ended with Yu, and afterward dispersed among recluses beyond the world, all transmitting it orally, without establishing written texts. By the Zhou dynasty, the Old Master set forth five thousand words—his language profoundly ancient, his meaning profoundly subtle. Who but a spirit or sage could fathom it? Liezi and Zhuang Zhou regarded it as emptiness and nothingness; Gai Gong and Cao Can saw it as purity and stillness. Though not the orthodox interpretation, they did not stray far from the Dao.

Yet among its misfortunes, there were three: First, the followers of Shen Buhai and Han Fei twisted it into cruelty and mercilessness, distorting it with the fallacies of penal laws. Second, Kou Qianzhi of the Northern Wei, having compiled Daoist scriptures, found them insufficient in number and thus merged them with techniques of prescriptions, talismanic water, alchemical elixirs, divination, and apocryphal texts, confounding them into one. Third, before the coming of the Buddhist Dharma, the teachings beyond the world were of two kinds: one called immortality, the other called the Daoist school. Immortality pertains to life, the yang; the Dao pertains to nature, the yin. Though the division of these two schools in the bibliographic treatises of various histories may not be entirely precise, their distinction is nonetheless clear.

Yet those of limited insight, constrained by their teachings, could not discern the difference. Foolishly taking the solitary yin within the body, they pointed to the heart and kidneys as Kan and Li, lead and mercury, engaging in the intercourse of the golden elixir. They deceived the foolish with their clamor, the blind leading the blind.

Alas, how can one not sigh in lament! For over twenty years, I have harbored this indignation, yet found no one with whom to speak.

Of late, I have encountered Master Lin of Xuáncháo, a hermit of the Three Mountains, and at a single word, our minds met as if needle to magnet—a once-in-a-millennium fortune for which I cannot but rejoice. The Master then presented me with his *Three Mysteries Treatise*. Reverently taking it in hand, I read with awe, my heart astounded and my eyes turned anew. I long to carve and disseminate it, that it may broadly benefit scholars, yet my coffers are ever empty, and the means to do so elusive. Thus, I earnestly beseech the renowned and the well-disposed to join in this noble endeavor, that its radiance may illuminate posterity—not without purpose.

Of old, the Perfected Lord of Jǐngyáng foretold in his *Mysterious Record* that a thousand years hence, in the region of the Five Mounds, eight hundred earthbound immortals would emerge. Now, the time is nigh! This book shall awaken faith and insight in all who encounter it, awaiting the true transmission. Those who attain the Great Elixir of Dragon and Tiger shall ascend directly to the ranks of immortals, fulfilling the prophecy, and enter the gate of longevity and enduring vision—how could this not be the path of the great man?

Let none among us abandon themselves. Written in the sixth month of summer, in the yǐ-mǎo year of the Yányán reign, by Zhào Sīxuán Cóngshàn of Zhàozhōu, at the Háo River in Línchuān.

I have heard that through cultivating the Dao one attains immortality, through practicing Chan one becomes a Buddha, and through Confucian study one advances in office. These three pursuits are the great endeavors of extraordinary men, yet few achieve them. The Dao operates by principle, medicine by principle, and governance by principle. Without the character *lǐ* (principle), to what could the Dao cling to justify its name?

Mankind is born into this life, yet none can escape old age and death. Those who speak of cultivating the Dao speak of cultivating the body; those who speak of refining the elixir speak of refining the form. The wise may seek benefit thereby, while the foolish only invite harm. Why is this so?

Man’s body is received from his parents, a single spark of primordial yang coalescing into the physical frame, growing into a six-foot form. The origin of this body is not a fabrication of willful imagination or something conjured from nothing. At the age of fifteen, one’s years resemble the waxing and waning of the sun and moon, the great abundance of lead and mercury complete within the crucible and cauldron. Beyond this point, gradual decline sets in. Moreover, with the tumult of emotions and desires, essence and qi inevitably wane and dissipate. Before middle age, many already show weariness in their faces and loss upon their heads—a lamentable sight indeed!

Thus, the immortals of antiquity clearly pointed to the two qi of life and body as the root of the medicine. The teaching urges one to infer and augment, to compare qi with lead to prolong life. There is no other meaning here—this is the principle of sealing the furnace and mending the altar. Such is the Way of loss and gain.

Yet there are foolish men, shallow in fortune, who know not the preciousness of their bodies or the value of their lives. They fail to preserve the original destiny of their innate celestial alignment, instead praying for longevity before wooden idols and clay effigies—thus do they remain ignorant of the Dao. In vain do they exert effort in anger, donning coarse garments and eating bark, enduring hunger and cold. Seeking the formless Dao, they exhaust their bodies in rigid sitting, clenching their fists to cultivate qi—yet gain nothing.

Moreover, some engage in debating empty doctrines, vying in verbal sparring, composing literary responses, and deeming such pursuits their life’s work. They merely strive to outwit others in conversation, yet even in old age remain utterly lost—all for lack of seeking true awakening. Worse still, they mutilate their forms and extinguish their natures, growing ever more deluded. They sit idly as the world’s clamor swirls around them, yet none can escape the consequences of their folly.

Some arbitrarily fabricate perverse theories, claiming that since man possesses a body, all sensory dusts defile it, and thus all existence is illusory. Others spin endless discourses on life and death, asserting that since birth must end in extinction, seeking life is mere survival, and true bliss lies only in quiescent annihilation. They say that in death, the yin soul reveals one’s original face—neither born nor destroyed, neither increasing nor diminishing. Or they claim that the luminous spirit abides eternally in the void, yet where does it suddenly depart? Those who stitch together such hollow arguments later regret that the body is the root of suffering, yet cannot abandon it. Some burn their crowns, sever their arms, or mutilate their limbs; others cast themselves into water or fire, deluded into believing such acts are mere illusion.

There are those who sit passively awaiting old age to exhaust their allotted years, only to be mocked for their senility. How can they know that in death, the hun and po wander the gloomy paths, buffeted by wind and rain, suffering according to their karma? Have they not heard of those who perish in war? Though their forms are gone, their spirits still crave blood offerings to soothe their souls. Those who die of starvation, though their mouths are no more, still yearn for grains and cakes to ease their hunger. Those who perish naked, though their bodies are no more, still seek silks and coins to cover their shame. Those who drown, though their blessings are no more, still long for glutinous rice dumplings to honor their memory. Those who succumb to ulcers, though their backs are no more, still require straw effigies to bind their pain. Those who die in childbirth, though their blood is no more, still demand orchid basins to cleanse their filth. And what of those who hang themselves, drown unjustly, perish in prison, or die on the road? Their souls are seized and replaced, yet they cannot escape the bitter realms. Let the wise ponder this: where is the bliss in quiescent annihilation?

Man possesses a body—while alive for a single day, he gains a day’s joy; delaying death by a year, he adds a year’s wisdom. With deep wisdom and far-reaching insight, he may commune with the divine. Thus the common saying goes: foxes that live long learn human speech; pythons that endure the ages summon wind and rain; sandalwood and cypress, with time, develop fragrance; clams and oysters, sealing their essence, nurture pearls. How much more, then, should man—the most numinous of beings—pursue the Dao to seek life? With the body as the pivot of the numinous, should he not refine his form to attain immortality?

The Dao is no esoteric mystery—it is found in daily speech and mundane affairs. Its principles are exquisitely subtle, its mechanisms attuned to movement and stillness. Yet it is often illustrated through familiar analogies, and without a sincere and earnest approach to learning, few can truly grasp it. Is this Dao something my noble peers may hear—or not? As the *Immortals’ Classic* states: "The Way of fleeting laughter is not worth discussing with lesser minds. Only those of superior wisdom and strength can uphold it."

I am a man of the Lin clan from Min’s homeland. In my youth, I suffered through warfare, family strife, and mutual betrayal, scattering my kin. I wished to pursue the scholarly path, but circumstances prevented it; I considered taking refuge in the Buddha’s gate, but feared leaving no legacy. Adrift like tumbleweed, I endured countless trials, knowing hardship and poverty, mastering humble tasks. Upon reading the *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon*, I felt as though I had long understood its truths. Thus, I devoted my heart to the Dao, exhausting my body and squandering my years, wandering lakes and seas, enduring hunger, cold, and toil, accepting all things as they came.

Fortunately, I met a perfected one who took pity on me and instructed me in the essentials of cultivating truth—for preserving the body is the foremost art. I then pored over countless scriptures, consulted diverse teachings, and realized: to seek long life, one must return to one’s origin; to see the Tathāgata, one must investigate the fundamental. That origin is the primordial qi; the fundamental is essence and blood. Knowing the root, one’s efforts are not wasted—like the starving finding food, the sick receiving medicine. Awakening to the true and constant, one solidifies the path to the Dao.

Yet some cling to empty words and perverse views, claiming to accumulate karmic causes for future lives or cultivate blessings for the next, while treating their present body and mind as useless vessels. Without cultivation, there is no attainment—ultimately, all is emptiness. Examining the alchemical classics and texts on the Elixir, I see that the most crucial method lies in the divine water of the Flower Pool, the foundation of all elixirs and the ancestor of the Great Dao. Preserved, it is called the Precious Pearl; conjoined, it is called the Golden Elixir. Though a thousand schools share this principle, their verses and songs each express their intent. Through diligent practice, my words flow smoothly, and my speech resonates with the divine—though I am ashamed of my inadequacy.

As for the fire phases and the weights of the ingredients, these have already been expounded by past sages; I dare not add superfluous details. Reflecting on my shallow grasp of the supreme Dao, I hesitate to speak further. Yet fearing the waste of years, I plan to retreat to a secluded island, dwelling in mountain caves to make my final rest. Often I think of old friends scattered like stars across the Wu and Chu regions, at the ends of the earth—unable to bid them all farewell, I have no choice but to gather these crude words, like curdled milk, and send them to like-minded souls as a parting message.

Thus I compose this work, titling it *Valley Spirit*, for it concerns nothing more than nurturing the primordial qi. Though its language is coarse and its words unrefined, it preserves the workings of creation. If any discerning gentlemen chance upon it, may they read with understanding, silently resonating with its truths and subtly aligning with the Dao’s mysteries. Should they find passages awkward or poorly crafted, I would be grateful for their corrections.

I received this transmission from a teacher, tracing back through the lineage of Han Xiaoyao, and am a disciple in the line of Master Lu’an Yu.

As for his person—ordinary and sage blended as one, hidden and manifest beyond measure. Moreover, I, in my lowly station, have long studied despite chronic illness, ever fearful that my meager blessings and shallow destiny may yet bind me to worldly dust, leaving me unworthy of self or teacher. Thus I dare not inscribe his name. This is meant only for those who would emulate the learned.

*Valley Spirit*, Scroll One
By Lin Yuan Shenfeng of the Five Blessings Mystic Nest

**Poem on the Great Elixir and Returning Cinnabar**

A hundred years—seventy is rare,
Gray temples, missing teeth bring sorrow.
The Tathāgata awakened early, cultivating non-abiding;
The Primordial Beginning endures, clinging to being.
Su Jin spoke of Chan yet feared death,
Shao Yong, gravely ill, still sought physicians.
Pity us fools who probe the wordless,
How many heroes are led astray by ghosts!

Hearing the Dao, without a teacher doubts remain,
Hard to seek the divine water to enter the Flower Pool.
Unversed in the Moon Grotto’s capture of lead and mercury,
Do not speak of *kan* and *li* before others.
Fireflies arise from rotting grass—easy to perish,
Waiting by the tree for hares—slow to awaken.
Before the returning cinnabar is refined, the head turns white,
Hands idle, hearts grieving, awaiting death’s hour.

Harmonize lead and mercury to lay the elixir’s foundation,
Encompass the armillary sphere, bind it to the west.
Grasp the interval between wood and metal,
Seek the parity of *geng* and *jia*.
The Metal Lord marries as the Azure Dragon’s son-in-law,
The Crone’s daughter weds as the White Tiger’s wife.
Following the Yellow Matron’s matchmaking,
In the depths of mystery, the *daogui* is born.

Having found the true path to the Mysterious Pass,
I teach you to easily refine the returning cinnabar.
Split open chaos to divide pure and turbid,
Wash away the dust’s clamor to reveal saint and mortal.
Nurtured naturally, the golden liquid warms,
Refined swiftly, mercury dries.
Clearly, a single vibration of the Western advent,
Dragon and tiger are but two names for the same.

Receiving the immortal elder’s wish-fulfilling gourd,
Diligently draw water to cultivate the spirit-sprout.
Warm springs bathe the evening cave of shrimps,
The bright moon ever fills the Magpie Bridge.
The Wood Maiden hides *geng* in a wondrous feast,
The Metal Lad roams *jia* in chance encounters.
Their bond deepens, desiring profound union,
Together they ride the simurgh into the nine skies.

Strive in cultivation—how can it be idle?
At the ends of the earth, finding a teacher is hard.
When meeting the enlightened, seek correctness,
Do not, like the wordless, deceive yourself.
Father and mother, the two poles, birth the child,
Mercury and lead, the two *qi*, merge into returning cinnabar.
I urge you to earnestly seek the Mysterious Female,
Seeking outside the body is all heterodoxy.

Father’s essence, mother’s blood—roots of mercury and lead,
In substance, the Mysterious contains the Primordial Honored One.
Distinguish the wondrous medicine to know returning cinnabar,
Discern the great Dao from its byways.
Milk is the blood’s dwelling—drink it when fitting,
*Qi* is the essence’s temple—swallow it swiftly.
Embrace the One, further cultivate the Dharma of Peace,
What worry then for life’s impermanence?

Stealing the workings of transformation, plant and eat the peach of immortality,
Your rosy complexion ever like spring’s intoxication.
Unfurl the Ghost Valley’s soul-ensnaring net,
Enter the Tushita’s Palace of Ultimate Bliss.
Deeply fear the axe’s theft—guard in secret,
In old age, pluck the fruit, hoping for boundlessness.
Flowers bloom and fall—do not grasp,
Gaze afar as they scatter in riotous red.

The initial aim of cultivation was to prolong life,
But lacking transmission, one drifts into Chan.
Mistaking the eye’s light for constant vigilance,
One scorns the body’s sack as frail.
Dissolving the soul into *po* makes one a ghost,
Refining *po* to return to *hun* makes one an immortal.
Through the ages, masters share one principle:
Teach people to seek lead in the water’s realm.

Wealth and poverty in cultivation depend on past causes,
The poor cultivate *qi*, the rich cultivate the body.
*Qi* departing the body becomes a yin ghost,
The body firmly preserved is called the Valley Spirit.
Without lead, life’s completion cannot sustain wealth,
Meeting immortals and knowing the medicine turns sorrow to poverty.
Cultivation has its categories—seek the proper match,
Cultivating *qi* without residue is vainly proclaimed.

Learning immortality, one shuns death,
Setting up the cauldron and furnace is the great plan.
Firmly grasp the alms bowl to subdue the Water Mother,
No need for lamps or urns to continue the barren mounds.
Nine years embracing the Dao, three thousand days,
Twelve autumns refining the elixir.
Vying with skeletons for the breath of hunger,
Defiantly refusing to eat earthen steamed buns.

Dry Chan, bound by precepts—matters obscure,
Without *li* and *kan*, no inversion is possible.
To preserve life, seek mercury within cinnabar,
To refine form, rely on lead in water.
Guarding the elixir, the *qi*’s signs are ever like drunkenness,
The work of firing delights most in sleep.
If you cling to sitting in stillness to complete the Dao,
You’ll emerge from the prison of death as an immortal.

Mount Sumeru rolls mustard seeds, the sea receives needles—
Once the human form is lost, it is hard to find again.
To fulfill Avalokiteśvara’s boundless intent,
Rely wholly on the Second Sage’s perseverance.
Mending the sky, refining stones to ascend the azure waves,
Boiling the sea into salt to verify white gold.
If this principle is lightly divulged,
Worldly affairs will know neither past nor present.

The Great Unity enfolds the numinous, transmuting into jade perfection,
The dancing robe remains unstained by worldly dust.
The lead-flower immortal maidens trail their radiance,
The Golden Grain Tathāgata reveals his wondrous form.

Benefiting beings with merit is called supreme goodness,
Refining form to merge with the Dao slays the life-spirit.
Why blame bamboo and silk for their dim records?
They betray those who steel their resolve to learn the Way.

The Purple Palace’s quail-fat glows with soft jade fragrance,
The Jade Chamber’s fine brew is the elixir of returned souls.
Balanced reversal and restraint serve the elixir’s work,
Once attained, fullness sustains life’s length.

Sipping from Rāhu’s throat, swallowing jade instructions,
Tending the Moon’s comet, guarding the pearl sac.
The Yellow Court refines the golden fish pouch,
Far surpassing an official’s fief or a country squire’s rank.

The foolish awaken from their dream of the scholar-tree,
Moonlight reflected opens the Jade Hall.
The monastery’s moon-sister pours the wine,
Just as the Heavenly Youth arrives hungry.

The white serpent hangs upside-down, vomiting the Seven Luminaries,
The black tiger is ridden astride to ascend the Three Terraces.
Were one not the world’s utmost spirit,
Who would dare speak lightly of this?

Study deeply the *Cantong Qi* and admire Boyang,
The *Wuzhen* and *Fuming* texts explain further still.
The Li Dragon and Kan Tiger enter the crucible and tripod,
The Qian Horse and Kun Ox guard the grotto chamber.

To restrain mercury, the single formula speaks of crane’s grass,
To nurture lead, the one ingredient is the Red Maiden.
Yin and yang paired, the body grows firm,
Clever deceit cannot endure long.

Breaking through primordial chaos, one laughs at the Great Void,
Hand reaching for the millet grain, the One Mysterious Pearl.
Dragons dissecting this find it tasteless,
Hungry tigers swallowing it delight in offspring.

Learn from the immortal elder to harmonize the cauldron,
Lest the noble gentleman be kept far from the kitchen.
Saving beings grain by grain transcends life and death,
Mastering withdrawal and addition fills the jade flask.

The Great Elixir is unknown to the world,
Perusing divine formulas exhausts secret injunctions.
Searching the Flowery Pond for the Red Child,
Embracing him to present to the Primordial Lord.

The belly first receives qi, guard against dietary leakage,
The brain gradually congeals spirit, beware of sneezes dividing it.
All endless mysteries are revealed,
Exhorting people to cultivate the Dao through diligence alone.

How many refine the true yet fail to preserve it?
Those with intention but no resolve are fools.
Knowing well that a foot of jade is not one’s treasure,
Refining yellow gold may yet ruin the self.

Bribes to seek marriage, filling the ranks of nieces and sisters,
Carved saddles and prancing steeds outshine qilin.
Easily courting death through arrogance and ease,
To learn the Dao, one must be utterly impoverished to the bone.

Daoist and Buddhist scriptures are weighed scruple by scruple,
The wish-fulfilling mani pearl, the jade-black jewel.
Xiao Liang’s resentment and blockage yield no gain,
Han Wu’s extravagance cannot be pursued.

Maitreya’s staff-head pepper sack,
Lü’s branch bears the medicine gourd.
One must seek a thoroughly combed fellow,
To overturn everything and speak it to him.

Feathered immortals in towering trees tend their fruit granaries,
Morning requires golden liquor, evening jade nectar.
Washing and clarifying the numinous essence like autumn waters,
Congealing the primordial spirit surpasses dawn frost.

Ghost-fire burns open the flying rat’s cave,
Barbarian thunder splits the sleeping dragon’s ridge.
Ever since the Great Treasury’s Yellow Court path,
One often rides the goat-cart into the emerald chamber.

In old age retreating to the mountains to learn immortality,
Refining elixirs and burning medicines to preserve one’s remaining years.
The two bows of Gen and Dui wrestle lead and mercury,
The six unions of Qian and Kun bear the mysterious feminine.

The earth ghost subdues the female to form the poisonous egg,
The metal lord conceals the worm, nurturing frog’s saliva.
A hundred mornings of bathing, busy moving the tripod,
From white to yellow, ten months complete.

Cinnabar and jade slips pair harmoniously,
Dry mercury embraces wet mercury.
Watering golden flowers to grow the treasure tree,
Boiling jade liquor to cast the jasper tower.

The great thousand transformations abound in numinous sages,
Attaining the One makes all things complete.
If the mind for profit and fame is not yet sated,
One returns again to seek within the red.

Yin at its extreme, yang arises, the six pulses fill,
Earth thunder shakes the floating elixir pearl palace.
When the first line moves, all lines move,
One method mastered, all methods are mastered.

The golden tripod bathes lead in weak waters,
The jade furnace advances fire, shunning the black wind.
Different names emerge from the same source, none recognize it,
All lies within the mysterious pass’s sacred key.

Without encountering true explanation, why rush?
First ensure sweet and savory nourish the skin-sack.
Morning combing, night pillowing, follow heaven’s principle,
Summer linen, winter furs, observe the world’s ways.

Meat nourishes spirit, aiding healing,
The human body’s illusory form is precious to preserve.
Blood, essence, tears, and saliva—though yin substances,
With the right instructions and cultivation, they too prolong life.

Seeking arts at the world’s edge, planting peaches of immortality,
Passing through Yunmeng and Yangping several times.
Plucking thunder to take home and plant,
Again wrapping stars to sift them out.

Temporarily employing the method of *na jia* to nourish dry bones,
Loathing the *gou geng* method that speaks of thatched huts.
If the Yellow Way is not cultivated but the Black Way is,
The vast heavenly net may be hard to escape.

To seek the Dao, first seek the formless,
Do not confuse dragon and tiger with careless explanations.
The killing mechanism reverses in bedroom arts,
Desire’s sinking delusion is well-bottom Chan.

The birth cave welcomes the red snake entwined in blood,
The tongue’s tip sends forth the white wild fox’s saliva.
Precious gold and silk transmit deviant ways,
Waiting for how many mutton coins?

The Three Clarities’ examinations select great scholars,
Frauds fill the ranks, the Dao is not upheld.
The heavenly eye’s perfect benevolence discerns good and evil,
Worldly affairs shift wisdom to touch both worthy and foolish.

The old immortal’s raw material for immortality,
Transmitted to men of great resolve.
A fine steed needs no fine whip’s shadow,
The mysterious pass swiftly entered—does it come or not?

Immortals are humans refined—who cannot do this?
Later, following advice is like wood following the plumb line.
The mother labors across the sea to search for divine medicines,
Easily, facing the wind, mending the life-lamp.

Seeking the Dao in the southwest, the transmission is wondrous,
Losing friends in the northeast—what was truly gained?
Heavenly truth, pure and mixed, is finely pared,
A cup of dark wine, bending the arm to rest.

*Principle of the One Truth*
The Dao’s namelessness is established through the One;
The formless of things arises through the One.
The Dao divides the source of inherent nature,
The One binds the stem of life’s tether.

Delighting in the Dao yet forgetting the One obtains its common name;
Guarding the One while practicing the Dao embraces its fine essence.
Thus the One is the beginning of all numbers,
The One is the omen of all things,
The One is the mother of all characters.
Therefore, the Dao and One together bear the load,
Substance and function both illuminated—
The One as substance, the Dao as function,
Nature is unborn, yet life is born.

The *Book of Changes* states: "Qian is Heaven! Kun is Earth! Valleys are marshes! Things take form!" Yet the *Daoist Classic* counters: "Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; valleys attain the One and become full; the myriad things attain the One and come to life." Man, too, is a thing—attaining the One, he lives; losing the One, he dies. Not a single day can pass without the One.

Thus we know: Heaven’s One, Earth’s One, the valley’s One—these three cycle endlessly, ascending and descending, mutually generating, alternating as end and beginning. Though things possess the One, they abandon it and thus cannot retain it.

In ancient times, Fuxi first drew the Eight Trigrams, beginning with a single line to form Qian, declaring it "firm and unceasing," yet it must reach its end. He then added another line to pair with it, and thus two Qians became Kun. Some say he softened Qian’s hardness to create Kun, so that hardness and softness complemented each other, movement and stillness harmonized, and stability was achieved. Qian and Kun are the keys, giving rise to Kan and Li. Kan and Li are the male and female of Qian and Kun. When Kan and Li transform below, they generate Dui and Gen, which are the male and female of Kan and Li. Male and female unite to become husband and wife; husband and wife conceive and become parents; parents age and become elders. Herein lies the principle of the Prior and Posterior Heavens, cycling endlessly in mutual generation.

Those who cultivate the body rely on a single art or skill to sustain themselves; those who refine life embrace the One of yin and yang to preserve their spirit; those who govern a household return to one wife and one concubine to secure their home. All these are called "attaining the One," and thus body and mind find stability.

Laozi embraced the One to discourse on the Dao, his five thousand words distilling the essence of the Dao into wondrous efficacy, while virtue aligns with hidden yin. Of virtues easier to transmit, Yan Yuan did not stray from benevolence for three months—benevolence is righteousness, is virtue, and thus his virtue could be passed on. Of the Dao harder to transmit, the *Hong Fan* lists five blessings: the first is wealth—wealth is property, is fortune, and thus one may receive the Dao.

Born between Heaven and Earth, some uphold benevolence and perfect virtue, some guard wealth and achieve fortune—Heaven’s endowment is not equal. Wealth relies on divination to reveal its efficacy; righteousness listens to lawsuits to settle disputes. Yet the Dao does not value teachers, nor virtue rely on resources. How then can the pursuit of righteousness achieve completion, surpassing the study of wealth?

Thus rare treasures must be firmly grasped, while easily heard matters often fade away. Offering coins to sacrifice to the altars of soil and grain is no different from tribute; privately setting up shrines to conceal spirits is no different from accepting bribes. As the ancients said: "The Dao is not idly transmitted, just as worldly sentiments drive alchemists to seek arts in vain." At their extreme, they hide certain texts or secretly imitate their forms. Those who seek masters and inquire of the Dao, yet go a lifetime without transmission—when no trace remains to guess, they blame only themselves; what cause for resentment?

Some say: "The Dao is not untransmitted, nor must it be transmitted through wealth. Even humble and esteemed gentlemen may scorn the Dao upon hearing it." The Dao branches into many schools, but lest this Way vanish from the world, if one finds a worthy recipient, the Dao burdens the person. Those who casually copy scriptures dare not append their words; those who falsely claim to possess gold cannot entrust them with their treasures.

Formerly, officials hastened to attain the Dao, and many courtesans once achieved immortality. Thus they discerned favor and disgrace, understood skill and clumsiness, excelled in listening yet suddenly awakened, and though deceived, were not deluded.

Now, worldly learning forgets the root to chase the branch, loses the Dao to cultivate virtue, regards ten thousand as the most noble of numbers, and the One as the basest. Hearing of non-being, they mock; hearing of being, they sneer. The Dao shelters under the One’s protection, while the One is the Dao’s taboo. Though many scholars clamor about embracing the One, guarding the One, uniting the One, attaining the One—mere names truly bear no weight, like seeing a square and not valuing the medicine.

Thus the One cannot be easily described in form or words. When words are insufficient, one chants and sings; when that is insufficient, one sighs in lament—still insufficient.

To study the Dao yet lose the One’s substance and function is like a thousand gold pieces easily obtained, yet a drop of water hard to dispel. The ancients who attained the Dao attained the One. Those who cultivated the great perfection of the supreme vehicle roamed the mysterious realm, entered the gate of all wonders, refined the Great Mystery’s One, and widely spread the celestial black writ, the primordial talismanic water, to save the dying world. Some say they "took from excess to supplement deficiency"; others say they "harmonized mercury and lead, sparing both sides harm."

Only foolish men and women corrupt the Dao and disrupt truth, wantonly harming one another. Filial sons who lose the Dao cut their flesh to save their parents, only to cause both parent and child to perish! Do they not know the One cannot be sacrificed?

The scriptures say: "The Dao has three thousand six hundred gates; attaining one, all matters are complete." Thus the One is the master key of the mysterious pass, the central lamp of the awakened instant—no lock remains unopened, no depth remains unilluminated.

In my middle years, I groped for the mystery with empty hands and awakened to the Dao, painfully reflecting on the many hardships of piercing through. Fortunate to have gained it from the four directions, not through mere effort but through no loss, I record this for universal salvation.

*Quatrains on Fire Timing and Practice*

Long life has a secret, yet no work is done,
Waiting for impermanence, feet tread on emptiness.
Telling of mercury and lead, they only laugh—
How can they recognize the master’s breath?

Gold essence and wood liquid lie east and west apart,
Drawn back and moved into the earthen crucible.
When the five phases return to the One’s nature,
Who can match the alchemical work of elixir refinement?

The numinous sprout grows the root of the Dao,
When the flower blooms, the moon becomes full.
This is the true black descending from the five directions,
Called true mercury, also named lead.

Within the sun is the crow, yin gold red;
Within the moon is the hare, yang fire white.
When crow essence and hare blood merge into the elixir,
Ordinary mercury and lead cannot be refined.

**The Sun’s Essence and Moon’s Spirit**

The sun’s essence gathers in *mao*, where *mao* belongs to the hare;
The moon’s spirit dwells in *you*, where *you* belongs to the fowl.
To refine the elixir, return to the root and establish the foundation—
Simply shift the fowl and hare back to east and west.

The hexagram *Ren*’s Crone descends from the jade terrace,
Transforming into the turning jade and the comet’s thunder.
Mistakenly touching the Yellow Chamber, she cannot fly away,
Seized by lead, she is bound and forms the embryo.

Lead and mercury unite, paired with the Four Spirits,
Refined into a numinous substance—the sacred silver embryo.
With mercury and lead as this empty chamber,
The body’s successor generates the dragon, bones and qi made true.

The fire-timing of the celestial cycle is not hard to know—
The reed-pipe’s flying ash marks the true midnight hour.
Only the Yellow Dame can fathom this:
The female body waxes and wanes each month.

At Wuling’s stream, the peach of immortality ripens;
On Xuanshan’s slopes, the fire-jujube glows red.
Wait for the black mist and slanderous rain to pass,
Then pluck them to offer the aged immortal.

Every person has a flask of mercury,
Yet young and old take different paths—how could it be absent?
Alas, they cast it aside without a thought,
Scattering the pearl of eternal countenance as common dust.

To still the heart is easy; to subdue the kidneys is hard—
A hundred days of preserving essence is already a feat.
When the night is full and the sky cold, one fears nocturnal emission;
Hasten to seek the great medicine to transmute cinnabar.

To accumulate essence and retain qi is no idle matter—
Primordial qi nourishes the body, harmonizing the hundred vessels.
How many fools lack the fortune to preserve it,
Daring to sigh over moxa burned at the navel?

The arts of the bedchamber must never be practiced;
Do not speak of the "Gate of Death" as a path to life.
Within the Cauldron of Lesser Yin lies boundless treasure—
Not all heroes with ambition can contend for it.

The Xian Pool’s grotto is the Water Immortal’s abode,
Where a single peach tree blooms a thousand times.
How many have lost their lives plucking its flowers,
Mistaking their concubines’ mourning robes for truth?

The old man clings to the flowery brothel in search of youth—
How can the heart for the Dao compare to the heart for desire?
Marching the ghostly path is ever perilous;
The frail, bare-chested elder embraces the tiger in sleep.

As the ancients said, "To love virtue is like loving beauty"—
Yet from dawn to dusk, one remains deluded.
The rich vie to learn the arts of yin absorption,
Boasting of what they cannot practice.

Wu maidens and Yue beauties are sought in abundance,
But who understands the *Spring and Autumn*’s warning of patricide?
When the navel’s gate suddenly opens, the bronze Buddha laughs—
All the relics in the bag vanish in an instant.

Bedchamber arts, if known, are better left unknown;
Widows and chaste wives often outlive their husbands.
Banish the ghost that clings to the body early,
Better than nailing peach charms above the door.

To master spirit union without bodily union,
The empty blossoms of yang’s allure will fall away of themselves.
Only then can one take up the alms bowl to subdue dragons and tigers—
To invite them upon oneself is to have no escape.

A single drop of Meng Spring is the medicine’s material;
The mortal embryo, bathed in it, becomes a numinous embryo.
To return to the root and revive life is to know the crucial gate—
To revert to the origin and return to the source is to be reborn.

In later years, one probes the mysteries half-drunk, half-sober,
Unable to fully grasp the *Yin Fu* or the *Dao and Its Virtue*.
Once the stew is seasoned, the host must be the basin—
Life’s mandate first follows the Northern Dipper’s script.

The Dao is founded upon the Mysterious Female to establish the elixir’s base;
Within the *Wu-Ji* Palace, *Kan* and *Li* are forged.
Without true lead to restrain true mercury,
Who can nurture the ghostly embryo?

At the dawn of chaos, black first turned to green—
Yet the elixir’s medicine already dwells in the Yellow Court.
To withdraw and replenish is as easy as Han Xiangzi’s flute;
To advance and retreat is as hard as the *Jian* and *Da Ling* spirits.

White snow and yellow sprouts receive qi at their inception;
Expelling evil and aiding the upright is called "Tu Su."
A youth sits in Dao until his hair turns white,
Shattering the monstrous bag—yet not a drop remains.

The *Kui* and *E* move from *Kan* to seek *Li*;
Reversing yin and yang is the proper time.
Awaken the old man to add to the fire-timing—
Lest the water’s source be clear or muddy, and all go awry.

A single sip from the Flower Pool brings merit—
New hair grows at the temples, red hangs from the crown.
Leisurely gazing into the mirror,
One finds one’s appearance no longer ordinary.

The river chariot’s conveyance of qi is inexhaustible—
A single revolution equals nine years of work.
To embrace the Dao and sustain the body leaves no trace;
Learners vainly crave swift success.

The sun, moon, and stars move in their ordered course—
Discern the subtle patterns, and their wonders can be glimpsed.
Heaven is not old, for it constantly revolves;
Man’s will is fickle, discoursing for but a moment.

A man severs white to transform essence into blood;
A woman severs red to transform blood into essence.
Though not yet immortals of Penglai,
They are called the Infant Brother and the Marvelous Maiden.

To revive life and return to the origin, the Dao’s darkness abides;
The unbroken divine water moistens the numinous root.
Even in old age, one clings to the bedchamber’s treasures—
Yet at a hundred years, one may still beget descendants.

At thirty, blood and qi are strong;
One laughs at those who speak of the Dao and elixir formulas.
With rice in the kitchen, morning cooking is easy;
Without oil in the lamp, the night’s work is frantic.

At fifty, to refine the elixir is already too late—
Qi declines, the body remains, called a "walking corpse."
How many now resolve to seek the furnace and cauldron,
Only to raise children in the furnace and cauldron instead?

To preserve what one has now is essential;
The past and future are as nothing.
To cultivate nothingness from nothingness—
What need is there to discuss the *Taiji* of primordial heaven?

Buddhas and immortals complete their lives within their alms bowls—
Why do people today vainly claim to share their awakening?
Monks who do not embrace the origin fail to attain true fruit;
Daoists who practice austerities fall into stubborn emptiness.

To cultivate stillness as merit is already unworthy—
Fire ascends, water descends, and one becomes a fox spirit.
Blood flourishes, qi defends, circulating through the channels—
How can the knife and spoon enter the mouth?

The path to Penglai relies on spirit travel;
The wordless golden elixir is not yet sufficient cultivation.
If one can extinguish desire and return to ultimate bliss,
Even the skull must sigh with Zhuang Zhou.

Clinging to stubborn emptiness is a grievous error—
Soul scattered, spirit dispersed, all ends in death.
Who in this world lacks dragons and tigers within?
Yet they say the body is refined over countless kalpas.

The affairs of rebirth and death are a labyrinth;
Buddhas transform sentient beings by accumulating good causes.
Pointing to the Western Land of Ultimate Bliss,
They speak of attaining human form in myriad ways.

Ask the crucial ford between the Gate of Death and the Gate of Life—
Buddhas speak of extinction; the Dao speaks of ascent.
Empty talk seems near, yet profound discourse is distant—
Thus the world reveres monks.

Seeking months within years, hours within days,
Long abiding by the furnace, yet still unaware.
On cold nights, they clamor to sit with alms bowls,
Only to guard against essence leakage while singing verses.

With a penchant for solitude and weary of broad learning,
How can one know that guarding the One is still a side door?
Mistaking one’s own body for a stinking skin-bag,
Insisting on long life is but idle talk.

Reciting sutras to avert calamity, performing exorcisms—
The ultimate meaning is clear; do not waver in doubt.

Those who guard the Dao and seal themselves in retreat practice water and fire,
Yet whence come tiger-wolves and willow rods?
The Five Immortals cultivate the Dao by different methods—
When the celestial cycles turn, what befalls you?

When the power of Water virtue waxes, yin affairs prevail,
Though the Mystery Gate is expounded, ghostly works abound.
The Dao teaches the Three Vehicles: gods, ghosts, and immortals,
Sitting in death or standing in liberation—yet life leaves no trace.

A corpse left upon the earth is still called death—
Hmph! What profundity lies in their mutterings?
Jade nectar congeals thickly, golden elixir grows dense,
Sealed behind closed doors, refining in solitude, leaving no human trace.

Guard the spirit carelessly, and essence will leak;
Dreaming of summons and omens, delusion breeds misfortune.
Primal talismanic water, primal lamp—
These are the dark essences of the Prior Heaven.

Since you pledged to refine the elixir,
None in this world can now practice it.
In mountain forests dwell foolish men,
Who gladly forsake fame and profit, never seeking them.

If all the myriad things are quiescent extinction,
How can one laugh and wait for their nonexistence?
Nobles and ministers, scholars and worthies,
Cherish essence, preserve life—do not beg Heaven.

Human life’s essence and marrow are not bestowed by Heaven;
In vain do they burn incense to pray for long years.
Sun and moon soar high into the Purple Court—
Even amid bustling work, the practice may yet be pursued.

Holding office while guarding the Dao presents no obstacle,
Yet I fear their conduct may not be pure.
Golden elixir reverses aging, restores youth,
Seeking the mysterious in the life-gate, the nature-school is fulfilled.

If boots are torn and not patched with leather,
Fine silks cannot mend them.
Within every person lies cinnabar—
Ordinary mercury, common lead—nothing more may be added.

How can the unlearned perceive this?
They burn miscellaneous stones, calling them "yellow sprouts."
Guard the One with single-minded devotion—even death is rest;
Haste is like quenching thirst, yet satiety is hard to attain.

To congeal the immortal embryo, one must gather the Pāramitā,
Seize the queen bee and place her within.
When Heavenly Gui and Heavenly Ren are fully recognized,
One is destined to become an immortal.

Let the Purple Mansion bear no name—
In the end, I alone can refine mercury and lead.

**Five Blessings: The Mysterious Nest**
*By Lin Yuan, the Divine Phoenix*

**The Art of the Pitch-Pot, Illustrated**
A golden vase casts wooden arrows—
Qi’s cavity draws the spirit home.
With heart upright and form aligned,
The mechanism nurtures and unfolds its power.

Lu Lüzi said: *"To honor Buddhism is to depart from office and guard the abiding; to study the Dao is to seek the mysterious in the Water Palace."*
This saying is most apt!

**The Diagram of Embracing Primal Simplicity**
*On the Empty Fame of Stillness Practice*

In cultivating the Dao, there are five stages, each a step toward immortality. Let us examine them:

To refine destiny (*ming*), one must preserve perception and presence, taking the body as the elixir chamber, qi as lead and mercury. Following the movements of yang’s work, supplemented by medicinal tonics, one cures illness and is called a *Human Immortal*.

Further, by safeguarding the spirit with the Jade Token and embracing a weighty, pure, and unadulterated nature, one grasps the image while forgetting words, achieving longevity in the world—this is an *Earth Immortal*.

Withdrawing behind walls to sever worldly ties, concealing one’s traces to evade summons, and refining the form with Golden Fluid until both form and spirit attain subtlety—this is a *Divine Immortal*.

Mastering the pivot of creation’s mechanism, aligning with Heaven’s Dao, enduring great trials, observing the mysterious precepts and prohibitions, forgetting speech and action while broadly cultivating benevolence, silently accumulating merit—one awaits the fulfillment of qi and the perfection of spirit. Then, transcending into a body of pure, light, harmonious qi, one returns to the Grotto-Heavens, attaining the rank of *Heavenly Immortal*.

These four ranks, though distinct in grade, follow the gradual progression of destiny-refinement. Thus, their principles yield inevitable fruition.

As for refining one’s nature (*xing*), one must trust in the void, taking qi as the master and the body as a temporary abode. Embracing yin qi to guard stillness, one unites the myriad threads, stills the hundred thoughts. Though eating and drinking do not burden the heart, the Four Great Elements remain inert, the Five Viscera idle. Through prolonged seated practice, the body becomes free of chronic illness, and toil goes unnoticed.

With diligent effort, one gradually attains stillness and stability. When essence (*jing*) ceases to leak, both nature-water and spirit become limpid. Inwardly observing, the heart is absent; outwardly observing, form vanishes; gazing afar, things dissolve. One enters true stillness.

Yang’s *hun* gradually wanes, yin’s *po* gradually prevails. The essence of *po* and the water of nature both grow luminous. In stillness, one forgets—this is called *entering samādhi*. Only then does one sense the body within light; in vagueness, the body disappears. Nature expands freely—this is called *attaining nature*.

With a pure and expansive heart, the center is empty yet responsive. Profoundly, one foresees the fortunes and misfortunes of human affairs, discerns past and future, yet remains unaware of one’s own afflictions. Some, in yin’s collapse, grow fearful, dreading the legions of demons. Exertion dulls wisdom; in dullness, serpents and tigers appear before them.

Without cause, yin spirits attach to their nature, perverse influences enter their bodies, ghosts and spirits rush to serve them—yet they merely endure the labor. The verification of stillness practice, compared to embracing the One, is also said: *"If one can remain constantly clear and still, Heaven and Earth all return to them."*

When yin essence flourishes, corpse-demons flourish. Unaware, one plunges into deep abysses—yet all can emerge of their own accord. As the saying goes: *"The Dao rises a foot, the demon rises ten."*

Some abandon the body to tread peril, indulge in empty thoughts to forget hunger and cold, or with fierce qi eat without excreting. Forgetting form, they feel no pain; in corpse-like trance, they harm themselves without injury. Facing execution, they remain unscathed; in suspended breath, smoke fails to dry them. When nature perishes, they wholly forsake sleep.

All such "benefits" arise from clinging to life and shunning death, free of fear—yet they only astonish and delude. Far from the Dao, they are but fleeting illusions, ultimately inescapable from death.

When stillness reaches its extreme and suddenly stirs—not by host or guest, but by thieving perversity—movement becomes uncontrollable. Essence scatters, and one speaks in verses, displays teachings, manifests forms to transform the vulgar, or abandons being for emptiness. Some slander the true wind—this is the loss of the heart, where the desire to prevail lingers, not the Dao’s doing. Though called "attaining the Dao," in truth, nothing is attained.

Born between Heaven and Earth, one holds the eternal golden celestial drop of spirit-water, the embryo complete with both male and female. Thus, when nature stabilizes, water clarifies; when clear, it reflects things. A pool’s water, when limpid, breeds fish and turtles; a mountain with springs harbors spirits—when contained, it breeds demons.

The vulgar hear of sorcery: entering a home, one gazes into the water in a bowl to perform theft—how much more so with the yin talisman of nature-water! For the cultivator who enters the realm of empty samādhi, if endowed with innate spiritual bones and an unwavering heart, they may awaken to the turning light and returning illumination, restoring life to its root. Sealing the mouth to sacrifice to the turtle, closing the eyes to cross the bridge—some can transfer the spirit upward, exit the corpse and re-enter the shell, coming and going without obstruction. Truly attaining the Dao of *Ghost Immortals*, realizing the fruit of the *Empty King*—one in ten thousand achieves this, a rare feat.

Yet though called "accomplished," can one feed hunger with porridge made of no rice? If, swayed by external things, heterodoxies arise, and one mistakes the demon’s chatter for one’s own ability—alas! The calamity of loss is near. Who would say one dies without resentment?

Alas! How lamentable!

Heaven’s Dao constantly cherishes all things, leaving none abandoned. Ghosts and spirits have no fixed disposition; when the Dao declines, they are lost. Some say the ghostly path is easy—how much more so for disaster?

Consider the Ghost Immortal’s attainment: unable to roam the light and pure, nor retain form in the heavy and dense, they dwell in the dim and distant, their thoughts alone—what is it like? Observing Heaven and Earth’s myriad things: first yin, then yang; from nothing to being; first emptiness, then fullness; abandoning delusion to seek truth; first ghosts, then spirits; laying down arms to cultivate culture; first merit, then skill; from coarse to refined.

All things, once existent, gradually decay, collapse, disperse, and perish, returning to formlessness.

All beings, human and otherwise, follow the flowing course of qi’s movement. Agitation overcomes cold; stillness overcomes heat; weakness overcomes strength; thought overcomes fear.

Heaven’s Dao: yin ever prevails over yang. Human Dao: stillness ever prevails over motion. Humans are endowed with excessive yin substance, hence the three *hun* and seven *po*.

The path of immortality often begins auspiciously; the ghostly path often begins inauspiciously. The *Yijing*’s transformations likewise state: one aligns with ghosts and spirits in fortune and misfortune. Yet in worldly affairs and literary principles, a hundred things are empty for every one that is real.

To abide in motion is also the Dao—when motion reaches its extreme, stillness emerges, and in stillness, spirit congeals. To abide in stillness is also the Dao—when stillness reaches its extreme, motion returns, and in motion, qi scatters.

Observe the hen brooding her eggs: when water is poured over them, those that float and stir hold life; those that sink and remain still hold none. No life means no spirit—this is a principle as clear as day.

The sage, observing the cycle, laments the ruin of things, sighing: “Better there were no things at all, so one would not witness their decay.”

Divination texts state: Heaven and Earth, years, months, days, and hours each have their moments of emptiness—how much more so for humans? Ordinary people’s deaths and burials last no more than three years. But for physicians, shamans, diviners, sages, loyal ministers, and righteous scholars who establish merit, benefit the world, and leave behind a name—those whose virtuous deeds extend their grace to later generations—are praised by the people. Thus, their names endure in the spirit realm, and their sacrifices are offered. Though loyal, serene, righteous, and brave, their spirits manifest in the yin realm.

Others, who merely admire lofty purity or reckless simplicity and have temples named after them, possess only empty reputations. In office, they share the same emoluments; in death, they share the same vulgar fate. Though they may have temples, they receive no offerings. Their deaths return to impermanence—no different from those who, in solitary yin, cling to stillness.

**Water Tune Prelude**

Thunder lies buried in the earth,
Springs well forth beneath the mountain’s base.
The pivot’s mechanism aligns—
Only the noble man can fathom its workings.

The first nine: “The hidden dragon—do not act.”
The top nine: “The exalted dragon has regrets.”
The dark ford gathers in the Yellow Palace.
Great Accumulation brings advantage—
Excellently succeeding, nurturing the primal male.

Dismantling the primordial chaos,
Seeking the cauldron’s essence,
Crafting the *Cantong Qi*.
With sincerity filling the jar,
The Dao flows abundantly, vast and bountiful.

Repaying intoxication with golden grains from the valley,
Embracing decay in a cracked urn,
Retiring to dine in public service.
Receiving restraint through doors and windows,
Its Dao endures without end.

---

Awakening to the celestial immortal’s secret,
Penetrating the patriarch’s barrier.
Inverting *kan* and *li*,
Returning to the root and reviving destiny—
A matter of moments.

Neither fasting nor precepts,
Neither action nor silence,
Nor seated meditation in perfection.
Why then do fellow disciples
Forgo sleep and forget meals?

Seek the yellow sprout,
Capture one’s own mercury,
Bind the returning elixir.
Worldly affairs are burdensome,
Yet none touch the Dao.

Neither abandon wife nor chase concubines,
Neither cast off children nor forsake office.
Simply drink the Great Mystery’s wine—
Each one may ride the phoenix.

---

The great medicine, the golden elixir’s ancestor,
Exists before the division of mixed essence.
Hard and soft split apart—
Different names, yet both emerge from mercury and lead.

Grasping the Dao’s reversal of things,
Refining this divine water of the Flowery Pond,
Extending the pattern to unite with the mystery.
The double eight is the crucial juncture—
Husband and wife reunite.

Noon arrives at *shen*,
*Yin* rises at *zi*,
Circulating the celestial orbit.
The hexagrams align in *Jiji*—
Yin must await yang’s extremity to assume power.

Three and five: *geng* gives birth, *jia* reaches fullness.
Gradually, *Zhongfu* conceives—
In ten months, the sacred embryo is complete.
Inside and out, radiant and crimson,
The great creation corresponds to pure *qian*.

---

Form and appearance nurture the *Kundulun*,
Fully attaining the *Pratyekabuddha*.
The great thousandfold world of self and others—
All named the immeasurable *asamkhya*.

Men dwell in Jetavana’s almshouse,
Women in the Sea of Awakening’s gate—
Love and desire are the roots of suffering.
If one delights in the *Lana* path,
The reward of blessings still exceeds the term.

---

Charity like Sudhana’s,
Treasure like Prabhūta’s,
Broadly seeking teachers through karmic excellence.
Suddenly transcending the other shore,
Scooping from Cao Creek.

The Buddha spoke of the *Srotāpanna* fruit,
I attained the *Arhat* path—
Thus realizing bodhi.
The first *pāramitā*:
Listen carefully and contemplate.

---

Trees, though old, may be grafted;
Can humans, though old, be left to wither?
The Mysterious Origin feeds on the mother—
The returning elixir entering the mouth is the true plan.

Begging the western neighbor’s red brew,
Seeking the eastern neighbor’s white wine—
Two into one gourd.
Boiled in my cauldron,
The jade hare and golden crow dance.

Rescuing decline,
Reviving the old woman,
Restoring youth like a fledgling.
Essence fills the marrow,
Body and mind ever robust.

Common sayings claim immortals renounce desire,
Idly speak of true persons having no thoughts—
Even heaven’s husband is moved by mechanisms.
I say: this is no ordinary Dao,
It does not bind itself in solitude.

---

Creation’s game is fleeting and false,
Heaven’s net spreads wide as mugwort.
Lifting the veil of life and death—
The hinge’s turn reveals King Yama’s presence.

The six paths’ wheel devours and consumes,
A single qi’s circulation governs high and low.
Examining the orifices to bestow life—
Only then may one avoid being cast into the skin’s hub,
Yet even then, meeting good parents is rare.

Friends are many, but those who listen are few.
Deception and entanglement arise from haste.
Heaven and hell—
Believe in Shen and Lü,
Investigate Han’s constancy.

Plowing hunger, few regrets,
The Dao’s valley doubts and lacks—
Yet actions skillfully align.
To escape yin and yang’s construction,
Refine lead frost in the golden crucible.

**Diagram of Wood and Metal’s Separation in Function**
**Diagram of Primordial Qi’s Generation**
**Discourse on Primordial Qi**

At the inception of primordial qi, it is but a single millet grain, a dewdrop, a water bead. From the boundless kalpas of beginningless time, within the obscuring haze of coalescing dust, it harbors and congeals a single droplet of water’s essence. Nurtured within, like a basket bearing an egg, it germinates from the base—thus it comes to be! Forcibly named the Dao, the Numinous Treasure, born of yin yet sustaining it, white within and black without, its dark essence establishes the martial, the warp of the Northern Dipper. Thus, the inner white transforms the po-soul, paradoxically belonging to yin; the outer black alters the hun-soul, paradoxically belonging to yang—this is yin’s containment and yang’s embrace.

The inner yin, stirred by yang’s movement, follows and emerges, becoming misty vapors. The outer yang, awaiting yin’s stillness, steps inward, initiating the swirling of nascent qi. As yin first emerges, it is unseen—termed "elusive and indistinct," akin to cold mist rising. As yang first enters, it is unheard—termed "profound and obscure," suddenly like the formless, generating warmth. Once conjoined, they blend in undifferentiated substance, accumulating from small to great, neither pure yin within nor pure yang without.

Moreover, yin qi as disposition favors expansion, leisurely dispersion, desiring full emergence. Yet as it gradually emerges, it does not forsake its offspring, forming embryonic radiance—appearing like mist generating dampness. Yang qi as nature favors nurturance, harmonious fusion, desiring full inwardness. Yet as it gradually enters, it cannot depart its mother, forming portents of dawn—warmth flickering in union and separation, generating heat. The outer yin increasingly coalesces; the inner yang increasingly congeals, binding into chaos. Its form returns to the origin, establishing celestial patterns—this is the dark enveloping the yellow.

Now, the dark pertains to water, the utmost essence of primordial qi, accumulating to fullness. The yellow pertains to fire, the generative spirit of residual qi, blazing within its bounds. Thus, within this chaos, only a single gleam of sunlight sinks into the water! Yin qi lies beyond the heavens, thus unable to rest, ever fluttering like a mother soothing a sleeping child. Yang qi resides within the fluid, thus unable to move, ever stirring like a chick awaiting the hen’s nourishment. Through prolonged nurturance, dryness arises within the yellow. Once dryness is born, the dark essence erodes and desiccates; water dries and qi empties—from this emptiness, wind is born. When dryness reaches its extreme within, thunder resounds!

Thus, within the heavens’ womb, the Four Symbols reside. Within, wind strives to rise yet cannot stir; water strives to flow yet cannot; fire strives to flame yet cannot ascend; thunder strives to surge yet cannot erupt. Gradually, they clash and contend, even to the point of war. Wind aids water’s force, creating surging waves; thunder aids fire’s force, adding vehemence. Until, through fierce collision, it shatters! Shattering is division—this is the opening of heaven. Thus, thunder quakes and resounds; wind lifts the vast expanse; fire’s qi ascends and descends; water’s fluid flows and pours. The ancients who governed transformation secretly designated wind and thunder as Pan Gu’s names, that later generations might not lightly fathom creation’s workings.

Once heaven divides, primordial qi transforms. The lighter qi ascends from below, congealing into the celestial abode. The heavy residue of primordial qi’s accumulated fluid follows the base it bears—this is true water. Tracing back to the time since heaven first took form, until chaos had not yet shattered, its vastness spanned but a hundred li. Generally, a person today may traverse a hundred li in a day—thus thunder resides within it. Only by firmly nurturing the sound of a hundred li can one shake the fury of ten li, for fire is its mother. Fire’s conflagration in a day does not exceed a hundred li before subsiding—thus we know thunder and fire’s command are constrained. Water may flow ten thousand li in a day, and wind likewise—thus we know water and wind’s governance are unbounded! Therefore, thunder’s strike scorches objects; wind’s breath dampens garments—each bears the imprint of its mother qi’s endowment.

Once the hundred-li heaven divides, it becomes a thousand li, gradually extending to ten thousand li. Wind expands according to direction; thunder surges according to position. The outer residual qi spreads and arranges; the inner primordial qi’s portents circulate and enclose. Through kalpas of response and transformation, it becomes impossible to fathom its myriad li! Some ask: wind and thunder share the same cavern—why can wind blow ten thousand li while thunder only shakes a hundred? It is said: wind, stirred by cold qi, blows water—this is primordial qi’s surplus, called yin qi, malign qi, perverse qi, easy to accumulate yet hard to disperse. The yin spirit governs the world with frequent recklessness. Thunder, borrowing dryness to shake fire, is residual qi’s selflessness, called yang qi, wrathful qi, righteous qi, hard to arouse yet easy to calm. The yang spirit governs the world with constant fidelity. Thus, when thunder unfolds, its sound weakens; when it surges, its fury abates.

Water, fire, wind, and thunder are the Four Symbols. Wind is but spirit; thunder is but resonance; fire is but light; water alone possesses substance. The sun is but fire’s light. Within the celestial vault, only water possesses the potential to manifest substance. Water’s upward correspondence gives rise to the Northern Asterism, and thereafter, water’s qi, the sun’s reflection, through transformation, generates the moon. Yet water is the mother of both prior and posterior heaven.

Water begets wind; wind in turn stirs water, raising waves into foam. Thunder shakes water, churning it into floating duckweed. The sun bakes water, congealing sediment into brine. The moon illuminates water, settling the chamber into mud. Mud accumulates and gives birth; worms and insects transform together—thus earth is formed.

Wind scatters and stirs dust; the sun scorches and hardens sand. When heavy dew descends and water nourishes the earth, moss and lichen first arise. Then come creeping weeds, followed by tender shoots, their fleeting growth and decay gradually thickening the soil. Grasses transform into bamboo, branches flourish into trees; over time, grasses bear ears, trees grow trunks, and herbs yield fruit. Spring’s flourishing and autumn’s shedding all rot and return to the earth, which grows ever richer until the land takes shape.

As tree roots intertwine with earth and piled soil solidifies, over time they harden into stone. Thus, within the bounds of heaven and earth, all that possesses form and image reduces to but two things: wood and stone. Ancient trees, infused with the qi of heaven, earth, clouds, and mist, develop essence and sap; over time, they transform into birds and dragons, into demons and men. Endowed with spirit and vitality, when shaped by karmic conditions, the limbs, hair, and body of humankind derive from wood—thus enabling leaping, drumming, grasping, bending, and stretching, all expressions of its nature. Red stone, nurtured by water and earth, refined by the sun and moon, develops blood and milk; over time, it transforms into toads and tigers, into sheep and women. With mechanisms transparent and fluid, when driven by thunder, the skull, abdomen, and bones of the human body derive from stone—thus enabling sitting, crouching, dwelling, and embracing stillness, all expressions of its essence. Wood as male and stone as female, once united, conceive and bear sons and daughters, completing the human form.

With the emergence of humankind, transformation and nurturance diverge. Even without mating, insects and creatures arise from wombs and embryos; young and old depend on one another, preserving offspring. Species differentiate, and myriad forms take shape. Those that forage in the wilds and fields develop natures suited to flight and movement; those that gather near hearths and settlements gain wit and discernment, beauty and ugliness. Tracing the origin of men and women born of wood and stone reveals the shift from insentience to sentience. The moist nature of stone gives humans their molars; the withering nature of wood brings death. All living forms are partial and contingent, yet the human body is most refined, endowed with the fullness of yin and yang’s primordial qi.

Heavenly spirits and earthly deities are all governed by humankind. It is further said: Since the opening of heaven and earth, their form resembles an overturned vessel. Within it, primordial qi generates and transforms; various qi ascend, congealing and accumulating at the vessel’s rim, forming the vaulted expanse like soot settled at the bottom of a cauldron. Depending on the thickness of the ascending qi below, over time it hangs suspended, forming layers and masses. Nurtured by the qi of the sun, moon, cold, and heat, it is smelted and refined into ore, its core harboring the essence of metals and jade. When defiled by turbid qi, it falls as hills, mounds, and caves. Nüwa’s smelting of stone to mend the heavens drew upon its primordial qi, leaving its raw substance in the world—these are the five metals and treasures. Those yet unrefined remain as cinnabar, lead, alum, saltpeter, and the like.

As the vaulted expanse accumulates qi over time, the weight of its raw substance gradually sinks. Above it, the hollow emptiness of Kongtong arises. All things, day and night, exhale qi that ascends, borne aloft by the blazing tips of these vapors. The scorching, shadowless qi penetrates the empty expanse, condensing into the sun’s spirit. The liquid qi of all things mingles below, forming the numinous essence of stars and sun. The qi of transformation manifests as lesser stars, hence called "lodgings," for they retain light for a single night. Observing the Dao of heaven, one sees that in its beginning, it possessed no numen—it contained the reflections of all images, its inner radiance serving as its spirit. It had no deity; the blazing brilliance of the qi enveloping all things became its god. Without external form or inner shadow, even the sagest cannot behold its face, though the worthy may align their hearts with it.

Some say the destruction of heaven and earth arises from no other cause: the excessive generation of the two qi weakens water’s power and hollows the earth. Primordial qi is water; residual qi is earth. Water flows day and night, scouring rivers and marshes, so river sources shift their courses and riverbanks lack fixed shores. Thus, the topography of Yu’s era reflects the prosperity and decline of north and south; the sands of Qiantang respond to the gathering and dispersal of east and west. As days pass and months return, the world follows the transformation of ridges and valleys. When water’s flow reaches its limit, its force weakens. Moreover, the earth’s overabundant generation of life hollows the soil, rendering it unable to sustain itself. Minor collapses occur in low-lying areas; major ones cause total subsidence. When strength is exhausted and destiny fulfilled, even in collapse, there is a bottom. Yet the light of the sun and moon, scattered by the shock of collapse, vanishes.

When the earth first subsides, life’s qi ceases and cold qi prevails. Heaven, left unsupported, becomes perilous. Within its darkness, all beings perish, returning to earth without residue. Three hundred and sixty years pass in the human world. When yin’s stillness reaches its extreme, yang stirs again; cold qi transforms into warmth, and warmth and cold interact, generating dampness. Once damp qi arises, it steams and spreads in all directions. The vaulted expanse, vast and desolate, becomes drenched and sodden, its vastness dissolving and collapsing. Another three hundred and sixty years pass, as it endures dampness and crumbles.

Examining the structure of hills and ridges—layers of stone beneath layers of soil, piled and interwoven—reveals that the decay and destruction of heaven and earth have long existed. The rest and renewal of heaven and earth are the cessation of creation’s force to nurture qi, the Dao of yin and yang’s union, the principle of returning to the root and restoring life. Though called destruction, it is merely the generation of residual qi, accumulating to form a posterior heaven above and a hollow earth below, where substance settles and returns to soil. The prior heaven, however, knows no destruction, for its primordial qi endures, returning to regenerate. When damp qi flourishes and heat’s signs appear, extreme heat gives way to dryness, and yang qi arrives!

The pure and turbid divide! Radiance emerges, and all things draw upon their origin—another eighty-one years have passed in nine cycles of nine. Thus, heaven and earth’s single rest spans eight hundred years.

I have heard elders say: eighteen thousand and eighty years after the opening of heaven, earth then came to be. Reasoning thus, heaven’s accumulated qi endures for ten thousand years, resting for eight hundred! In sum, it becomes evident that Qian descends to form Kun.

For heaven, one day contains twelve hours; in the human body, twelve meridians. A person’s weariness and awakening hinge on a single hour, aligning with the reckoning of rest. When heaven and earth collapse, their spirit does not perish. Thus the scripture states: the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Floating Radiance and the Primordial Heavenly Worthy are separated by countless kalpas—this is no falsehood. After their collapse, heaven rises higher and grows more distant; earth sinks lower and thickens; mountains accumulate and tower ever more loftily, like stones revealed as waters recede.

If heaven and earth did not rest, there would be no means for them to unfold; if an infant did not sleep, there would be no way for it to grow and transform.

Someone asked: How can the primordial heaven endure and attain long life?
The answer: Observe the image of heaven—it is like a covered vessel. Externally, there is no vast emptiness; peripherally, no leaking apertures. Though dark passes and earthen barriers lie within, they reside in its inner realms of brightness and obscurity, stillness and movement. The circulation of its primordial qi, along with its rest, occurs solely within it—thus it endures. Heaven envelops the myriad things, stealing their qi to nourish itself, and by this means attains long life.

Now, heaven’s theft of the qi of things: there is no second heaven—it steals only from what is born within itself. Thus, the myriad things suffer no loss or violation; this is the natural theft it rightfully claims. Humans, too, can do this. Moreover, since humans share the same body, if they can steal from what they themselves possess, how much more can they steal from other things!

Yet in the human body, beyond the five viscera and six bowels, nothing else abides. Though every sip and bite enters from without, to seek long life solely from self-generation is difficult. Thus, the Yellow Emperor practiced the art of controlling women and lived to one thousand two hundred years. Qian Keng mastered the method of nurturing infants and enjoyed a lifespan of eight hundred. Looking back: grafting peach onto apricot, grafting mulberry onto elm; consuming the velvet of deer, eating the flesh of young animals; wearing furs, demanding bloody sustenance—all because their qi can supplement qi, their essence can stir essence. Though things differ, their primordial qi is the same.

The ancient sages said: draw near from the self, draw far from things. The world recites these words, yet few truly savor their meaning. In cultivating the Dao, one seeks attainment—through seeking attainment, it is called "theft." Eating grain is theft; eating meat is theft. To become a thief who feeds the spirit, though theft it may be, no theft compares. If one can steal primordial qi from oneself and return it, then the realm of long life is easily attained! How then could one plot further, becoming a thief of unkindness?

Furthermore, what is the primordial qi of humans? In its beginning, it is a single dewdrop of life within the qi of the beginningless. It gives birth to heaven, gives birth to earth, and through wood and stone, gives birth to humans. Extending to ancestors, it is the parents who give life to the body. What now resides within the human body is the single point of spirit-qi between the two kidneys—bestowed by the parents.

Now, the union of yin and yang in heaven and earth, the coupling of the myriad things: it is the coupling of essence. Misrepresented, it is said to be blood. Once parents infuse their spirit into the Gate of Origin and the Cavern of Nurturing Yang, it is the root of the beginningless mystery, the original dewdrop—this is called primordial qi. Its form is indistinct, its image obscure, concealed within the essence-fluid—this is the water-body.

It governs the kidneys, containing and nurturing the yang soul, transforming to generate heart-qi. Heart-qi generates the pupils of the two eyes, dividing into clear and turbid. The clear qi of the right eye transforms into spirit-water, returning to the heart as fluid. The heart’s fluid transforms into blood, returning to the left kidney as essence. Essence transforms into qi, guarding the spirit as nature.

The turbid qi of the left eye ascends to generate brain marrow, forming the skull. Once complete, it descends to generate the spine, then the right kidney, pairing with the left kidney as the Gate of Life—or in women, the uterine palace—uniting hun and po souls. The hun generates the liver, heart, tongue, gallbladder, pericardium, small intestine, bladder, and penis. The po generates the lungs, throat, stomach, spleen, colon, large intestine, anus, and the constructive and defensive qi, combining to form the Triple Burner.

The hun governs the movement of blood and constructs the sinews, ligaments, and channels. The po transforms qi to move the defensive, generating flesh, bones, hair, and skin, completing the body, and thereafter the four limbs. In women, all is reversed, for they face north to receive the embryo. (This pertains to the mother’s pulse diagnosis.) Yet though male and female differ, both rely on the cubit pulse to determine life and death, equally decisive for fate.

The operation of primordial qi: it resides in the kidneys, passes through the heart, responds in the eyes—three palaces ascending and descending, a single qi circulating. Thus, the kidneys pair with the bladder, the heart with the small intestine, the eyes with the brain. These pairings are their gathering places. Knowing these pairings—this union, this return—one understands the qi’s egress and ingress: its intervals, its waxing and waning, its clarity and turbidity. This is the sign of illuminating the heart and perceiving nature.

The transformations of primordial qi divide into two forms: qi and fluid. Qi is called life; spirit is true mercury. Following movement and external contact, when awake, the spirit roams in the eyes; when eyes close, it returns to the heart; in sleep, it retreats to the kidneys; in silence, it gathers at the brows—this is the ascent and descent of qi.

Fluid is called nature; essence is true lead. In tranquil cultivation and internal return: in the kidneys, it is essence; reaching the liver, it becomes hun; reaching the heart, it becomes blood; reaching the spleen, it becomes rich marrow; reaching the pericardium, it becomes constructive vessels; reaching the lungs, it becomes po; reaching the Triple Burner, it becomes defensive qi; reaching the interstices, it becomes moving qi; reaching the brain, it becomes spirit-spring; descending to the nose, it becomes jade nectar; reaching the throat and tongue, it becomes numinous fluid. Entering the stomach, it gathers in the heart’s domain.

The constructive and defensive qi, once circulating the body, return to the heart, joining with the fluids of grain in the large intestine. At the colon, they separate the clear and turbid: the clear qi enters the small intestine, seeps through the kidneys to the bladder. The bladder returns to the original sea, the original sea regenerates qi—endless day and night.

At this moment, it is called the spirit returning to qi, qi reuniting with fluid. The noble person guards their solitude, attaining this as the minor return. When male and female dwell together in the chamber, one thing divides into two names: within yin lies hidden yang, called the Yellow Sprout; within yang lies the image of yin, named the White Snow Divine Talisman. Together, they are called the Knife-Point Elixir.

The method of cultivation: at the *zi* hour of yang within the human body, nourish with extraordinary water and advance with natural fire—"natural" here means following the proper timing. In but a moment’s effort, something arises from nothing, forming the sacred embryo. This is called "seizing the workings of creation."

If one does not seek the oral instructions and further loses the company of those of the same kind, even the Jade Fluid will be absent—how then could the Golden Fluid exist? Merely abiding in contemplation and non-action, hoping for the union that forms the elixir, is truly delusion.

When a person lacks root and foundation, the body lies in partial decay. Qi cannot linger, fluids have no place to return. As the years advance, qi ages, the form withers, fluids dry up. Failing to complete the Dao, illness becomes their worry, hunger and thirst their burden, old age and death their sorrow—how much more so when seized by the killing mechanisms of yin and yang?

Someone asks: What is meant by "seizing"?

When it is the time of cold and heat, they harm the blood and vessels, weakening the spleen and stomach. When it is the time of thunder and lightning, they snatch the hun and po, startling the spirit from the body. When it is the time of yin rain, they extinguish the spirit’s vitality, causing dreams of swallowing yin qi. When it is the time of frost and snow, they pare away the flesh, inducing dreams of peril and seminal loss. When it is the time of famine, they wither the qi and constitution, dulling the senses and breeding foulness. When it is the time of pestilence, they rot the life, bringing maggots, blood, and premature death. When it is the time of war and weapons, they destroy the form and will, bringing great pain and separation.

Unaware, people lose their rosy complexions to unseen withering—all these are the seizing of the killing mechanisms.

Some say Heaven loves life and hates killing—could Heaven not be compassionate? Yet Heaven’s love of life is rooted in earthly qi: it nurtures the living qi of beings and corrupts their dead qi, just as the human abdomen cannot tolerate putrefaction.

If one can regulate and ingest original qi, it must rely on stomach qi as its foundation. Forsaking the coarse and rough, one offers the refined and pure; rejecting untimely foods, one partakes of the fresh. Casting off the stale and spoiled, one takes in the sweet and nourishing, filling the stomach qi so that original qi overflows.

Confucius said: "When sacrificing for the lord, do not keep the meat overnight." When a traveler slaughters a sheep, he must first sharpen the blade and stab. Some say to eat living flesh and discard dead blood—what was once hearsay is now proven true. This is cherishing the body and valuing life, knowing what harms and what benefits, and thus drawing near to the Dao.

If one mourns in houses of misfortune or illness, enters places of childbirth or taboo corpses, hears the lamentations of prisoners or sits in slaughterhouses awash with blood, or even binds oneself in unlawful fetters, all these scatter the spirit in terror.

Little do they know that original qi lodges in the human body like mist in the grass. Even the most careful guardian has no master for a hundred years. Nurture it, and it remains; disturb it, and it scatters. Scattered, it causes dizziness; severely so, one collapses.

Those who courageously nurture original qi possess bodies and minds of penetrating clarity, hearts filled with solid sincerity. They have thoughts and compassion, resolve and fortitude. Even when tasting great bitterness, severing an arm, or cutting off a foot, their original qi hides in concealment, their countenance unchanged—suddenly, they die. Or in a single joy or anger, they perish. Yet if they live, their spirit remains undispersed. Those who cannot nurture it are vulgar, shallow, and ignorant, clinging to delusions and retreating from insight. Full of taboos and easily deceived, their qi has no steadfast abode, their spirit no silent dwelling. Some, through sorrow or rage, even take their own lives—how utterly foolish!

Now, the essentials of original qi: that which is guarded within is called *upright qi*, *Grain Spirit*, *nature and life*. The remaining qi that responds externally is called *vast qi*, *responsive spirit*, *voice and appearance*.

Thus, the *Wang Shuhe Pulse Classic* states: "If the responsive spirit moves, the hun and po rest within, and the life-giving pulse does not cease—this is the movement of the responsive spirit’s point. As long as the life pulse remains, one does not die."

Therefore, Laozi said: "Nature and life are ever-present." The Buddha said: "Voice and appearance are all empty." The one speaks of the internal, the other of the external.

Yet deluded followers, failing to fathom profound principles, mistakenly point to the Buddha’s teachings, seeking the bliss of extinction. How could they know the words from the *Analects*: "When the bird is about to die, its song is mournful; when a man is about to die, his words are kind"—how lamentable! Alas!

The sages and worthies of old spoke of the Dao’s boundlessness, expounded the *Yi Jing*’s Supreme Polarity, discoursed on astronomy and geography, mastered the arts of archery, calligraphy, and mathematics, or traced the waxing and waning of the myriad things—yet most did not ground their teachings in primordial qi. When it came to exhausting principle and fulfilling nature, the very point where true work begins, they merely floated in vague talk of the constant Dao, refusing to take responsibility. What use are such hollow words, like disjointed bones and sinews, loosely bound together, all offering no benefit to self-cultivation?

Thus, Mencius spoke only of "nurturing the vast and flowing qi," while Zhuangzi contented himself with "delighting in the responsive and manifest spirit," as if utterly unaware of primordial qi’s truth—could this truly be called knowing the Dao?

Those who speak directly of primordial qi affirm the One. This One is what the Three Powers (Heaven, Earth, Man) share in common, the foundation of life itself. There is substance, there is form—this is the original face of self and other, the root to which the ten thousand methods return. Returning to the source to recover life is but the One in its manifold expressions. Beginning with the One, all cycles of advance and retreat remain the One—how could it bear a second name? Hence the teaching of pointing to the One and returning to primordial qi.

Inheriting the master’s oral instructions, moved by the fivefold harmony of the western rhyme:

*The Secret of Golden Fluid and Returned Elixir*:
Within the void, a child is nurtured.
Once the master’s touch awakens,
Thrice sigh the world’s unknowing.
Guard and return—spirit comes home to me,
Joined with Qian in daily use.
Meet no one to ask of the Way,
But taste the single dose of the knife’s edge.

Forging the sword of pure Yang,
Geng-metal’s hardness serves its purpose.
Yielding yet opposing mercury,
Unbending must add lead.
Crossing the sea, sinking or not,
Passing the pass—profound, again profound.
The immortal fears no restraint,
Hanging his girdle, he ascends to heaven.

Daoist lineages divide into pure and turbid,
Erroneous transmissions corrupt the principle.
Inquire of herbs: old or tender?
Furnace and cauldron: Yin or Yang?
Dragon and tiger know their birthplace,
Husband and wife easily lose heart.
Twelve years to refine the cinnabar,
The great medicine weighs a catty of gold.

At chaos’ first division, the birth,
Heaven and Earth’s qi began green.
Rejoice—not a minor path,
Yet pity those who revile its form.
The two luminaries revolve around the crucible,
The five sprouts house the ten thousand spirits.
The yearly elixir is named here,
The scriptures and secrets recorded in the *Huangting*.

To complete life, one needs the golden crucible,
Without spirit, there is still spirit.
Yi meets Geng at Xin’s port,
Na Jia flirts with Xin.
Outer medicine easily disorders nature,
Inner elixir rarely rescues poverty.
From afar, I hear of Tang’s Lü,
Who vowed to deliver a thousand souls.

*The Valley Spirit* concludes its third scroll.
