**The Supreme Mystery of the Eight Radiant Registers**

In the first year of the Supreme August Era, on the second day of the ninth month, the Later Sage Lord Li journeyed to the Western River. Surveying the eight directions, he encountered the Primordial Celestial King riding an eight-radiance jade chariot, drawn by nine-hued dark dragons and three-pure flying clouds. Preceded by a procession of immortals, they bore flowered banners, while lions and white cranes chanted harmoniously, floating through the void to assemble above the Western River.

Lord Li bowed deeply and inquired of the Celestial King: "Formerly, I received the celestial script and jade graphs of the twenty-four diagrams, yet though I grasped their text, I did not fathom their wondrous verses. Though diagrams and eulogies exist, their forms remain absent—practicing them in obscurity, their profound principles elude clarity. Now, encountering the Heavenly Worthy, my joy is beyond words. I humbly beseech your completion of this Way, that its truth may be perfected."

Thereupon, he was instructed to purify himself with a thousand-day fast, suffuse his body with five fragrances, and face east to ingest the talisman. Once his form and spirit were fully manifested, all would become thoroughly illuminated, and every doubt instantly resolved.

Lord Li bowed again, reverently accepting the celestial decree. Strictly adhering to the heavenly rites, he observed a thousand-day fast, faced east to ingest the talisman, and beheld the gods of the Three Regions and Eight Radiant Ones within his body. The twenty-four diagrams of golden script and jade graphs appeared luminously in the void, their radiant colors and brilliance boundless, their intricate details naturally unfolding.

At that moment, he summoned the immortal overseer of the diagrams to render them in illustration. Golden script and purple characters, jade texts and cinnabar verses—thus were the sounds formed. From the Supreme Nine-Light Perfected Lady of the Upper Prime of the Southern Culmen, the Eastern and Western Twin Flowers, the Northern and Southern Perfected Lords, the immortals of the Five Peaks, and the Pure Void Perfected Ones, all received the true texts. These were the very diagrams drawn by the Later Sage, each duly appended.

In the first year of the Vermilion Brightness, on the first *yin* day of the first month, at the hour of noon, the heavens shone with fourfold brilliance, purple clouds coiled through the sky, the Eight Assemblies of the Empyrean rejoiced, numinous winds swept away dust, sun and moon exhaled radiance, the five stars poured forth their essences, heaven and earth were steeped in twilight mists, fragrant blossoms rained down, rivers and seas stilled, mountains and peaks concealed their vapors. The Five Sufferings were all dissolved, the Three Paths released their souls, the Nine Dark Realms ceased their torments, the gates of eternal night swung open, the deaf and blind regained hearing and sight, the Six Afflictions were all healed, the Earth Treasury unsealed, gold and jade revealed their forms, white bones quickened with qi, decayed remains returned to life, dragon scales leapt and danced, birds and beasts soared in joy. The Three Realms knew enduring bliss, humans and spirits rejoiced as one.

On this day of great celebration, the myriad kalpas were renewed. The Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning extended his hospitality upon the Jade Terrace. In the Vermilion Brightness Heaven, upon the Southern Fire Peak, within the Cinnabar Numinous Grotto Palace, he unfurled the Five Colors, fashioned an altar of yellow gold, and spread a foundation of white silver. The Seven Treasures proclaimed the numinous, and he transmitted the *Cavern Mystery Golden Writ of the Purple Script and Vermilion Chapters of Spontaneous Numinous Charts*, along with the Twenty-Four Perfected and the Three Divisions’ Radiant Spirits, the Heavenly Immortals, Flying Immortals, Divine Immortals, and Earthbound Immortals, their legions of troops and mounts, to the Supreme Peerless Dao Lord. Following the solemn protocols and mysterious statutes, he illuminated the true ordinances and scriptures, initiating ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine individuals whose names were inscribed in gold, whose characters were arrayed across the heavens—those destined to ascend as immortals.

At the conclusion of the great kalpic cycle, the texts shall be gathered and returned to the Seven Treasures Mysterious Terrace of the Great Canopy’s Purple Tenuity Palace. Now, as the Three Caverns govern the kalpic flow and the Numinous Treasure’s Lower Teaching prevails, the vacancies among the celestial offices of the ascending immortals must first be filled by those of middling worth to complete the ranks of the Black Emperor’s Perfected of the Nine Heavens.

The Master of the Northern Peak, Lord Ju, formerly received the teachings in the *Xu* year, on the thirteenth day of the ninth month, at the Southern Grotto of the Central Heaven, from the Master of the Central Peak, Lord Yang. As he was destined to initiate others, those whose names were preordained in the golden registers and jade records, whose natures aligned with perfection, were to be selected to fill the celestial offices, traversing the Eight Poles and arriving from the midst of the Void.

Now, the destined life of the Vermilion Emperor’s Perfected, so-and-so, born in the *bing-wu* year, whose fate is governed by the Southern Emperor of the Cinnabar Heaven, born in the seventh month, imbued with the primordial qi of the Plain Heaven’s destiny, whose bones and fate align with the immortal perfected, is to fill the office of Second-Rank Immortal of the Cavern Mystery. In this year, on such-and-such a day of such-and-such a month, within such-and-such a heaven, in accordance with the ancient ordinances of the former master’s luminous and true great method, he ascends the Yellow Altar. The Seven Treasures secure the numinous, the Five Colors attest to his immortality, and he is initiated into the boundless *Spontaneous Numinous Treasure Cavern Mystery Golden Writ*, the *Purple Script and Vermilion Chapters of Jade Text*, the *Charts of the Twenty-Four Perfected and Three Eights’ Divisions*, and the divine immortals’ mounts.

Having received the great method, he is acclaimed by the Three Realms. The numinous demons safeguard his clarity, his person traverses the Five Paths, his name is inscribed in the Golden Tablets and Jade Records of the Purple Palace. His rank ascends to Perfected Immortal, and he roams freely, clad in the celestial regalia of feathered robes. He ascends upon clouds, borne by dragon-drawn chariots, preceded by the Three Sevens’ colored standards, heralded by phoenix songs, followed by the Heavenly Chime. The Five Emperors open the Way, the Supreme Ultimate attends his chariot, immortal youths and jade maidens scatter blossoms and burn incense, jeweled canopies trail their tassels, encircling and protecting his journey. Harmonious qi fills him to abundance, and he ascends to the immortal palaces.

He must observe proper conduct in movement and stillness, guard his speech, and be vigilant in his actions. He must cast aside all worldly entanglements, sever extraneous thoughts, calm his mind, and embrace silence, focusing his will solely upon the method. He must not allow turbidity, nor incite others to distraction, lest he disrupt the true qi. In all his actions, he must practice great compassion, broadly delivering all beings, ensuring the nation’s peace and the people’s prosperity, unifying the Four Seas in tranquility. His seven generations of ancestors and parents shall all ascend and be delivered, his person shall enter luminosity, and he shall be reborn early among humankind. When the great kalpic cycle turns, he shall ascend together to the Supreme Clarity, carefree in the Seven Treasures Grove of the Golden Portals.

Those not yet initiated as immortals must complete seven years of the method’s practice, until their celestial qi is fully prepared. When the celestial signs proclaim that one’s destiny aligns with perfection, the transmission shall proceed in accordance with the ordinances. If one lacks numinous resonance, the teachings must not be disseminated for forty thousand kalpas. Should one betray the covenant or leak the sacred texts, their parents in life and death shall be eternally confined to the dark night, and their person shall perish amidst the Five Paths’ winds and blades for ten thousand kalpas.

Without daring to speak further, he adheres to the ordinances and upholds the precepts, uniting with the immortal host in life and death, all in accordance with the *Luminous and True Scriptures*.
