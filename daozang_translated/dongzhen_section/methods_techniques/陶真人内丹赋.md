**Author:** Daoist Tao Zhí of the late Tang and Five Dynasties period.
**Preface and Commentary:** Both written by the same hand.
**Original Intent:** The work was composed on the Dao of refining external *Dān* (elixir), yet it mistakenly addresses internal alchemy, hence its proper name should have been *Jīndān Fù* (Treatise on Golden Elixir).
**Volume:** One.
**Source:** *Zhèngtǒng Dàozàng* (Orthodox Daoist Canon), *Dòngzhēn* (Cavern of the True) section, *Fāngfǎ* (Methods) category.

**Ertao Ren’s Treatise on Inner Alchemy**

Man is born of the *Wǔxíng* (Five Phases) *Qì* (Qi), and his form is nourished by the *Sìxiàng* (Four Symbols) *Jīng* (Essence). He draws from the exhaustion of rivers and seas to prolong his life, and from the waning of sun and moon to invigorate his spirit. Thus, the Sage harmonizes gold with jade, refines stone to mend the heavens, and cultivates the *Tǐyòng* (Body-Mind) in its primal radiance—seeking to emulate the grandeur of sun and moon.

Now, the Great Elixir of the Dragon and Tiger (the union of *Yīnyáng* forces) is the position where the South and North converge, born of the primordial *Yuán* (Origin) *Èr Sān* (Two and Three). It bears the name of East and West’s mutual ingress, as the *Wǔxíng* (Five Phases) merge into singular unity. The hues of blue, red, white, and black each govern the four cardinal directions; above and below are in perfect accord, radiating to all eight directions. The Five Sovereigns (*Wǔdì*) are established, the Three Powers (*Sāncái*) manifest their symbols, and all things take form.

The sixty-four *guà* (hexagrams) and their *yáo* (lines) are applied, the twenty-eight *sù* (lunar lodges) align with their degrees, contained within the seventy-two *hòu* (phenomenal phases) and the three hundred and sixty *xún* (solar terms). It begins with *Yuánsāng* (Primordial Yang) and ends at *Huìlà* (the final lunar phase of the year).
Hence the *Sūtra* (Scripture) states: *"By merging with the virtue of Heaven and Earth, and the luminosity of sun and moon."*

In spring and summer, growth and flourishing advance, all derived from the Four Seasons (*Sìshí*). In autumn and winter, retreat and dormancy prevail—how could this be separate from the cyclical *Yùn* (Movement)?
*Qián* (Heaven) is long in *Gèn* (Mountain), *Sūn* (Wind), and its form, as rigidness transforms into softness. *Kūn* (Earth) is generated by *Zhèn* (Thunder) and *Duì* (Lake) in their shapes, as the feminine returns to the masculine position.

Yet, when the functions of *Yīnyáng* (Yin-Yang) first manifest, the sun and moon exchange their breaths in mutual sighs. Thus, the *Lǐ* (Ritual) *Nǚ* (Female) separates from the *Kǎn* (Abyss) *Nán* (Male), and the *Jīn* (Metal) *Fū* (Husband) from the *Mù* (Wood) *Fù* (Wife). Their *Jīngqì* (Essence-Qi) is refined, and their marrow and sinews are tempered—ten months of labor yield a complete transformation of the spirit.

Its essence becomes a fluid, congealing like the pure frost of frozen ice, or like snow when carved. Now, the principles of *Qiān* (Lead) and *Gǒng* (Mercury) are distinguished, and the sources of water and fire are first verified. The quintessences of the two *Xiàng* (Symbols) are combined, and the vital substances of the Five Phases are extracted. Thus, the Sage delves into the characters of sun and moon, penetrating the obscure and fathoming the dark.

He exhausts the Five Phases of metal and water, transcending the mundane to attain the sacred.
The *Cān* (Commentary) states: *"Sun and moon are the foundation of the *Yì* (Changes), embodying the balance of rigid and yielding."* This refers to the three substances of water, earth, and metal—does the resolute scholar not recognize his own nature?

To reach the ultimate truth, one must:
- Clarify the hexagrams of the *Lǐ* (Ritual) *Guà* (Hexagram),
- Deeply grasp the interplay of *Yīnyáng*,
- Discern celestial phenomena,
- Seek the essence of the *Yì* (Changes),
- Adjust the fire’s intensity,
- Balance life and death,
- Ensure purity in the external forms,
- Harmonize the inner and outer responses.

The *Sānyuán Zhōushén Lùn* (Discourse on the Three Cycles and Divine Manifestations) states: *"To understand the medicine, first understand oneself."* Realizing this single phrase reveals the myriad transformations.

If Heaven and Earth undergo change, and the male and female forces contend in their courses—if similar yet divergent, or dark and light intermingle—it is like ascending the stars with a ladder, or attempting to fish a whale with a suspended needle. Fortune smiles upon those worthy scholars who scrutinize and elucidate these truths—I dare not err in the sacred Dao!

The Way is spontaneous and natural—this is the primal *qi*. The primal *qi* is the void and boundless *qi* of Heaven and Earth. The void and boundless *qi* of Heaven and Earth gives rise to all things, marking the origin of the Mysterious Unity. Those who study the Elixir refine this *qi*; obtaining the void and boundless *qi* is called the True-One’s natural Way, the source of all transformations.

The *Laozi* says: *"The formless cannot be named or described, so it is forcibly called Dao."* The Way of holding to the One is the natural *qi*—this is the mercury. The worthy scholar need only follow the method to refine it: from nothingness to substance, shedding the mortal coil to reveal the True-One—this is the natural Way.

The art distinguishes true and false:
The true is lead, refined into mercury, which is called the True-One, also White Gold, belonging to the *xī* (west) direction of the *duì* (trigram). The vulgar do not grasp the True-One’s Way; they refine lead, seeking its truth, yet the substance is buried—how could the true emerge? Thus the Classic says: *"Do not destroy my lead, lest my life be forfeit."*

The Way of seeking the true form:
It draws upon the Three Lights above and responds to the Three Talents below. When the Six Harmonics are complete, transformations are boundless—this is the True-One’s Way.

The false arises from those who pursue immortality without studying the Classics, without guidance from a master, fabricating methods on their own. They take ordinary mercury and, without proper method, arbitrarily apply yin and yang, attempting to make the supreme elixir—thus failing. Li Cheng says: *"How could ordinary lead and mercury be mistaken for the supreme elixir?"* Not conforming to Heaven and Earth, they misuse clarity, causing yin and yang to clash, disrupting cold and heat—how could they not use false methods and later lament?

Thus the Classic says: *"The shallow and profound, the wise and foolish, the true and false—these have existed since antiquity."*

The method follows the Two Principles—Heaven and Earth.
Taking symbols from the Eight Trigrams,
The Great Elixir transforms and revolves, its body and structure adhering to these symbols.
The circulation of metal and water aligns with the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions, harmonizing with the Eight Trigrams to form the Eight Trigrams.
Every forty-five days completes one phase—this is one trigram.
A year has three hundred sixty days, with eight phases of forty-five days, hence the Eight Trigrams are taken as symbols.
From the *Taiyi* to the manifest, the Eight Trigrams are also the symbols of the sun and moon.

To open and distinguish Heaven and Earth—
*"Open"* means to establish.
To clarify Heaven and Earth’s distinctions—
Heaven and Earth’s positions are the cauldron’s tripod.
First discuss the tripod, then the elixir; once Heaven and Earth’s positions are set, the revolutions of the Celestial Cycle are defined.

Cold and heat are harnessed, yin and yang contend—
Timing must not miss the seasons; this is taking symbols.
To blend the transformations of yin and yang—
Yin and yang are *qi*; just and yielding are forms.
Thus the worthy scholar follows this pattern, with water and fire as masters.
Their separation has its time; only then can one discern the transformations of yin and yang.

The *Tongxuan Lun* states: *"This is the mother of Heaven and Earth—sand and mercury."*

Pointing to the trigram *Kàn* and weaving with the Classic,
*Kàn* is metal, positioned in the west.
*Kūn* is water, yet it is also metal.
Water and fire, the two substances, circulate and return, entering and exiting, bending and extending—their forms.
Guo Zhenren says: *"The west is bound as the weft; the *jiǎ* position is the binding."*
*Jiǎ* is the first of the Ten Heavenly Stems; *jiǎ* is the divine child, the first of the Twelve Divine Ones.
Pairing *jiǎ* with *zǐ* (child), hence it is called the weft.
It corresponds to the south and north, taking and discarding.
Thus the song says:
*"Pick the south, take the north,
Child and Mother contend.
Turn north to west,
Pairing husband and wife—
This is not empty."*

Thus the elixir stone, one substance, bears only yin—
This is called taking and discarding.
The *Shìfáng* constellation leaps upon the Azure Dragon—
*Shìfáng* is the *jiǎ* mansion, so mercury resides in the *Fáng* star.
The *Fáng* star belongs to the *mǎo* (east), green in hue—
Wood is born of water, and water belongs to the north, black in hue.
Green and black are called Azure, hence the Azure Dragon.
Zhang spreads its wings like a White Horse’s belt—
*Zhāng* is the fire mansion of the south, symbolizing cinnabar.
This is the ancient immortals’ method of shedding its red aura,
Restoring its true nature—
Called "cinnabar that has shed its body," also White Sand,
Or White Horse Tooth.
Thus the black-and-yellow forms—
Heaven and Earth—
As the substance of vessels, their sinews are mercury,
Their bones are silver.
Under the influence of fire-*qi*, gold and water naturally shed their lead,
Gradually purifying impurities.
On the vessel, they fly and circulate,
Dispelling stagnation and adding mist—light and unrestrained.

They dwell in rocky crevices, straddle mountains, overlook rivers.
Mercury in the cauldron, submerged by metal and water,
Under roasting and boiling, surges and bubbles, unable to settle,
Gradually forming flowers above,
Or gathering into a mass—
Dwelling in rocky crevices, hidden in valleys.
Or lying dormant in the pan, like the form of mountains.
Observing the sun’s radiance and the moon’s hues,
This spans years and accumulates over time.
The sun’s radiance is mercury; the moon’s hues are gold.
Gold and mercury forming shape—
Not until the sun is full and the moon complete will it be achieved.

Thus a year governs twelve months, with three hundred sixty days.
Time accumulates into months, months into years,
Until one Celestial Cycle encompasses four thousand three hundred ten days,
Symbolizing the four thousand three hundred years of cosmic circulation.
Hence it is said: *"Spanning years and accumulating over time—*
The worthy scholar examines and verifies this,
Using the Great Elixir to pair yin and yang,
Creating cold and heat,
Yin consuming yang, yang nourishing yin—
The Returned Elixir does not submit to the Four Seasons and Five Phases unless their symbols are taken.

To exhaust the workings of transformation,
To follow Heaven’s time and serve Heaven.
To exhaust the Way of yin and yang,
To know the source of transformation.
The Master says: *"*

Know the source of transformation—then you know the **Divine** *(shén)*.

Thus the Eight Trigrams are performed:
Father and son, lord and minister,
Hard and soft paired in harmony,
Ranked by their high and low,
The Six Pitches completed in cycle,
Uniting to form the Great Dao.
The Five Phases and Six Pitches are fixed,
Seventy-two Constellations, forty-five nodes,
The Twenty-four Qi marked by water clocks,
Great and small determined—
Then chanting the Three Powers *(Tiān-Dì-Rén)*,
Taking symbols from Heaven and Earth.

The *Cān* *(参)* says: *"Exhaust the Divine to know transformation."*
Thus the Sage follows *for* *(fǎ)* as the Way of Heaven—
No other meaning exists.

At first, male and female pair in union,
At last, soaring they ascend as Immortals.
*Begin* means *initial*—
The *Cān* says: *"When the beginning is upright, the end is clear;
The *Gān* *(干)* is not yet firm."*

This is the male mercury and female gold,
The precious pair configured as medicine,
Fit for internal ingestion.
*Soaring* refers to the *Jūquè* *(朱雀)* mercury.

Obtained, it lingers in hesitation—
Inheriting qi, it gradually ascends as fire,
Named the *Zhèngyáng* *(正阳)* Elixir.

There are those beyond things,
Whose nature inherits Heaven’s purity,
Embracing the harmonious *chōnghé* *(冲和)* essence,
Disgusted by the world’s clamor and dust.

Master Wú Yún said:
*"The Immortal is what people admire.
Death is what people detest.
Thus, if the spirit is not pure and the bones not refined,
It is not because they lacked the yang spirit’s breath—
Nor did they lack the yearning for Immortality."*

Those who yearn for Immortality,
At the moment of receiving breath,
Encounter the *Chángshēng* *(长生)* constellation,
And meet the *Yángwáng* *(阳王)* office—
Thus, human nature inherits Heaven’s purity,
Rising beyond things,
Serene and pure, the body harmonious, the spirit clear,
Disgusted by the world, abandoning the dust.

To seek the method of non-death,
To find the secret of prolonged life,
To grasp the essence of the Golden Elixir,
To penetrate the profound and mysterious truth—

The method of non-death originates from the Yellow Emperor and Laozi.
Laozi’s *Danjīng* *(丹经)*,
The secret of prolonged life is the *Cāntóng Qì* *(参同契)* and *Jīnbì Jīng* *(金碧经)*.

If a worthy scholar obtains this text,
First, they must report to the Three Officials *(Sān Guān)* above,
And to the Land and Soil True Lords *(Tǔdì Zhēnjūn)* below.
Then, they must bathe and purify their heart,
Burn incense in a cold chamber,
Study and verify it—
Only then will their mind open, enlightened,
And the True Essence *(Zhēnyuán)* be revealed.

Scholars of the Dao must seek teachers and friends widely,
Requesting even the minutest clarifications—
Never act recklessly.

Thus, *yǎoyǎo míngmíng* *(杳杳冥冥)*—
Within its depths lies the essence.
*Yǎomíng* *(杳冥)* is the appearance of dark, mysterious black.
Within it lies the essence—*yín* *(银)*.
The essence is *gǒng* *(汞)*.

This is silver hidden in the Great Yin,
Only receiving the breath of the Great Yang,
Nourished by warmth over time,
Its form concealed, lurking within the Great Yin.
When its root sprouts and its vitality is complete,
It is called *Fùhuǒ Shuǐyín* *(伏火水银)*.

Again, *yǎomíng* is the appearance of the unrefined.
It is as if it is, yet not—
Not seen, yet visible.
Thus the Classic says:
*"In mysterious darkness, the spirit condenses—
Lead does not reveal its crudeness,
Mercury does not show its form."*

The Returned-to-the-Yang Master says:
*"Lead receives the blind acid—
Thus, wrapped in coarse cloth, it holds jade.
Gold inherits the mercury’s armor,
Its embryo enters the water through hesitation."*

Infusing the *Jīnhuā* *(金花)* with its breath,
Examining the two names of water and fire.

Master Guó *(郭真人)* says:
*"First, melt the *Jīnhuā* into water,
Use another vessel to warm the mercury and pour it into the pool.
Its color congeals white,
Its form resembles lead’s *sū* *(苏)*—
This is also called *sìfǒu* *(伺否)."*

The *Yīqì* *(一气)* is the True One—
One transformation receives the talisman,
The position of the Green Dragon,
Bound by the *Shuāngfāng* *(束方)* and *Zhèn* *(震)*.

*Zhèn* belongs to Wood,
Wood generates Fire—this is mercury.
Earth can generate Metal—this is Yin silver.

Thus it is said: *"Examine the two names of water and fire."*

Distribute the Four Symbols,
Refine the Five Phases,
Summon the sun’s soul and call the moon’s shadow,
Follow the tiger’s nature and harmonize with the dragon’s emotions.

Master Lǐ Chéng *(李澄)* said:
*"The characters *jīn* *(金)* and *mù* *(木)*,
The four symbols of *Kǎn* *(坎)* and *Lí* *(离)*,
Are the body of the urgent medicine.
Lead and mercury are the gate of profound mystery,
The root of the Returned Elixir."*

This refers to the Green Dragon, White Tiger,
Vermilion Bird, and Dark Tortoise—
The Four Symbols.
When the Four Symbols are complete, the Five Phases are fulfilled.

The Twenty-eight Constellations circle Heaven,
The sun and moon align in measure—
The dragon breathes to the tiger,
The tiger inhales the dragon’s breath—
Their natures and emotions harmonize,
The sun and moon complete their cycles—
Is this not the Four Symbols and Five Phases refined?

From this, the *Yì* *(易)* demonstrates its mechanism,
The *Sháo* *(杓)* star sets its position,
Following the *Jī-Dǒu* *(箕斗)* to disperse its hues.

Master Lǐ Chúnfēng *(李淳风)* said:
*"The Northern Dipper’s seven stars,
Near the *Zǐwēi* *(紫微)* office,
Located north of *Tàiwéi* *(太微)*,
Called the Imperial Chariot—
It issues commands,
Its movement governs the center,
Overseeing the four directions.
It establishes the Four Seasons,
Balances the Five Phases,
Adjusts the nodes,
Fixes all divisions—
All tied to the Dipper.
Its *kuí* *(魁)* is the *Xuánjué* *(璇玑)*,
Its handle has three—
The *Yùhéng* *(玉衡)*.
The text says:
*'Xuánjué and Yùhéng,
To harmonize the Seven Governors.'*

*Jī-Dǒu* are the positions of *yín-wèi* *(寅巳)*,
Fire arises here—
The *Jiǎ* *(甲)* disperses its hues.

Connecting *Mián* *(绵)* and *Gèn* *(艮)* to *Duì* *(兑)*,
*Gèn* is Mountain, *Duì* is Marsh.
The *Yì* says:
*'In Heaven, it forms symbols;
On Earth, it forms shapes—
Transformation is revealed.'*

Master Hàn Kāngbó *(韩康伯)* said:
*'Symbols refer to the sun, moon, and stars;
Shapes refer to mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees.
Suspended symbols revolve,
Creating darkness and light.
Mountains and marshes communicate qi—
Thus clouds and rain descend,
Flowing in endless cycles,
Qi circulates above and below—
This meaning is profound."*

Apply *xíng* *(刑)* and *dé* *(德)* together,
Hard and soft unite,
Entering the Central Palace,
Returning to *Wù-Jǐ* *(戊己)*.

*Bò* *(播)* means *to apply*.
*Xíng* governs yin destruction,
*Dé* governs yang mercury—
Thus hard and soft naturally unite,
Entering the Central Palace,
Returning to *Wù-Jǐ*—
The Earth position,
Named *Huángdì Shēngchù Xuánlì* *(黄帝生处玄立)*.

It can also subdue water and silver,
Thus the Dark is concealed.

The *Jīnbì Jīng* says:
*"To govern the Great Peace,
Together with the Central Palace Earth."*

The *Cān* says:
*"The three substances belong to one family,
All returning to *Wù-Jǐ*."*

The three substances are water, fire, and metal.
Then, through nine returns, its forms transform,
Seven refineries reveal its beauty.

Nine corresponds to the *Qián* (乾) hexagram—
The *Wǔ-Jǐ* (么几) Dragon takes its station.

Seven corresponds to the *Kūn* (坤) hexagram—
The Flying Dragon ascends to Heaven.

The Sage’s transformation:
The *Wǔ-Jǐ* Dragon meets regret—
A calamity of exhaustion.
Thus, one returns from the Nine to the Seven.

The adept of cultivation must grasp the hexagrams,
Bending and stretching, motion and stillness,
Emergence and retreat, unfolding and coiling,
Ascension and descent, advance and withdrawal—
Each has its paired correspondence.
Only then, by holding to the One and refining the True,
Does the principle of *Jiāo-Tài* (交泰) reveal its splendor—
The timely pairing of male and female.

Circulating water and fire to nourish each other,
The *Cān* says:
*"Its origin lies in copulation,
Fixed to bring forth life."*

With *Kǎn* (坎) as male and *Lí* (离) as female paired,
The Sun resides in the Moon’s abode,
Their essence subtly mingling.
Exhausting the *qi* yields the *yá* (牙) and *niè* (蘗).

The *Yì* says:
*"The Sun and Moon revolve—
One cold, one warm.
The Dao of *Qián* forms the male,
The Dao of *Kūn* forms the female.
*Qián* knows the Great Beginning,
*Kūn* completes the things."*

Thus, the Sun and Moon employ the functions of Heaven and Earth,
Gold and water merge their essences,
Water and fire circulate and transform,
Returning to exhaust the *yīyuán* (一元) *qi*.
The *yīyuán*—sixty days—
Four *xī* (熙) complete.

The *Qì* says:
*"The first year is the hidden *yá*."*

From inner sincerity to outer harmony—
Inner is metal, outer is water.

Metal and water seek to act,
Following the laws of yin and yang,
Using the *guà* (卦) and *yáo* (爻) for timing.
Inner is three yang lines,
Outer is three yin lines.
When in yang times, seek the outer from within.
When in yin times, seek the inner from without.
Metal within is the direct symbol of spring and summer,
Water without is the direct symbol of autumn and winter.
The interplay of inner and outer
Draws its analogy from the *guà*.
Then it is made profound—
And again profound.
The profound is the *Xuányuán* (玄元).
As the *Tàishàng* divides one *qi* into two meanings,
The two meanings are Heaven and Earth.
Earth, cleaving one *qi* into true essence,
Is called *Zhēnyī* (真一), thus it is the true profound.
Again, the profound—
This is transforming white into gold,
Gold being the supreme treasure,
Hence, "profound again profound."

The *Jīng* says:
*"Those who practice *yǎnshì* (衍士) and alchemical nourishment
Shall attain longevity.*
Metal’s nature does not decay,
Thus it is the treasure of all things.
Not common metal—
Metal, when transformed,
Becomes the dragon spiraling east by fire,
The tiger turning west by water.
The tiger sheds its shell and discards its offspring,
The dragon departs from *bǐng* (丙) to summon rain.

Mount *Cuīmò* (崔昤) says:
Its spirit transforms into liquid,
Congealed, it becomes mercury—
Like frost shimmering, resembling jade railings.
The pure essence flows crystalline,
Its light and shadow like stars and drills.
Refined ten thousand times, its form remains constant—
From non-being to being, destroyed yet reborn,
From being to non-being, extinguished yet revived.
Yin and yang unite,
Yin and yang merge,
Endlessly transforming, becoming the essence of things.
The sage refines it a hundred times to attain *tōnglíng* (通灵).
Endless return—this is called *huándān* (还丹).

Another song says:
*The Five Phases invert and spread,
The dragon emerges from fire’s embrace.*
*The Five Phases act disorderly,
The tiger is born from water.*
This reveals the method of the supreme elixir,
Where yin and yang contend,
The Five Phases clash and reign in turn.
*Qi* first appears white and black, then yellow,
Beginning with water and fire, ending with earth.
This is the form of metal and water,
Acting from *Fù* (复), until the tenth month completes *Kūn* (坤),
Transforming its segments—
First white, then yellow,
Red and black intertwined,
Each returning to its root—
Its essence is the Great *Huándān*.

Fire first—
Fire’s count is two, water’s count is one.
Fire extinguished,
The four seasons converge into one *qi*,
Fifteen days, twenty-four *qì* (气),
Giving birth to all things.
*Huándān* mirrors water and fire creating all things,
Drawing upon Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang *qi*,
*Qi* balanced in hardness and softness,
Harmonized with the four seasons,
Unable to forge—
Then the Dao of *Zhēnyī* is complete.

Abandon the south, take the north,
*Jiǎyǐ* (甲乙) as ancestral roots.
The *Jīng* says:
*"Within yang is yin, within yin is yang.*
Yin within yang—
Sand produces mercury.
Mercury departs from yang,
Thus returning to the natural water of the north.
Water nourishes wood,
Wood resides in *jiǎyǐ*,
With fire as ancestral roots.
As it says: *Fire spiraling east becomes the dragon.*

Divine water, sacred stone,
The imperial male and female—metal and mercury.
Divine water is not the fermented brew of alcohol and vinegar,
Stone cannot be used.
This is yin-one controlling yang-one,
The meaning of *Huápó* (华池).
Hence, the imperial male and female—
The essence of the Three-One.

The Dao does not depart from *Xuányellow* (玄黄),
Guarding One while preserving the Three and Five.
The original Dao—mercury.
Heaven and Earth’s Three and Five *qi*.
Guarding One while preserving—
Not departing from mercury, already gold.
The determined scholar examines it meticulously,
Speaking of true principles.

From *qīngyāo* (青腰) to distant attainment,
*Xuánsù* (玄素) hooks the deep.
*Qīngyāo*—verdigris,
*Xuánsù*—gold,
The Green Dragon and White Tiger.
Hooking the deep—
The meaning of distant attainment.

Wind refers to the water of seven and eight,
Water generates the gold of nine and six.
Wind is yang *qi*.
From the fifteenth day onward, *Zhèn* (震) is active,
Mercury obtains metal *qi* and is drawn in,
Naturally harmonized.
Water generated—yin *qi*.
From the sixteenth day onward, it turns to *Xùn* (巽),
Softening hardness,
Thus metal dissipates,
Entering mercury and returning to the *Kūn* *guà*.

The *Cān* (参) says:
*"Seven and eight, fifteen days,
Six and nine correspond as well.*
This is the sixty-four *guà* of one month’s cycle.
Hardness without, softness within—
Inner yang, outer yin.
Hardness without—metal.
Softness within—mercury.
The *Jīng* says:
*'Yin is silver, yang is mercury.'*
Thus, inner yang and outer yin.

Another note says:
*'Hardness is *Qián* (乾), softness is *Kūn* (坤).'*
Yin and yang unite in virtue,
Hardness and softness have form.
Yin and yang are *qi*,
Hardness and softness are substance.
Drawing upon yin and yang to form metal and water,
Metal and water’s forms established,
Their substances merge and congeal into solidity—
This is transformation.
The Green Dragon leaps while the White Tiger lies low,
The Vermilion Bird flies while the Black Tortoise sinks.
The Green Dragon is the wood spirit,
The White Tiger is the metal spirit.
The *Jīng* says:
*'Cinnabar is wood essence,
Obtaining metal, they merge.*
Taking Heaven’s mercury,
Combining with Earth’s silver,
Gathering soul and spirit to form *huándān*.
Heaven’s *Xuán*, Earth’s *Huáng*,
Harmonizing cinnabar and mercury—
At the proper moment, both enter the divine chamber,
Refining this spirit essence,
Fire, earth, and metal circulating,
Balancing *Wén* (文) and *Wǔ* (武), swift and slow,
Responding to the *zhōnglǜ* (钟律).
The Vermilion Bird is fire, the south’s position.
The Black Tortoise is water, the north’s position.
Speaking of mercury—
Sometimes it flees, sometimes it flies,
From the south’s Vermilion Bird,
Through north’s water and fire.
Two waters merge, three times—east,
Green Dragon lead-water,
Thus it first leaps and subjugates the White Tiger.
The *Jīng* says:
*'Dragon-yang, odd numbers to the left,
Tiger-yin, even numbers to the right.'*
Thus, the sun scatters the central male,
The moon bewilders the maiden.
The sun—fire.
The central male—metal essence as moon,
Obtaining fire *qi* and self-dissipating,
Merging with mercury as one body,
Mercury transmitting metal *qi* and becoming confused,
Neither fleeing nor flying—
Called the moon bewildering the maiden.

The astonished maiden—mercury.
The central male—gold.

Wei Jun said:
Fire consumes gold, gold strikes wood to flourish—
Three and five unite with one,
The most refined essence of Heaven and Earth.

Earth is strong, metal is fierce—
Cold and heat alternate.
Earth is realgar, obtaining its position in the central official,
A general’s name.
It can lie prone in water,
Yet also generate gold.

Cold and heat alternate—
Igniting the martial and civil fires in due time.

The Dragon exhales, the Tiger inhales,
The Black Tortoise and Toad swallow and emit.
The Dragon is mercury,
The Tiger is gold,
The Black Tortoise and Toad are the essence of sun and moon.

When gold and mercury obtain the *qi* of fire and water,
Within the crucible they transform—
High and low in form,
Operating the civil and martial fires in play—
One ascends, one descends,
One bows, one rears.
Once the phases of emergence and concealment are fixed,
Swallowing and emitting follow their time—
Yellow and white are achieved,
Called *Jīnxīng* (金星, Golden Star) beautiful sand,
Or *Jùshèng* (巨胜, Great Victory) purple covering powder.

If not fully transformed,
That which lies concealed within gold is called *Jīnlóng Dān* (金龙丹, Gold Dragon Elixir),
Also named *Fúhuǒ Zǐfěn* (伏火紫粉, Concealed-Fire Purple Powder)—
Both are Great Return Elixirs.

South and North copulate in water and fire,
The Hare and Rooster revolve between the Child and Horse.
Mercury is the north’s position.
Fire is cinnabar, the south’s position.
The two directions come and go,
Each guarding its fixed nature.

Cold comes from the north,
Heat from the south—
Both act in their own time,
Returning to their original posts.

The Hare is eastern mercury,
The Rooster is gold-mercury,
Combining water and fire to return to the Child and Horse.

The *Zǐhéchē* (紫河车) Secret says:
Twelve months give birth to a child—
The Child and Horse are they.

Summarizing the strategies of Heaven and Earth,
The sovereign of effortless transformation.
Operating the *Qián* and *Kūn* hexagrams,
Each has its own strategy and numbers.
The *Qián* strategy’s yang lines—
Half a *zhǐ* yields six thousand nine hundred twelve.
The *Kūn* strategy’s yin lines—
Half yields four thousand six hundred eighty.
Together, they total eleven thousand five hundred twenty.

The sovereign is gold.
Gold as ruler, symbolizing the North Star.
When *Qián* and *Kūn* interact,
Their motion never ceases,
Yet at the poles, they do not shift.

Gold and water within the vessel,
Allowing water and fire to permeate naturally,
They spontaneously form the true body,
Effortlessly transforming in accordance with the nodes.

Mother and child are enclosed within the square and circle,
Nurtured and refined within the crucible and cauldron.
This is the gold method—
The world’s hasty folk cannot know it.

Mother and child are gold and mercury.
Gold and mercury are the internal and external symbols of *Kǎn* and *Lí*,
The method of the two *qi* interlocking,
Their union within the crucible.

Within the crucible, light expands and radiates,
Like the sun and moon in linked rings,
Within the six directions.
Water and fire are the medicines,
Heaven and Earth are the crucible,
Capable of regulating the square and circle—
The principle of the golden crucible.

The *Cān* (参) says:
*Kǎn* and *Lí*’s square and circle are the city walls.
The *Wǔxiàng Lèi* (五相类) says:
When the city walls are complete, figures thrive.
Indeed.

The world does not understand the golden crucible,
Often using gold, silver, lead, and flowers—
This is a great regret.

Measure the *zhūliǎng* (铢两) to determine the cycle,
Observe the *yáo* symbols to calculate the fire numbers.
Measuring *zhūliǎng*—
Six *zhū* make one *fēn*,
Four *fēn* make one *liǎng*,
One *liǎng* is twenty-four *zhū*,
One *jīn* totals three hundred eighty-four *zhū*—
Symbolizing the sixty-four hexagrams with three hundred eighty-four lines.

The cycle returns and amplifies,
Observing movement to determine the fire numbers.
The *Jīng* says:
Fire records are not false—
Performing the *Yì* to clarify it.

As for the two solstices opening and closing—
Winter solstice, summer solstice.
Yin and yang succeed each other,
From the Child to the Perch, yang is born,
From the Horse to the Rooster, yin is born.
Terminating at *Kūn*’s union and beginning at *Guàn*,
Rising at *Fù* and ending at *Lín*—
Pure *Qián* concludes,
Then from the initial nine, one variation begins.

Nine-two becomes three—
Three is *Pǐ* (否),
Nine-four is *Guān* (观),
Nine-five is *Bō* (剥),
Upper nine is *Kūn* (坤),
Nine returns to seven—
Fire-Heaven, Great Possession.

This is the completion of *Qián* and the beginning of retreat.

Again, placing the pure *Kūn* hexagram,
Following the previous from the lower position—
Initial six varies as *Fù* (复),
Two as *Lín* (临),
Six-three as *Tài* (泰),
Six-four as *Dàzhuàng* (大壮),
Six-five as *Yǒng* (央),
Upper six as *Xū* (需).
Eight returns to six, residing in the water-earth *Bǐ* (比).

Thus the *Jīng* says:
Rising at *Lín* and ending at *Qián*.

The flying dragon, the reclining moon—
The flying dragon is mercury,
The reclining moon is the vessel.
Upper and lower strings.

Li Cheng said:
Within the Green Dragon’s second eight and White Tiger’s center—
The eighth and twenty-third days,
Gold and water, half a *jīn* each.

Yellow gold, white snow—
Divine transformation naturally.
Yellow gold is the returned lead essence,
Congealing into purple powder,
Brilliant red—
Thus called yellow gold.
White snow is the flying and concealed mercury,
Its color like snow—
Thus called white snow.
This is the way of divine, natural transformation—
Taking it brings feathered ascension.

Fusing *Kūn* and *Gèn* to form earth,
*Kūn* is yin, *Gèn* is silver.
The *Sānpiān* says:
Gathering yin forms earth—indeed.

Gazing upward at *Qián* and *Duì* to form heaven.
*Qián* is yang, *Duì* is gold.
Tao Jun said:
Accumulating yang forms heaven—indeed.

The *Yì* says:
Mountain and marsh exchange *qi*.
Again it says:
What is the *qi* of Heaven and Earth not exchanging?
It is the form and substance each transforming.

Mother and child’s affection and sorrow,
Mutually governing their connection.
Mother and child’s affection and sorrow—
Lead is refined by mercury,
Mercury can conceal lead,
Lead and mercury unite—
The way of yellow and white is complete.

Silver originally comes from lead,
For lead embraces the child.
Concealing lead within silver,
Silver hidden within lead—
Thus they mutually govern their profound connection.

It is like a person in the Dao—
The Dao does not depart from the person.
Fish in water—
Water departs from the fish.
Fish without water die,
People without the Dao perish—
This is the profound principle of mutual governance.

One color, three and five—
Water stirs mist and cloud.
One is the True One.
Three is mercury.
Five is realgar, the earth.
The True One and earth are heavy yin substances—
Thus they do not receive flight.

Obtaining harmony with mercury,
It ascends—**flight** is achieved.
The **flight** manifests as frost powder,
Called *"water-stirred mist and cloud"*,
Also arising from the vessel.

The *Daoist* **True Person**’s *inner alchemy* **Preface** is complete.
