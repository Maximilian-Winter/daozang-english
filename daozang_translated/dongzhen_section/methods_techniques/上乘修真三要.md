**The Three Essential Methods of Superior Daoist Cultivation, Fascicle One**
*Recorded by Master Yuanming*

To hear of the vast and profound Supreme Dao is to return to the essence of mind and nature. Whether in substance or function, whether provisional or real, all must harmonize with the fundamental principle—this is the first truth.

Within the jade crucible, the fire is kindled; the spirit gathers, and the celestial wheel turns. Floating clouds are swept away, and thoughts align with the cyclical flow of *zi* and *wu*. As *qian* breathes and *kun* dissolves, this mirrors the workings of the sun and moon.

Heaven endures, earth persists—who would dare idle and squander time? A single moment is worth ten thousand taels of gold.

Those who attain the Dao traverse the world, yet struggle to find its manifestation in the daily lives of common folk. Only when the subtlest mysteries are fully realized, when both medicine and illness are transcended, does one arrive at the great path of cultivation.

**Three Methods Verse**

Recognize the rootless bandits—
these thieves are called the mind.
With a great shout, halt them;
the three methods are seized as one.

Hold firm at the perfect juncture,
and both sides grow strong.
Lift and strike at the heart—
the three methods are forgotten as one.

---

Four hooves race, the nature unturned;
the herdboy departs, and the horse’s thieving mind must be guarded.
Sever the fetters, lock the shackles—
once the mind strays, intent is hard to reclaim.
Among ten thousand, few can grasp the reins and rein it in.

This horse’s temperament is wild,
neighing and bolting east and west.
The herdboy chases behind,
yet the thieving mind remains unsecured.

At the first moment of leisure, release it—
lead it south of the village, unaware of the horse’s fright.
A single thought sends it galloping east or west,
in an instant, it covers two or three leagues.
Its form stumbles blindly into deep chasms.

Bound in the wilds,
the herdboy watches in hunger and vigil.
From afar, it neighs repeatedly—
seize it and never let it roam free.

This horse is so hard to capture—
though hobbled at neck and hooves, bound fast,
it cannot be held in check.
Its heart still unsecured, it roars and bolts again.
Tighten the halter, fasten the fetters,
yet its wild heart races with the wind,
turning its back on its true home.
Once gone, it vanishes without trace,
lost to the ends of the earth.

For its reckless intent, thirty lashes are ever due.
Do not mistake it for a fine steed—
its willful mind cannot be trusted.
A single thought follows the wind,
and where can even the wise find it?
Only when tamed does clarity come.

A stubborn horse is hard to teach,
rearing against the reins, biting its master.
Seize it, deliver thirty lashes—
then, with hands subdued, truth is revealed.
Bind its head, apply the whip without respite,
hold fast the rope’s end,
and frequently strike its back.
Tether it in an idle place,
and the herdboy’s watch becomes natural.

The herdboy’s grip must be twofold:
one hand wields the whip upon its back,
the other reins its heart with intent.
Yet even the herdboy cannot secure its will—
goodness does not come naturally.
Bareback, without saddle or bridle,
as soon as it is led to feed,
it snaps the purple silk reins,
kicks at the trough, and defies its master—
its wild heart utterly unruly.

Do not regard it with a casual glance.
It is no true beast—
do not mistake it for a fine horse.
A moment’s carelessness lets it slip,
and both households suffer the loss.

Its rampant, roaring nature races far,
swift as flight.
Give it thirty lashes—
then, with hands subdued, clarity comes.
Be single-minded and firm, not fierce or stubborn.
Tighten the bit, keep watch without rest.
If the herdboy’s care slackens,
both will be lost in confusion.

Do not employ this horse as a fine steed.
Though constantly tethered, it is never fed,
ridden all day with the whip.
Starved past midnight,
its true nature stirs faintly—
a fleeting joy, a hint of pleasure.

This horse’s nature is base,
yet it harbors the heart of a thousand-mile steed.
If the herdboy plays carelessly,
letting it slip from his grasp,
it is hardest to retrieve.
Let it run free, call it back—pay it no mind.
Abandon it in the wilds,
leave it to its own devices.
With a flick of the sleeve, stroll away humming,
then reclaim it and return it to its rightful home.

With sincere resolve, wave farewell to the evening’s song.
Keep constant watch, ever vigilant—
the herdboy leads it to the roadside.
Standing firm, not a step astray,
he ensures the fine horse’s nature remains untamed no more.

Wild grasses and cold springs are its only companions,
wild grasses its sole companion,
cold springs its nearest neighbor.
The fine horse stands by the stream,
while the herdboy’s true nature finds joy.
With raised brows and bright eyes, what awaits?

Leisurely, beyond worldly cares, he roams free,
playfully guiding it without restraint or pride.
Vast and clear, utterly at ease,
transcending even a single blade of straw.

Yet in an instant, the fine horse’s nature cannot be secured—
the willful steed strays day after day,
when will the herdboy find rest?
Seize it, never let it slip,
hold fast, and peace comes naturally.

Steal no idle moments, set no snares.
The herdboy’s song lingers, unceasing,
as he rides alone beyond worldly cares.
Flowing waters, empty mountains, clouds his companions—
returning, his heart is clear, joy without sorrow.

Leading it home, turning back,
he sings alone in the evening,
sighing at how fleeting time is.
With a wave of his hand, he returns to the woods and springs,
carefree beyond the world, letting years drift by.

The black horse with a silver head—its nature is no lie.
Born with a good and gentle disposition,
it does not betray the herdboy’s heart.
Leaning idly against a withered pine,
he hums in carefree ease.

The herdboy dances and sings, ever close by—
leading it to a cold pool to bathe,
its form gleaming, free of grime.
The herdboy dances and sings,
while the fine horse follows closely.
For a moment, body and mind find rest.

The fine horse takes the reins,
ready to repay its master’s kindness.

The Five Lights truly shine bright,
transcendent, standing alone above the crowd.
Longing to sing afar in joyous heights—
a red horse crosses the western river,
the herdboy stands on the bank.

Hold fast, do not let it pass,
strike it dead—what doubt remains?
Yet fear it may not be reined in when full.
The black horse gallops unrestrained,
the white ox is penned day by day.

At dawn, the herdboy ascends to the Purple Palace,
a pure breeze scatters across the sky.
Gradually, this beast settles into its true nature—
the white horse’s temper is gentle,
the herdboy need not rush.

Beneath the clear wind and bright moon,
he sits alone, refining the elixir’s formula.
Do not indulge in play—the horse’s heart is a thief.
Tether it in the formless to guard the unempty,
let go and gather, naturally inexhaustible.

How could a fine steed hinder a noble’s ambition?
Only for the blue-maned one to gather the Five Lights.
Against its will, the fetters break the hoof’s lock.
At leisure, beyond the world, it dances in spring’s breeze,
lifting the effortless, one finds self-exhaustion.

The Milky Way does not hinder flowing water’s passage,
the herdboy just then seeks the *Can Tong Qi*.
All prior efforts are undone, both hanging in vain.
Locked to the Pillar of Original Fate,
never left idle for a moment.

Starved until its coat is scorched and thin,
let it go—no need to watch.
Cast it aside in the wilds, no need to look back.
The white horse is tied to the numinous terrace,
the herdboy finds great joy.

You do not see it led away,
shedding its form, rising from the dust.
Idly gazing at green waters and blue mountains,
the horse grazes on ravine grass,
the herdboy rests in leisure.

At dusk, he returns to his old home,
pointing afar to the moon on the horizon.
When weary, he wanders alone to rest in the cliffs,
in weariness, he refines the elixir’s script,
at leisure, he dances a tune.

A long laugh beyond the wind’s reach,
the herdboy attains freedom.
Sitting, the red reeds grow two or three stalks.
The white horse with a blue mane—its Dao is not empty,
riding it, he seeks the *Can Tong Qi* beyond the world.

He intends to take a single drop of Kun’s essence,
and gather it into Qian’s treasury of mysteries.

The herdboy now knows the noble nature of the gentleman,
moonlight locks the clouded stream—
the herdboy dances and plays his flute.
Lift it swiftly, then set it down:
a thunderclap on level ground.

Beneath the clear shade, waters murmur.
The herdboy sits in solemn stillness,
the horse stands beneath the pines.
A woodcutter steps forward to ask,
the herdboy knows nothing at all.

Unfettered, free—no one inquires.
The fine steed rests in the forest,
the herdboy plays his flute beneath the crag.
Carefree, unbound by any realm,
his heart withered, his nature like ashes.
Yet joy fills his face with laughter.

The fine steed rides the wind away,
lightly grasped, it appears before him.
Beyond the crag’s edge, free and at ease,
the herdboy sleeps beneath the moon.
Once he saved the master by dropping the reins—
this horse’s nature is gentle as silk,
the herdboy guards the natural Way.
Originally, there was not a single thing,
yet in non-being, the body finds wholeness.
Virtue is good, the tranquil Dao not empty.

The mind-steed is fundamentally empty,
forced to gallop west and east.
Lift it, then strike it all away—
the bright moon keeps company with the clear wind.

Songs and dances of ten thousand stanzas, boundless beauty,
the herdboy’s song and dance most refined.
Idle, idle, idleness—joy without sorrow.
Having traversed the ends of the earth, delighting in no-self,
he gathers it up and hangs it on the moon’s tip.
From ancient times, this could be the family’s foundational style.

Snowy peaks and Song winds move,
the cold pool’s moon congeals.
Green crags and immortal osmanthus flourish,
beyond the world, wild cranes cry.

Thus nurtured, his nature becomes pure and harmonious.
Carefree, the lone wanderer delights at the world’s edge,
beyond the clouds, serene and unpressured.
The pivot-song’s melody pierces the clear sky,
his dancing sleeves find heaven and earth too narrow.

The boy rejoices, free to roam.
When the time comes, he laughs and dances in the spring wind,
emerging from being, entering non-being—unhindered by emptiness.
Within the cave, the true wind is worthy of emulation,
at heaven’s edge, the great perfect clarity congeals.

Strolling at ease, he roams the scenes beyond the world.
The white horse and the herdboy—
the awakened one’s intent knows no bounds.
The wondrous principle of true emptiness,
suddenly reveals the clarity of nature.

Alone before the green crags and blue pines,
the herdboy embodies the natural,
moonlight locks the azure sky.
In the thatched hall’s pure stillness,
each line resonates with profound mystery.

The herdboy at ease, delighting before the crags,
searching for herbs, the busy boy rests,
the white horse idly bears the scriptures.
The intent of the western journey’s eastern crossing,
erases traces—no connection remains.
The guest views poetry and books, forgetting the years.

Soundless, pure song brings joy,
idly chanting the gates of all wonders.
Three strikes—all done,
beneath pines and bamboo, a single pot of purity.

Emptiness of nature—no need to capture the mind-steed.
Guard the heart-ape to stillness,
the boy rests naturally, no longer wandering.
The elixir complete, he knows creation’s workings—
beyond things, what further cultivation is there?
Forget the mechanism, sever the heart-ape’s grip.

Before the vast, bright moon,
strike the center with a single fist.
Where the true countenance remains unchanged,
there lies the valley spirit’s wholeness.

Now seize the nature at hand—
nature abides in tranquility,
delighting in the Dao without end.
Within the crucible, jade-like essence congeals,
hung upon the osmanthus branch.
Sleep without worry, waking without entanglement.

Joy and play reside within,
gathered to seek the *Can Tong Qi*.
The herdboy’s nature is natural,
moonlight locks the emerald sky.
In the thatched hall’s pure clarity,
each phrase resonates with subtle mystery.

The seven returns forge the elixir’s form,
no need for nine-fold refinement’s work.
In motion, the eight purities’ subtle principle—
cleaving open primal chaos,
chiseling through heaven and earth.

Recognize the "nothing-yet-all,"
the family’s inherent Way.
Follow the constant, then reverse to wield expedience.
No need to count the passing years,
the twin gates never left idle.

Luminous, bright, and all-pervading,
dreamless, one arrives at Dengye.
Slanting sunlight and clear wind near the horizon’s edge,
cranes dance to the elixir’s discourse,
the boy’s song soars with wondrous intent.

Facing each other, few words spoken,
the bright moon illumines the toad palace.
Well met, to share tea with the mountain boy.
Drinking alone, Zhao Zhou’s tea,
sleeves brushed, one steps into mist and rosy clouds.

Beyond the world, no companions sing,
the mortal realm clamors like hemp.
By the stream, pride cast off, the self-made fortress crumbles—
clapping hands, laughter rings out,
beyond the world, a wild crane arrives.

Where the herdboy rests in leisure,
another Penglai unfolds.
Wildflowers and meadow grass are my home.
Awakening to Lü and Huang’s root,
outwardly, the wildflower countryside.
At ease, wandering in dreams,
within the gourd, sun and moon stretch long.

Truly, there is some sincerity,
the fine steed has no inherent nature,
the herdboy’s form is naturally whole.
Originally, not a single thing exists—
where is there no peace?

In carefree ease, delighting in mist and rosy clouds.
Green waters and azure hills,
immortals within the misty grotto.
Pushing aside the moon at the sky’s edge,
below the ravine, a sky of clarity.

A hundred years of life, all a fleeting dream—
sleeves swept, ascending the blue peak,
strolling idly, embracing the natural.
Gathering one thing,
setting down a gourd of heaven.
Passing days with hempen cloth and green threads.

Beneath the clear wind and bright moon,
when will the spring breeze ever cease?
The jade-green pool’s limpid lines,
all idle words of leisurely folk.

The heart like withered wood, cold ashes—
the herdboy’s nature at ease,
the ravine’s waters murmuring.
Idly observing the world beyond,
mountains remain mountains as ever.
Without effort, the flute dances on its own.

Lifting a thousand kinds of being,
setting down, all becomes one nothing.
Sleeves swaying, stepping beyond the world,
alone astride a solitary wheel.

The swift steed reined in, resting beneath the crag,
a gibbon frolics,
the herdboy rides backward on the ox.
Captured and made to follow,
ever joyful, endless delight.
Well met, to dwell secluded before the peaks.

The three realms and ten directions manifest,
the clear wind turns at hand.
All grasping and releasing done,
awakened, one lets go a single thread.

Joyous, possessing an unshaken nature—
toying with being within nothingness,
revolving the gates of all wonders.
Opening the eye of the mysterious female,
ordinary and sacred part at once.

Seated on high, radiant with joy.
Lifting the ten directions’ realm,
setting down, delighting in heaven’s truth.
Unchanged through ancient and modern,
within the gourd, sun and moon renewed.

Severing the tangled vines, no more dream’s allure—
beyond the white horse crag,
the herdboy sleeps soundly.
Man and steed unshaken,
the bright moon faces green mountains.

In the clear night, where is there no clarity?
The three blasts, four calls—
herdboy and horse leave no trace.
The true great Dao is non-action,
originally, the family’s inherent Way.

Silent, the one nature encompasses all—
silent, the heart does not arise,
when heart arises, bondage is born.
Where the two things are both forgotten,
nothing is not embraced.

Hidden in secrecy, the form concealed beyond the humble hut.
The numinous terrace’s hidden Dharma,
eight leaves shared with seven flowers.
Within the shadowless thatched hut,
sitting alone, refining cinnabar.

The horse dead, the solitary body strolls at ease—
the horse dead, nature knows no sorrow,
the solitary body roams ten thousand miles.
A single spirit unobstructed,
this is the one neither lingering nor staying.

Freely singing and dancing, feigning folly—
carefree, without a single worry,
freely attaining liberation.
Singing and dancing, riding the wind away,
the bright moon shines on the southern tower.

Swift steps resemble the nature of the idle—
the true nature of ignorance,
the empty nature is the Dharma-body.
After awakening, not one thing remains,
without nature, things are naturally real.

Constantly guard the One, speak not of three.
Constantly guard the not-empty emptiness,
no-thing is the family’s inherent Way.
Where the body is wholly forgotten,
hidden within the great void.

The unending radiance knows no obstruction—
hanging up the Xuanyuan mirror,
cold light pierces the azure sky.
Beneath the clear wind crag, it rises,
a single wisp of colored cloud’s trace.

The furnace cools, the scrolls set aside, pure discourse ends.
My heart like the autumn moon,
the jade-green pool’s light, bright and clear.
Nothing compares to this,
how can I speak of it?

The horse and man both forgotten, utterly silent—
this double forgetting is hardest to speak,
its wondrous function, continuous and unbroken.
The root of learning’s cessation is non-action,
non-action is the root of spontaneity.

Inwardly guarding, nurturing the true and natural.
Inwardly guarding the golden true precepts,
acting beyond the four births.
Originally, not one thing exists,
vast and free, the great spontaneity.

The great Dao needs no skillful means—
the great Dao is without sentiment,
good and evil arise within skill.
Lifting all, striking all away,
the mysterious gate’s great Dao flourishes.

Hungry, eat; thirsty, drink; tired, sleep.
When hungry, one must eat,
when tired, sleep at ease.
Originally without restraint,
where is there not spontaneity?

Attaining the One, forgetting the heart, single-mindedly guarding the One—
attaining the One, forgetting the heart’s guard,
the heartless nature endures long.
Silently revolving the celestial circuit,
facing south, gazing at the Northern Dipper.

The gates of all wonders, mysterious and again mysterious—
the wondrous gate always closed, nothing is,
lifting it, eighty thousand miles open.
Severing the tangled vines, no more dream’s allure,
fully knowing the mystery upon mystery, the supreme clarity.

Refining the jade embryo, distinguishing creation—
refining the jade embryo’s guest,
how many are within?
Penetrating heaven and earth’s revolutions,
round and round, a single true flavor.

Within the gourd, another heaven exists—
looking up, heaven is not seen,
looking down, earth is not seen.
The wondrous emptiness, hard to speak,
the Dao’s transformation knows no bounds.

The Dharma-body, pure and clear, penetrates the three heavens—
I come from purity,
later, I depart from purity.
Clear beyond the nine heavens,
a single spirit finds no attachment.

Names and distinctions all forgotten, speak not at all—
who plucks the stringless lute,
with wondrous hands, striking pure tones?
Suddenly, the spring thunder resounds,
its echoes heard in the nine skies.

The formless pagoda is ever present—
in the East, lingzhi grass grows,
in the West, golden flowers bloom.
The true fool of non-action,
worthy to be the seven-tiered pagoda.

The golden dragon, the emperor rides, eternally prolonging years—
a single strike shatters the mysterious gate,
thoroughly investigating the mechanisms of all truths.
Xuanyuan ascends the golden palace,
the giant spirit rides the crane in flight.

Nature extinguished, heart forgotten, nothing remains—
nature and heart extinguished,
vast and empty, forming chaos.
The non-acting lion’s child,
how could it not keep to its place?

Bare and radiant, the luminous ford—
bare and radiant, the luminous ford,
red and unadorned, the phoenix’s marrow.
Round and complete, the mirror beyond form,
bright and shining, the purple-refined immortal.

At the beginning, who knows whose child it was—
from nothingness, nothingness gives birth to qi,
qi renews the primordial beginning.
Who knows whose child it was?
Returning to the root, nature’s heaven is true.

Originally, the first purple-gold immortal—
the primordial Jade Clarity Heaven,
all names embody spontaneity.
Bright and shining, this clear mirror,
the great net’s purple-refined immortal.

*West River Moon*

Chaos swirled like an egg in its first clustering,
dim and silent, filling all space.
Vast and formless, it embraced primordial vastness—
a single qi cycling, congealing in weight.

Within lay true Water and true Fire,
steaming and coiling like ice.
At its heart, the Primal Beginning wrought mysterious work—
the Three Qi evenly divided in Great Stillness.

*Secret Formula:*
With a wondrous hand, open the eyes of the whole body,
stir the twin gates to set the Five Bright Pearls in motion.
The Heart-Elixir is gathered in three hundred words,
the nature refined with the *Yin Talisman Scroll*.

*Heaven and Earth as Body and Function: The Right Dao, Second Chapter*
*Mu-Su-She #1: Mirroring the Heart*

The Great Unification—hard for mortals to grasp.
Strike, open the Illuminated Round,
illuminating the slumber of a deluded heaven.
All actions, whether bright or dim,
hold the Cinnabar Origin within Qian—
never turn your back on True Emptiness.

The Medicine of Kun lies in its kind.
Gather it and deliver it
to be matched with Ding Gong’s pairing.
The pill, perfected, bears the savor of Prior Heaven.
Consume it, ascend as an immortal,
crane-borne, roaming beyond the world.

*Waves Scouring Sand*
I bow my head to the host of immortals,
having fathomed the workings of Heaven and Earth.
The Nine Perfected’s breath stirs the river mists.
The arrow strikes the red heart—master and disciple aligned—
winning the full cycle of the celestial sphere.

Beyond the world, Mercury and Lead are gathered,
the dual elixirs complete.
One subtle sign, twofold mystery.
Lift the Crimson Crucible of the Two Yins,
and the work is sealed in perfection.

*Secret Formula:*
The Heart-Elixir hides within Kun,
the Cinnabar faces Qian within the nature.
No weight or measure for the Fire-Timing—
its wondrous root lies in Prior Heaven.

From Chaos flowed the body and function of Heaven and Earth.
The two hexagrams, Qian and Kun, each with six lines of old yin and old yang,
are the primordial image of the Lord-on-High.
Qian’s nature, Kun’s heart, being and non-being—
these are the principles of the Elixir.
Qian has six lines, each of thirty-six;
Kun has six lines, each of twenty-four.
Qian’s number is two hundred sixteen,
Kun’s number is one hundred forty-four.
The twelve lines of the two hexagrams
correspond to the three hundred sixty days.
The cultivator, aligning with Heaven and Earth,
refining through the transformations,
gathering at dawn and dusk,
tempering day by day, hour by hour—
how could the Elixir not be wondrously achieved?

*The Cauldron of Qian and Kun: The Right Dao, Third Chapter*
*Xiao-Yao Ling #2*

The Master asks of the Dao, and it is only the Valley Spirit that penetrates.
Simply take Qian and Kun as the cauldron and vessel—
their twofold subtle workings are wondrously boundless.
Profoundly still, ever more limpid and clear.

The jade pool’s guest, beyond the world, moves in mysterious workings.
Laying down the ten thousand concerns, none hold fast—
the luminous pearl rests in the palm, ready for deep inquiry.
Striking through the sea-cloud bell.

*Sumuzhe*
Within the jade furnace, the elixir is fired.
Refined thrice, the highest is truly wondrous.
The sea-bottom tortoise and snake are diligently gathered.
Enclosed within the pot, refined into perfect enlightenment,
illuminating boundlessly, radiant and resplendent.
With ease it is grasped, the very ladle of immortality.
Merit and conduct fully rely on precepts and restraints.
A pair of straw sandals—
don them to tread upon clouded feet.

*Secret Formula*
The Mysterious Female communicates its workings,
ceaselessly refining the Valley Spirit.
Non-action is the true Great Dao,
the elixir cauldron points to wholeness of the Real.

The diagram of the elixir cauldron flows from the body and function of Qian and Kun,
its workings resonating with Qian and Kun.
The twelve lines: when yin meets yin, it transforms into the number two,
thus old yin is twenty-four;
when yang meets yang, it transforms into the number three,
thus old yang is thirty-six.
The cultivator, following the cauldron’s inner workings,
forges the breath of Qian’s rest and Kun’s essence,
using yang to refine yin and form the elixir.

*The Crescent Moon of the Elixir: The Right Dao, Fourth Chapter*
*Sumuzhe*
The medicine is boundless, frequently gathered.
In the pure firing of the elixir cauldron,
one taste penetrates the three mysteries.
All dharmas are truly comprehended as nothing.
The family style of purity—
this is the highest essence.
Entrusted to the knowing, it perfectly delights.
Opening the mouth to deep inquiry,
beyond the world, wisdom arises.
Within Qian, luminous clarity adds living means.
When realization dawns,
one is enveloped and drifts into sleep.

*Secret Formula*
The paired passes beside the spine, behind the elbows,
storing spirit and gathering the nine to attend the origin.
The workings of the Returned Elixir move lightly—
at midnight, riding the simurgh to the Moon Palace.

*Gazing Toward Penglai*
True workings—
the bright moon illuminates the edge of the sky.
The jade hare and colored toad of the fifteenth night,
the golden crow flying, spitting forth rosy clouds.
A single dot of the Daoist’s tea.

Beyond the clear night,
quietly hidden is the purple cinnabar.
In the crescent moon furnace, the jade medicine is fired,
within the cinnabar cauldron, golden flowers are knotted.
Bestowed upon the Daoist’s family.

The crescent moon furnace flows from the elixir cauldron,
Qian’s infant pure and still,
Kun’s maiden moving and turbid, intertwined.
The two hexagrams’ twelve lines—
each hexagram has six lines,
five days make one *hou*,
refining the elixir of the moon’s seventy-two *hou*,
the essentials of the twelve months.

*The Fire Phases of Ascent and Descent: The Right Dao, Fifth Chapter*
*Sumuzhe*

Extinguish all strife, attain the true Fire Phases.
Ascent and descent depend entirely
on that single, flawless elixir.
Locked at the primal origin where cosmos arose,
when the moon reaches the *Li* Palace,
divine protection naturally follows.

Harmonize heaven’s breath, the true medicine is achieved.
In but a moment’s effort,
who shall fathom its depths?
Jade bamboo pierces the ice, immortal music resounds.
At dawn, the Three Purities appear,
enduring life through ten thousand kalpas.

*Secret Formula:*
A single spark of true Yang fire,
rises in unison to the Moon’s vast palace.
Descending, it returns to the Sea of Qi,
where breath regulates, tiger and dragon intertwine.

*Linjiangxian*
The treasured sword, re-polished, gleams bright,
its perfect clarity illumines boundless space.
Moonlight, radiant, seals the toad in heaven.
Within this wheel of boundless embrace,
pine and cypress shelter the immortals’ abode.

Jade dust swirls across the face, wind-dancing,
silver peaks spread verdant clouds beneath the eaves.
The crane arrives first to announce the Jade Emperor’s decree.
Mounting the simurgh, one departs,
sleeve brushing as they ascend to the Primordial Court.

Now, the *Diagram of Heaven and Earth’s Ascent and Descent of Yin and Yang*
flows from the crescent moon furnace.
The two hexagrams *Qian* and *Kun* are the parents of yin and yang,
excluding the Four Symbols—*Kan*, *Li*, *Zhen*, and *Dui*.
Within yin, yang is nurtured; *Kun* embraces the hidden *Qian*.
The twelve lines of *Kun* and *Qian*:
when *Qian* meets *Kun*, twelve lines transform into twenty-four,
thus yielding the twenty-four qi.
Fifteen days mark the *zhongqi* (mid-phase), fifteen days the *jieqi* (seasonal node).
*Mid-phases* belong to yin, *nodes* to yang.
Of the sixty-four hexagrams, excluding the Four Symbols leaves sixty.
Each hexagram has six lines—six times six makes thirty-six,
equaling three hundred sixty days.
From winter solstice to noon: one hundred eighty yang lines,
*Qian* breathes, refining yellow gold.
From summer solstice to midnight: one hundred eighty yin lines,
*Kun* wanes, refining mercury.
*Qian* and *Kun* are the parents of the sixty-four hexagrams’ yin and yang—
to grasp one is to forget the other.
*Kun* as body, *Qian* as heart: the essence of elixir refinement.

*The Right Dao of Samadhi, Sixth Chapter*
*Sumuzhe*

Seal the Mysterious Pass, penetrate the threefold samadhi.
The herb-gathering immortal elder
has gathered the true message.
Willow banks and reed flowers deepen in emerald hue.
White clouds blanket the earth,
known only to those who cannot perceive.

Yet when plucked, it bends to one’s will.
The family’s inherent nature,
entrusted to the true heart-ground.
A single luminous spirit-pearl shines resplendent,
illuminating the dust of ten thousand sands—
when met, one receives the prophecy.

*Secret Formula:*
Having gathered the samadhi fire,
it abides all day in *Kun*’s palace.
The numinous elixir, formed into a single grain,
is entrusted to Ding Gong.

*Langtaosha*
Virtually circulate the microcosmic orbit,
the message of *Kun* and *Qian*.
Yin and yang ascend and descend, moonlight fresh.
Lead and mercury, refined to seven thousand measures,
gradually perfect the work.

Temper the body ceaselessly,
release it wholly.
At the proper *zi* and *wu* hours, cease withdrawal and addition.
When eighty-four thousand merits are fulfilled,
the immortal is instantly realized.

Now, the *Fire Phases of the Microcosmic Orbit*
emerge from the crescent moon furnace.
The twelve messages of the two hexagrams:
*Qian*’s six breaths—six yang lines—
from *zi* to *si*, pure *Qian* elixir forms in the golden crucible.
*Kun*’s six wanes—six yin lines—
from *wu* to *hai*, pure *Kun* medicine ripens in the earthen cauldron.
Heaven and earth, *Qian* and *Kun*,
are the great creation of all beings.
From the first nine lines to the winter solstice,
one day to fifteen days, ascending seven thousand.
From *zi* to *wu*: six nodes, six mid-phases;
from *wu* to *zi*: six mid-phases, six nodes—
each cycle totals eighty-four thousand.
For the cultivator, one inhalation and exhalation
moves the pulse three inches, traversing eight hundred ten *zhang*.
Sixteen *zhang* and two *chi* of qi’s movement intersect.
In great practice, one day refines eighty-four thousand elixirs;
in lesser practice, one hour circulates thirteen thousand five hundred measures of medicine.

*The Right Dao of the Threefold Return of the Three Primordials, Seventh Chapter*
*The Three Primordials of Qian and Kun, Three Palaces*

**West River Moon**

The wondrous root of the Three Primordials’ true fire,
gathered and tempered into elixir.
Two hundred forty measures of medicine complete,
each pellet radiant, its form manifest.

Within the cinnabar, crimson clouds swirl;
Lord Ding consumes it and ascends as immortal.
In the Yellow Chamber, silent slumber—utter stillness—
only then does the infant appear, longing at last.

Lesser Yang: four sevens, twenty-eight;
Lesser Yin: four eights, thirty-two.

**Su Mu Zhe**

Gather the Three Essences, unite the Four Images.
Qi flows unobstructed, rising and descending without cease.
Flying into the Mud Pill Palace, a hundred *zhang* of light.
Through years deep and ages long,
refined into a canopy of luminous jade.

Attain the primordial, ascend to the supreme.
At the central station of equilibrium,
thirty-five strokes of the rod.
Struck true, neither coming nor going—
this mind, this family’s tradition,
is utterly without falsehood.

**Formula:**
Gradually relinquish the Three Primordials,
instantly dissolve the Four Images.
When all methods vanish—
what form remains?

Spiritual radiance pierces the ninefold heavens—
in stillness, atop the peak, the moon appears.

sky brightens—
emptiness vast, ten thousand *li* of clarity.
Moonbeams seen in a thousand places,
a single spark of the Great Sun arises.

**Su Mu Zhe**

Seek the primal cause, find its perfect match.
The Sevenfold Return’s true medicine,
two flavors of elixir paired.
Fire-tending, knife and measure—deep emerald hue.
Rising and descending,
yet the observer fails to comprehend.

Apply effort, shun indulgent sleep.
Not bound to the middle,
its wonder neither inner nor outer.
Through the double gates of the spine, soaring auspiciousness.
A single luminous pearl
flies onto the Azure Dragon’s back!

**Formula:**
A single luminous pearl,
split into two halves.
Cast aside the pagoda of form—
preserve only the treasure within.

**The Right Dao of the Ninefold Return’s Great Elixir, Ninth Chapter**

**West River Moon**

Ninefold transmutation of the numinous elixir,
from the beginning, a single point of primordial truth.
The immortals gather it to become celestial beings,
universally bestowing it—all have their share.

Originally, cinnabar alone,
returning to its root: black tin, white silver.
The River Chariot conveys it to the Heart Lord—
realization dawns, yet it never leaves the square inch.

---

Wondrous return to the root,
ever abiding in constancy.

**White Silver Elixir**

White silver elixir—
who does not love it?

A full ten-day cycle of swift drinking—
drunk, you attend the Peach Banquet,
returning without blame.

**From Zi, Wu, and Xu: The Ninefold Return Elixir**
**Formula:**
Within the elixir, heaven and earth expand;
within the flask, sun and moon endure.

A single grain of cinnabar—
once attained, it is yours.

**The Right Dao of Heaven and Earth, Sun and Moon: Tenth Chapter**

**Su Mu Zhe**

Gather within the flask,
congeal sun and moon.
A moment’s effort—
unceasing refinement.
The riverbank’s reeds bloom white as snow.
The elixir flies to me—
how can I speak of it?

Dao without illumination,
the true single secret.
Attained, it is the *dilu*:
freely abiding in quiet simplicity.
Only when the crane arrives from beyond
does one ascend in broad daylight,
destined to approach the Golden Gates.

Within the elixir, heaven and earth;
within the flask, sun and moon.
Frequently gathered and refined—
wrought into white snow.

Transcending the five phases,
cultivating the realm beyond.
Reeds on the far shore,
lush crimson clouds descend.
Vast and boundless, the scene lures one to drowsy slumber.
Awakened, from the beginning,
all points align in perfect accord.

Moon in snow,
sun in the flask.
Alone, I ride a small boat,
freely steering auspicious pine winds.
The wondrous origin comes to heal your transgressions.
I universally exhort all:
do not obscure your primordial beginning.

Leap beyond the five phases,
seek the realm beyond.
The pure and serene Dharma-body—
the supreme gathering.

**West River Moon**

Stir the wondrous origin of soaring heaven,
refine a single grain of cinnabar.
Morning seek, evening gather—
the Daoist’s labor.
A full ten-day cycle completes the point.

The Jade Balance is set aright,
moving eight-faced clouds and mist.
Alone in my small hermitage,
I sit as an immortal—
sleep dispelled, myriad illusions unyielding.

Heaven and earth, two trigrams,
twelve lines.
In the twelve hours of each day,
each hour has eight quarters and four seconds—
thus yielding one hundred eight *zhu*.
Moment by moment, hour by hour,
the elixir is refined.

**Hanging Golden Chain**

Countless carts,
white calcium blended as one.

**Kneading the Cake**

The round cake is formed,
vast as the heavens above.
Steamed to perfection in primordial chaos—
just one, precisely so.
Picked up with ease,
yet who shall be the one to break and taste?

**True Origin Transcending the Right Dao, Eleventh**

**Su Mu Zhe**

Great True Origin,
transcending the Dharma-realm.
Refining the essence,

the myriad Dharmas fall silent.
I alone transcend the Three Realms,
the wondrous, undivided mystery of the Primordial Origin wholly realized.
A ship sailing the vast seas to ferry all beings.

**The Great Dao of Non-Action, Twelfth**

**Su Mu Zhe**

This Non-Action—
the Primordial’s creation.
Being and non-being,
truly boundless wonder.
Who has ever reached the supreme, non-empty?
Forced to name it,
we borrow words as signs.

The Dao is eternal,
the great mystery.
Awakened image, radiant and complete—
attaining the One, the sudden teaching.
Generation to generation,
the treasure of the mind-seal passed down.
Surpassing all side doors,
the True Great Dao alone shines.

**Formula:**
Wondrous form connects the Mystic Valley,
true emptiness embodies the natural.
Called the Great Dao,
not to be conveyed by worldly sentiments.

**Wang Peng Lai**

In the realm of non-being,
the Great Dao is wordless.
All dharmas, when grasped, reduce to one phrase—
forced to name it: the Dao, the cinnabar immortal.
Image and Emperor are the root.

True non-being—
wondrous transformation precedes being and non-being.
The supreme, non-empty, silent, and wordless is transmitted,
the subtle, formless Mystic Valley’s sacred text.
The ancestral lineage exists in the Primordial.

**Man Ting Fang**

Sudden awakening to the mystery,
gradual departure from the dusty realm—
dual forgetting of sudden and gradual, Non-Action.
Cultivating the Great Dao of truth,
fully seeing the original formless.
Precepts strictly upheld, virtue and power refined—
becoming an immortal,
a knower beyond the world.
Relying on the mind-ground,
three thousand merits fulfilled,
eight hundred deeds without flaw.

Noble ones,
do not retreat.
Be diligent, cautious, and devoted—
compassionate, frugal, and clear.

**Essentials:**
Put others before self,
endure, yield, show compassion.
Sever worldly ties at the highest,
encountering the Mystic Gate,
resolve unwavering.
Divine spirits protect,
liberating the seven ancestors,
together ascending to the colored clouds’ return.

**Song of Pure Awareness and Nature**

I cultivate this mind—no obstacle stands firm,
awareness and nature, luminous and ever-present.
Mind opens, vast and boundless, filling the ten directions,
nature comprehends, divine powers pervade the dharma realms.

Awakened mind at ease,
nature self-liberates.
Mind is the true immortal—
who returns to decay?
Grasping swiftly, seek within nature—
who would linger in old debts?

Nature transcends bounds,
mind’s light expands.
Nature, since the kalpa’s dawn, illumines inner and outer.
Mind stabilizes—ancient family tradition,
nature like cold ashes, solitary sitting in bliss.

Mind like withered wood,
nature all-covering.
Mind and form are empty—no clinging to precepts.
I teach you to recognize nature’s pure simplicity,
to cease attachment to body and self.

Guard your mind,
nature becomes reliable.
Mind forgotten, all vanishes—what strangeness remains?
Nature’s emptiness—karma’s traces lost,
mind’s harmony—no turning toward or away.

Nature serene and steadfast,
mind clear and at peace.
Nature frugal, gentle—do not sell yourself.
Mind compassionate, humble—avoid greed and excess,
nature’s trust and magnanimity lessen others’ faults.

Mind like fire,
nature like kindling.
Mind united with the infant, like a newborn child.
Nature like Mount Tai—unshaken,
mind like sun and moon, radiant in the spirit terrace.

Nature the white ox,
mind the herdsman’s pen.
Nature battles the Three Corpses, teaching them defeat.
The Mind-King is the true master,
mind as a sharp sword—passion retreats first.

Mind the golden elixir,
nature the sea of medicine.
The maiden of the Li Palace gathers without mind.
Nature’s chariot, the Kan Palace, circulates the heavens—
seizing the black turtle, the mind bows of itself.

Mind the crescent moon,
nature bright and dark.
The cinnabar tripod round, the mind reverent as cowrie.
On the Caoxi road, nature in Yunzhou,
lead and mercury meet in the treasure vase.

Mind perfected,
nature the Great Dao.
Mind and nature wholly transcended—observing self at ease.
To awaken the Dharma-body, the Great Luo immortal,
do not corrupt the original mind and nature.
