### *The Supreme Three Heavens Jade Hall Orthodox High Ascent Inner Radiance Jade Scripture, Scroll One*

The Master said: Those who study the supreme Dao and aspire to immortality must refine themselves through the essence of the sun and the radiance of the moon, for only thus can they achieve the immortal Dao. Without the mysterious workings of the Dao, none can unite with the True. The so-called "essence and radiance" are not sought externally but are the innate truth of one’s own body.

The Dao’s methods number in the thousands, its paths in the tens of thousands—twisting trails and side routes, cluttered with miscellaneous teachings. Thus, scholars often abandon the true for the false, forsake the internal for the external. The longer they practice, the harder it becomes to succeed.

The *High Ascent of the Sun and Moon* is the esoteric transmission of the Most High and the ancestral masters, passed down orally from mouth to mouth without reliance on written words. Now, it is recorded in writing so that those of later generations with karmic affinity may more easily seek and investigate it.

Moreover, heaven’s spirit resides in the sun and moon, and the human body mirrors this. Thus, those who embody heaven and cultivate their bodies may reverse yang, transform their bones, and ascend in broad daylight—truly, this is the path to efficacy.

As the *Yellow Court Scripture* states:
*"High ascent of sun and moon, my supreme Dao,
Yu Yi and Jie Lin, well-preserved in harmony."*
And again:
*"The radiance of sun and moon rescues the aged and infirm."*
These are no empty words.

For those of superior learning, once their minds open and their understanding deepens, they will grasp the essence of all things and transcend effortful practice to reach the realm of effortlessness. However, those of lesser capacity, with shallow and narrow roots, cannot enter the Dao without deliberate effort—they cannot grasp and perfect the True.

Thus, the Teaching Master deemed the Dao difficult to express in words and necessarily relied on written discourse. Here, the profound and wondrous is fully expounded. If later scholars diligently practice and steadfastly uphold it, they may ride the clouds of qi, tread upon radiant light, attain longevity, and commune with immortals and sages. How could this method compare to mere verbal instruction?

The Master said: The supreme Dao of immortals fundamentally requires no laborious visualization or circulation. To enter the true path of cultivation, one must employ talismans and scriptures. For five hundred years, a sage is born; for seven hundred years, a true adept is transmitted this Dao. Such methods are indeed rare to find worthy recipients.

Observing those who uphold the Dao today, many are young and frivolous, neglecting precepts and conduct. They disrespect the law and belittle their masters, deceiving heaven and earth. Thus, the foolish seek profit without discerning worthiness, casually transmitting texts for wealth like peddlers.

When disciples seek a master, they offer gold and treasures as ritual gifts. Yet when masters transmit and transform, they should choose those of loyalty and integrity. If disciples rely on wealth to disdain their masters, and masters pursue profit out of favoritism, slander and fault will inevitably arise, bringing misfortune upon themselves.

This *High Ascent Scripture* is a text forbidden by the heavens. It must be transmitted only to those carefully selected; it should not be indiscriminately shown to the unworthy. If one cannot find those who wholeheartedly follow the path, they are surely those who deceive the law and their own hearts. Be strictly warned: do not violate this.

*"Yang arises from the Primordial Sea, ascending from below.
Chaotic yet ordered, it scatters the host of yin.

*"Fire dragons lead the way, piercing the crown with flying light.
Spirits enter the boundless, paying homage to Yu Yi.
In a blink, I ascend and merge, blending with numinous brilliance.
Unwavering, I pursue the root, burning away Peng’s corpse."*

The Master said: On the twelfth day of the lunar month, purify yourself, sit in stillness, and knock your teeth twenty-six times. Visualize yourself as before, from the summit riding a golden dragon across the fire bridge, soaring toward the Solar Palace. Then, the auspicious qi below the mountain harmonizes and warms.

**True Yang’s Homage to Numinous Brilliance Inner Radiance**

**Yin’s filth burns to ash, as I pay homage to the Lofty Honored One.**
**Numinous qi returns to me, illuminating every aperture with light.**
**Spirit merges with inner refinement, transforming to birth the immortal soul.**

The Master said: On the fifteenth day of the lunar month, recite the incantation, ingest the talisman, knock the teeth, and swallow saliva as before in number. Visualize yourself entering the sun to pay homage to the Imperial Lord, presenting your aspiration to study the Dao of immortality. After a long while, withdraw.

**True Yang’s Numinous Radiance Illuminating the Inner Landscape**
**Incantation:**
*Radiance of the Solar Palace blazes bright, as I don the numinous light.*
*Eight windows shine clear, nine portals glow resplendent.*
*Form and spirit return to the source, qi refines into radiance.*
*Washed and refined, without leakage, the Valley Spirit soars.*

The Master said: When the adept reaches this stage, having entered pure Yang, recite the incantation eighty-one times, ingest the talisman, absorb the qi, knock the teeth, and swallow saliva. Visualize yourself entering the Solar Palace, sitting upright to absorb the light and draw in qi. The numinous crow emits light, entering your mouth, suffusing your entire body with brilliance. This practice is to be performed at the noon hour on the seventeenth day of each lunar month.

**Pure Yang’s Golden Radiance Resplendent Inner Landscape**
**Incantation:**
*Heaven’s radiance merges with form, spirit and qi unite with the sky.*
*The true fire of Li’s clarity becomes my Three Fields.*
*Coming and going freely, soaring naturally.*
*Pure Yang completes the body, attaining the rank of divine immortal.*

The Master said: On the twentieth day of the lunar month, perform the practice as before. Then visualize your body within the sun, inner and outer merging as one, warmth arising naturally. Nine rays scatter their brilliance, suffusing the heavens in great crimson. Recite the incantation eighty-one times, knock the teeth, swallow saliva, ingest the talisman, and after a long while, withdraw.

**Nine Yang’s Li-Clarity True Qi Yu Yi’s Inner Landscape**
**Incantation:**
*Cavernous Yang’s qi crimson, blazing and crystalline.*
*Yin scatters, Yang gathers, nurturing my true form.*
*Form and spirit both transform, merging with Li’s clarity.*
*Refinement arises naturally, cycling through countless flights.*

The Master said: On the twentieth and twenty-fifth (dark moon) days of the lunar month, recite the incantation, ingest the talisman, knock the teeth, and swallow saliva as before. Visualize your body merging with the sun as one, your form no longer visible—only the blended radiance remains. Practicing this for one year banishes illness; for two years, spirit strengthens and the body lightens; for three years, the corpse’s poisons dissolve; for five years, one may ride qi and mount light. With unwavering diligence, the Imperial Lord will gaze upon you, true immortals become your companions, and you will ascend at dawn. Take heed.

**Primordial Simplicity’s Inception of the Mysterious Origin Inner Landscape**
**Incantation:**
*Vast and boundless, the empty profound, the chaotic true source.*
*Flourishing radiance yet concealed, the mysterious wheel self-completes.*
*Converging at the inception, symbolizing the Emperor’s precedence.*
*Following the time to refine and ingest, qi enters the profound mystery.*

The Master said: On the night of each new moon, recite the incantation nine times as before. Visualize yourself as Kunlun, its base as a vast sea stretching boundlessly. From the water’s depths, the lunar wheel rises black, devoid of light. Ingest its primordial qi, and after a long while, swallow saliva and knock the teeth according to the number of incantations recited.

**Luminous Clarity of the Great Inception’s Radiance Inner Landscape**
**Incantation:**
*True radiance first arises, utmost Yang within Yin.*

*The source of fluids flows freely, illuminating the jade chamber.*
*Qi’s light grows abundant, ingesting and soaring in flight.*

The Master said: On the night of the second day of each lunar month, sit in stillness and purify yourself. Visualize yourself as Kunlun Mountain, seated at its summit, gazing at the moon rising like a hook over the sea, its water-wheel full above. Knock the teeth and swallow saliva, each twenty-seven times. Recite the incantation, ingest the talisman, absorb the qi, and after a long while, withdraw.

**Crystal Radiance’s Luminous Flourishing Inner Landscape**
**Incantation:**
*Radiance scatters in the celestial pond, gold and water half-formed.*
*Light pierces the dark night, illuminating my mysterious pearl.*
*Drinking the crystalline nectar, fragrance permeates the numinous body.*
*Through true convergence of numbers, ride the radiance in soaring flight.*

The Master said: On the seventh day of each lunar month, purify yourself and sit in stillness. Visualize yourself ascending Kunlun’s summit, gazing at the moon’s light like a half-formed wheel. Recite the incantation twenty-four times, ingest the talisman, and swallow saliva according to the number of incantations. Absorb the qi, and after a long while, withdraw.

*Soaring high into the inner landscape, condensing the radiant orb’s perfection.*

The Master said: On the night of the thirteenth day of each lunar month, purify yourself and sit in stillness. Visualize yourself ascending Kunlun’s summit, gazing at the moon’s radiance. Recite the incantation thirty-six times, knock the teeth, and swallow saliva, each thirty-six times. Ingest the talisman, absorb the qi, and after a long while, withdraw.

**Full Radiance’s Numinous Clarity Pervading Illumination Inner Landscape**
**Incantation:**
*The jade pivot’s radiance, full and unwaning.*
*The mysterious radiance limpid and clear, the spirit’s gate opens its doors.*
*Within stands the Lofty Honored One, crowned in jade, robed in feathers.*
*May the numinous qi descend, hastening my return’s appointed time.*

The Master said: On the night of each full moon, purify yourself and sit in stillness. Visualize yourself standing atop Kunlun’s summit, the moon full and brimming with light. From the moon, water and clouds form a bridge, gleaming like silver. Ingest its qi without ascending. Recite the incantation thirty-six times, knock the teeth, and swallow saliva likewise. Ingest the talisman, absorb the qi, and after a long while, withdraw.

**Incantation:**
*The celestial source flows in cycles, light piercing the layered towers.*
*Dawn’s glow illumines the ten directions, the five fluids dispel the obscure.*
*Soaring emptiness captures the radiance, the true body floats in flight.*
*With one true ascent to pay homage, the nine Yangs hold no peril.*

The Master said: Proceeding as before, on the sixteenth day, visualize the moon’s true water forming a bridge, descending to connect with Kunlun. Your body rides a multicolored phoenix into the moon. Recite the incantation eighty-one times, knock the teeth, and swallow saliva likewise. Ingest the talisman, absorb the qi, and after a long while, withdraw.

**Golden Radiance’s Pure Emptiness Embracing the True Inner Landscape**

**Incantation:**
*Divine radiance veils in mist, the body ascends to the Mystic Palace.*
*Pay homage to form the luminous essence—vows are instantly fulfilled.*
*Chew the Mystic Flower, ingest the numinous wind.*
*The corpse-soul scatters, the spirit transforms into immortal visage.*

The Master said: Once more, the adept visualizes entering the Moon Palace to pay homage to the August Sovereign, offering prayers for the pursuit of immortality. Ingest the talisman, recite the incantation, knock the teeth, and swallow saliva—each forty-nine times—on the night of the seventeenth day.

The Master said: The journey to the moon spans but two ten-day periods; beyond this, its light wanes. Thus, these practices must be performed in succession.

**Unsurpassed Divine Radiance of Void Clarity and Inner Landscape**

**Incantation:**
*The moon is my spirit, the spirit follows the moon as one.*
*Inner talisman and outer form unite, transmuting into true shape.*
*Elegance gathers in the Flower Chamber, above blooms the Golden Blossom.*
*Merit perfected, without leakage, ascending to Jade Capital.*

The Master said: On the eighteenth day, the adept visualizes the body within the moon, inwardly and outwardly luminous and clear. Ingest the talisman, recite the incantation sixty times, swallow saliva nine times, and knock the teeth nine times. Perceive golden radiance scattering in all directions, illuminating the heavens with light. Then absorb the *qi*, and after a long while, withdraw.

**Fixed Radiance of Pure Cold Jade and Luminous Essence Inner Landscape**

**Incantation:**
*The round wheel’s essence revolves, the hidden paths of night unfold.*
*Jade Void merges with radiance, golden light lingers in cycles.*
*The source of fluids flows unimpeded, illuminating the Spirit Terrace.*
*Fragrant sweet dew floats, transmuting my immortal embryo.*

The Master said: By this stage, the adept merges as one with the moon. Visualize the body uniting with the Supreme August One, no longer perceiving one’s form—only clarity remains. Practicing this for ten days, the merit surpasses even that of the solar practices. Yet if the adept’s precepts are unrefined and resolve unsteady, though one may grasp and release in fleeting moments, persistence still extends life and transcends the world—how much more so for the devoted?

**Morning Radiance Transforming the Landscape**

The Master said: The adept again visualizes this scene in the latter ten-day period, awaiting the cloud chariot’s ascent into the Void.

**Hymn of Primal Unity**
*The spirit’s carriage soars from the Flower Chamber,*
*The Jade Flask’s auspicious *qi* ascends with true radiance.*
*Supreme Harmony’s fortune binds the realms of Water and Fire.*
*Within dwells the True One, girded with jade pendants,*
*Loftily ascending, wafting celestial fragrance,*
*Emerging from the Void, entering the Origin—Yin transforms into Yang.*
*Vast and boundless, the golden elixir’s nectar*
*Irrigates the hundred bones, ensuring longevity.*
*Bow to the Primal Jade Void Sovereign above.*

The Master said: Lesser adepts, of shallow capacity, know not the Way of natural longevity through clarity, stillness, and perfect penetration. They must rely on visualization and circulation. Yet with devoted and prolonged practice, they merge with the Dao and attain immortality. This method is most esoteric, rarely known. Even those who know may not practice; those who practice may not persist. Thus, immortal masters and Daoist preceptors carefully select disciples for transmission.

The practitioner, when entering seclusion, must not make a sound, cough, or spit, nor speak to others. With precision and persistence, the spirit soars through the void, coming and going without hindrance, uniting with the immortal perfected. Know then that this text holds the Celestial Master’s secret of soaring through the heavens—treasure it.

**The Supreme Three Heavens Jade Hall Orthodox Lineage’s High Ascent Inner Landscape Jade Scripture, Volume One Concludes**
**The Supreme Three Heavens Jade Hall Orthodox Lineage’s High Ascent Inner Landscape Jade Scripture, Volume Two**

The Master said: For protecting the body and prolonging life, nothing surpasses the true Dipper’s restraint of the soul and refinement of the Nine Yangs’ radiance within the *qi* of the *Gang*. Thus, the sages declared: *"Entering and exiting the Dipper, the body grows strong, the *qi* flourishes, life extends, and destiny increases—all evil flees."* They also said: *"All methods emerge from the Dipper; all spirits are commanded by the Dipper."* Thus, every method and practice depends on the Dipper for efficacy. Therefore, the sagely masters invariably employ the Dipper’s ascent to transmit the Dao, guiding adepts toward immortality and truth. By preserving the Void and embracing the Real, one sits to command the Three Realms, governs the Six Heavens—this method is indeed one of the Three Ascents’ secrets, the ladder to transcendence. How could one not revere it?

Named the *Exalted Jade Emperor Spirit*, the *Lord of Eightfold Radiance and Primal Void*.

**Ninth: The Venerable Star**
Named the *Grand Tenuity Jade Emperor Spirit*, the *Lord of Seven Mornings and Seven Essences*.

These two stars are the supreme spirits of the Sovereign Stars. Those who behold them gain longevity; those who cultivate them attain immortality. In former times, a servant of Chancellor Huo Guang of the Han, named Huanche, suddenly saw the two stars within the Dipper, shining with extraordinary brilliance. He bowed and departed, and thereafter lived six hundred years.

The Master said: On the twenty-first night of the month, at midnight, enter your chamber. Press your hands to settle the qi, close your eyes, and inwardly visualize your body rising gently upward, ascending into the *Kui* of the Northern Dipper, where you sit with your back to the Perfected Star. With prolonged practice, you will feel as though your form truly dwells within the Dipper. Focus your intent to the utmost, and you will sense warmth within your body—this is the true qi harmonizing with virtue. Visualize the stars of the Dipper, their light descending upon your body, illuminating you within and without. Then visualize the Three Great Spirits of the Nine Stars.

First, the **Great Spirit of the Upper Prime**:
Named *Qi Jian*, styled *Ling Gang*, clad in a purple auroral robe of phoenix plumes, a tiger-patterned cinnabar skirt, with a pendant at his left and a jade ring at his right, both hands grasping fiery golden bells.

Next, the **Great Spirit of the Middle Prime**:
Named *Xuan Du*, styled *Su Kang*, his neck bearing a halo of radiance, crowned with a *Fu Chen* coronet, draped in a crimson feathered mantle, girded with a dragon belt and tiger-patterned robe.

Last, the **Great Spirit of the Lower Prime**:
Named *Kang Meng*, styled *Liu Yu*, wearing a *Fu Hua* coronet of green jade, a yellow phoenix-feathered mantle, a dragon robe and tiger belt, bearing fiery golden bells at his waist, and holding the rays of the sun in his hands.

The Three Spirits sit facing you, bidding you sit with your back to the Primal Star. With reverent heart, bow to them. In deep concentration, as if in a trance, visualize the Three Great Spirits asking: *Why do you not hasten to prostrate yourself?* You reply: *I fear the myriad demons of the Six Heavens and Three Officials.* The Three Spirits grow wrathful together, shaking their bells and exhaling qi, their radiance flashing across the eight directions.

Suddenly, you see a maiden, her form like an infant, seated before the Three Spirits facing you. She exhales purple mist, which enters your heart, and calls out: *I am the Ninefold Essence of the Dipper’s Yin Spirit, the Jade Clarity Sovereign Consort of the Upper Realm, named Mihua, styled Linqian.* Then swallow your saliva nine times, click your teeth nine times, and press your left hand to your heart. Recite the incantation:

The Supreme Elixir of Cinnabar, its numinous radiance flashing like a whirlwind. The nine wefts unfurl in revolution, their luminous qi diffusing and dispersing. The Purple Palace’s hidden torch, the Seven Luminaries flourish and scatter. The Two Effulgences present their brilliance, yin and yang now divided. The Four Measures turn in prosperity, cloudy ford-waters swirl and irrigate. Auspicious moments awaken qi, ascending to the Nine Origins. Grasping the Dipper, clambering the Celestial Stem, I present myself to the Three Lords. They ask why I tarry: *Why do you not ascend as an immortal?* I bow my head in reverence, saying: *I fear the ghosts and dare not advance.* The Emperor then blazes in majesty, his mouth holding the root of the sun. To the left, he shatters the Six Heavens; to the right, he tramples Mount Deng. His streaming bells blaze above, the demon chiefs shatter and disperse. He expels my seven *po*, strengthens my three *hun*. Concealed within the Dipper’s sway, the Nine Essences reside in my heart. Purple auroras glow in cavernous reflection, flying radiance spans ten thousand fathoms. Harmonizing *hun* and restraining *po*, the Six Embryos refine and temper. Through essence’s resonance, the stars transform—suddenly the Jade Consort appears. Seated upon my heart, she gazes down and looks up. Her name is Mihua, her style Linqian. She exhales and inhales crimson mist, pacifying the hundred passages. She wears a brocade mantle, phoenix-light and simurgh-skirt. Her waistband is tiger-script, her robe dragon-patterned with jade inscriptions. In her hand she holds Moon’s Splendor, her head crowned with a purple coronet. She soars into the Great Empyrean, riding a canopy of light and clouds. Inscribed as *The Great Simplicity*, I attain flight as an immortal. Rising and floating through the Hollow Cavern, I suspend jade in the Supreme Origin. Ascending to the Vermilion Chamber, I command the myriad spirits. The registers divide into two measures, returning to an infant’s visage. The Northern Emperor unleashes thunder, the Southern Emperor arrays fire. The Eastern Granary kindles its torch, resplendent with thunderous roars. The Western Flow doubles its blows, chiming tones in harmonious accord. Four times I rise and leap, presenting myself to the Jade Perfected. Then I mount the Eight Effulgences, roaming through purple mists.

When finished, raise the hands as before, swallow saliva thirty times, and click the teeth nine times. Upon completing the incantation, rise and bow twice to the northwest, closing the eyes to visualize Mihua above, now suffused with primordial qi.

The Master says: On the first, third, and fifth days, visualize the Mud-Pill Palace, swallow saliva fifty times, click the teeth nine times, and with the left hand pinch the center between the brows while softly reciting the incantation:

*Supreme Purple Radiance, spirit of the Nine Conduits. Canopy of seven descents, illuminating the myriad spirits. In motion, you command the lofty numina; in stillness, you harmonize with luminous qi. Yin and yang flow and irrigate, the Three Qi divide at the center. Roaming and crossing beyond all bounds, you illumine the host of heavens. This month, at dawn’s first light, ascend to the Mud-Pill Palace. Without essence’s congealed resonance, transform into a great spirit. Named Wondrous Sword, styled Numinous Might. Seated upright within the Dipper, roaming my Hall of Light. Phoenix-plumed purple mantle, tiger-brocade cinnabar robe. Left side girded with jade pendants, right waist adorned with golden bells. Hand grasping streaming bells, head crowned with dawn’s radiance. Exhaling qi to irrigate and bathe, the Mud-Pill Palace is made whole. Harmonizing *hun* and *po*, planting the flowering pillars and beams. Enabling my flight as an immortal, transcending the void to tread the empty. Ascending to the Supreme Clarity, driving tigers and commanding dragons. Facing north to the Jade Emperor, in the Jasper Forest’s Upper Palace. Journeying west to the Great Simplicity, bowing to the Three Origins.*

When finished, press the hands again, swallow saliva nine times, and click the teeth nine times. Upon completing the incantation, rise and bow twice to the north, then twice to the northwest.

The Master says: On the seventh, ninth, and thirteenth days, visualize the Crimson Palace, swallow saliva fifty times, click the teeth nine times, and with the right index finger gently press while softly reciting the incantation, pinching the heart and softly intoning:

*Supreme Purple Perfection, numinous spirit of the Nine Qi’s center. Encompassing the myriad measures, the revolving mechanism shines resplendent. Flying auroras stream with radiance, their brilliance illuminating the Jade Clarity. Mystic canopy of the host of spirits, come to respond in the heart’s courtyard. Flying light descends in effulgence, the Middle Origin fills to abundance. The Six Palaces open and unfold, flowering liquid levels and smooths. Refining *hun* and *po*, attaining the essence of the Perfected. Through resonance and transformative touch, a hundred thousand changes arise in an instant. Suddenly a great spirit appears, seated upright in the Chamber of Tranquility. Solemnly facing the Perfected, a hundred joints open and align. Grasping the Dipper and clinging to the Ladle, gazing at the sun in a hundred directions. Named Xuan Du, styled Su Kang. Crimson-feathered flowering mantle, dragon-sash and tiger-robe. Body suffused with precious radiance, neck bearing a halo of light. Head crowned with flying dawn, lotus coronet soaring aloft. Enabling my flight as an immortal, transcending and floating through the Great Void. Ascending to the Purple Gates, facing north to the Jade Emperor. Commanding the myriad spirits, the host of numina welcome and receive. Flowers bloom upon the heart, auspicious clouds flourish eternally. Phoenix flutes ring clear, simurgh pipes chime in harmony.*

When finished, press the hands again, swallow saliva nine times, and click the teeth nine times. Upon completing the incantation, bow twice as before.

The Master says: On the fifteenth, nineteenth, and twenty-second days, visualize the Cinnabar Field Palace, swallow saliva sixty times, click the teeth nine times, and with the left hand’s second finger pinch the philtrum while softly reciting the incantation:

*Supreme Purple Emperor, resplendent and bright at the central pivot. The Nine Wefts glow in misty radiance, light penetrating the Supreme Subtlety. The myriad spirits gaze in reverence, a thousand spirits plant their roots. Seven times pinch the philtrum, softly reciting: Dividing the petals to restrain yang, manifesting compliance to grasp yin. Harmonizing their radiance, awakening the array of the Mystic Root. Things arrayed in... the moon’s inception is most auspicious. Observing the response within the navel, purple qi issues forth in auroras. Flying light plunges and descends, refining my *hun* and *po*. Flowering essence gleams and flourishes—suddenly a great spirit appears. Numinous and noble of the Upper Palace, named Kang Meng, styled Liu Yu. Seated upright within the navel, riding the Dipper’s Nine Qi, exhaling and inhaling cloudy liquid. Balancing blood and ordering the stomach, yellow phoenix-feathered mantle. Dragon robe and tiger sash... kindling the sun’s root. Head crowned with green lotus, waist streaming with fire bells. Lightning flashes in boundless reflection, enabling my flight as an immortal. Transcending the void to tread the floating, ascending to the Jade Chamber. Bearing the Empyrean’s emptiness, commanding the myriad spirits, heaven and earth share in repose.*

Press the hands again, swallow saliva twenty times, and click the teeth nine times. Upon completing the incantation, rise and bow twice toward your natal constellation.

The Master says: The above is called *Ascending the Dipper and Rushing the Celestial Stem*, able to restrain *hun* and control *po*, augment qi and extend years. Summoning the Perfected and attracting the numinous all begin from this. *Reclining with the Dipper.*

The Master says: For all morning and evening repose, first visualize the Nine August Stars upon your sleeping mat. Stand at the foot of the bed facing north, both hands clasping the heart, close the qi and shut the eyes. Visualize the Northern Dipper in the heavens along with the Imperial Nine Stars, each in their proper seasonal positions, descending gently to the mat in ordered array as depicted. Let the Celestial Pass form the shape of the monthly Stem-Dipper, nine feet in length and six feet in breadth, encircling the true stars beyond. On the evening of the new moon, also visualize the Morning Canopy Star descending together with them, likewise arrayed as in the diagram.

From the *Kui* down to the Dipper’s mouth, enter the *Kui* from beyond the honored stars. Lie supine, close the eyes, and visualize the stars as orbs of radiant light—purple in hue, their edges crimson—encircling them as if pacing the diagram. Let my head align with the Nine Poles, drawing true qi into the Mud-Pill Palace. Let the true stars rest directly above the crown, visualizing the true qi’s purple radiance following the body into the Mud-Pill, overflowing to suffuse the head and brain, its light illuminating and penetrating all. Tread upon the honored stars, and with the heart’s intent, ascend as an immortal, commanding the Grand Tenuity to govern my three *hun*.

Slightly bend the left foot, pressing the toes upon the Emperor Star, and with the heart’s intent, ascend as an immortal, commanding the Most High to restrain my seven *po*. Extend the right foot to tread upon it, the left hand grasping the Northern Terrace. The Northern Terrace is the essence of the Origin Star. Raise the left hand slightly, embracing the nether cord of the Origin Star, its form resting in the tiger’s mouth. The right hand holds the Pivot Root. The Pivot Root is the essence of the Pivot Star. Invert the right hand, grasping the cord of the Pivot Star, its form resting above the tiger’s mouth.

Next, arrange the body as prescribed, close the eyes, and visualize the Nine Star Lords:
1. The essence of the Great Star, named *Mysterious Pivot Supreme Perfected*. May I ascend as an immortal, riding the void and steering the floating. Visualize the star before the left little finger.
2. The essence of the Origin Star, named *Northern Terrace Supreme Perfected*. May I ascend as an immortal, wandering the Terrace of Flowing Sands. Visualize the left hand grasping it.
3. The essence of the True Star, named *Nine Poles Supreme Perfected*. May I ascend as an immortal, governing the Three Mysteries. Visualize the star above the head.
4. The essence of the Pivot Star, named *Pivot Root Supreme Perfected*. May I ascend as an immortal, my jade name inscribed among the flying immortals. Visualize the right hand holding it.
5. The essence of the Net Star, named *Grand Peace Supreme Perfected*. May I ascend as an immortal, ascending to the Highest Clarity. Visualize the star to the right of the Pivot Star.
6. The essence of the Mechanism Star, named *Life’s Mechanism Supreme Perfected*. May I ascend as an immortal, my name recorded in the Grand Tenuity. Visualize the star to the right of the Net Star.
7. The essence of the Pass Star, named *Mysterious Mechanism Supreme Perfected*. May I ascend as an immortal, commanding jade lads. Visualize the star beside the Mechanism Star Lord.
8. The essence of the Emperor Star, named *Most High Jade Sovereign Lord*. May I ascend as an immortal, ascending to the Hall of the Latter Sage. Visualize the star within the *Kui* Star, its net linked to the Pivot Star, aligned with the center of the right foot.
9. The essence of the Honored Star, named *Grand Tenuity Jade Sovereign Lord*. May I ascend as an immortal, entering the cinnabar chamber and jade house. Visualize the star linked to the net of the Great Star, aligned before the left foot.

Next, visualize all nine stars together, click the teeth twenty-one times, and swallow saliva twenty-one times. Recite the incantation:
*Nine Stars, Great Essences, True Lords of the Northern Culmen.
Augment my fetal essence, strengthen my three hun.
To the left, draw the sun’s splendor; to the right, restrain the moon’s crystal.
Within the stems, the Yellow Radiance; above the Primordial Void, the Supreme Perfected.
Let me ascend as an immortal, ascending to the Purple Palace.
Divine Tiger and Jade Talisman guard the Gate of Life.
Myriad evils submit to the law, refined by the Dipper Lords.*

After gazing for a long while, visualize the essence of the Dipper stars suddenly entering the Grotto Chamber. Visualize the nine stars upon the mat along with their net, all dividing their essence into minute forms, then retreating through the qi gate into the Grotto Chamber. Lie supine with the *Kui*’s mouth facing [the mat], so that both the mat and the cheeks possess them. Within the Grotto Chamber and the *Kui*, to the left sits the Yellow Elder Lord, clad in yellow embroidered robes; to the right, my spirit sits opposite the Yellow Elder Lord. Within the mouth resides the Mud-Pill Crimson Child Sovereign Lord, seated facing outward, his light illuminating the entire body, inside and out, penetrating all. The Three Passes and hundred joints all glow crimson. Recite the incantation:
*Grotto Chamber’s Primordial Essence, Crimson Child Supreme Sovereign.
Dipper’s radiant canopy descends to illuminate the Mud-Pill.
Refine and guard bones and blood, restrain and govern po and hun.
Let me ascend as an immortal, riding clouds to ascend the dawn.
Ascend to the Jade Emperor’s court, to the Primordial Sovereign of Grand Unity.*

After the incantation, close the eyes, still the thoughts, forget the form, and rest in serenity.

The Master says: The yin essence of the external Northern Dipper governs immortality, enabling the numinous Grotto Chamber. The yang essence of the Northern Dipper causes the five viscera to generate spontaneously, thus attaining the immortal’s vision and ascending to the Highest Clarity. On the new moon, visualize the Purple Canopy of the Flowery Court; only on the first day of the month visualize the stars above and below the mat dividing their essence to enter the Grotto Chamber. First visualize the Nine August Stars, then the Morning Canopy, next invoke the names of the Nine Stars, and proceed to completion.

At dawn when rising, silently click the teeth fourteen times and swallow saliva fourteen times. Recite the incantation:
*Celestial Origin’s High Dipper, within dwell seven lads.
Highest Clarity’s purple essence resides within my body.
Flowery Dawn’s Purple Canopy, Primordial Palace of Grand Simplicity.
Bestow the sacred numinous qi, descending into the Grotto Chamber.
Let me ascend as an immortal, ascending to the Jade Hall of the Grand Ultimate.*

After the incantation, visualize the nine stars vanishing abruptly. The Morning Canopy of the evening and stems likewise vanish. The "rising at dawn" refers to those who practice this method exclusively. If other tasks are undertaken during the night, one should also recite the incantation before rising.

**Returning to the Origin Formula**
The Master says: Though *Rushing the Celestial Stem and Reclining with the Dipper* have been practiced, those of lesser learning who have accumulated merit and unclean sins yet unable to dissolve them must perform this method to repent and wash away transgressions before ascending as perfected.
