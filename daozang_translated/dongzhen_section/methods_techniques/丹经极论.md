**The Ultimate Treatise on the Elixir Canon**

Before the primordial chaos preceding heaven and earth, true lead existed in its nascent form, having attained the One. Thereafter, heaven and earth gradually emerged, followed by yin and yang, the Five Phases, and the myriad beings. Thus, lead is the parent of heaven and earth and the root of yin and yang. The sages extract the root of heaven and earth—the parents—and take the mother of yin and yang as the mother of the elixir. If one cannot comprehend that which gives birth to heaven, earth, yin, and yang, one has not grasped the Way of the golden liquid returning elixir. To use the Five Metals, Eight Stones, plant ashes, morning dew, frost, snow, ice, or other miscellaneous substances produced *after* heaven and earth and yin and yang as ingredients is surely difficult!

Those of like mind, after long reflection, will awaken to this truth. Unless one cleaves open the primordial chaos to behold the root of heaven and earth, and splits the vast expanse to perceive the mother of yin and yang, one cannot discuss the true Way of the golden liquid returning elixir. Those who attain understanding will grasp this—beware of straying into side paths and crooked byways.

True lead is the true qi of the One. The original yang qi of the human body scatters daily, and only by its coagulation can the sacred embryo form. Thus, the sages gather true lead to refine it, causing it to coagulate into cinnabar. Daily, they apply the fire, gradually adding mercury. As mercury increases, the qi of lead dissipates, hence the process of "withdrawing lead and adding mercury." After ten months of practice, when lead is exhausted and mercury dried, it transforms into the golden liquid returning elixir, and the form becomes purely yang!

Lead is the fire of heaven and earth, the foundation of the parents yin and yang. The sages gather the root of heaven and earth—the parents—as the foundation of the great medicine, and extract the pure essence of yin and yang as the substance of the great elixir. This is no ordinary alchemical process.

Mercury’s nature is to flee, but it coalesces upon encountering lead, for mother and child cling to one another. Before the primordial chaos preceding heaven and earth, true lead attained the One and took form first, gradually giving rise to heaven and earth, yin and yang, the Five Phases, and the myriad beings. Using the pre-heaven yang elixir to refine one’s own yin mercury, one immediately becomes purely yang! Thereafter, refining within the body to produce the golden liquid returning elixir—since the true transformation occurs within—is called the "inner medicine" and "inner elixir." Though the natural true fire blazes ceaselessly within the earthen crucible, one must rely on the external furnace, diligently applying the work of increasing, concealing, withdrawing, and adding, operating without error or negligence until completion. Yet the true fires—both inner and outer—undergo boundless transformations, all dependent on the wondrous efficacy of true lead.

This substance alone can capture mercury, preventing its flight. Though the two medicines—inner and outer—differ in form, their function is one and the same. The reason for inner and outer medicines lies in the fact that the human body receives the refined qi of the heavenly Way at birth and is shaped by the molding of yin and yang. Thus, within the body, essence and qi are fundamental, with spirit born of qi and qi born of essence. Yet these three treasures are all post-heaven qi, products of the utmost yin. For those who cultivate the truth, refining essence, qi, and spirit is paramount. However, since these three are all post-heaven and purely yin, lacking yang, how can they transform into pure yang and transcend heaven and earth?

Thus, the ancestral masters said: "Lone yin cannot generate on its own. One must gather the pre-heaven qi of the One, using true yin and true yang—substances of the same kind in the ratio of two to eight—to capture them within a single moment, refining them into a grain of utmost yang elixir, called true lead." Since this transformation occurs externally, it is termed the "outer medicine." Using this yang elixir to capture one’s own yin mercury is like a cat catching a mouse. The yang elixir is the mother qi of heaven and earth, while one’s own mercury is the child qi of heaven and earth. Using the mother qi to subdue the child qi—are they not of the same qi?

It is also said: Before the primordial chaos preceding heaven and earth, true lead attained the One and gradually gave rise to heaven and earth, yin and yang, the Five Phases, and the myriad beings—this proves that the golden elixir is the pre-heaven qi of the One. Using the pre-heaven yang elixir to refine one’s own yin mercury transforms it into pure yang. Further aided by the fire of yin and yang symbols—advancing, retreating, withdrawing, and adding—after ten months of practice, the form transforms into qi, qi into spirit, and spirit unites with the Dao, becoming formless and unfathomably mutable. Thus, one transcends heaven and earth, standing beyond creation, grasping and molding heaven and earth,

The One is qi. If one can circulate the true qi of the Great One, harmonizing it with one’s own true qi, embracing the Supreme Harmony, and refining it over time, this becomes the Great Elixir. The Elixir is pure yang, and yang is the Dao of Heaven. Thus, when spirit abandons the Dao and gathers, it takes form; when it scatters, it becomes qi. Those who commune with the Dao are nourished by the Dao through qi.

To cultivate spirit is to preserve harmony with the Dao of Heaven. When essence and qi mutually sustain one another and are refined over time, this is called "refining the form with pure yang." Fire is yang, and breath is wind. Using wind to blow fire refines the form, and both spirit and form attain subtlety—this is called "refinement." To refine the form with form, one must first concentrate the mind within, allowing true qi to surge in harmony. This is the pure essence of yang qi, circulating without cease, ascending and descending, cycling endlessly, embracing all things—thus it is yang of the Elixir.

Heaven’s qi descends and then ascends; earth’s qi ascends and then descends. The yang essence of heaven crystallizes as the sun, and the yin essence of earth crystallizes as the moon. If one grasps the mechanism of the Dipper’s handle, one naturally revolves the sun and moon, circulating without rest—this is the Dao of refining spirit with pure yang. Those who cultivate the Elixir gather the essence of the sun and moon, unite the numinous qi of yin and yang, and when the cycle of stars is complete and yin and yang are exhausted, they return the merit to the virtue of earth, and spirit and essence are perfected.

The transformations of the Qian Dao establish the nature and mandate of all things. The Dao of transformation arises from the primordial within nature, yet it must rely on mandate as its body; mandate emerges from the existent within the non-existent, yet it must employ nature as its function. When nature is disturbed by emotions, mandate declines with desire. When mandate is flourishing, spirit is whole and nature thrives; when mandate wanes, nature weakens and spirit dims.

Nature is the Dao, spirit, function, stillness, and yin within yang; mandate is life, body, movement, and yang within yin. These two depend on each other—neither can be lacking. Solitary yang cannot stand, and solitary yin cannot form. Only when body and function are both complete does the wondrous Dao emerge.

Master Lü said: "Enlightening empty nature without refining the Elixir, even after ten thousand kalpas, the yin spirit will struggle to attain sagehood." Master Dou said: "Seeking awakening through Chan, exhausting words to inquire into realization—seeing nature, how could one know it is like a dream? It is no different from a mad monkey grasping at the moon’s reflection in water. How can one seize the moon’s light and bring it back?"

Yang essence is the essence of the True One, the qi of utmost yang, called Yang Elixir. One’s own true qi belongs to yin and governs the entire body with its hundred bones. When the Yang Elixir arrives from without to subdue one’s yin mercury, the Yang Elixir becomes the master, and one’s mercury becomes the guest. When these two long for each other, they congeal into golden sand, naturally neither flying nor fleeing. Then, with the addition of fire, they are nurtured and tempered into the Golden Elixir of Return.

Thus, the Yang Elixir is external and called "distant"; one’s own yin mercury is internal and called "intimate." Reversing this intimacy and distance to determine master and guest—this is how the Dao is accomplished! The true Dao nourishes spirit. If one can guard the self at the barrier where qi dies, even the withered bones of seven generations will be infused with life qi. That which gives me life is the Dao; that which animates me is spirit. To guard spirit with the Dao and nourish spirit with the Dao—this is the way.

The external medicine is the Elixir. In the crucible of creation, the true qi of the One is refined. When the work is complete, success is achieved in half a double-hour. The internal medicine is the Golden Elixir of Return, which requires ten months to complete the spiritual embryo’s gestation.

Though these two medicines operate through the same yin-yang transformations of creation, their methods of applying fire and timing differ greatly. For the external medicine, the fire timing requires the body and mind to remain unmoving, breath to be natural, and spirit and qi to enter their root. If closure is too extreme, it becomes strained; if release is too indulgent, it becomes scattered. Only by maintaining unbroken continuity can spirit naturally congeal and breath naturally settle.

The work of circulating fire is like cooking a small fish—neither excessive nor insufficient. When the initial qi sprouts, it lies in the "gathering without gathering." It exists yet does not exist—this is nurturing the tender yang with subtle yang. Then, focus attention within the compass, with each breath returning to the root. With intention, stabilize qi, gradually circulating fire in ascent and descent, cycling endlessly. One must not rigidly fixate on stillness, lest it lead to blockage.

Thus, the revolutions of yin and yang are the wondrous workings of Qian and Kun, yet few comprehend them. If heaven and earth did not revolve, qi would stagnate, and the myriad things would not arise. If a person does not revolve, qi becomes blocked, and the Elixir cannot be produced. How then could one attain the same longevity as heaven and earth?

A single cycle’s work is completed in nine revolutions. After prolonged firing, one feels a subtle surge of spirit and qi. When the fire timing is complete and clarity resides within, yin and yang separate—then one should withdraw the fire and nurture it for a time. Then, resume firing, gradually refining until extreme emptiness is attained and profound stillness is maintained. Body and mind unite, spirit and qi merge, the hundred bones and nine orifices feel as if bathed, and the twin gates of the spine blaze like fire—only then can one be called pure yang.

Those who cultivate refinement must be fluid in seizing the moment, knowing when to advance and retreat, preserving or relinquishing without loss—they become sages.

For the internal medicine’s work: The true qi of the One is formless and indistinct. Without the union of the two eights’ yin and yang qi, how could it descend and manifest as the grain-like form of the Elixir? Yet even after ingesting this grain-like Elixir, without the misty warmth of yin-yang fire, how could it transform into the Golden Elixir?

The true qi of the One, within the crucible of creation, is tempered by true fire. Its light pierces the curtains, and golden radiance fills the chamber. This is the true yin and true yang refining the union of the two qi, producing the grain-like Elixir. When swallowed and carried into the cinnabar field of the abdomen...

Within, it transmutes the yang soul to dissolve the yin corporeal spirit. At this moment, the singular qi circulates back into the body, descending from the Mud Pill Palace, and one feels the five viscera grow crystalline and cold, golden light suffusing the entire form—success hinges upon this instant.

Yet within the body, there remains the work of ten months: applying the methods of withdrawal and addition, guarding against danger and foreseeing peril. This is the time described as *"the mud-snake in the well dances on the mulberry branch, the moon at the window illumines the plum and pear; in the night’s chaos, the earth crumbles, yet the ten thousand images remain unseen."*

Having obtained this elixir, the scriptures expound at length on the yang elixir. After it has transmuted one’s own yin mercury, one must operate the fire with an empty mind, harmonizing without attachment. The union of yin and yang is governed by breath; breath is directed by spirit-qi, spirit-qi by water and fire, and water and fire by fetal breathing. Flowing ceaselessly, Kan and Li merge, giving birth to the Golden Elixir.

The mechanism of yin-yang transformation does not rely on initial effort. Once ascended, it descends from the Mud Pill Palace—what is called "settling below to stabilize the human body’s Mud Pill and Crimson Palace, regulating the five qi and harmonizing the hundred spirits." Here, one forgets qi to nourish spirit, continuing downward in a gentle, silent ascent.

The oral instruction states:
*"Concentrate qi to attain suppleness, like an infant free of filth and scattered thoughts. Still the mind and guard the One; external perceptions do not enter, internal perceptions do not depart. All day, remain in primordial chaos, as if within the womb.
Spirit settles to meet qi, qi harmonizes to unite with spirit. Spirit congeals with qi, and qi clings to spirit to abide.
In the realm of profound stillness and great rest, in the boundless expanse of nothingness, the heart is ashen and obscure, like a hen brooding her eggs, like a fish in water. Exhale to the root, inhale to the stem, continuously preserving it—guard the single breath within the womb.
Further, withdraw from worldly dust, sever sight and sound, reduce food and drink, and abstain from sleep. Then, in effortless motion, let it move of itself, and in self-moving effortlessness, do not cling to holding or guarding, nor fixate on advancing the fire.
Over time, nurture the Child Pearl. As the saying goes: 'When the medicine is ripe, no fire-timing is needed; clinging to fire-timing will harm the elixir. Simply preserve it without loss—thirst, fatigue, hunger, and sleep will regulate themselves.'*

At the moment the elixir forms, one suddenly feels the spine surge upward to the Mud Pill Palace, a trickling sound arising, as if something brushes against the brain from the head. Momentarily, like sparrow eggs, pellets descend in succession through the *Heavy Tower*, cool as ice, sweet as butter, their savor incomparable. Sensing this, one has obtained the Golden Elixir of Return. Slowly swallow it into the cinnabar field without cease.

The five viscera grow crystalline and cold. With eyes closed, one inwardly observes the organs distinctly, as if illuminated by a candle. Gradually, myriad golden rays suffuse the body. After ten months of work, the Sacred Embryo is complete, and the spirit is refined to emerge from its vessel.

**Emergence of the Spirit**
Since ancient times, the emergence of the immortal’s spirit has followed no other method—this spirit is the original spirit of one’s own body. When qi is full, the spirit becomes numinous; when the spirit is numinous, it emerges naturally, unlike the methods of visualization.

The emergence of the yang spirit cannot be seen or known by ghosts and deities. If ghosts and deities can see or know it, it is of the same kind as the yin spirit, not the yang spirit. After three years and a thousand days of work, with cultivation complete and qi full, the spirit whole, one moves freely in and out.

The body outside the body is the Dharma-body: when gathered, it takes form; when dispersed, it becomes qi. It cannot be conceived or discussed in terms of form. The yin spirit, being formless, cannot divide itself or transform into forms. The yang spirit can manifest as one body or a hundred, each capable of eating and interacting. When reunited, they merge into one—what is called *"sacred yet unknowable."*

The spirit’s concealment and manifestation are unfathomable, its transformations infinite. A thousand or ten thousand miles away, it arrives in an instant. Past and future events are all foreknown—only then can it be called the yang spirit.

The yang spirit’s emergence and return both occur through the Heavenly Gate. When the Heavenly Gate first opens, it feels like an axe splitting the brain—do not be startled. Like an infant gazing at the door, guard it in a secluded chamber, and do not emerge lightly. Initially, it circles to the left and right, turning to regard the spirit’s dwelling. When the spirit’s emergence is familiar, whether eyes are open or closed, one sees oneself.

Then, let it come and go in the void. Begin with ten steps, then a hundred, then a thousand, gradually extending farther. When sending it out, immediately recall it. Over time, one may let it roam freely at will.

When the spirit emerges, leave one spirit to watch the dwelling and command the guardian deities to protect and ward it. The guardian is the golden-armored deity within the brain. When emerging, entrust it to steady the top of the head, lest false apparitions, assuming names and forms, enter the spirit’s dwelling—do not permit their entry. Upon returning, call one’s own name, and they merge into one. Without three years and nine years of work, how could one reach this stage?

**Verses from *Wuzhen Yipian***
*"The ethereal gathers and scatters—this is essence and soul.
The wise call it Qian and Kun.
The Dao of Change encompasses heaven and earth’s transformations;
Do not cling to the ten thousand images in words and theories."*

**Four Seasons**
*"Flowers bloom in four seasons at the four-point pavilion,
The wind carries their fragrance, wafting sweetness to all.
I urge you to gather them in their proper time—
Do not let the delicate reds scatter heedlessly."*

**West River Moon**
*"The elixir is the wondrous treasure of the colored body,
The Dharma-body is the true heart.
From the beginning, it has been without color or sound—
One entity, no need for dual recognition.
The ten thousand dharmas are neither nonexistent nor existent;
Neither existence nor nonexistence—do not seek them.
Abandon both extremes, abide in the center—
This is the supreme path to choosing the Buddha."*

**Another Verse**
*"Principle has no past or present,
This heart—what joy, what anger?
The formless is the true form;
The colored body is the Dharma-body.
No need for half a phrase or a single word—
It enlivens a thousand, ten thousand people.
Ah!
Here is the ultimate destination—
Why keep turning over the body?"*

**Stanzas on Returning the Elixir and Restoring Life**

**Quatrains**
The altar rises in three tiers, eleven levels high,
Eight directions harmonize—earth is supreme.
Lord Ding relies wholly on the Yellow Dame’s power,
North and south devour each other, restraining soul and spirit.

Guarding the One within the altar, dust is left behind,
Each line observed, each line perfected.
This heart resembles embers in chaff—
In silent sitting, the drip of water-clock is heard.

First sprinkle divine water upon the Kun Palace,
Raise the west, then merge with the east.
To know the Dao’s profound and subtle principle,
The sun shifts into the moon’s radiance.

The Gate of Mystery and Darkness—know it well,
Few grasp it, fewer still begin.
If you still doubt the principle of longevity,
Go ask the mulberry and gaze upon the plum trellis.

**Five-Character Verses**
Having received the true immortal’s formula,
Within yin refine to utmost yang.
Where the earth’s thunder stirs in concealment,
Stars and constellations confer together.

The Eight Trigrams form the mother,
The Three Powers first appear in flourishing.
No longer troubled by the bonds of life and death,
Surely you will perceive heaven and earth enduring.

The discourse on the Elixir Canon concludes.
