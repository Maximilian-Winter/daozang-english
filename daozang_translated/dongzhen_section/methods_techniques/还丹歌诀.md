**Verses on the Returned Elixir**

**Title:** *Verses on the Returned Elixir*
Originally compiled by Yuanyangzi, likely composed in the late Tang or Five Dynasties period. Two fascicles: the first collects ten verses on the returned elixir from various masters; the second contains *The Song of Golden Liquor* by Yuanyangzi (Yang Canwei). Though the verses align with those in *Yuanyangzi’s Collected Writings on Golden Liquor*, the annotations differ. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* section, *Methods* category.

**Fascicle One of *Verses on the Returned Elixir***
*Compiled by Yuanyangzi*

**The Song of the Ancient Immortals’ Affairs**

The world knows not the Dao’s depth or shallowness,
Scorning its subtle signs, faith wavers thin.
Faith itself lacks firmness from the start,
Erroneous study leaves the Dao ungrasped within.
Blind transmission, credulous belief—all goes awry,
Who ponders the gate of life and death’s mystery?
The primal mechanism holds sixteen thousand doors,
Refining the po, refining form, refining the medicine too.
Those who master heaven and man must perfect all,
Thus the heavens promote them to celestial office true.
The narrow-minded, ignorant common folk,
Seek to become immortals—how hard the task they view!

Some may chance upon a single method’s shield,
Yet of the Dao’s ten thousand arts, not one they know.
Since ancient times, those who fail to cultivate immortality
Mostly err in practice, their paths askew.
Do not trust the idle Daoists of the bustling market,
Who knead butter, spit filth, and swallow saliva’s flow.
Proud of "River Chariot" guiding breaths as novices,
They grasp not the subtle, bending limbs in vain.
Boasting of "chamber arts" with exotic claims,
Yet never reversing yellow or turning black again.
Stumbling in the current, they surely harm their primal qi,
Divining by hexagrams, they stray from the law’s domain.
When fire-toxins blaze, deafness must ensue,
Without the elixir, vainly forcing qi to rise in vain.
Few thoughts, few desires—no illness takes root,
All arts pale before the four great emptinesses’ truth.
Suddenly ceasing alchemy, wasting years in idle drift,
Medicine stilled, qi stilled—no moment’s pause allowed.
The root of death’s decay is not as they suppose,
The five viscera must be thoroughly refined and drained.
Spitting a crimson cherry from the mouth,
This is not the five phases within the body’s frame.
Failing to harmonize yin and yang into the supreme medicine,
Life and death remain bound to the Three Worms’ claim.
Some feast on rosy clouds, swallowing the two luminaries,
Blinding their eyes, spinning like echoes in a mirror’s game.
Those who practice qi-circulation follow countless rules,
Yet invite wind-evil, unaware of their own blame.
Some wield talismans to command ghosts and spirits,
While the golden elixir eludes them, their bodies frail as dreams.
When the hundred bones scatter, they return to dust,
A single thing reversed—ghosts and kin lament in vain.

Or they speak of "exiting the spirit" through meditative vision,
Yet the wondrous true emptiness remains unseen.
Falsely claiming to borrow a dwelling or enter a womb,
They cycle through the four births, bound to rebirth’s wheel.
Some binge on food and wine, their faces ruddy, strength immense,
Voices like thunder, boasting of true immortal arts.
Yet this is but the vigor of innate yang’s abundance,
Not the fruit of alchemy’s transformative part.
Some sleep drunk through wind and rain,
Their warmth but the wine’s fire, their cold the winter’s bane.
Sober, they shiver in thin robes,
No different from ordinary folk in their suffering’s pain.

Speaking of inner elixirs—mere illusions, empty forms,
Deluded minds chase phantoms, lost in vain.
Thinking of a virgin girl will not conceive a child,
A hen’s egg holds no life within.
Some claim to be long-lived men of distant ages,
Having received the sword’s secret from Dongbin’s hand.
They deceive the foolish and ignorant,
Passing days in wine and chess, their bonds unplanned.
Some boast of "yellow and white" arts to cheat and steal,
A thousand herbs and stones spawn illusions grand.
The immortals’ medicine lies within the five phases,
Who can fathom its workings, its blessings command?
Such charlatans abound,
Staving off hunger and cold, avoiding life’s hard span.
Unknowing of the Dao’s true root and stem,
They age and die like hemp—what recourse remains?

Even ancient immortals repaid past debts,
Disguised in humble guise, they begged in secret ways.
Amidst mud, tiles, and rubble they dwelt,
Yet within, their jade and treasures lay.
Those who feign the Dao in Yan’s land follow this path,
Mute, their silence startles none.
Unlettered, their conduct unrefined,
Their poverty and suffering mark them as the fallen one.

To cultivate immortality, first perfect merit and conduct,
When deeds are full, heaven and man refine life’s thread.
Empty words of longing for the Dao, without cultivating the heart,
At death, the unrectified heart is to blame instead.
Some, with scant knowledge, hastily erect a hut,
Seeking fame and praise, emulating the southern flight’s aim.
Failing, they turn back—only to die,
Leaving behind slander for later men to proclaim.

Others, with shallow grasp of Chan’s words,
Cling to the ten thousand images in their minds.
One day, their walking corpses suddenly perish,
The crowd calls it "transformation" or "corpse-liberation" in kind.
The great Dao’s true principle is not so,
Ascending with one’s dwelling—this is the ancient, enduring lore.
Misled by deviant arts, they die in vain,
Yet still they speak of immortals whose forms transcend the mortal shore.

Consider the deceptive, heterodox, and illusory arts,
Walking on water, flying through space—yet all is known.
How can such "immortals" transform their bodies’ gate,
If they cannot reverse aging, preserving form and bone?
To cross the living, save the dead—only the elixir suffices,
Transmuting the five phases, qi and form made whole again.
The golden elixir grants heaven and man’s longevity,
All other arts but briefly extend the span of years’ chain.

The immortal formulas are clearly transmitted in the world,
The Three Caverns, Four Supplements—how can they be counted?
High immortals since ancient times arose from kings and lords,
The biased views of common fools—how can they be anointed?
Of old, the Heavenly Master met the Old Lord,
Receiving a thousand scrolls, celestial texts descended.
Ge Hong’s ten thousand volumes were deemed few,
Sun Simiao’s reclusion—all were widely learned.

The ancients’ enlightenment came through texts and meaning,
Yet today’s men cling to poor teachers’ creeds.
The wise, through texts, find their masters,
The dull seek in vain—how hard the path proceeds!
Scholars past and present pore over the *Cantong Qi*,
Its purport lies within, yet differences abound.
Failing to grasp the source, the true intent,
Even in old age, its meaning remains shrouded, unsound.

Call it "inner"—speaking of tripods and furnaces, they seem to know,
Call it "outer"—generating form from formlessness, they fail to see.
The *Cantong Qi*’s meaning is fundamentally clear,
Without a master’s transmission, it remains obscure eternally.
Heaven bestows subtle guidance for a reason,
Meeting a master, receiving the formula—true lead is seen.
True lead is the metal within water,
Born from the indistinct, before heaven and earth’s sheen.

The northern sun, the southern moon,
Yellow silver, white gold—each in its eightfold measure.
Dragon and tiger wage war, metal and wood intertwine,
First liquid, then congealed—the ointment’s body smooth and pure.
Eighty-one hues of true Kan and Li,
The medicine arises, the three and five unite in one’s cure.

At times, one opens their mouth to ask fellow practitioners—
Who truly knows the White Tiger’s pivotal refining?
The *Huangzhong* pitch far surpasses *Dacu*,
Direct signs and affairs follow the stars and cleaving water-clocks.
The *wu-yin* and *shen* offices mark solstices and equinoxes,
The *jiazi* and *jisi* divide the primal seasons.
Hexagrammic fire waxes and wanes through nine cycles,
Blue, yellow, red, white revolve in turn.
Within the furnace lies another heaven and earth,
Cold and heat, dawn and dusk traverse Fan Mountain.
The thief of creation comes—hard to speak plainly—
The Five Phases engender and yet assail one another.
In a single day, a year is seized;
In a year’s exchange, a month is found.
When the moon moves to *ding*, the medicine rises and falls—
This is metal’s journey from the land of fire.
When the moon moves to *bing*, the Returned Elixir submits;
At *si*, metal is born, mercury’s nature perishes.
From *zi* to *si*, the Qian body is complete;
From *wu* to *hai*, it begins anew.
Inverting and balancing, refining yin and yang—
Who discerns the true Metal and Wood?
At *mao* and *you*, Metal and Wood appear,
The bodies of *jia* and *geng* inherently float and sink.
A full cycle lacks but thirty spokes,
Yet in a month’s reckoning, the hub is seen.
In the second month, the Dipper’s handle turns west,
Four yang respond to the season—elm flowers fall.
In the eighth month, the *Kui* star stands at due *you*,
Shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout—Wood’s work is known.
The *Bo* hexagram: the elixir is complete, yet it slays;
The Nine Returns revive and restore the soul.
Where Bo Yang’s white dog briefly vanished—
Have you heard of this matter or not?
When ingested, old illnesses arise one by one,
Transforming skin, hair, bones, and marrow.
Jade-like skin, gleaming teeth—youth returns,
Another immortal from the Peach Blossom Spring.
A knife-tip of powder transmutes mercury into gold,
When lead and tin are touched, their hue deepens.
The divine elixir at the elbow roams the eight poles,
Traversing mountains and seas, ghosts and spirits revere it.
The divine cinnabar is utterly real, yet without form—
The three scrolls of the *Cantong Qi* bear no single mark.
Learn well to recognize the sun’s radiance and the moon’s glow,
Clearly they are not of this world’s things.
The deluded take cinnabar and mercury,
Or even minerals and metals, to be the true.
True gold, when dead, is like ash and dust,
Thus it earns the name "Bright Window Dust."
I once concealed myself until a master’s guidance—
It was the true divine water of the Flowery Pond.
Attaining the Dao depends on natural affinity,
Who in halls of wealth would believe this?
The world’s eyes see my afflicted frame,
And say illness burdens me—these words are false.
They know not that I am tested by heavenly demons,
When the great medicine touches me, ailments vanish of themselves.
My affinity has led me to know this one truth,
Yet I remain unattached, tending no small defense.
This heart has reached the immortals’ gate,
Though this mortal body still bears mortal ills.
To become a sage or immortal is the highest mechanism—
Those with a share in it know it all.
The three poisons—greed, wrath, delusion—arise from illusion,
Who can fathom their predestination in the Three Palaces?
Things follow fortune and misfortune, coming and going,
Where are those of old when their things remain?
Worldly people are shackled by form and appearance,
Failing to roam freely or refine the self.
Fleeting glory and the ten thousand things are fundamentally empty,
Gaining only a cycle of honor and disgrace in death.
I once dwelled in simplicity for many years,
Studying the classics until I met my master at last.
A single crucible yields flowing pearls—the celestial medicine,
When grape wine ripens, the sea and mountain tryst awaits.

Behold—
Heavenly beings must choose the learning of heavenly beings,
Jade tablets must be carved from fine jade.
Heaven does not hasten the foolish below,
A master craftsman does not select bricks and tiles for casting.
I urge you to read widely and seek broadly,
One arrow cannot raise an army.
An immortal master must be steeped in the learning of heavenly beings—
Truly recognize the red orb and the azure robe.
Wu the True Lord’s song:
The arts of immortals and transcendents are hard to encounter,
Even with toil and suffering, one must endure to see.

Swiftly cultivate hidden virtue while swiftly seeking the classics,
When merit ripens, sudden enlightenment arrives in a single dawn.
The Great Return Elixir is no trifling matter—
Those who ingest it roam heaven and earth.

Do not mistake dead treasure for living gold,
For common mercury and lead are not the true ingredients.
If you wish to know what exists in the world,
Ponder it carefully as one ferments wine:
Wood essence becomes rice steamed seven times,
Golden liquid becomes yeast refined over time.
Western earth and the Pool of Hua’s waters—
This substance has ever moved gods and ghosts.
Seal the crucible’s mouth and circulate it once,
And he who ingests it will exchange his bones and marrow.

If you recognize the yellow sprout yeast,
Refine it, and it will resemble chrysanthemum blossoms.
Ordinary folk do not know the world’s lead,
For the root of worldly lead is inherently different.
Wood essence and golden liquid are not two flavors—
Yin and yang, at their darkest extreme, naturally refine.
Though lead, mercury, rice, and yeast may seem alike,
They must be tempered with the Four Yellows and firewood water.
Without firewood water, transformation is difficult—
How can the Nine Cycles and Seven Returns be achieved?
The ancient immortals spoke only of two flavors,
Never mentioning the matter of refinement and subjugation.
Now the secret is revealed, yet it is not much—
Only the Nine Origins and the Fire Record must be sought.
Alchemists vainly pore over a thousand scrolls,
Only then will they know this song holds true meaning.

Wood becomes the Azure Dragon, gold the White Tiger,
The sun the Vermilion Bird, the moon the Dark Warrior.
When the Four Symbols harmonize in the Central Palace,
Long life is no longer difficult in one’s own body.
Metal, wood, water, and fire form dust—
Who knows which to discard and which to master?
Worldly folk do not grasp the words of perfected beings,
Trusting instead their own hearts and emulating the ancients.
They mislead others onto lost paths,
Unaware that their own bodies will turn to dust.
I urge you to refine the medicine and recognize the tiger—
When yang meets yin, they naturally unite.
Three hundred and sixty like congealed silk,
The chaste maiden becomes the mother of long life.
When the work is complete, rely on the Ninefold City,
Ingest it for a thousand days, and the body ascends.

**Lead and Mercury, Three-Five Chant**
Lead emerges from within lead,
Though of the same nature, they differ.
If you can discern black from white,
The white sun is the immortal’s palace.
*First: Red.*

Do not mistake water for silver,
Nor befriend its lead.
Only when the Azure Dragon emerges
Will transformation be truly natural.
*Second: Black.*

Fire two, water one,
The three return to the east,
The dragon brings rain,
Waiting for the tiger to stir the wind.
*Third: Azure.*

Five is the earth’s position,
The work of wu and ji,
The emperor governs all things,
Nothing is beyond its reach.
*Fourth: Yellow.*

Within the one is another one,
The true one is yang,
The mother of wood,
Arrayed in the west.
*Fifth: White.*

The Perfected One truly understands:
Gold and water become silver,
Quicksilver, white water, earth become gold,
Cinnabar.
Yin and yang, with the great medicine,
Are refined at its heart.
The Four Symbols and Five Phases
All reside within it.
When these two substances transform and succeed,
They become the adepts of the Three Clarities.

**Song of the Perfected One Wei**
Zhen, Li, Kan, and Dui take their forms,
Lead and mercury must first distinguish false from true.
When the dragon parts the eastern dawn, though its traces are hidden,
The tiger departs the western wastes, then the spirit is freed.
In the south, fire awaits its descent and control,
In the north, springs arise to unlock the gate of exchange.
Only these two forge creation—
Do not recklessly mix the Eight Stones with mundane dust.

**The Gathering of the Return Elixir by Master Xiaoyao**
Master Xiaoyao gathers the Return Elixir,
Borrowing the analogy of marriage to illustrate its completion.
With its ingredients—ruler, minister, host, and guest—
Resonating and harmonizing, three matters are arranged.
Listen well, for there is substance in what follows:
A substance dark and profound, chaotic and indistinct,
Pure and numinous—
Heaven cannot kill it, earth cannot punish it.
Why does it exist? From whence does it arise?
Once formed, it does not die—hence it is called long life.
The tortoise must undergo nine transformations,
The rooster seven returns.
When the bones are strong and the flesh at ease,
The spirit bright and the countenance preserved,
One knows the maiden is ready for marriage,
The man fit for union.
A skilled matchmaker arranges the meeting,
The uncle represents heaven and earth.
On an auspicious day, with kin gathered like clouds,
Feasts are laid, seats arranged, inside and out abuzz.
Ah! How splendid and resplendent!

They spread yellow gold for mats, white jade for carpets,
Seating arranged by rank, the worthy and wise in order.
The bold-hearted sit beside the great tiger,
While the other gallant guests stretch out in a line.
Red and radiant, filling the chambers,
The white-haired elder presides over the game,
The Azure Dragon youth guards the door.
Before the gate, carriages and horses crowd the courtyard,
Purple clouds swirl, golden censers burn,
Fragrance thick and rich, ascending to the nine heavens.
Naturally, the kitchen prepares roasted and boiled delicacies,
At the table, calls and laughter intertwine.
The Ghostly Lu Brother pours wine,
The Eastern Family’s disciples tend the fire,
The Ochre Gentleman is summoned to beat time,
The various clans’ youths are ordered to tune their strings.
Long melodies draw out the spring willows,
All at once, purple mist swirls,
The two yellows and four whites are fully present.
Coming and going, rushing and dashing,
Before the people and behind the horses, inhaling and swallowing warmth,
With propriety and justice, no factions or bias.
Some chant "Ten thousand years,"
Others sing of joy for a thousand.
The hall resounds with song, the room with merriment,
The host, seeing this, is delighted and at ease.
He calls for the Unburnt Ash Child to tend the furnace,
The Elm Sweet Child to wipe the table,
Add vegetables, adjust salt and sour,
Warm the wine, let it not grow cold.
The doorkeeper stands watch,
The guests linger, reluctant to part.
"Dear friends, few days remain before we must bid farewell,
Do not fear the deep night or the late hour."
The host harmonizes his voice to soothe the guests’ weariness,
Encouraging the worthy.
A poor household’s gathering,
Yet it is the karma of past lives—
With nothing more to offer, he deeply thanks their kindness.
Then the guests leap up,
Responding with humble words.
Half claim drunkenness, apologizing for their clamor,
Empty-handed and flushed, disturbing the wise.
For three days and six nights, no rest is found.
To serve such poor brothers brings shame beyond measure.
The host says: "We grow like trees, brothers sharing the same root."

Girls who reach marriageable age must be wed,
Boys who come of age must take a wife.
Today we bear witness to this union,
In days to come, remember this deep kindness.
The host remains, the guests depart,
Their hearts still lingering, suspended in longing.
For eight or nine days the door stayed shut,
Only today was it first flung open.
At this moment, rites are complete.
The music has passed its time, kinfolk disperse,
The bride returns to her chamber—
Only the man and woman remain,
Clinging to each other in tender reluctance.
Like sun and moon,
They follow each other through kalpas unending.
This is the one method,
The root and foundation of the Dao.
Not even sages and worthies can fathom it,
Nor gods and spirits comprehend.
Only my master and I have grasped it—
Guard it closely, practice it in secret.
Keep it hidden without fail,
And you will never stray from the Dao.
Let no triple leak occur,
Nor the five know of it.
If you hold to this and the Dao,
Keep it secret, secret—
Such wonders are beyond thought.

Master Xiaoyao says:
Once hidden in mystery, now fierce as a tiger,
Pity the Five Agents—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth.
Yet within them dwells a white-haired elder,
Pointing the way to the azure sky all day long.
If a scholar of the Dao should meet him,
Exert every effort to cherish and grasp this truth.

He also says:
The Dao may be transmitted,
But if kept secret, Heaven’s Way flourishes.
Those who seek long life,
Honor and obey father and mother.

**Ode on the Nine Cycles of the Yellow Lady of Mount Emei**
The old hermit, favored by grace,
Refines the elixir within the forbidden chamber.
In the crucible, all medicines transform,
Above the furnace, mercury takes flight.
Like autumn frost in hue, the jade unites,
Its radiance holding the moon’s nightly glow.
All arises from the Enlightened Lord’s inspiration,
Enabling the Dao’s subtleties to unfold.

First, draw forth the mercury,
Then burn it back into cinnabar.
The method of the immortals is most secret,
The essence of alchemy in the inner court.
Purple-black bears the true color,
Crimson light mingles with dawn’s rosy clouds.
To merge into one body,
One must fiercely refine the Three Flowers.
Cycle upon cycle, delving into the profound,
Layer upon layer, entering the boundless void.
The cinnabar’s body now shifts,
Returning to mercury’s form.
Black as autumn frost, still,
Crimson light like stars at dusk.
Naturally it becomes the marvelous maiden—
What fear is there of failing to attain the numinous?

Though white tin first melts,
The yellow sprout has already congealed.
Like snow descending from heaven,
Or ice forming on a pool’s surface.
Grind the dry earth and stir-fry,
Sift the ash and steam with moisture.
Still, watch for the black hue,
Then wait for the brine to settle.
Regulate the fire with civil and martial balance,
Seal the furnace with yin and yang.
In the crucible, observe the black pass,
In the pot, discern true emptiness.
Reinforce with repeated nurturing,
Guard against the six medicines’ corruption.
Once hardened like joined jade,
Where can one find a straying pearl?

Niter poured into boiling water,
Borax steeped in simmering brew.
Salt’s excess merely transforms,
Alum’s fine grains need no grinding.
Old white hardens at first,
New yellow’s hue not yet firm.
Before placing it in the fire,
Fear the mercury’s fumes.
Cease the fire, open the elixir’s cauldron,
Refine the gold, remove the medicinal mud.
Auspicious light joins sun and moon,
True qi mingles with rainbow’s sheen.
Its form excels the golden tripod,
Its essence gathers toward the horse’s hoof.
Only after nine cycles are complete,
Behold the single *dao* knife’s measure.

Ground to powder, refined anew,
Test its worth before the furnace.
Like dust, half-purple startles the eye,
Like silk, all-yellow evokes wonder.
Auspicious as three stalks of grain,
Numinous with five-colored light.
Wait until the gold’s poison is fully drawn,
Then present it beside the jade steps.

When the jade pitchpipe heralds spring’s return,
The golden elixir responds to the Emperor’s devotion.
May the Southern Mountains share the Sage’s longevity,
The Eastern Sea match the age’s purity.
Blessings flow from the Mysterious Origin’s virtue,
Merit arises from the Supreme Dao’s manifestation.
Though this humble servant possesses the art,
The immortal transcends the thatched hut’s bounds.

**Song of the Lesser Return Elixir of White Metal**
The Emperor asked the Perfected One:
"The Dao is fundamentally without duality,
All converging in the One.
Medicines have many functions,
Yet how can the body be aided and blessed?
I beg your compassion,
Hasten to save my life."

The Perfected One replied:
"Body in harmony with the black,
Medicine sharing the primordial essence—
The two Dao align with the mechanism,
And decrepitude naturally recedes.
Do not seek the great elixir,
For sun and moon’s timing is hard to await.
A single taste of white metal
Prolongs life and augments years.
The immortals guard this secret,
Never transmitting it lightly.
If you can keep it hidden,
Do not lightly disclose it."

In all twelve verses,
The transformations of medicines and methods
Are none other than water’s essence.
The Six Fungi lend their hues,
The yellow sprout grows naturally.
Yang’s light does not rise,
Yin’s flow makes no sound.
The Dao’s method is secret yet simple,
Yet scholars find it hard to achieve.

First nurture the yellow youth,
Begin by restraining the household ghosts.
Exhaust death to support metal,
Let remaining life restrain water.
If one can grasp this principle,
All will penetrate its truth.
Receive the Sage’s words in person,
For the matter is hard to fathom alone.

Hollow the base to avoid scorching,
Know the white, guard the black,
Refine the yellow into one branch.
Avoid yin’s filth,
And within a hundred days,
The great Dao of longevity—
Easy to understand, hard to know.

The Yellow Lad, pure and refined,
Weds the Mysterious Consort.
Gold’s power grows strong,
The medicine matures, the body flourishes.
The earthen dwelling holds three parts,
The fire chamber embodies the Two Modes.
Supreme virtue dissolves yin,
Pure yang abides in subtlety.
A single taste of white metal
Fortifies human decrepitude.
Mixed natures are hard to guard,
But shared resolve is easy to maintain.
Consume a thousand grains,
And for a hundred days, no harm will come.
Ten thousand illnesses gradually fade,
Heaven’s years, Earth’s longevity.

Follow the oral instructions,
Cherish the transmission in person.
After seven days, it naturally subdues,
Ten thousand moments, firmly secured.
Refined a thousand times, boiled ten thousand,
Entrusted to the Five Worthies.
Store it well in a golden vessel,
Never sever the Mysterious Pass.
Daub the four walls with ochre,
Guard the cinnabar at the round door.
One resides in the fire’s coffer,
Two in the ash pit.
Five toads can be preserved,
Three crows, no doubt.
The Dao’s essence unfolds slowly,
Each day growing more wondrous.

One yellow, two white,
Three *zhu*, two made.
Nurture until the toad is full,
Raise the lofty crane.
Avoid other distractions,
The Dao and body will naturally rejoice.
Transmit to the unworthy,
And heaven’s calamity, earth’s cruelty will follow.

The sprout belongs to the Yellow Lad,
The medicine resides in the Mysterious Maiden.
External aids are none other than
Jade fungi and pure vinegar.
Vulgar scholars hear much,
Dao Lords speak little.
Discrepancies in materials
Bring vain suffering.
Copper and iron mar the form,
Cinnabar ash saps strength.
To verify its numinous power,
One must preserve its original nature.

One yin, one yang—
The matter is easy, the timing is the key.

Within strange clans, they herd as one,
Each kind sharpens its own thorns.
To slay the Green Dragon, summon the White Tiger—
Naturally transformed, no wind nor rain.
Snowflakes fly.
Snowflakes fly, the soul returns, the spirit already home,
Gathering and scattering both ruled by the waters of *ren* and *gui*.
Beneath the Jade Canopy’s radiant bloom, the body abides in non-action.

Bubbling Spring’s waters,
Bubbling Spring’s waters—
Through spring, summer, autumn, winter, depth without end.
When the time comes to traverse the world,
Thick warmth naturally governs.

*Tai Bai Han Yun Zhong Huo Ji Ge*
The Great Dao is vast and boundless,
Yin and yang beyond fathoming.
Creation’s unfolding, generation’s arising—
The world’s people cannot perceive.
Foolishly discoursing on emptiness, they age with white hair;
Erroneously crafting, they squander their wealth.
Seeking to prolong life and halt the years,
They instead wound and shorten their span.
From ancient times to now, those who have loved this path
Have brought ruin to countless lives.
Grasping at misguided methods, ignorant of the true aim,
When facing the furnace’s fire, they merely refine cinnabar to draw mercury,
Matching yin to yellow stone,
Or adding lead to mercury,
Or flying mercury into streams,
Or refining earth to claim gold,
Or mistaking crow’s milk for honey.
Melting lead into mercury, they call it "Yellow Sprout";
Mercury entering *geng* and *xin*, they name it "Dragon and Tiger."
Mercury as the Great Dao—all is false.
If the heart is moved by profit, how can it be embraced?
To forge the elixir is a grave error.

I, having long loved the Dao, failed to awaken to the true origin.
Such methods of subjugation—
All were personally tested.
Witnessing the world’s people perish from plague,
I felt deep sorrow and grief.
Observing life and death’s fleeting passage,
Where could one seek the Dao?
Thus, I set forth these essential mysteries,
To reveal them to fellow learners.
I meticulously detail yin and yang,
Hoping all may awaken to the Dao.

Now, lead is the male within *kan*,
Rightly belonging to *ren* and *gui*.
Refining yin to dissolve and smelt,
Nine cycles of floating and sinking—
When the count is complete, it becomes *qian*,
Thus paired with the western position.
The world’s people see it often,
Yet do not comprehend its true origin.

The Tiger, too, manifests its form,
Fierce, sharp, and black.
Ascending to heaven, it becomes clouds and rain;
Descending to earth, it becomes springs and sources.
Its jade essence returns nine times,
The Metal Elder extinguishes fire—
All through the White Snow.

Mercury is the female within *li*,
Rightly belonging to *bing* and *ding*.
All things flourish and thrive,
Receiving its darkness.
Above, it responds to the Azure Yang with constancy;
Below, it hides in the White Storehouse, sinking in concealment.
The Dragon soars to heaven, revealing the essence of wood;
Spring’s arrival brings forth flowers and herbs.
Vague and indistinct, yet right before the eyes—
Seven returns to revive the soul,
Mysterious blossoms and azure waters.
If one awakens to this,
All profound secrets become clear.
Those who close their eyes
Will find it hard to glimpse.

Thus, the Tiger of the moon’s dark phase,
Refining the Dragon of the sun’s radiant essence,
Subduing the shadows of the twin blacks,
They mutually attract and unite as husband and wife.
*Kan* resides in the Three Flowers,
Becoming the ultimate principle.
Therefore, I reveal these essential mysteries
To those who would understand.

I also chant the *Thirteen Celestial Talismans*—
Let later learners study them closely,
And they will surely grasp the true origin.
If you obtain this text,
Do not recklessly disclose it.

The returning yang begins to stir,
Following the cycle, the seasons shift.
The Dragon lurks, unable to soar,
The Tiger crouches, its cries rare.
The two blacks meet at last!
The Three Flowers foretell the dawn.
Fire fills the ninefold count,
Then wanes and returns again.

On the eighteenth day before the furnace,
Heaven and earth’s qi intermingle.
The Metal Youth comes to restrain wood,
Earth stabilizes the water’s embryonic sac.
Resonance and response mutually consume and gaze,
Harmony and unity lie in attunement.
Advance with the measured dripping,
Retreat according to the hexagram’s lines.

When the Dao prospers, await the proper moment,
Yang’s harmony begins to arise.
The pitch shifts in the first month,
The Dipper’s handle guards *yin*’s course.
The nobleman’s heart remains vigilant,
Yin and yang follow the seasonal sprouts.
After thirty days, step forth,
Pray and refine, then return to the fire.

The Elm’s death, the *Kui* star nears *mao*—
The third absence marks the right time.
The sun’s essence and moon’s spirit,
These two essences unite to form the Great Dao.
Dragon and Tiger naturally contend.
Great Strength completes the compass and square,
Blossoms open toward the cassia branches.
Cease the furnace, halt the fire’s timing,
The azure hue transforms into radiant light.

All trees contain yang,
Blossoms open, fragrance fills the path.
The Golden Rooster rides the great fire,
The Vermilion Fire’s essence.
The Jade Hare wanes and is harmed,
The Water’s essence.
The wise grieve over life and death,
High and low vanish in an instant.
When the medicine is complete, pay homage to the Great Emperor,
Ingesting it dispels calamities.

Through bitter discipline, *qian* is refined,
Cultivating the elixir requires steadfast resolve.
If the Tiger wounds the Dragon, blood flows,
If metal slays wood, no smoke rises.
When yang flourishes, yin approaches,
Prosperity gives way to decline naturally.
Strike the sound, let it ring like a chime,
Observe and gain extended years.

At *Chu Liu*, reaching the southern palace,
Yin ascends, pregnancy begins.
The pitch pipes shift frequently,
Holding the nodes, they alternately attack.
After five days, the count wanes,
The Three Flowers’ fate is supplied.
Bring it to the door to see—
Bloodstains, thousands deep.

*Xiao Ji* wields the celestial talisman,
Yin comes, retreating in accumulated trust.
The Metal Elder replenishes marrow and sinew,
The Vermilion Bird grasps the pivotal mechanism.
The Dao’s body mirrors heaven and earth,
The harmonious medicine resides in the furnace.
Do not treat it as mere transformation—
Ingesting it, even the dead revive.

When *Pi* closes, the three yins descend,
The general slays the many blacks.
The Herdboy meets the Weaving Maiden at the Celestial River.
*Jia* and *yi* injure wood,
*Geng* and *xin* begin to sharpen the sword.
Commands circulate through the seasonal nodes,
Cold and heat all pass through.
When the moon aligns with heaven’s hardness,
Wind stirs the shepherd’s purse and wheat sprouts.
The Earth Lord personally conducts the sacrifice,
The saliva altar nurtures golden sand.

The cassia’s shadow rounds the Milky Way,
The sun’s harmony rhymes with purple clouds.
The swan arrives, the dark crow departs—
Soon, one will see plants growing in water.
Cold yin harms the season’s beings,
Yin’s arrival withers all trees.
Seek chrysanthemums at *wu* and *ji*,
Crimson blood severs the Dragon’s waist.
Decaying into earth,
When lead is separated, it vanishes.
With a steadfast heart, cultivate the ultimate Dao,
Do not resent the distant path.

At *Shang Liu*, dwelling in *kun*’s position,
Yin and yang encompass the beginning and end.
The Emperor’s son’s work becomes marrow,
The *Li* maiden’s blood is deep red.
When two and eight unite,
The three differ in principle.
Open the furnace to behold the supreme treasure—
Ingesting it, the withered elder transforms.

Revisiting the land of pure origin,
Yang hides, creating the six colds.
After thirty days of refinement,
The nine-six elixir is complete.
Inscribe the name on the golden tablet,
Erect the altar in the immortal’s palace.

Renouncing the world’s afflictions, one ascends on wings to ride the simurgh.
Salt, gallbladder, and rice—boil the Emperor’s son and daughter with left-flavored herbs for three days and nights. Left-flavored herbs blend with yellow to form a vessel, nurtured for one seven-day cycle.

*Song of Perfected Yang Xing:*
All in the world love elixirs,
Yet none truly find them.
Some say use lead, some say not—
Even when lead is used, it is still wrong.
If you cannot find it, do not grow angry;
It is because the true Yellow Sprout eludes you.
Only those with faith and conduct are worthy of transmission—
Those unstained by wealth or lust are true adepts.

Work in secret to aid others, never flaunt your skill,
For seeking immortality may instead shorten your years.
Beware of wandering among the halls of the noble;
Leave divination and healing to idle hands.
If you cannot yet retreat, with no place of leisure,
Then seek remedies for illness—
Why fret over the joy of the Dao and long life?

Lead is the sovereign, mercury the minister,
Fire the messenger.
The Crimson Blood General guards yin and yang,
Commanding and subduing the medicine.
When the elixir is complete, first use it to refine mercury—
Once mercury is transmuted, it may be ingested.
No ghostly officials will pursue you, nor will you die.
If you attain this, seek it in quietude, not among the powerful.

The secret lies in the heart, transmitted through hand and eye.
If heart and mouth do not align, if hand and eye are not passed down,
Indulging in wine and lust severs all ties to the Dao.
When water in the Cinnabar Field congeals, the Yellow Sprout arises;
After a hundred days of nurturing, it submits to fire.
Yin dwelling in the yang crucible is the Golden Elixir—
After ten months of refinement, it is ready for ingestion.
Ingesting it preserves your complexion,
Your hair and temples never wither, your resolve never falters.
Selling elixirs and medicines among men,
A thousand years of life go unrecognized.

The elixir of long life, the pill of immortality—
The world desires them, yet they are hard to find.
Hesitant in heart, wavering in intent,
The eight methods of elixir-making have long existed—
Why not master even one?

Two converse, plotting together,
Day and night seeking the formula of immortality.
If you obtain black lead and the Old Woman,
You will soar into the heavens on your own wings.
One is left, one is right—
When yin and yang are complete, the Returned Elixir is achieved.
Truly refine it, and you will surely live long,
Roaming freely in the purple courtyards of the immortals.

The world’s bustling crowds, with their carriages and horses,
Their rosy cheeks and black hair do not endure.
Alchemical arts have been passed down for ten thousand years,
Yet seekers rush about, never finding the truth.
If everyone recognized the Yellow Sprout,
How could there be poverty in the world?

Old men and women craft the great medicine—
Lead and mercury, the two metals, are not misused.
Emerging from water, entering fire, they lose vitality,
Half-alive, half-dead, bound in mutual accord.
Through this accord, a sixty-year cycle is completed—
Above yin, below yang, they submit to one another.
If you attain this in the world’s clamor,
No ghostly officials will claim you, sparing you from death.

Lead is lead, mercury is mercury—
Yet all in the world think they can use them.
The Yellow Sprout of herbs, the Yellow Sprout of wood—
All in the world boast of them idly.
Since ancient times, secrets were passed mouth to ear, never written—
Those who burn offerings labor in vain, ruining their families.

The White Emperor of the West dwells in Wu Du,
Adorned with a parrot-feathered crown, as all require.
The Flowery Pond is sealed for seven days—
The maid, through a matchmaker, finds her husband.
Watch the furnace closely, tending to the four seasons’ darkness;
Cold and warmth, heat and chill—do not let your heart sleep.
Honor the immortals with perfect ritual—
A single drop of yellow gold fills the earth.

Lead and mercury, the two yin,
Are the heart of the Returned Elixir.
Their mutual restraint is not difficult,
Yet people remain lost, never seeking.
Scholars see nothing, wasting a thousand gold pieces.
If you receive guidance, you create blessings and relieve poverty.
Such is its use—
Neither heaven nor immortals will resent you.
If you recklessly reveal the Dao,
Heaven’s wrath will be great.
Plagues will strike, and you will face official punishment.

Black kinds do not dwell together—
Mother and child are bound in mutual accord.
Without lead and the Yellow Sprout,
Subjugation is impossible.
The Yellow Sprout submits within yin,
White Snow arises within yang.
Placed into the fire to burn,
Yin and yang are bound together.
Mother and child cannot escape,
Never parting in life or death.

Cinnabar, oh cinnabar,
It saves lives and families.
If it can save my life,
It can save my family.
It can give birth to a wondrous maiden,
To wed the Yellow Sprout.
She serves her husband with purity,
Neither joyful nor angry.
She observes rites and music, morning and evening,
With measured discipline.

Gold may be made, the world may be transcended—
But if gold is not achieved, you wait in vain.
Mercury’s essence lies first in the Cinnabar Field,
Then in the yang crucible, where darkness connects.
Harmonized for three days, it finally settles—
Know then that the great medicine resides in lead.
First entering the yin furnace, it becomes Great White;
Later dwelling in the yang crucible, it transforms into the Golden Elixir.
If people grasp this principle,
Refining mercury will not be difficult.

Cinnabar and mercury enter the lead pool,
Yielding the Yellow Sprout, unknown to others.
This is the oral secret left by immortals—
Even if you encounter it, you still need a teacher.
The teacher must clearly transmit the oral secret—
Few in the world’s clamor speak of it.
In seventy years, it is passed to one—
Only those with immortal bones receive it clearly.

Those in the world who seek the Dao
Are foolish with wine and meat,
Wasting a hundred years in ignorance.
The Metal Lord is subdued—
A single branch of the Returned Elixir.
Cinnabar subdues fire,
Curing illness without doubt.
Long life is within reach,
Unshakably firm.
Not aging, not dying—
Like Peng Zu of old.

Ancient immortals obtained the essence of red copper,
One tael of mercury, one tael of essence.
Half a tael of roasted cinnabar, boiled in rice water from dawn to dusk—
The body becomes strong.
Cast into copper or iron, its power is like a mirror—
Ghosts and spirits fear it, unable to speak.
If you receive the oral secret from a perfected one,
You must cherish it to attain long life.

When yang essence is firm, the hun-spirit stands;
When yin essence is firm, the po-soul is complete.
When hun and po are strong, the heart becomes sagely—
Red lead and cinnabar mercury grow even more potent.
If you encounter an immortal who leaves this art,
Your hun and po will stand, and you will live long.

Those who know the Maiden will surely return essence;
Those who subdue the Vermilion Child will surely remain steadfast.
The essence of metal, the marrow of stone—
These are the numinous spirits of the hun.
Those who cultivate become sages;
Those who subdue become potent.
No ghostly officials will pursue them,
And their names will be recorded in the immortal registers.

At fifty or sixty, it may be passed on—
Only then does it first become firm and enduring.
Yet still one must conceal one’s path through medicine and divination,
Moving or staying, sitting or lying without care.
Since ancient times, how many have come,
Only to harm themselves through this art?
One must study yin and yang, along with divination and physiognomy,
Blending with the world, seeking outwardly while inwardly poor.

Worthy of transmission, passed down in turn,
This Dao-gate originally saves and delivers.
Those who recklessly transmit it bring calamity—
Father and son grow distant, speech no longer shared.
To seek the true lead of the cinnabar field,
Cinnabar, when refined, makes the body firm.
If only you receive the oral secret from a perfected one,
Red lead enters water, and the great elixir is complete.

Each matter must be remembered in heart and word,
Yet creation still requires hand and eye to transmit.
The river chariot bears and carries within the cinnabar field,
Fire-taming rests entirely at the edge of yellow sprouts.
The Metal Lord can dwell in water,
Black lead holds yellow sprouts.
Transform these yellow sprouts into water,
Use water to make the river chariot.
The marrow of the southern Crimson Emperor—
This is the essence of Grand Yin.
Ancient immortals could seize and refine it,
Taking the form of mercury.
When the two essences unite,
This is the heart of the returned elixir.
If you encounter this principle,
No need for distant seeking.
From black lead, take yang;
From cinnabar, take yin.

*End of the Upper Scroll of the "Song of the Returned Elixir"*
*Beginning of the Lower Scroll of the "Song of the Returned Elixir"*
*Collected by Master Primal Yang*

Song says:

The true Yin and true Yang are the true Dao,
This true Yin-Yang is true water and fire,
Not the water and fire of the mundane world.
It lies right before your eyes—why seek afar?
People daily witness this Dao yet fail to awaken.

Year after year, the common crowd burns divine elixirs,
Suddenly seeing blue and yellow, they deem it fine.
Yet they know not the correct Way,
Mistakenly using lead and mercury.

Those of resolve must seek the method and model,
Understand the compass and torch, then follow their path.
Do not harm the spirit-heart with vain visions of old age.
Without the true formula, white-haired years bring no gain.

But if you obtain the true yellow sprouts,
One who ingests them attains ageless life.
Should you gain the true yellow sprouts,
Consuming them, you naturally achieve the Dao.

The Green Dragon pursues the Tiger, the Tiger seeks the Dragon—
The Dragon is mercury, the Tiger is lead;
Mercury loves to fly and move, yet is restrained by lead and cannot rise.
The Crimson Phoenix joins in union, their voices singing in harmony—
Mercury, swallowed by the Vermilion Bird, naturally emits the cry of the infant.

Regulate the qi and timing,
Circulate the fire without missing the seasonal nodes.
Move through the Palace of Li—
Li Palace is the spirit of fire.
When the numinous medicine enters the bowels, the body ascends of itself—
The elixir of spirit enters the mouth, becoming the true person.

The yellow sprouts are not the same as worldly lead,
The yellow sprouts are the root of the great medicine,
Beyond the grasp of the vulgar.
In vain they labor their spirits, seeing no merit.

From an empty chamber, white-haired age arises alone.

Where does one wander in search of Red Pine?
Red Pine—the name of an immortal.
The divine water and flowery pond are rare in the world,
The divine water and flowery pond, the root of the great medicine,
Not the common lead and mercury of the mortal realm.
Its transmission forbids the knowledge of vulgar men.
As the *Baopuzi* says: Were this joy known to the dead,
Immortals would fill the earth.

Yet they take the world’s base lead and mercury,
Making them seem alike to dispel all doubt.
The immortals guard this secret,
Speaking only of the world’s lead and mercury.

The subtleties of the Five Phases are hard to fathom—
Dragon concealed, Tiger hidden, originally Kan and Li.
The arts of the Returned Elixir number in the hundreds,
But the most essential is the Golden Flower Pond.
The Dao of yin and yang is difficult to trace to its source;
If one trusts ancient formulas, success will never come.
The *Can* says: The Yellow Emperor prized the Golden Flower.
Thus, lead’s outer blackness cradles the Golden Flower within.

Cinnabar’s position is not inherently red,
Yet it aligns with the southern palace through the four seasons.
Cinnabar is not red, its place in the south—
Thus, the world’s people cannot grasp its origin.
Vermilion’s nature has no fixed abode,
But know its source as autumn stone.
The true essence of the sun’s soul and moon’s spirit—
These two mysteries of the black elixirs, beyond mortal comprehension.

They nurture the embryo and rear the child, the body most divine.
When the transformation nears its end, you shall see for yourself—
Clearly, it becomes the dust upon the bright window.

The *Can* states: It resembles the dust upon the bright window.
Lead and mercury belong to one gate, yet none may rely upon them;
The golden elixir’s secret teachings remain unknown even to sages.
This secret Dao of sages, none comprehend—
The world calls salt "sage," a mark of ignorance.

Do not take common gold and stone of the world,
To measure years and fire in vain contention.
If one uses worldly lead and mercury,
Refinement will yield no benefit.

Heaven births these things in response to emptiness and nothingness,
These things coalesce from subtle and wondrous radiance,
Not through artificial craft or forced creation.
As wife, as child, and again as husband—
This medicine is lord and minister, mother and child,
Husband and wife, fish and water.

The gate of the Three and Five lies only in the sun and moon,
Clearly, the positions of *mao* and *you* serve as the beginning.
If one knows the Three and Five, lifelong worries cease.
For *mao* and *you* are the stations of long life,
Where yang’s radiance is born and yin’s essence takes its seat.
Heaven and Earth cannot evade one another;
All matters ultimately return to the realm of Heaven and Earth.
Heaven and Earth are the great Dao,
Yet people use them daily without awareness.

After ten months of gestation, mother and child part,
But how could the wise ever abandon them?
When the cycle of transformation ends,
The refined numinous medicine stands alone,
The child dwelling apart while the mother is cast aside—
Thus, the wise never truly discard them.

Nurtured by nature’s endowment of purest truth,
The harmonious blackness coalesces into form.
The *Can* says: Heaven births the Dark Maiden,
Earth produces the Yellow Lad.
Wealth and nobility all stem from embracing the five hues,
How could lead and mercury ever be kin?

Mysterious and obscure, beyond all distinction—
People do not recognize lead and mercury.
The gate of lead and mercury’s meaning remains hard to reveal,
For people do not grasp the essence of yin and yang.
If the world cannot fathom its origin,
Examine the five phases closely, and you shall see for yourself.
The five phases are metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.
The infant, restless and elusive, cannot be grasped;
In vain, one wearies the spirit, suffering empty toil.
People fail to recognize the wondrous essentials,
Expending spirit in futility, seeing no effect.

But if one knows to heed the words of sages,
Clearly, this is the path to Heaven.
The Three and Five dwell together in one chamber—
The Dragon and Tiger are called the Three and Five.
One husband and two wives form a pair.
One and two are the numbers of water and fire; five is earth.
Only with a good matchmaker may they be joined,
Thus fostering intimate bonds of friendship.
The Way of yin and yang requires a good matchmaker,
The matchmaker being divine water.
With a good matchmaker, husband and wife naturally harmonize.

Yin and yang, obscure and unfathomable,
The Azure Dragon and White Tiger contend of themselves.
When the Dragon and Tiger enter the chamber, none can comprehend.
As the year draws to its end, transformations unfold in mutual devouring;
The White Tiger restrains the Dragon, and the Dragon gradually wanes.
At year’s end, the cycle completes—
Mercury is gradually congealed into treasure.

Heaven is yang, the old mother is Earth—
For one yin and one yang are called the Dao.
The Vermilion Bird of the south, the Dark Warrior of the north.
The south is the spirit of fire, the north the spirit of water.
As the years pass, all become earth—
Where then shall people seek the Dragon and Tiger?
Water and fire together become earth.

Three persons unite in shared purpose as one clan—
The three persons are the three legs of the tripod.
Ever revering the sun and moon shining within.
The two radiances of sun and moon enter the tripod and die.
Having encountered the Three Flowers, now they liquefy again;
Nine revolutions complete the work of years and months.
Nine revolutions mark the exhaustion of yang numbers,
The Three Flowers are fire.

The Azure Dragon’s essence lies in the east—
The east is *jia-yi* wood, mercury, the image of the Dragon in *zhen*.
It joins with Heaven and Earth, borrowing their positions.
After the White Tiger appears from this,
The White Tiger is lead, the Yellow Sprout its form.
How could flowing cinnabar refuse to follow?
Flowing cinnabar is mercury,
By nature fond of flying and fleeing—
Bound by lead, it cannot escape.

To know that cinnabar is the essence of wood,
Move it to the west to join with metal.
Cinnabar, the essence of wood, unites with leaden gold to complete the great Dao.
Where shall ordinary people seek its traces?
In the realm of the indistinct and obscure.
Laozi said: Dim and dark, within it lies essence;
Vague and elusive, within it lies substance.

When the Dragon and Tiger are refined through five revolutions,
Gradually, the fragrance of chrysanthemums arises in the furnace—
The medicine in the tripod emits a scent like chrysanthemums.
Now is the proper time for refinement;
Do not resent the long passage of days and months.
In refinement and circulation, one must observe the firing times.

Those who awaken return as if retracing their path,
While the lost find no easy way to seek its traces.
Awakening is not difficult; the lost struggle in vain.
Three persons move in harmony, sharing one source—
The three persons are the three substances: water, fire, and metal.
Their nature has never departed from the ancestral origin.

One person is, one person is not—
The White Tiger of the west is "is," the Azure Dragon of the east is "not."
Metal is the wife, wood the husband.
Metal is yin, the wife; wood is yang, the husband.
Profound and abstruse, beyond all measure—
The great Dao is deep and mysterious, beyond all systems.

The supreme work has never consented to be mapped in diagrams.
Guard the great Dao in secrecy—it cannot be made clear through illustrations.
Heaven’s profound mystery matches Earth’s yellow essence,
Heaven’s mystery and Earth’s yellow.
The two essences harmonize and return to the chamber of fusion.
The two breaths together enter the crucible.

In the furnace of white liquid, transformation follows the moon,
Changing with the waxing and waning of sun and moon.
Those who partake of it find their hearts clarified, as if frozen in purity.
Those who consume it can banish all illness.

Who can determine the source when metal and wood wound each other?
Heaven and Earth move in harmony, naturally interconnected.
Metal restrains wood, wood generates fire, fire melts metal—
Generation and restraint intertwine, yet the world fails to grasp their root.

The world conceals the great white of yin—
Who can comprehend the yellow sprout of lead?
The yellow sprout is not of this world, so none can fathom it.
In the eleventh month, when the water phase of *ren* and *gui* holds sway,
A single yang stirs, yet it is called the great white of yin.

The supreme work fundamentally resides in *kan* and *li*,
Speaking of true water and true fire—this is the yellow sprout,
Not the water and fire of the mundane world.
Mundane lead and mercury must not cling to each other—
If one employs the lead and mercury of this world, it will kill.

The wise conceal it where none can see.
The wise practice it in seclusion, so few ever witness it.
The King of Huai refined the golden flower in his pool,
The King of Huai concocted thirty-six waters,
Able to transform the five metals entirely into treasures.

When the nine cycles of lead essence near their end,
Opening the furnace, one suddenly beholds the red blossom of the elixir.
The nine revolutions of the great elixir complete, its hue is like the red lotus.

Water and fire transform together into earth,
Water and fire contend, naturally becoming ash and soil.
Where then can one seek the Golden Elder?
Refined to the ninth cycle, all perishes into ash and soil—this is not the true color.

The transmission of lead and mercury is rare in the world.
If one encounters the numinous elixir, it must not be recklessly shown to the unworthy—
The Most High’s statutes mete out punishment, and seven generations suffer the consequences.

Cinnabar’s jade-like substance wears a robe of snow,
The cinnabar is white, and the perfected call it "autumn stone."
Day after day it rests in your dwelling,
Yet day after day you gaze upon it without knowing its source.

When the returning elixir enters the mouth, the body becomes light,
The great elixir, once ingested, grants one the lightness of feathered transformation.
It can dispel long-standing illness and expel malevolent spirits,
The great elixir, upon entering the mouth, expels the Three Corpses and Nine Worms,
Harmonizing the five viscera and six bowels, leaving no room for disease.

From this point, greed and attachment fade away,
It can transform the foolish into the wise, altering their nature and emotions.
The foolish become sages, their names ranked alongside the ancient immortals.

Drifting and floating, indistinct—its nature is hard to discern,
Mistaking it leads the spirit astray, wasting years and months in vain.
To know when the numinous medicine will be complete,
Yin and yang must undergo nine full transformations.

Who could have foreseen that the numinous cinnabar would emerge from worldly dust?
The three flowers unite, and tiger and dragon become kin.
Behold those who have refined the elixir before and after—
How many thousands, even tens of thousands, have perished in the attempt?

The *Song of the Returning Elixir*, Scroll the Lower, concludes.
