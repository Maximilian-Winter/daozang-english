**The Jade Purity Golden Casket Azure Florescence Esoteric Writ of the Golden Treasure Inner Alchemy Formula, Scroll the First**
By the Perfected Purple Yang, Zhang Pingshu

**Memorial to the Throne**

Unmindful of the axe’s doom, I dare to voice these humble and irreverent thoughts. In this world, I have known much turmoil, yet achieved nothing—surely ruin awaits. Now past thirty years, I have found solace only in the Great Dao.

Reflecting upon the vault of heaven, I see that what once hindered my success now aids its fulfillment. The debt of gratitude is profound; I inscribe it upon my heart and bear it with reverence.

Now, I witness with sorrow: among the people below, who lacks the vessel for the Dao? They rush and toil in the dust of the world, ravaging their true essence. The more they descend, the further they stray—abandoning humanity for things, and in seeking humanity through things, they can no longer return.

If things cannot be cultivated, one ultimately becomes a stranger to one’s kind. Alas! Though I myself have not yet transcended, I pity them all the more—no different from a frog in the mud mocking the chicken on the fence.

Only yesterday did I receive the transmission of *The Jade-Clear Golden Casket Longevity and World-Transcendence Inner Alchemy Scripture of the Azure Radiance Perfected*, a text at once concise and easily practiced, detailed yet uncluttered. Within the body, it divides the lord of yin and yang; within the crucible, it establishes the pivot of the Four Symbols. The Three Centers are constantly guarded as the mechanism; the One Fixation never departs as the function. In function, there is non-function; in stillness, it endures forever.

For the wise and the refined, a single glance suffices—creation lies within the palm of one’s hand! Now, I wish to purify myself, fast, and concentrate my thoughts to render it into diagrams and discourse, leaving no detail concealed, directly revealing the profound essence of the utmost truth. I shall select what may be transmitted and transmit it, that the lamp of the heart may be passed on, flowing through ten thousand generations—what a splendid endeavor!

Yet at the moment of first transmission, the oath was most solemn, and my master’s charge most grave: to lightly disclose it invites punishment. Many times have I wished to proceed, only to hesitate, unable to recall how often! Prostrating myself in the dust, I turn my mind toward the upper realms, reverently considering that the Most High cherishes life and values the salvation of others above all. Thus, I bow low in humility, beseeching the Heavenly Compassion to perceive my intent. If my plea is not granted and the mysterious censure is made manifest, so be it; but if, perchance, it is deemed acceptable, may I be granted peace to fulfill this vow.

Again, I lay this before the Heavenly Threshold. I, your servant, am utterly overwhelmed with awe and trepidation, bowing my head a hundred times in deepest gratitude. Of late, I have submitted memorials...

The Heavenly Court wishes to have *The Supreme Lord of Azure Radiance’s Jade-Pure Golden Casket: Secret Essentials of Internal Alchemy for Longevity and Salvation* illustrated with diagrams and expounded in discourse, that it may be transmitted to worthy scholars. Prostrating myself in my thatched hut, I awaited the Heavenly Punishment for over thirty days. When no censure came, I dared at last to purify myself with ablutions, burn incense, and compose this work in concentrated thought over three days. I have sealed it within a bamboo

Moreover, to summarize in a single word: stillness. The principle underlying stillness may likewise be understood. Like a boat sailing downstream, swift and surging, bound for some island sea—no toil is spoken of in the journey. Yet once homeward thoughts arise, longing for the peace of one’s native place, one hastens to hoist the sail, seeking a contrary wind to return. Such is the Dao of stillness. But if one has long been estranged before seeking to return, or long lost before attempting to find the way, how can stillness be attained in a single day? First, one must reflect on the cause of returning to stillness, and only then can stillness be achieved. Having awakened to past errors, one must seek present rectitude—yet where does this rectitude reside, if not in constancy?

The poem says:
From the golden ladder, one falls to the azure cliff,
Recalling the blossoms of Penglai, how many have bloomed?
Where now lies the great Dao of old?
Only wild grasses remain, a thicket of thorns.

**Oral Instruction:**
When a single deluded thought arises, reflect on how the mind has failed to attain stillness in ordinary times—this is the obstruction. Abandon it swiftly. With long practice, will it not become effortless?

For essence depends on qi to arise, and essence resides in the Kidney Palace, where qi blends with it. Thus, when it ascends with qi as yang-lead, this is the process. If essence is substantial yet primordial qi does not arise, and primordial yang does not manifest, what benefit is there to me? Only when primordial spirit appears does primordial qi arise, and when primordial qi arises, primordial essence is produced.

**The Role of Intention as the Matchmaker:**
Intention is not merely a matchmaker. In the Dao of the Golden Elixir, from beginning to end, its function cannot be set aside. Intention arises from the heart, yet the heart must not be carried away by intention—if the heart is led astray by intention, all is lost!

**On Kan and Li:**
Kan is the Kidney Palace; Li is the Heart Field. Kan in stillness pertains to water, yet [when dynamic, it pertains to fire]; Li in motion pertains to fire, yet [when still, it pertains to water]. At the moment of their union, when the Heart Field is still and the Kidney Palace is dynamic, is this not true yang below and true yin above? Moreover, intention arises from the heart and descends directly to the Kidney Palace, while yang arises from the kidneys and ascends directly to the Yellow Court. Thus it is said: Kan and Li are inverted. If they are not inverted but proceed in sequence, the heart-fire will not be still—then the meaning of the "fire pit of the great earth" becomes clear.

I have illustrated this in the *Diagram of Union*.
**Commencing the Practice**

**On Holding the Heart and Commencing Practice**

Having expounded the discourse on the heart, we now proceed to the method of practice, for the heart, though desiring stillness, is yet troubled by unceasing desires. These desires arise from the temperament and nature, where this nature enslaves the true nature, ever assailing the eyes and ears. For the cultivator of the elixir, once the heart is free of affairs, the temperament has no means to enslave it. Yet what enslaves the spirit is nothing but the allure of external things.

During seated meditation, first practice the method of restraining the breath. To restrain the breath: when one breath has not yet ended and another follows, now, as the first breath arises, suppress the subsequent breath, so that it follows slowly. With time, the breath settles. Though the breath is restrained a thousand or ten thousand times, the heart must not be stirred. If the heart stirs, it will chase after the breath, and before the breath stills, the heart has already moved.

Before the words were finished, someone nearby laughed and said: "How impractical! This man teaches a method without principle—restraining the breath yet keeping the heart unmoved. Is this not like burdening a man with a thousand *jun* and forbidding him to exert himself? Is it possible?"

The master replied: "Listen to me. Though you restrain the breath, if you also preserve the heart, then the heart will not move, and the breath will naturally still. Yet even if the breath is restrained, how can you ensure that desires will not arise?"

He continued: "When desires arise, it is because the senses are stirred by external things. In deep stillness, if the eyes perceive something, the spirit is enslaved by the eyes—hasten to withdraw and return it inward. If the ears hear something, the spirit is enslaved by the ears—hasten to withdraw and listen inwardly. The same applies to all senses."

The questioner said: "I hear one and understand two. Now I grasp this principle! Though I withdraw the spirit and preserve the heart, the spirit is gathered, and the heart is fundamentally still."

The master replied: "To preserve the heart is to nurture the nature. At the beginning of nurturing the nature, if you do not preserve it, there is nothing to nurture, and in the end, nothing will be perceived. Preserving the heart truly begins with gathering the heart. What is called gathering the spirit is but an auxiliary use of gathering the heart. With long practice, seeing becomes as not seeing, hearing as not hearing; form and heart forget each other, merging with the supreme Dao. Then the original nature is revealed, and the original *qi* is born.

**On Spirit**
Spirit is the original nature. In my previous discourse on spirit as the master, I have already exhausted the subject. Yet considering those who cultivate the elixir, the method of concentrating the spirit is neither hasty nor superficial. Thus, I expound further and later illustrate the spirit-chamber.

To concentrate is to unite the spirit within essence and *qi*. Essence and *qi* are inherently interdependent, and the spirit naturally clings to them. Why, then, emphasize the spirit alone? The spirit is the master of essence and *qi*. In the alchemical work of union and gathering, and in the firing process, all is done through the spirit’s use of *qi* and essence. If one first concentrates the spirit within the *qi*, the *qi* cannot settle, nor will the spirit willingly cling to it, and the medicinal substances will be harmed.

Moreover, the spirit is the original nature. When the nature is first glimpsed, it is not yet stable—floating and drifting, advancing and retreating, appearing and vanishing. If you force it to concentrate, how can the nature concentrate itself? What concentrates it is the temperament’s nature. Initially, one relies on the temperament to seek the original nature—can the temperament’s nature truly pursue the original nature? Now, scholars are misled by the method of concentrating the spirit. Why? Some immortals speak of first concentrating the spirit, and thus blindly lead the masses astray. Do they not know that what they call concentrating the spirit is merely stilling thoughts and returning the spirit to the heart?

In the Dao of the heart, when the spirit returns to the heart, the complete body of the nature is revealed. Once the complete body is revealed and put to use, all is the spirit’s function. Thought after thought, it does not depart from the golden elixir. Thus, when the elixir is formed, the spirit naturally returns to it—what concentration is there? Therefore, to concentrate the spirit is to merge the spirit with essence and *qi*. When essence, *qi*, and spirit unite as one, the yang spirit is born. At this moment, this body becomes a useless thing. Who would deny it? I have heard this from my teacher, who heard it from his distant teacher, who heard it from heaven.

**On the Illusory Elixir**
There is an illusory elixir, for those who study the Dao, ignorant of the correct principles, rashly engage in gathering and union, and thus produce an illusory elixir. The illusory elixir arises when the Heart Field is not yet stilled, and one hastily gathers the solitary yang. At this time, the solitary yang is not true yang but merely the *qi* of breath; the essence is not original essence but the turbid essence of lust; the spirit is not original spirit but the thoughts of desire.

One who has just begun to study the Dao yet desires to become an immortal—is this not desire? To unite and arouse yang through desire is the origin of the illusory elixir. The essence resides in the Kidney Palace, and if one gathers it and ascends to above the navel, yet has no place to settle it, it follows the *qi* and rests to the right of the *qi* cavity. The navel is connected to the kidneys by a thread, and when it joins with the *qi* and stops, it is called an elixir. Though it is called an elixir, when spirit and essence are employed, it is merely a postnatal substance. Where, then, is the prenatal substance? What is called the Yellow Court, the inner furnace, the outer furnace, the Mud Pill Palace, and other cavities—these only appear after the establishment of the prenatal. Where were they at that time? They did not yet exist.

Like wind stirring shadows, seeking the toad in the sea, waiting by the tree for a hare, or fishing in a tree—day by day, the deception is exposed. The essence scatters and flees, and the prenatal has no master. Alas! This is not the elixir of long life but a method that shortens it. There are also those who gather *qi* and ascend to encounter the heart’s blood and *qi*; when the blood congeals into a thing, it is also called an illusory elixir. Such cases are many, and thus I cite them to dispel confusion.

**The Method of Grasping the Elixir**
Though the golden elixir resides within, can it also be lost?"

There are such cases. Is there a method to grasp it?
There is.
Yet this is not the elixir’s escape.
The gates and doors were not secure, allowing it to depart—illusory elixirs may be lost, but how could the golden elixir suffer such a fate?
How does one know when the golden elixir has departed?
When the elixir resides in the crucible, it is replete with the true *qi* of the Five Phases. The *qi* of the Five Phases within my body presses upon the furnace, and they resonate and stir. Should one day perceive the *qi* ascending outward while the inner resonance ceases, the elixir is no longer present.
Swiftly, one must lay everything aside in profound stillness, relinquishing even the furnace and crucible, whether the elixir remains or not, to the realm of nothingness. After a day or a night, one may then sense its whereabouts—whether in the heart, the liver, the spleen, or the kidneys, for the elixir may lodge in any of the hundred cavities of the body.
Once its location is known, one must subtly and continuously preserve it, guarding it to prevent its departure. After another day, one may then gather it with intent, guiding it directly to descend into the Yang Palace. From the Yang Palace, employing the same intent as when gathering it, one follows the old path to ascend it directly into the crucible.
Such are the mysteries of creation—who could deny it? If there be one who speaks thus, they are my teacher.

The Discourse on Divine Water and the Flowery Pond

Divine Water refers to the liquid of Wood; the Flowery Pond is the cavity beneath the qi point of the navel, between the two kidneys—a passage most resembling the Yellow Court, where the grain qi transforms into essence, known in medicine as the Essence Cavity. In the young and robust, whose yang abounds and qi flows freely, the Divine Water and Flowery Pond serve merely to irrigate the furnace and crucible, cleanse the spleen and stomach, and circulate moisture through the qi cavities. Yet for those whose primordial qi has waned and essence is exhausted, these become the very foundation of the elixir.

When primordial qi declines, it is not the primordial qi itself that fails, but rather the qi of the material form that has been severed and lost to excess. The nature of wayward desires arises ceaselessly, the prior heaven remains unseen, and the posterior heaven proves insufficient for its purpose—thus begins the root of emaciation and infirmity. The Flowery Pond is the passage through which essence is generated and descends to the external kidneys. When qi is vigorous, essence is abundant; when essence is abundant, the Flowery Pond flourishes, and its use leaves one with surplus. But in those whose qi has withered, essence is desiccated, and the grain qi that arrives produces only a kind of sighing water, which flows back to the kidney palace.

Yet once I have stilled myself! Primordial qi inherently neither increases nor decreases, but the Flowery Pond is no more. The great medicine lacks one of its three ingredients, so when yang stirs but before the moment of direct gathering, intent is employed to guide it back to the Weilu, ascending straight through the Jiaji to the Mud Pill Palace. Thus, essence is drawn from the Essence Cavity, naturally rising with the qi to the Noon Palace, where it encounters the fusion of all yang—only then may essence be employed. It then descends to the heart, where mercury is gathered, and from the heart it returns downward through the Yellow Court, settling within. A single intent is then used to seal and secure it, preserving it with unbroken continuity to nurture it. The two substances within naturally consume and merge with one another, and the elixir begins to form.

Recently, a school from western Zhejiang has applied this method even to the young and vigorous to congeal the elixir—yet the Dao lies near, and they seek it afar. Still, each clings to their own truth.

The Discourse on the Hundred Cavities

Within the human body, there are eighty-four thousand hair-follicle cavities and three hundred eighty-four qi palaces. The hair-follicle cavities disperse, belonging to the qi palace of the navel’s qi cavern, which also serves as the governing descent of the three hundred eighty-four palaces—while the yang palaces all become essence. The heart is the Middle Field, the crown the Upper Field; beneath the tongue lies the Mysterious Throat, within the eyes the Silver Sea; at the center of the forehead, between the brows, the balance of mouth and nose, the sides of ears and eyes, the flanks of the throat, the space within the waist and ribs—all are cavities. As for what I call the emergence of the elixir, it may be concealed in any of these cavities. How could it be said that the human body possesses only one or two cavities? These one or two cavities are the pivot of the multitude—how could they be limited to this alone? This describes the body; its application will be discussed separately in what follows.

*Middle Scroll of The Jade Clarity Golden Casket: Secret Writ of Azure Radiance, Golden Treasure Inner Refinement Elixir Formulae*
*Illustrated Discourse on Gathering and Refining*
*Composed by Perfected Master Purple Yang, Zhang Pingshu*

Gathering involves drawing true yang from the Kidney Palace, while taking involves extracting true mercury from the Heart Field. When gathering is possible, gather—gathering must yield its use. If gathered at the wrong time, the dragon will not descend, the tiger will not ascend; though one may see blood and qi surging, rushing to and fro, the deluded will mistake this for union! Yet they know not that *li* and *kan* remain *li* and *kan*—true yang within yin and true yin within yang stand apart, unmoved. When the qi and vessels are arrested by a single thought, qi swiftly enters the meridians, and within *li* and *kan*, harm befalls lead and mercury instead. Though called "nurturing qi," it is in truth the depletion of original qi at the center. Original qi in man appears only in perfect stillness—this is the qi of prior heaven. The qi of posterior heaven circulates ceaselessly, yet men, drowned in desire, fail to examine it closely. At the moment of slight composure, when the heart is free of other uses, one may then perceive the qi’s ascent and descent—yet mistakenly gather it as prior-heaven qi, thereby inviting harm. Thus do modern scholars often suffer strange ailments, all for this reason.

Man’s illnesses arise solely from obstructions in qi and vessels. Qi naturally regulates itself, yet if one forces it to ascend, the spleen, stomach, lungs, liver, ears, eyes, mouth, and nose are injured; if forced to descend, it is like water breaching a long dike, rushing downward with irresistible force. How could the true substance endure? Pitying those who speak of the elixir yet harm their own lives, I place the *Illustrated Discourse on Gathering* first, though it reveals celestial secrets outright. Yet if those with aspirations for the golden elixir instead destroy their lives, I offer this correction through right principle. The Most High cherishes life and will not fault me. Thus in this scroll, I depict with the knife and spoon of mystery and yellow, the infant boy and maiden girl—all metaphors—sweeping aside delusions to retreat three leagues, so that the wise may see and grasp the *Can Tong Qi*, while the foolish, upon seeing, may dissolve their confusion like melting ice, each detail clear and bright as a mirror revealing every hair.

Those who seek the golden elixir must first cultivate hidden virtue to fulfill human affairs, then hold to the previous discourse on the heart—only then will the great medicine be born and the illustrated forms appear.

The method of gathering arises from the heart, for the heart is the pivot and axis of all transformations. One must forget it to seek it: forgetting is the ordinary heart, seeking is the true heart. Yet within forgetting, a single intent to seek arises—that is the true heart. In the midst of vagueness and indistinctness, the true heart first appears. Once the true heart is seen, from this true heart generate a true intent, and with reversed light turn inward to illuminate. Then the hundred apertures will all unfold, and original essence will blossom forth! The key lies in generating being from non-being, and non-being from being. When this state is reached, even the true heart is forgotten and discarded. With nothing left to depend on, true breathing becomes continuous. When true breathing is continuous, the qi of posterior heaven settles, and as posterior heaven recedes, the qi of prior heaven appears—thus yang is born!

When yang is born, the qi of prior heaven flows from the qi cavity into the kidneys, like bubbles welling up. Between the two kidneys runs a thread that pierces the qi cavity—this is the meridian formed at the moment of conception by one’s parents. When the qi of prior heaven courses through it, one feels this sensation, and the hundred vessels of the body all become like spring’s vitality, gradually growing in warmth. At this time, the qi of prior heaven is first established, and as prior heaven stands firm, posterior heaven retreats further. Only then may one subtly arouse the intent to gather.

This intent is born of the eyes gazing downward upon the heart, yet the heart is released and sent down into the Yang Palace. Gently gather, then release—thus yang rises. *(See "Discourse on the First Yang.")*

The intent to gather arises from the heart, and the heart arises from the eyes. Thus Laozi said: "I have long observed the heart to attain the Dao"—it is most numinous. When true breathing is settled, the inner light is the spirit-light; this heart is the true heart. The true heart generates intent, and the spirit-light illumines the heart. Hence the constant teaching: the eyes gaze upon the heart, the heart generates intent, and intent gathers lead.

If yang has not yet flourished and one hastily gathers it, the moment the intent to gather arises, posterior heaven revives. Thus the cultivation of life is fundamentally tied to the ground of nature. Nature is such that all appearances are illusory and false. Once attachment to appearances is gone, falsehood vanishes and true principle is revealed. Yet when true principle is just made clear, if a single thought arises, does this not return to the illusion of appearances? Therefore, wait until yang has grown before gathering—then it will surge upward vigorously. When the qi of prior heaven is abundant, posterior heaven has no chance to resist.

The ascent of gathering is truly extraordinary! It rises in a warm, intoxicating manner, reaching the navel before pausing briefly. When it rests just above the navel, it settles—only then is it called lead-gold. Gold generates water, thus mercury is born in the heart. The principle that clouds follow the dragon and wind follows the tiger is now manifest. When the wind is calm, rain descends, and naturally lead and mercury unite, swallowing and devouring each other. Gold generates water, water generates wood, wood in turn generates fire. Wood loves gold, yet gold despises wood—this is the way of their union. Though metal overcomes wood, how can there be love and hatred? It is simply the inherent nature of metal and wood. I employ the inherent nature of heaven, thus I use the inherent nature of the five phases—though this is but a metaphor. For where do the five phases exist in prior heaven? Yet without such analogies, the principle cannot be conveyed.

Once the method of gathering is clear and the principle of union is revealed, there remains one further admonition: gathering must not be too slow. If too slow, it will age and become unusable, and the qi of posterior heaven will mix in. Let the adept study the *Illustrated Discourse on Union*—then more than half the meaning will be understood.

A poem says:
Intoxicating harmonious qi brews the spring wind,
A single yang is born in the midst of vagueness and indistinctness...

Where nothing gives birth to being, and form emerges from emptiness only to return to it,
Lead’s essence rises above the navel, while Mercury’s nature flows from the heart’s source.
Within stillness, truth appears—within truth, stillness abides.
When Kan and Li unite, a misty rain descends.

A poem says:
Wood becomes the Dragon, Metal the Tiger;
Kan’s gate births the boy, drawing Li’s maiden.
To know the workings of creation’s root,
Look not beyond the true fire born at midnight.

*Discourse on the Diagram of Union*
Vague and indistinct, yet within it lies form;
Dim and obscure, yet within it lies substance.
The ancient sages often used this to warn disciples—
for only in the state of indistinct stillness can the elixir be refined.
Without stillness, yang does not arise;
after yang arises, without stillness, the elixir does not coalesce.
Thus, when the mind first gathers lead, it must not linger—
stillness has its time, ascent its moment.
For what first emerges is nothing more than a single breath.
When it rises to the navel, it becomes lead—
then the heart’s intent must cease, for it is no longer needed.
Lead naturally draws mercury, mercury naturally seeks lead;
within the vague and dim, the principle of union is complete.

I have received my teacher’s oral instructions and now reveal them.
Guard them well! Guard them well!
Read in silence, utter no sound.
If one who understands the Dao—one with karmic roots—
encounters this profound and precious teaching,
let them commit the oral instructions to memory but not to writing,
or if written, let them not be shown.
Then I shall truly be indebted to their virtue.

I studied under my teacher for ten years,
and all that I received, I now lay bare,
wishing to share it with those of like aspiration.
This is the *Supreme Inner Refinement Elixir of Golden Essence and Jade Purity*,
the *Upper-Grade Method for Transcending the World and Attaining Immortality*.
The celestial laws are most strict—
unmindful of consequences, I have composed this text.
After submitting a memorial to the heavenly court for thirty days,
I received a response before daring to set it down in writing.
As I wrote, my heart trembled, sweat fell upon the page,
and tears mingled with my brushstrokes.
May those of true aspiration obtain this,
and may they not implicate me—
together, may we achieve the supreme fruit and ascend the immortal ranks.

Alas!
Those who know me call me anxious of heart;
those who do not ask what I seek.
May our hearts illuminate one another—
I can do no more than earnestly implore.
May the immortals deign to witness this!

*Oral Instructions on Gathering and Union*
Seek within forgetting, forget within seeking;
within forgetting, see—within seeing, forget:
then yang is born.
Forget within gathering, gather within forgetting;
within forgetting, rise—within rising, see;
within seeing, transform:
then lead is formed.
Arise within stillness, ascend within intent;
act within forgetting:
then lead draws mercury.
Lead and mercury unite within,
essence and spirit converge without:
union is achieved.
Lead, mercury, essence, and spirit merge as one—
then direct a single thought to descend to the Yellow Court,
returning to the crucible.

*The Innermost Oral Instruction*
To fuse lead and mercury, use a single intent.
To gather the first yang, stillness must give birth to stillness.
No wonder Lü [Dongbin] often spoke in riddles—
yet still, disciples remain lost and deluded.
So much said—yet this is all.

Hark! Flowers scatter like stars across the sky,
before the gate, the stream’s murmur fades—
the green boat bears the green maiden away,
and in an instant, the green boat returns alone.

The green maiden dwells within me—
clouds rise o’er Wu Gorge’s twelve peaks,
in the deserted palace, flutes fall silent,
the star bridge lies beyond the blue mountains,
and if you seek reunion, you shall never meet.
This is both nature and destiny.

Someone asks: What is *jiaogou*?
The Master replies: The aperture beneath the heart in the *Caiqu Tu* is the place of union. It cannot be sought through form, nor grasped through formlessness. Only when lead ascends does yang qi rise above.

From the qi cave, it descends to the Palace of First Yang—
I gather it with intent.
As mercury descends, they meet,
qi sinking into [the aperture].
For when mercury and lead are born,
lead ascends above the navel,
illumined by the radiance of essence—
thus it is called *lead*.
Lead is like the body, mercury like the shadow;
when the body moves, the shadow follows—
so mercury descends in response.

The ascent of yang lead cannot be called pure yang,
for it contains the radiance of essence—thus it is also yin.
The descent of yin mercury cannot be called pure yin,
for the heart generates mercury, and the heart is spirit.
When mercury encounters the radiance of spirit, it becomes usable—
thus it is also yang.
Within yang there is yin, within yin there is yang.
The two qi intermingle, congeal, and coalesce,
forming the Mysterious Pearl, like a grain of millet.

Someone asks: Lead is the first yang—
the first yang is nothing but primordial qi.
Then what is mercury?
The Master replies: Both lead and mercury are primordial things.
Lead is primordial qi, mercury is primordial numen.
This qi is the mother of destiny,
this numen is the child of nature.
One may call them lead and mercury,
or nature and destiny—
which of the accomplished patriarchs would reveal this so plainly?

Another asks: What is this aperture beneath the heart?
The Master replies: It is the *Hundun* Spirit Chamber,
formed by the qi of essence-light and eye-light—
essence-light surging upward as [yang],
eye-light descending as [yin].
Though essence is primordial essence,
without the essence of daily use, primordial essence cannot appear.
If you doubt this, consider:
where there is water, mist rises as white qi—
have you ever seen white qi rise from dry earth?
Water is essence, white qi is its radiance.

Though spirit is primordial spirit,
only when the spirit of daily use is not enslaved does primordial spirit manifest.
Like the bright moon in the sky—
only when clouds disperse does its light shine down.
Purity is the absence of clouds,
riding the light is its illumination.
Though essence belongs to yin, its radiance belongs to yang;
though eye-light belongs to yang, when it shines inward, it too belongs to yin.
When radiance and light meet, they form an aperture—
qi responds to qi, drawing the two substances to converge within.
All things come into being through essence and qi,
through primordial qi.
When the work is complete and the effort full,
one becomes a True Person.
For the intent of ceaseless generation resides here—
this is why it is numinous and divine.

Should one ask: Once the union is achieved, how does this pearl descend into the Yellow Court and return to the crucible within?

It is said: When the two substances gather, emotion and nature unite, and the Five Phases are complete—like the tiger returning to the mountain, the dragon to the abyss. The eye’s light turns inward, and essence-qi is restored here, descending into the Yellow Court, returning to the crucible within. At the moment of convergence, there is a pivot, a hinge—vague yet luminous, as ten thousand pores burst into spring. Secret, secret, secret.

These words are not found in the original classics; they are what the adept has realized.

Should one ask: Yang arises above—if one abruptly halts its ascent, how can one ensure it will not descend again?

It is said: A profound question! Below the Yellow Court lies the gate of the Cinnabar Chamber. When intent arises, yang ascends; when intent ceases, it unifies—thus yang cannot descend. The furnace and crucible reside within this unity, belonging to Earth, and thus embody the upright qi of the Five Phases, completing the full form of Heaven and Earth.

Should one ask of the method of furnace and crucible:

It is said: The Yellow Court within the human body is thus—when the first yang ascends, and the moment this pearl descends into it arrives, *this* is the furnace and crucible. The Yellow Court is inherently Earth. As for the center within the center, it is Earth within Earth. Thus, when the pearl descends into it, it forms the crucible vessel. The Five Phases each strengthen their foundation—what does "strengthen their foundation" mean? The mother seeks the child, the child clings to the mother—this is the method of the Elixir. All rely on their inherent nature. Once returned to the crucible, each qi follows its course, like the child clinging to the mother. In quiet sitting, when the spirit’s light descends, it returns to the crucible; when essence’s radiance ascends, it does the same. In walking, standing, sitting, or lying down—like the dragon nurturing its pearl, like the hen brooding her egg—each qi returns to it. All the meridians of the body become thus. The key lies in neither forgetting nor forcing growth.

O students of the Dao—is it so? Or is it not?

In my method of the Elixir, it is thus and no more.

A poem says:
Why trouble with the Maiden and the Infant?
I speak to you with utter clarity:
Where Heaven and Earth reverse within the body,
The sun and moon revolve within the flask.

Know that the One is the function of yang—
you must recognize the One as the pivot of qi.
Heaven bade Purple Yang to reveal it all—
why seek another master thereafter?

*The True Diagram of Heaven’s Mechanism Leaked*

Having reached this state, having grasped this principle—do not rejoice too soon.

Hmph! You still do not know how to contemplate it.

A treasured sword lies buried by an ancient prison’s side.
Nightly, rainbow light surges upward to the sky.
Tiger and dragon battle—once the Three Fields grow still,
Where then to seek your mercury and lead?

Ha-ha-ha! Hee-hee-hee!
Beware mistaking deer for horse—
a single Mysterious Pearl lies deep in mud.
By Oxherd and Weaver’s bridge, the path is blocked;
the River Chariot’s passage leaves no trace behind.
Who dares inquire of the true message?
Only the Wind of Xun, blowing through the layered passes, suffices.

*Discourse on the True Diagram of Heaven’s Mechanism Leaked*

Once the diagram of the Golden Elixir is complete, lest the celestial mechanism remain too deeply hidden, let us discuss the inversion of the Five Phases, describe the flow of water and fire, clarify the advance and retreat of medicinal materials, and embody the cyclical movement of sun and moon.

All that needed saying in my three previous essays has been said.
Yet fearing that students may still not grasp it, I have written this book.
This book lays bare the celestial mechanism, revealing even the finest detail—
transforming stubborn stone into gold, transmuting shards into jade—
no exaggeration here.

The two eyes are the dwelling where spirit is enslaved;
wherever one gazes or looks, spirit cannot depart.
The two ears are the place where spirit is sent forth—
sounds from a hundred leagues away enter the ear, and spirit follows, then leaves.
The two nostrils are the station where spirit is wearied—
who but spirit discerns and distinguishes with each breath?

If only the eyes, ears, mouth, and nose were like the brows,
would not spirit then rest and remain whole?
Thus, one would no longer be bound by the postnatal,
nor need to labor in cultivation.

In general:
Forget the eyes, and spirit returns to the crucible, illuminating within—
for in the state of continuous, subtle presence, the eyes lower and gaze downward.
Forget the ears, and spirit returns to the crucible, hearing within—
for in the state of continuous, subtle presence, the ears listen inwardly below.
Forget the nose, and spirit returns to the crucible, drawing breath within—
for when true breathing is settled, qi returns to the Ocean of Origin.

Speaking as one, when all are forgotten, all return to the crucible and unite within.
Is there yet another oral instruction?
The oral instruction—

The hen can brood her eggs with her mind ever attuned.
Someone asked: "In the Dao of the Golden Elixir, the ears, eyes, mouth, and nose have already been discussed, and the heart’s role is self-evident. But what of the liver, gallbladder, spleen, stomach, and lungs—are these truly useless organs? Or do they, too, hold use within their seeming uselessness?"

I answered: "This principle is only understood upon reaching that stage. Yet I have vowed to conceal nothing—what could I possibly hide? When I first sought my teacher, I too asked this. My teacher bestowed upon me a poem, saying:

*At first, I did not grasp this truth,
But once I reached this field,
I knew my teacher had not deceived me.*

Now, I shall reveal what my teacher left unsaid. The functions of the Five Phases cannot lack even one. Thus, in the state of continuous, subtle presence, the spleen’s *qi* and the stomach’s *qi* intertwine and return to the heart’s thread; the liver’s *qi* and the gallbladder’s *qi* intertwine, then the large and small intestines connect to the kidney’s thread; the lung’s *qi* submits to the heart’s *qi* and communicates with the nose. This *qi*, in the stillness after settling, is the primordial *qi* circulating—from east to west, from south to north.

The southwest is the meeting place of *qi*. When *qi* converges here, it then passes straight through the spine to the upper and middle *dantian*, descending to the kidney palace. Between the two kidneys lies a strip called the *Bridge of Life Governance*. As Cold Mountain said: *'Above is the cave where spirits gather; horizontally lies the Bridge of Life Governance.'* When *qi* descends here, yang *qi* and essence *qi* surge upward, merging with this *qi* as one. Then, they encircle the crucible’s exterior, and with daily use, they daily increase. Through the power of cultivation, the *yin* and *yang* banks take form here.

Suddenly, something transcends and emerges—neither inside nor outside. The matter of the Golden Elixir is self-evident without words. Half is the profound within the profound; what is the other half? It is this: when a cultivator of the Golden Elixir reaches this point, they have attained half. That which transcends and emerges is the *Mysterious Pass*, the single aperture. Vast without exterior, minute without interior—within the formed, within the formless. First, seek the formless within the formed: this is seeing *nature* through *life*. Then, seek the formed within the formless: this is seeing *life* through *nature*. To begin with *nature* is difficult; to begin with *life* offers a starting point. Though ten thousand miles may seem distant, there is a path. To begin with *nature* is like grasping the moon in water. Yet in the end, success is the same. Those who begin with *nature* may even surpass! They use *nature* to govern *life*, while I use *life* to govern *nature*—thus, it is not for me to lightly judge. Those who fail to reach this through effort understand only the surface. Without seeing, one need not cling to existence, lest they fall into attachment."

Someone else asked: "In your diagrams, there are many apertures—why?" I answered: "These apertures are not those in the *Gathering and Union* diagrams. For the Dao is the interplay of *yin* and *yang*, boundless in its coming and going. When employed, it fills the entire body. When unused, it retreats to the side of the heart-field, leaving no form or image. What is it, then? It is the master of returning intention. Left belongs to *yang*, right to *yin*—secret, secret, secret, secret—only here is the return to the Great Ultimate.

To return to the *Great Simplicity* is from the Great Ultimate; to return to the Great Ultimate is from the *Great Harmony*; to achieve the *Great Harmony* begins with *yin* and *yang*. Thus it is said: *'When yin and yang harmonize, wind and rain come in season, and fine grain grows.'* This is the analogy.

The *Great Expansion* is fifty. Heaven’s number is one, earth’s is two; heaven three, earth four; heaven five, earth six; heaven seven, earth eight; heaven nine, earth ten. *Yang* is odd, *yin* is even. Heaven’s numbers total twenty-five, earth’s thirty, together making fifty-five. The number of the *Great Expansion* is fifty, minus five to represent the Five Phases—this corresponds to the crucible’s interior and exterior. Then, subtract one more to symbolize the unmoving Great Ultimate, leaving forty-nine in use. Subtract one more to form the *yin* and *yang* banks, leaving forty-eight in use.

The practitioner’s method of the furnace, crucible, and firing employs the four trigrams as the foundation and the sixty-four hexagrams as application, focusing on *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*. Using the *Great Expansion* diagram to seek its imagery, the principle of circulation becomes clear, and the method of the *Celestial Cycle* is revealed. If still unclear, consult the *Discourse on the Furnace and Crucible*.

*A speck of toad-light illumines the great void,
The golden toad in water inhales and exhales.
High and low remain but pure yin’s body—
Why does generating yang require surplus?*

**Discourse:**
The great void is vast and boundless; the bright moon shines alone. Snow-like waves surge, and the golden toad radiates. People see the moon’s brightness and call it *metal essence*—when essence flourishes, the moon shines. But who knows that the Golden Elixir’s generation arises from *nature*? Water symbolizes the *Kan* palace; the golden toad symbolizes the single aperture of true *yang*; primordial *nature* symbolizes the moon’s function. When *nature* first appears, it is star-like, round and luminous. Yet this is not yet the full manifestation of *nature*—only when the *qi*-based *nature* briefly stills does primordial *nature* slightly emerge. Like the moon appearing when clouds part, or vanishing when they close, if not constantly preserved, it may disappear, no different from when it was unseen.

Thus, when a cultivator of the Golden Elixir clearly sees this thing, primordial *qi* is born! They must then employ it—like spotting a thief and seizing them, lest they escape again. Yet when gathered into the crucible, this speck of true primordial *qi* can never depart. Take the *dantian* as the sun and the heart’s primordial *nature* as the moon. The sun’s light naturally reflects upon the moon. After union, the precious body gives birth to metal."

The moon receives the sun’s *qi*, thus on the third day a single yang arises. Once the elixir resides in the crucible, one feels a speck of numinous light constantly illuminating the heart, without distinction of day or night. On the eighth day of the moon, a single yang is born, and the second yang emerges. The second yang signifies the elixir’s *metal-qi* growing slightly stronger, while primordial *nature* becomes slightly manifest. From the second yang’s birth at the moon’s fullness, the third yang becomes pure. The third yang pure means primordial *nature* is fully revealed—precisely what was earlier called "within the formless."

When the first yang arises purely, one merely senses something within the body, now luminous, now hidden. When the second yang is born, the entire body radiates light. When the third yang arises, the light is neither within nor without; one feels this body as if suspended in emptiness—no body, no emptiness, no sun, no moon. To abide thus constantly is *dhyāna-samādhi*. Yet if the elixir cultivator clings to existence and fails to gather true emptiness, they cannot employ the *wu* (non-being).

Having reached this stage, the Golden Elixir is half-complete. Why? Because primordial spirit is now visible, yet it has not returned to the elixir, merging essence and *qi* into one—hence it remains half. Let us now speak of the latter half’s principle: once the moon is full, on the sixteenth day a single yin arises. The first yin marks the beginning of *nature* returning to *ming* (destiny/life). From the first yin’s birth to the twenty-third day of the moon, the second yin emerges. The second yin signifies *nature* returning to *ming* by two-thirds. From the third yin’s birth on the thirtieth day, the three yins are complete. The third yin means *nature* has fully returned to *ming*. When *nature*’s entire body is revealed, its continuous, subtle presence constantly reverts within *ming*.

Initially, *ming* seizes *nature*’s wholeness; then *nature* settles *ming*—this is the celestial mechanism of *nature* and *ming*, the very meaning of "dual cultivation." The celestial mechanism is most profound; I have fully disclosed it. At this point, the Golden Elixir is complete.

Beginning with the fire-phase, each day’s work nourishes it day by day. With a hundred days’ effort, the *spiritual infant* is born. Thus I use the moon as a metaphor, drawing on its principle of mutual illumination and union. The moon’s brightness truly originates from metal; metal’s *nature* truly arises from the moon. Refined a hundred times, it grows ever firmer, indestructible through ten thousand kalpas. For metal is the sun’s color, the moon’s *nature*; fire is the *qi*. When metal enters fire, it returns to primordial *nature*’s truth, enabling refinement into the supreme treasure, called *Golden Liquid Returned Elixir*.

Thus, those who refine the elixir first gather metal, for metal generates water. The principle of union is manifest, relying on earth to complete it. The city walls’ foundations and embankments all depend on the true golden medicine to firmly secure the dike. Refined into pure gold, it is called the *Golden Elixir*.

**Diagram of the Crucible and Furnace**
The crucible and furnace’s form is thus distinct:
The eight trigrams crisscross, their use intimate.
Refining the Five Phases all relies on earth,
Transforming true earth into true gold.

**Discourse on the Crucible and Furnace**
The crucible is neither gold nor iron;
The furnace is neither jade nor stone.
The *Yellow Court* is the crucible,
The *qi*-cavity is the furnace.
The *Yellow Court* lies directly above the *qi*-cavity,
Interwoven with channels—this is the crucible and furnace.
Yin and yang are the charcoal,
For steaming and refining.

Within the human body, the *Yellow Court* is where, at the moment of union, primordial *qi* arises. At this instant, the gate opens and the elixir descends within, whereupon it is secured. This is like mercury filling a gourd, its mouth sealed and placed in deep water. Mercury is lead and mercury; the gourd is the *Yellow Court*; the deep water is *qi*. Sealing the *Yellow Court* conceals the elixir’s mother, placing it in the *qi*-convergence site. Those who understand will examine this and grasp its essence.

When the tiger roars, wind arises; when the dragon intones, clouds gather. The cricket sings in autumn; the clam and oyster reveal yin. Myriad *qi* return to the crucible, sealing it ever more tightly, refining it ever more firmly—this is why the crucible and furnace exist.

The essentials of ten thousand elixir scriptures, with diagrams and images, are meant to enable one to grasp the image and forget the words. Later scholars, clinging to images in search of truth, each seek abstruse theories, unaware that the supreme Dao is not complex—its pivot is merely yin and yang. Whether speaking of "Heaven’s one generating water" or other numerological principles, it merely clarifies the circulation of water and fire. Whether referring to the four seasons and eight solar terms, it merely illustrates the waxing and waning of heaven and earth’s yin and yang. Concealing the mother while speaking of the child, few truly understand. Thus, in writing this book, I discard branches and leaves to speak of the root. With the root present, branches and leaves naturally flourish. The ancients did not wish to speak, yet I have spoken. Daoist adepts should grasp this intent and not regard it as a minor teaching. Following this, one may ascend to immortality in an instant.

Someone asked: The crucible and furnace’s form is clear—may we also hear of their function?

Between heaven and earth, the myriad grasses and trees, all things differ, yet after the winter solstice, when yang stirs below, withered trees flourish anew, grasses sprout, hibernating creatures stir, and all things rejoice. Does creation have a mind to generate the myriad things? Do the myriad things have a mind to await creation? It is merely the movement of a single *qi*, to which the myriad things respond. Heaven—what mind has it? Things—what mind have they?

When the hundred grasses bloom and bear fruit, it is precisely the time when medicinal substances circulate; when leaves fall and fragrance fades, it is precisely the time when medicinal substances return to the root and restore life. This may illustrate how the ancients likened the production and descent of medicinal substances to the formation of the elixir—nothing surpasses this. Yet one must not cling to the notion of "no-mind," allowing them to float and sink of themselves, nor must one cling to the notion of "mind," driving and chasing the fire.

Abide continuously as if present—know its absence, guard its presence; know its darkness, guard its brightness. Within stillness, enact the fire-times; within stability, congeal the returning elixir. Bestow it with the center.

**Diagram of the Spirit Chamber**
Having expended all effort to congeal and complete it,
Turn the light inward to illuminate the scene clearly.
Before the master arrives, who can conceal it?
Hearing the Dao, the numinous light rides the Crimson City.

**Discourse on the Spirit Chamber**
The Spirit Chamber is the chamber where the original spirit resides—this is the *yin’e*. People know the creative transformation of establishing the *yin’e*, which is manifest and revealed. Yet they do not know that a chamber without a master is of what use as a chamber? Though the master is absent, the embryo of the master already lies within this chamber. It is like pregnancy: over ten months, when the mother breathes, so too does the child; when the mother inhales, so too does the child—only the *qi* is not yet sufficient. When the *qi* is full and the form complete, a single spark of numinous light enters within, and suddenly there is birth and crying, wholly and purely human. This is the time when the *yin’e* is formed and the spirit returns to the chamber.

When the spirit returns to its chamber, it is said: "Obtain the One, and all affairs are complete." After intercourse, the spirit’s light rides and illumines the mysterious pearl; essence and brilliance ascend and are produced from the mysterious pearl. True lead is the original *qi*; essence, *qi*, and spirit already have an embryo within. When the fire is sufficient and the *qi* abundant, the original essence, original *qi*, and original spirit all merge into one—thus the infant is born. But is the infant born at once? Only when the fire has smelted away the yin of the grasses does the embryo begin to detach. At this point, the infant is truly born.

I have often said that the diagrams of elixir-refinement drawn by the ancients are indeed the *yin’e*—this single point is to be settled within it. Later scholars, seeing the *yin’e* and knowing the point is to be settled within, yet remain ignorant of the way to settle this point within. Temporarily congealed, it ultimately disperses; fierce fire burns in vain, and the *li* and *kan* escape.

This point, produced externally and following the posterior heaven, becomes one generating two, two generating three, three generating the myriad things—all proceed from this. Ordinary people act upon it with intent, yet reverse the process. Produced internally, the Way of long life and enduring vision is preserved—is this not returning to the root and restoring life? The reason life is restored and the root returned lies in deep roots and firm stems.

The Way of deep roots and firm stems begins with settling the mind and dispelling desires. The principle of settling the mind lies in withdrawing from sight and sound. Confucius said: "Look not at what is contrary to propriety; listen not to what is contrary to propriety; speak not what is contrary to propriety; make no movement that is contrary to propriety." This is the true principle. Yet Confucianism seeks to act in the world and serve the times, thus using propriety as its boundary.

The so-called deluded mind consists of joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure. Loyalty, forgiveness, compassion, deference, sympathy, reverence, respect, and caution constitute the true mind. For those who refine the elixir, the true mind and deluded mind are merged, returning to the origin and tracing back to the beginning. From within the absence of deluded mind, a single true thought arises—striving through the heavens and earth with effort, ultimately reaching effortlessness.

As for the "true mind" of the Buddhists, it differs again: letting go of the six emotions, utterly without a single thought, the nature-ground is vast and empty, and the true origin appears of itself. In the instant of its appearance, there is free coming and going. At the extreme of stillness, reaching the utmost extreme, one sees the Great Ultimate. It requires but a word or half a phrase—like dying once and being reborn—before one can grasp the supreme mechanism of creation and become the root of neither birth nor death. How easily can one glimpse its gate?

**The Jade Purity, Golden Coffer, Azure Florescence Secret Writings of the Golden Treasure Inner Refinement Elixir, Concluding Scroll**

The first quarter [of the moon] must be short, the latter quarter long;
Within water, the lamp’s flame shines of itself.
Day and night, the *xun* wind blows without extinguishing it—
Stir the heart to move it, and it grows yet more radiant.

**Discourse on the Fire-Times Diagram**
The *Book of Changes* contains three hundred and eighty-four lines; the number of the fire is three hundred and eighty-four *zhu*. Thus, abandoning *qian* and *kun* as the crucible and furnace, *kan* and *li* as the external medicinal substances, the first day uses *zhun* and *meng*, the second *xu* and *song*, the third *shi* and *bi*, the fourth *xiaoxu* and *lü*, the fifth *tai* and *pi*, the sixth *tongren* and *dayou*, the seventh *qian* and *yu*, the eighth *sui* and *gu*—and the metal weighs half a *jin*. The ninth day uses *lin* and *guan*, the tenth *shike* and *ben*, the eleventh *bo* and *fu*, the twelfth *wuwang* and *daxu*, the thirteenth *yi* and *daguo*, the fourteenth *xian* and *dan*, the fifteenth *feng* and *dazhuang*, the sixteenth *jin* and *mingyi*, the seventeenth *jiaren* and *kui*, the eighteenth *jian* and *jie*, the nineteenth *sun* and *yi*, the twentieth *guai* and *shen*, the twenty-first *cui* and *sheng*, the twenty-second *kun* and *jing*, the twenty-third *ge* and *ding*—and the water weighs half a *jin*. The twenty-fourth day uses *zhen* and *gen*, the twenty-fifth *jian* and *guimei*, the twenty-sixth *feng* and *lü*, the twenty-seventh *xun* and *dui*, the twenty-eighth *huan* and *jie*, the twenty-ninth *zhongfu* and *xiaoguo*, the thirtieth *jiji* and *weiji*.

In an instant, it completes a cycle, cycling without end. From the movement of the sun and moon, the alternation of cold and heat, the blending of heaven and earth, the transformation of the myriad things into harmony—reversing creation, overturning *qian* and *kun*, stealing from the cosmos, robbing yin and yang—only those who comprehend the world’s utmost subtleties may speak of this.

Some may ask: "The forms of *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*—these are the timings of the celestial cycle of fire and *qi*. When *Kan* and *Li* unite, *Qian* and *Kun* converge! The Dao of Heaven descends, the Dao of Earth ascends—this is the function of *Qian* and *Kun*. *Kan* is *Qian* uniting with *Kun*, and *Li* is *Kun* uniting with *Qian*. The other hexagrams merely establish form; one must not rigidly seek the lines and images, for only then does the method of fire and *qi* become apparent."

Another says: "By your words, it seems no more than encompassing Heaven and Earth, circulating the sun and moon. Yet the *Furnace and Cauldron Diagram* arranges the eight trigrams within the cauldron, and the *Fire and Qi Diagram* elevates the *wu* position to the *Niwan* palace, laying a level bridge between *mao* and *you*. Why is this?"

I reply: "The celestial mechanism was never meant to be revealed, but since words have come to this, why conceal it further? The River issued the Diagram, the Luo issued the Book—Heaven itself disclosed these, let alone man!"

The guest says: "Enough."

I have heard that revealing celestial secrets brings calamity upon nine generations, yet have I not also heard that saving one person brings blessing upon nine generations? With my method of the Elixir, I conceal nothing and transmit it fully to those of karmic affinity. If even one faithful practitioner attains immortality, how could I have no merit?"

The guest says: "Your intent is beyond what I can fathom."

I say: "This furnace, this cauldron—these are but the principles of advancing fire and water. Water and fire are nothing more than *qi*. When *qi* ascends, I meet it with the mind—this is fire. When *qi* descends, I sustain it with stillness—this is water. In this state of unbroken continuity, the work of advancing at *zi* and *wu* is applied. At this moment, the time of the crescent-moon furnace arrives.

When innate nature appears, *qi* is born; when *qi* is born, metal is born; when metal is born, *qi* multiplies; when *qi* multiplies, metal flourishes ever more. These two interact in mutual function. When metal flourishes within, it pierces the floating clouds, revealing a sliver of true nature—bright as the moon: this is the crescent-moon furnace. With prolonged nurturing, metal and *qi* grow abundant and complete, illuminating a full orb of bright moon—this is the fullness of nature. Once the full nature is seen and metal-nature is returned, my body is wholly governed by true nature and life. This is the time to apply fire.

For before these two merge as one, fire is used to refine them, forging pure gold. Encompassing nature and life, the entire body becomes yang, floating and sinking at will, cherishing the sun and moon, delighting in roaming the crown gate. When the time comes, the Dao is accomplished—with a sudden burst, a thunderclap resounds, and the body is no longer one’s own.

Alas! Every person could succeed thus, yet those who abandon themselves—how pitiful they are!"

When I survey the entire work, once the nine cycles are complete, the bathing finished, and the fire’s power exhausted, not a single star is extinguished—then a single breeze stirs to fan it. This *xun*-wind is but a slender thread beneath the crucible. When closed, it is *qian*; when opened, it is *xun*. Closed, it exhales; opened, it inhales. How does it open and close? Nothing but the mind’s intent makes it so.

Some may ask: *Xun* is the position of the west—yet by your account, *xun* resides in the central palace. Have you not reversed them?
I say: The west is *xun* in function; the central palace is *xun* in essence. When an intent arises from my heart and descends to the *xun* position, its image begins to open—thus my words truly encompass both essence and function.

Next comes *qian*. *Qian* is metal, and fire is the essence of metal; when they meet, blazing fire spreads. It must be tempered by *kan*, yet if *kan* cannot restrain it, the fire may turn and attack below. Thus it is halted by *gen* and exhaled by *xun*. The upper line of *xun* belongs to yang; without yang, fire cannot be stilled. When it encounters *zhen*, the flame flickers; when it meets *li*, it blazes anew. It is then halted by *kun*. *Kun* is water, and fire arises from water—if it encounters *dui*, it ceases of its own accord. *Kun* is not a primary trigram, so it gradually returns to *dui*, which is also the trigram of the west. Thus, from the *weilü*, it slowly ascends to the *niwan* peak, the Gate of Heaven, the place of true noon. Noon belongs to fire, and the fire grows ever brighter. Then it is met by the heart—fire of the heart, the meeting being spirit, thus spirit-fire—brightening further still.

If at *mao* and *you* it were to descend directly, punishment and virtue would stand at the gate—how perilous! Therefore, one path divides into two. Today’s *mao* and *you* are yesterday’s *kun* and *gen*. Fire is *qi*, and the principle of *qi* is to descend and then ascend. Thus it returns to the kidney palace, transforming into true water, and is put to use.

Gentle fire is yielding in nature and difficult to transform; when it encounters *mao*-wood, wood must overcome earth, so fire is used to overcome wood, and earth is no longer subdued. Fierce fire is strong and easily transformed; descending from *you*, *you* belongs to metal, and metal generates water, so water returns to the crucible.

One asks: What is gentle fire? What is fierce fire?
I say: Gentle fire rises from the Three Passes to the heavens. Fierce fire is the fire of the noon palace and the heart.

In all the firing process, this is the moment of greatest danger. The alchemist must prevail in a single battle, and the world will be settled. The daily cycle of celestial firing must not be taken as a fixed rule—yet neither should this be clung to, nor that. Rejoice, rejoice!

As auspicious clouds part, the primordial vastness appears;
Dimly in the void, ancestors seem to appear.
When the wind stills, the Seven Stars remain in the water;
Faintly, lingering echoes drift through the sky.

*Yin Exhausted Diagram*
*Discourse on the Yin Exhausted Diagram*

One day, Master Zhang sat in a secluded chamber, his form forgotten and his qi transformed. Suddenly, a wind arose in both ears, and he first became aware of the autumn cicadas’ cries. Across the river, the verdant willows seemed to carry the lingering echoes of celestial flute music from the nine heavens. In a daze, he perceived a figure standing beside him—its ears, eyes, mouth, and nose identical to his own. Pointing at Zhang, it cursed: "Since the primordial chaos of *Taiyi*, I have served you without a moment’s respite. What crime have I committed against you?"

Master Zhang could not help but laugh soundlessly and said to it in silence: "Come, let me speak with you. What you say is true, but tell me—have you suffered for me, or have I suffered for you? Sit for a while, old friend." The figure replied: "From the beginning, I had no cares. After dwelling with you, waking or sleeping, I have been bound to you. Through countless kalpas, I have lost my freedom. You placed me in the deserts of wind and frost, then bade me return east, then west—endlessly tormenting me. Only recently have I been sheltered in a chamber of wisdom, nurtured by regulated breathing. It is good, yet too late."

Zhang said: "This is not my fault, but the doing of the six thieves of desire. You are subtle and hidden, while they are manifest and conspicuous. I knew of them but not of you—like a blind man in a boat, aware only that it travels a thousand *li* each day, yet unaware of the labor of the one who poles it. If the boat were not set in motion, the poler would be at ease!"

The figure resembling Zhang rejoiced: "I nearly lost you! I possess a blade tempered a hundred times—together, we can exterminate these thieves and root them out." Later, when they entered the alchemical crucible, they would ascend alone to the Golden Gates. Zhang replied: "Indeed, indeed."

Then, yellow light burst forth in all directions, and the five colors shone brilliantly. Those who witnessed it heard these words: "The way to expel the thieves must not be rushed. Haste invites counterattack. If your strength is insufficient, disaster is certain. Let the remaining thoughts roam freely, but guard them with constant care. Though they may assume cunning forms, regard them as nothing. One battle settles the Three Pure Ones, and all demons are cast aside."

Alas!
In those days, the winds of the world raged in vain,
Now waves are stilled, the sea is calm, and peace presages ascent.
Pitiful are those who fail to grasp the cycles of fortune,
Still brandishing their weapons, watching over my city.

Alas!
The flames of ignorance burn without smoke,
Yet warmth arises from the true solar essence, piercing the heavens.
With a thunderous crack, the perfect elixir is born,
Soaring through the skies to pay threefold homage before the Jade Emperor.

*Yang Pure Diagram Discourse*
(No further text—what is there to see?)

*On the Essentials of the Golden Elixir*
Man’s body, vast yet ungraspable as heaven and earth, encompasses the ten thousand things, its transformations unfathomable, its numinous subtlety profound. Yet the common people use it daily without awareness—thus the Way of the Golden Elixir is rare indeed!

The Way of the Golden Elixir values the medicinal substances, which reside in essence, qi, and spirit. Spirit begins with the radiance of spirit-light; essence begins with the essence of vitality; qi is the primordial qi. Essence is not full without qi; spirit is not replete without qi. Essence fuses through qi; qi functions through essence. Qi manifests through spirit; spirit operates through qi.

Let us speak of the body’s heaven and earth: After the Great Ultimate divides, the Two Modes are distinguished. The Two Modes generate the Four Images, the Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams, and with the Eight Trigrams established, the Way of heaven, earth, and man is complete. Heaven takes movement as its essence; earth takes stillness as its essence. The qi of heaven and earth ceaselessly intermingles, with the sun and moon traversing between them.

After our parents shaped and nurtured us, the meridians first formed. Once the body was complete, the finer channels emerged, reverting to the emptiness of original nature. The pathways of the valleys and sinews resemble the lush growth of grasses and reeds. This is the primordial qi, the Way of the primordial—these are the most precious words of the golden treasure. One must guard it with the center, that the pathways may be unimpeded.

Man receives the central harmony of heaven and earth at birth—this is called *ming*. Born of the central qi of heaven and earth, one becomes human. Taking the body as heaven and earth, one must also hold to the center as the pivot of creation. The center has three centers: the heart’s center of intent, the navel’s crucible, and the kidneys’ furnace. Of these three, the heart’s center of intent is most crucial, the navel’s crucible next, and the kidneys’ furnace last. From the beginning to the end of the Golden Elixir, these three must never be separated for even a moment.

In the Way of the Golden Elixir, scholars often seek the branches of the Five Phases. They should know that at the moment of union, in the realm of indistinct obscurity, the pores are nurtured—this is the root of metal. In ease and harmony, the limbs are supple—this is the root of wood. Lead is fundamentally fire in nature yet metallic in disposition; mercury is fundamentally water in nature yet wooden in disposition. There is no other reason: water and fire are the bodies of lead and mercury; metal and wood are their functions. When lead and mercury congeal, their radiance unites—this is intent, which belongs to earth. Once the Five Phases are complete within the crucible, like attracts like, and the Five Phases encircle it without. Through inner and outer resonance, the elixir begins to take form, resembling a grain of millet—neither green nor yellow, neither black nor white, beyond description.

At this stage, one must preserve it with unbroken continuity, in purity and non-action. Naturally, a hundred wondrous phenomena appear. The kidney water merges with the essence-water, flowing down from the mysterious throat—this is called the divine water of the Flowery Pond. Within the void, white snow arises and the yellow sprout grows. In the moment of unbroken continuity, all swiftly returns to the crucible. Thus, the great medicine never departs from essence, qi, and spirit—one must first recognize the medicinal materials.

Yet the medicinal substances arise from essence, qi, and spirit—they are not essence, qi, and spirit themselves. Nowadays, some follow heterodox paths, self-righteous in their practices, exhausting essence, qi, and spirit in servitude. How can they produce the medicine?

Of essence, qi, and spirit—which is most vital? The answer: spirit is most vital. The Dao of the Golden Elixir begins with spirit and employs essence and qi, hence spirit is most vital. Spirit is another name for nature; in the utmost stillness, when primordial qi is about to arise, spirit also seeks to emerge. One must swiftly stabilize it with concentration and await its return—otherwise, it becomes a formless form, scattered and without substance. If one boasts of its comings and goings, claiming mastery of the great Dao, who then could not achieve it? Spirit moves not swiftly yet arrives instantly, travels not yet reaches everywhere. As the master’s teaching says: the wondrous function of spirit is boundless yet constrained. If one grasps the Dao, one may guide its entry and exit, but it must never be recklessly ventured. For while gathering it within is permissible, how could one dare to release it without?

When spirit departs and takes form by clinging to trees and plants, yin has not yet been exhausted. As it prepares to emerge, many strange phenomena appear: moonlight shines brilliantly, issuing from the eyes; breath is drawn in through the nose, issuing from the nose; pure sounds are heard in the ears, issuing from the ears. Why then can it not enter and exit through the mouth? The mouth is the gathering place of the five viscera’s qi, and spirit, abandoning essence and qi, steals away to avoid this realm of abundant qi. Spirit, qi, and essence are ever intertwined in longing; once spirit departs, the other two have nothing to rely upon. Thus, the departure of spirit brings harm and no benefit. Day by day and month by month, it illumines the earth below. The alchemist reverses its course for inner work, while following its flow becomes fire.

This fire circulates in cycles—nine revolutions within nine revolutions. At the first revolution, it flourishes, then waits for yin qi to dissipate before advancing to the second, and so on, until the nine revolutions are complete and it presses upon the crucible. Thus, the work of advancing the fire is called "true yang battling the grassy yin." Let me clarify: the human body is entirely yin, possessing but a single point of yang. I take this single point of yang, moving it from afar to near, revolving it again and again, battling and retreating the grassy yin. Thereby, the yang path daily grows while the yin path daily wanes. As the *Book of Changes* says: "The dragon battles in the wilds; its blood is dark and yellow." When yin is exhausted and yang is pure, the elixir may ascend to the Mud Pill Palace. Suddenly, with fierce determination, the true person first appears. Such is the Dao of the Golden Elixir—there is more that words cannot exhaust.

When the elixir first forms, during its union, it inevitably relies on the convergence of yin and yang qi. Later, it is gradually refined with yang fire into a body of pure yang. Thus, it ceaselessly strengthens—this is the Qian Dao. The elixir is complete, and so one condenses spirit to form the body, achieving the initial stage of the immortal elixir. Initially, it employs the five phases to fulfill its function, but later, it is nourished with true gold to become a body of pure gold. Hence, its entire being radiates golden light. Gold transforms into the color of the sun, thus it shines; gold embodies the nature of the sun, thus it is firm. It is called the Golden Elixir, or Golden Immortal.

Though the illusory body is a temporary construct, the alchemist must rely on it to cultivate the foundation of the elixir—like the earth, when the city walls are secure, external evils cannot enter. In the moment of unbroken continuity, the spleen and stomach merge into one channel, encircling the left side of the elixir chamber, while the lungs and liver merge into another, encircling the right. When true qi thoroughly penetrates, it circulates within the meridians. Thus, by drawing near the elixir, qi may be obtained to transform into the supreme treasure. Understanding one aspect reveals the other, yet this too arises naturally from non-action. I have raised this example to make it clear.

Non-action is not inaction. The single qi within a person moves through intention—like clenching a fist: the intention to open causes the five fingers to extend, yet nothing is outwardly manifest. When the adept comprehends this, at the moment of gathering the primordial unity of qi, they maintain a single true intention, drawing in a single true qi. Following the diagram and observing the image, it settles in the Yellow Court—this principle is one and the same.

In the depths of winter’s desolation, only after the union of yin and yang does the myriad phenomena arise. When the adept understands this, they know that after the union, without expecting the birth of the elixir, it will naturally be born. Gold in water dazzles the eyes; gold in earth is concealed by it. For it is born in seclusion, hiding its brilliance. The elixir within the crucible is like a ruler on the throne: when the hundred officials fulfill their duties, the nation is naturally at peace, and the people are at ease. When fire timing and medicinal substances are each in their proper place, the myriad transformations are accomplished.

What does "each in their proper place" mean? In the first revolution, the medicine is produced in the east and descends in the west. The heart serves as the handle of the Dipper, turning the mechanism. Thus, moving twenty degrees fills the po, and turning another twenty degrees fills the hun. Thereby, the fire’s hun and the water’s po stand firm, and the spirit’s function is greatly enhanced. The other revolutions follow likewise. To illustrate the essentials: it is said, "The Dipper’s handle establishes the four seasons; the eight nodes all follow its course. The Dipper’s pivot stands firm, while the handle and scoop move behind it. One need only keep the two eyes bright, their upper and lower functions in harmony. Proceed in stillness, do not rush heedlessly. If you seek a formless diagram to guide you: a single qi circulates and returns to its original abode—what else is needed for the Golden Elixir to succeed? The supreme Dao is not complex; it is ordinary people who complicate it. I received this from my teacher’s transmission, thrice admonished to explore its secrets. Why then draw diagrams and compose treatises, expounding every minute detail to astonish gods and ghosts? Hmph! Were it not for those who transmit the Dao, the scriptures would remain, and the three masters would pass away."

**Secret Instructions in Sequence:**
Sit in stillness, dispelling idle thoughts. Face upward, regulate the breath, and guard the moment of one’s own birth. When the command is heard, qi harmonizes and rises. Wait until qi stirs before proceeding downward, storing it within, then direct it upward to the two orifices, surging straight into the five stars. Await the radiant stillness, then observe the heart releasing a segment downward. Await another radiance, and the true qi of the first yang is born. Maintain unbroken continuity—just eighty percent.

When the faint light emerges, employ the mechanism of entry and exit—once the Dao is opened, then proceed with the *zi-wu* cycle. When the great light emerges, employ the mechanism of entry and exit to break through the crown once. This is the method of ascending posteriorly and descending anteriorly. Thereafter, all pertains to the *weilü* and the Five Stars, and within thirty days, the mechanism of entry and exit will be observed. At the first quarter, fifty days suffice, and the mechanism is seen thrice in all around the full moon. On the left and right, the mechanism appears; when the days of the last quarter are complete, the lower luminous cauldron darkens. Employ the mechanism, then face the celestial path directly. With *Taihe*, return to the *Taiji*; with *Taihe*, return to the *Wuji*.

The mechanism of movement and stillness: when qi is abundant, restrain it with stillness; when qi is weak, assist it with intention.

**Secret Instructions on Fire Times:**
The elixir resides within the cauldron—above is water, below is fire. The heart’s movement pertains to fire; stillness pertains to water—this is the water cauldron. The base’s stillness pertains to water; movement pertains to fire—this is the fire cauldron. When yang is beneath the cauldron, it is called water; when fire ascends above the cauldron, it is called water-fire. Yang fire is the external furnace; the external furnace and fire abide within the *qi* cavity. The *Huangting* is situated above the *qi* cavity, and the *qi* cavity is the internal furnace. The internal furnace stores fire, constantly refining near the cauldron—this is "maintaining unbroken continuity."

When fire grows and advances below, one must not remain seated, except during the *zi* and *wu* hours. At *wu*, advance fire; at *zi*, advance water. When yang arises, do not disturb it with the heart; receive it with intention, guiding it to the right, then rotating and descending to the left, storing it within. The reverse is advancing fire.

Someone asked: "May I inquire about the nine revolutions?"
The master replied: "Three months of fire times constitute the nine revolutions.
**First Revolution:** Begin at the flanks, left and right, storing the path of fire. Starting from the yang palace, ascend from the right side to the shoulder, traverse the center, and condense, sending it downward from the left. Then maintain unbroken continuity—stillness is preferable to movement, slowness to haste. Movement is called 'fanning the fire'; haste is called 'injuring the elixir.' This is the daily practice at the *zi* hour.
**Second Revolution:** Advance one *cun* and two *fen* from the flank, employing the previous method. This is the practice at the *chou* hour.
**Third Revolution:** Advance five *fen* from the flank, employing the previous method. This is the practice at the *yin* hour.

**Bathing:** At the *mao* hour, when fire arises to retrieve the elixir, measure four *cun*—two threads form the path of fire. The pulse penetrates the cauldron, so when fire arises, do not use the eyes or heart; guide it with intention. Rotate right to align horizontally with the cauldron—this is the true thread of earth. Then enter profound stillness, and fire transforms into water, returning to the elixir within the cauldron. Thus bathe, maintaining unbroken continuity.

Heavenly mechanism! Heavenly mechanism!"

**Guard this well! Guard this well!**

**Fourth Revolution:** Advance one *cun*, employing the previous method. This is the practice at the *chen* hour.
**Fifth Revolution:** Advance five *fen*, employing the previous method. This is the practice at the *si* hour.
**Sixth Revolution—Withdrawal and Addition:** Advance five *fen*. Fire arises from below, and at the *wu* hour, the heart-fire and crown-fire blaze together; thus, yang’s initial flourishing is slightly restrained in withdrawal. When it revives, the fire is already faint! Ascend directly to the left, then traverse horizontally—just as it reaches the heart, encountering heart-fire, the flames flare fiercely! This is withdrawal and addition.

**Seventh Revolution:** Advance five *fen*, employing the previous method. This is the practice at the *wei* hour.
**Eighth Revolution—Bathing:** Proceed leftward in descent, rightward in ascent, retrieving the elixir precisely one *cun*. The fire-path of the *wei* hour is entirely the path of utmost yin. When fire’s power wanes, it meets the *shen* path—also a yin path. There is no other way: above the heart lies the yang path; below the heart, the yin path. The fires of both hours pass through the yin path, and only at *you* does metal begin to flourish; thus, await it in stillness. Fire transforms into golden liquid and returns to the elixir within the cauldron. Thus bathe: the *mao*-hour bathing augments mercury, while the *you*-hour bathing augments lead.

**Ninth Revolution:** Retrieve the elixir, merely five *fen*, applying it in an instant before settling to await.
**Tenth Revolution—Hai Hour:** Employ the *xun* wind to kindle fire, performing the method of revolving fire. Consult the *Fire-Timing Diagram*.
