**Preface to the *Qizhen Collection* of Master Tongxuan of Mount Jinfeng**

I humbly consider: to rightly order spring, summer, autumn, and winter, one must have a pointer to make them known; to fathom the subtle, wondrous, and all-pervading, one must rely on words to awaken understanding. Yet words are but shadows of the mind’s perceptions, and written characters are shadows of words. Thought is the mind’s shadow, speech the mind’s echo—neither possesses a true substance. Yet through them, principle may be exhausted, the subtlest mysteries dissolved, all errors obliterated, and not a single dharma clung to. What use, then, are words?

Yet if principle is not inscribed in words, it would be like fish without a trap—none would seek it—or like hares without snares—none could be caught. Generally speaking, words are the traps and snares for fish and hares, sufficient to record the essentials of the supreme Dao, to guide and govern the mechanisms of immortality. How could they be discarded?

Thus, the sages composed and expounded the *Yinfu* and the *Daode*, unfolding the essence of the wondrous origin. The worthies, emulating the sages, wrote books such as the *Chongxu* and the *Nanhua* sutras, striving to enlighten later awakened ones, leading them to transcend the mundane and enter sagehood. How could they not employ words to do so?

Moreover, in recent times, the Five True Lineages have branched into many schools, teachings flourishing in all directions. Qiu and Liu authored the *Panxi* and *Xianle* collections; Tan and Ma titled their works *Jinyu* and *Shuiyun*. Without exception, they all drummed and sang the winds of the mysterious, illuminating wisdom and insight like the bright moon in a frosty sky, universally reflected in a thousand pools. They enabled those who savor the Dao to chew its rich marrow, to recognize the right path and avoid the pitfalls of delusion. Was this not achieved through words clarifying principle?

Later, those who grasped the dragon’s scales or clung to the phoenix’s wings, who expounded the Dao and bequeathed teachings to rescue the drowning and guide the lost—I have witnessed this in Master Tongxuan. The Master’s surname was Liu, his given name Zhiyuan, a native of Gaolou Village in Xici. Born with compassion and empathy, he cherished the ancestral teachings from childhood, delving deeply into the great vehicle’s canonical texts. In adulthood, he encountered the flourishing of the Dao’s fortune, when the multitude of teachings were released from vulgarity. He met Master Chaoran, who transmitted to him the principles of nurturing the true, preserving simplicity, seeing nature, and recognizing the mind—all rooted in non-action.

Thereupon, he abandoned what the masses loved and gathered what they discarded. With resolve, he directly entered the profound mystery, stepping through the gate of a myriad wonders. With one taste, the three observations became empty and pure; with a second, all eight directions turned crystalline. Manifesting transformation bodies in countless forms, he traversed the single path of life and death. The celestial mechanisms and wondrous Dao were already imprinted in his heart. Thus, every utterance and written word from his brush may be likened to strings of pearls and strands of jade, not carved or engraved but naturally transcending all contrived search and arrangement. Truly, this is a compass for learners, worthy of the finest calligraphers.

Though but a single phrase or a lone character, his aim was to pry open the blind and rouse the deaf, enabling them to receive and apply the teachings—not merely to cultivate himself. Yet before his literary legacy could fully flourish, he suddenly departed the world. Having penetrated the six realms with unwavering certainty, he shattered the muddy pellet (of the brain) and ascended formlessly. His writings, though extant, remained obscure and little known.

His disciple, Li Zhiquan of Pingshui, fearing they would fade into oblivion over time, traveled extensively through Jin and Bing provinces. He gathered fragments from friends who recited them from memory and obtained eight or nine parts out of ten from the records of Liu Zhijian. Thus, he collected the remnants, assembled them into a single compilation, arranged them by category, and divided them into three scrolls, titling them *Qizhen* (*Awakening the True*).

He showed them to me, seeking my review, and repeatedly urged me to write a preface, hoping to have them published and widely disseminated. Upon repeated perusal, I found the text and principles clearly laid out like a go board, the wondrous insights scattered like stars. They can guide those wandering in the dark alleys into the great radiance of the pure and luminous realm. How could one who is not a luminous pearl of the mind, transcending heaven and earth, achieve such a feat?

Though I am a descendant of the Dao’s lineage, my attainment of the Dao is but faint and indistinct. My talent is as light as a cicada’s wing, my words as shallow as a frog’s croak. How dare I strike the cloth drum before the Thunder Gate? Yet, compelled by his insistence and unable to refuse, I have roughly sketched a fraction of the Master’s literary brilliance and exemplary conduct with these humble words.

Written on the twenty-second day of the latter part of the fourth lunar month in the year of *jiachen* (1244). Inscribed at the beginning of the scroll.

By Dong Shiyan, the Elder of Fengyuan of Tongyangjinli.

**Qizhen Collection, Volume One**
Composed by Liu Zhiyuan, Master Tongxuan of Mount Jinfeng

**Seven-Character Quatrains**
*In Response to Wang Anren’s Inquiry on Daily Practice*

Silent and ceaseless, the breath fans no wind,
Jade path pierced through, bone-deep fire burns bright.
At Kun’s summit, the sun refines jade nectar,
Nine-nines of merit merge in ebb and flow.

*Following Wang Yongzhang’s verse on wine*

No need for brewed ale or fermented grain’s bouquet,
My golden elixir’s savor alone endures.
Heartless, I drink to dawn’s intoxication,
Mystic trance roams the land of endless night.

*In harmony with Qi Ziming’s rhyme*

Shaking off dust from my lapels, I delight in the Dao’s realm,
Clapping my breast, I recall the moonlit homeland of old.
A flask of spring’s hue in the realm of clarity,
Self and world vanish—both forgotten in ease.

*Following Fan Qingshu’s rhyme*

Deep in woods and springs, I recall the immortal’s abode,
Stealing moments to tend the moon’s radiance.
Loving the Silver River’s wind and waves so still,
I drift on rosy wings, sailing the magic raft.

*Dongxi Zhao the Master’s tea offering*

A jade bowl of sacred water, stirred with cinnabar,
Skillful hands brew auspicious snowflake blooms.
Long ago, Lu Tong savored its taste,
Now I fully grasp it as the Yellow Sprout.

*To Chang Lou’an*

No chase for court or mountain,
Only loving poverty’s idle days.
Moonlit nights and dawn winds as sworn friends,
No craving for rank or purple sashes.

*Again*

Dwelling in seclusion, joy unburdened by comfort,
Alone amidst mist and emerald skies.
Now standing, now walking, worldly cares dissolve,
Half singing, half dancing, a few smiles arise.

*For Master Li*

A line heard by the ear demands effort,
On the tongue, great vessels are hard to forge.
Timed firing completes the seven-sevens,
Flesh and bone fuse—even spirits gasp.

*In harmony with Jianxuan’s rhyme*

The secluded chamber’s mirror outshines the Moon Palace,
Illuminating all within as emptiness.
Manifesting everywhere, unburdened by things,
Light shines inside and out—body perfectly whole.

*Again in the same rhyme*

The empty chamber’s mirror, pure and still,
Never permits the world to grind its sheen.
Its light embraces all forms, ever responsive,
Impartial in its work, never clinging to others.

*On the Brush*

Strong-boned, light-bodied, its tip sharp as a needle,
Obeying the hand’s ink, its nature unrestrained.
Branches live, trunks die through ages past,
Yet still it pours forth, blackening hearts.

*Evening Glow Pavilion at Yongzhen Hermitage*

Sunset hangs on the forest’s edge, sky clear,
Light strikes the cloud pavilion, dazzling the eye.
I have returned to the golden realm,
No half-grain of worldly dust lingers.

*Bamboo at Gushen Hermitage*

Cloud-court hands planted the tall bamboo,
Stalwart joints, hollow hearts, unstained by dust.
Defying snow, scorning cold, its spirit rare,
Evergreen through all four seasons’ spring.

*Leaving Home Without Awakening*

Severing love, I sought the path beyond the world,
Yet only plunged into day and night’s frantic labor.
Boasting of tending a few acres,
Even an inch of the magic field lies barren.

*Expressing My Feelings*

Brewed slowly, the deathless draft,
Drunk in bliss, I enter the immortal’s land.
Sobering, I bathe in the unborn body,
Suddenly sensing golden waves filling my belly.

*Mid-Autumn Moon Gazing*

Full moon’s shadow chills like ice,
Its radiance pierces the golden sky, boundless.
I see the true form of perfect clarity,
No need to point a finger to see.

*Resting at Pine Pavilion*

Straw sandals, bamboo staff, I rest in the thatched hut,
Facing the pine pavilion, vast as the void.
Wind stilled, mist cold, the sky endless,
I seem to wander the old land of Hua Xu.

*Hearing the Zither at Pine Pavilion*

Pine Pavilion stirs to shed worldly dust,
Three strains of the jade zither, one wisp of incense.
Murmuring winds, rustling strings,
No need for misty isles to hear immortal tunes.

*Following Cai Qing’s Rhyme*

Within heaven, another heaven unfolds,
Expanding the power of creation within.
Embodied in the Great Void, without form,
It manifests as solitary perfection in all ten directions.

*Admonishing the Assembly*

The Dao embraces earth and the three heavens,
Do not cling to the mindless—merge with nature.
When practice aligns with Heaven’s timing,
Only then does the pearl of nature shine round.

*The Moon of Nature*

Not a wisp of cloud veils the frosty sky,
The moon of nature hangs, supremely bright.
Responsive across the three realms and ten directions,
A thousand pools reflect its perfect roundness at once.

*Jin River*

The Jin’s waters flow cold, unafraid of chill,
Warm as if boiling, spraying mist and cloud.
I know it alone bears the spring’s eternal breath,
Unbound by yin and yang’s creative power.

*Tailing Hermitage*

A solitary hut nestles in cloud-wrapped hills,
Its gate untouched by wheels or hooves, moss-spotted.
After reading the *Yellow Court*, incense cools,
Deer and apes keep me company in tranquil ease.

*Ascending the Great Tower*

Climbing the perilous tower, my gaze expands,
A day’s ten thousand miles held in my palm.
So clear, so distant, free of dust’s veil,
I seem to dwell idly in the Moon Palace.

*Viewing the Plum Blossoms*

Fierce cold oppresses all things,
Yet the garden’s old jade plum stands proud.
Unfazed by the biting wind’s force,
Its white blooms open branch by branch in the snow.

*Invited by Elder Ren of Tongyang*

My body like an untethered fishing boat,
Drifting the vast sea at will.
When inspired, I sing; when weary, I sleep,
Letting the world’s seasons turn as they may.

*Occasional Verse*

Beyond form, the pivot’s subtle work,
On the ground of the unborn, I nurture heaven’s truth.
Forging a single luminous body,
Scattered, it becomes wind; gathered, it is spirit.

*Answering Ren Erxian’s Inquiry on Daily Practice*

Lead and mercury refined by the hour,
A hair’s misstep and the elixir fails.
If you grasp how to daily add a pearl,
Its light embraces the void—body perfectly bright.

*In Harmony with the Palace Examination, Presented to Master Wang*

Mountain hermitage’s traces pure, dust-free,
Cultivating the Dao’s true work, renewed each day.
A heart at ease, unstained by anything,
Vigilant, worthy to follow the gourd-discarding sage.

*Sudden Rain*

Clouds rise at Heaven’s Gate like ink poured,
Thunder roars, lightning flashes, rain torrential.
Fierce and towering, it scatters with the wind,
Washing the rivers and mountains a thousand miles clean.

*Mountain Dwelling*

Embracing poverty’s livelihood in deep ravines,
Apes and deer my only kin, neighbors gone.
A censer of sandalwood incense, nothing to do,
Three paths through the wicker gate, my breast full of spring.

*Visiting a Recluse, Unmet*

Amid mist and rosy clouds, I seek the immortal,
Yet in my quest for truth, truth eludes me.
The crane’s carriage drifts away, untraceable,
Falling blossoms seal the spring of Wuling in vain.

*West Pavilion at Yunxi Hermitage*

Evening’s sunlight strikes the western pavilion,
Revealing each thing in its completeness.
A radiant light illumines the Dao’s eye,
No need to seek elsewhere for my own heaven.

*In Harmony with Han Ziyu’s Excursion to East Mountain*

Clattering clogs climb the eastern ridge,
Suddenly my body and mind feel cool and pure.

**Sighing This Body**

This frame is firm, ever self-purifying,
Grinding through the years where earth and heaven stretch long.

---

**Matching Bu Caiqing’s "Golden Peak Abbey"**

**I**
Golden Peak’s immortal hall faces the lone ridge,
Man alone deeply engraves the heart of virtue and power.
Grateful, auspicious clouds appear from time to time—
The Peng Palace lies plain within the eye’s reach.

**II**
Majestic Golden Peak presses upon distant peaks,
Ancient cypresses before the court pierce heaven’s heart.
It clearly points to the meaning of the Western Advent—
Why seek Cao Creek so far away?

**III**
Gazing at Golden Peak’s flank, it meets green summits,
Its ice-pure aspect pervades the human heart.
How many toil for fame and profit—
Who would steal a moment’s leisure to seek this place?

---

**For Master Zhao**

Dwelling in seclusion at Clear Stream’s mouth,
A low couch, a thin mat—ever wakeful.
To refine a single grain of elixir in the Mystic Palace,
One must rely on the crucible’s fire, three thousand strong.

---

**Feng Zhongxiang Asks About Cultivation**

Do not cling to forms or grasp at texts,
Nor wander side-paths or crooked trails in search.
To know the valley of spirit and qi in emptiness—
Drawing being from non-being is true cultivation.

**II**
Sitting in dead ash, the body labors in vain,
Blind refinement, blind practice—mind needlessly taxed.
One must know where the medicine’s essence originates,
Restoring brightness, nurturing the fire to perfection.

---

**Further Question on Heavenly Light**

Acting or non-acting—both miss the mark,
Holding fast, contemplating—all prove false.
The lead crucible, mercury cauldron—mechanism truly wrought,
Essence congeals, spirit coagulates, inner radiance shines.

**II**
Dragon contends with soul, tiger with spirit,
Crow battles primordial essence, hare battles spirit.
Empty earth, non-action—harmony complete—
Silently containing light, silently merging with heaven’s truth.

---

**Lü Hezhi Asks About Cultivation**

To begin cultivation, one must die to the yin,
If the yin stalk does not die, myriad entanglements assail.
Not knowing the true message within—
Firmly seize, firmly grasp, lest it slip away.

---

**On the Golden Elixir**

The Golden Elixir is drawn from non-being,
Yet do not cling to emptiness alone.
Emptiness is true emptiness—emptiness fully realized,
The empty body, the embodied—all perfectly fused.

**Further Question on the Elixir Method**

Stillness is water’s essence, wisdom is fire,
The heart is true mercury, the body is lead.
With effort, even a moment can congeal—
Ten months to gestate the embryo, to become an immortal above.

---

**For Master Qiao’s Request of a Banner for Wandering Souls**

Yellow clouds flutter, borne on a staff’s tip,
Guiding lost souls to the azure heavens.
Since the Jade Sound’s teaching ceased,
The gates of darkness scatter karma, drifting on the wind.

---

**For Prefect Yang of the Leather Bureau**

Skillfully splitting stubborn hide with a sharp blade,
Lest it rise and gather dust.
Wrought into a body of true purity, ice and frost—
Never cut from the same cloth as the rank and foul.

---

**For Abbot Wang’s Farewell, Requesting a Verse**

Coming in the ninth summer, pomegranates burst in flame,
Departing after the third autumn, chrysanthemums defy the frost.
A heart at leisure beyond mist and water—
All silently guard the true constant.

---

**First Night of the New Year**

The Dragon Mountain’s lanterns burn like golden lotuses,
Nine streets’ towers resound with pipes and strings.
A thousand scattered pearls dazzle the eye—
Adorned, the nightless world becomes a flask of heaven.

---

**On the Woodpecker**

A spirit-bird pecks within the wood,
Talons sharp, beak keen—swiftly it works.
Not for lack of sustenance to fill its belly,
But to rid the towering forest of its pests.

---

**Admonition on Studying the Qin**

Hastening in Dao-cultivation, cherishing every inch of time,
Strumming silk and paulownia—mind laboring in vain.
Within yourself, the stringless melody is already complete—
Why seek sound only upon the fingers?

---

**Admonition on Go**

A move in hand-talk stirs idle thoughts,
Observing the board, life’s mechanism—black and white contend.
If black and white know there is no duality,
On the path of life and death, no need for alarm.

---

**Liu Xian Asks: A Hair’s Difference Prevents Elixir Formation**

Ten months total three myriad moments,
In standing, walking, sitting—maintain unbroken continuity.
A moment’s effort equals a year’s waiting,
Seizing three myriad years within heaven’s span.

**II**
In each of the three marvels, moment by moment—no other way,
Within three myriad moments, harmony is key.
A single moment’s deviation drains the medicine’s essence—
By what means then can the Golden Elixir congeal?

---

**Xu Xian Asks About the Method of Cultivation**

Water and fire balanced, neither dry nor overflowing,
Mercury and lead refined, entering the Elixir Terrace.
With each day, each season, gradually congealing—
Original substance, original form—gestating the sacred embryo.

**Further Question on Mystic Frost**

Gather the qi of the sun and moon’s two wheels,
Seize a speck of yang from heaven and earth.
Follow the season, return to the lead-mercury crucible,
Boil with water, refine with fire—condensing mystic frost.

---

**Li Daokuan Asks About Cultivation**

The body harbors true qi, the heart harbors essence,
Refining these two yields the numinous spirit.
If one invests full effort with threefold resolve,
Through a hundred thousand kalpas, clarity will dawn.

---

**On Subduing Lead and Mercury**

Lead and mercury, when fire is applied, can flee—
One must rely on nameless simplicity to anchor them.
Lead enters the Kun Palace, mercury enters Qian,
Water and fire harmonized—the elixir bears no fault.

---

**Left Elder Asks: The Culmination**

Forget form to nurture qi—qi is the root,
Forget qi to nurture spirit—spirit nurtures the true.
Even spirit must be forgotten—emptiness then nurtured,
Nurturing emptiness to merge with the Dao—this is the culmination.

---

**Reminder: In Dao, Do Not Cling to Emptiness**

The Dao is not far, yet people distance themselves from it,
People who embody the Dao—the Dao seeks them.
Know that the heart’s attainment has no empty use—
Emptiness itself is not empty—emptiness is the true.

**II**
Busily disentangle from webs of doubt,
Thought by thought, open the gates of myriad wonders.
Seeing through delusive conditions, free of clinging forms—
The heart’s mirror shines, never dimmed.

**III**
The six dusts’ shadows are not the heart’s forms,
Extinguishing brightness to seek emptiness is still external.
To know the true Dharma-body of non-emptiness,
First one must clearly realize the One True Heart.

---

**Li Miaozhen Asks About Emptiness and Oneness**

Before and after awakening—both are not true,
In the very moment of dissolution, the body pervades fusion.
Silent, thought-free—the heart abides rightly,
Suddenly vast, as if dwelling in the great void.

---

**Admonition to the Assembly: On Dreams**

A dream within a dream—double illusion,
A shadow beyond a shadow—triple delusion.
Turning and following conditions, illusions arise,
Conditioned mind ever obscures the true heart.

**II**
All conditioned things are like dreams and phantoms,
How many karmic thoughts are resentful demons?
The conditioned’s essence is not truly real—
In the very moment, if not extinguished—what can you do?

**III**
Dreams are empty forms, the body is a dream,
Thought by thought contending with emptiness—dreams are the same.
Dream and waking share one self,
Yet there is no self—this self is empty emptiness.

---

**On Transcending Creation**

Amidst the swirling transformations, wholly transcended,
Vast and solitary—only standing alone.
Spirit’s illumination, strict discipline—never forgetting,
Abiding in the One True—without deviation.

**On the Sun and Moon’s Lofty Ascent**

Sun and moon soar high—wondrous workings of the mechanism,
Golden crow’s crimson glow crosses the deep pool.
Steadfast, lodge in the osmanthus of the Moon Palace,
Gradually refined into skin white as snow.

**Continuing the Subtle Inquiry on Halting Thoughts**

When thoughts arise, swiftly awaken and halt them at once—
Let not thoughts arise while awareness lags behind.
If awareness is swift and cessation is swift,
The wondrous Dao appears before you—realization is near.

**Amidst Snow**

Halfway up the mountain, the goat-path winds and coils,
Forests and peaks block the snow’s biting cold.
Leaning on the railing, gazing from on high,
Suddenly one feels the vastness of heaven and earth in a single gourd.

**Leisure at West Creek**

Beyond the gate, the creek’s sound washes jade-cold,
Piercing the heart’s ground—serene and at ease.
Awakened from the dream of *Huaxu*—no affairs remain,
A bowl of pine tea, a stove of sandalwood.

**Seven-Character Regulated Verse: The Grass Pavilion of Eternal Truth**

A Daoist hermit builds a grass pavilion in the secluded abode,
Earth harmonizes with thatched windows—frugal in construction.
The lingering bright moon adds to idle delight,
The beckoning clear wind quickens rustic passions.
Auspicious mists conceal the three paths—pristine and pure,
Sunlit haze dips low, brightening the curtain’s sheen.
At times, gibbons and cranes come to visit,
As if speaking of lofty halls—not necessarily clear.

**To the Recluse of West Mountain**

The recluse’s nature loathes the snail-shell fame,
Chronic illness and misty peaks quicken rustic joys.
Acorns and sesame suffice for daily sustenance,
The alchemical furnace and scriptures bring delight to life.
At dawn, he gazes at the mountain market’s sunlit haze,
At night, he listens to the pines’ gibbons crying to the moon.
All affairs, when seen to their end, are nothing at all—
Only the One True Dharma Realm stands solitary and towering.

**Not Many**

One nature, pure and empty—six qi in harmony,
Wind and waves still—no churning in the Chan river.
His livelihood hoards the yellow sprout in abundance,
His living spares the white snow in plenty.
In the field of purity, he willingly turns and turns,
On the realm of luminosity, he alone spreads his net.
Now his kin are the body of emptiness,
A single effort—this is all that is needed.

**Again**

The flavor of the Dao flows on, effortless in use,
Vastly opening the profound measure—free from worldly clamor.
Two wheels of light shine bright on the nine heavens,
Three isles’ winds return—four seas’ tides.
Six delusions born of emotion all shatter like tiles,
Four conditioned karmic laws melt like ice.
The heart empty, unattached—like the empty realm,
One nature, crystalline—transcending ten thousand ages.

**Concluding *Stimulating the True*, First Volume of Spring**

**To the Tune of "Courtyard Full of Fragrance"**

A mind at leisure—one lone cloud,
Drifting free, untethered from all ties.
In the nine-heavens’ pool, a surging sacred spring,
Watering the yellow sprout, the auspicious herb,
Breathing purity, its light veiling golden lotus.
True tidings—cool winds sweep the earth,
Piercing to the bone, ceaseless and soft.

Merged into the true form,
Lofty, standing alone,
Laughing, transcending the Chan heavens.
Let yin and yang shift and turn,
The power of kalpas cannot scorch.
Eternally enduring, unbroken,
Drawing the true One—
The dharma-realm rests serene.
No birth, no death,
The wondrous body of pure luminosity,
A thousand miles—one moonlit grace.

**Second Verse: To Magistrate Hou Botong, Master of Calculation**

Heaven-endowed with many talents,
Master of all arts, measuring heaven and earth’s heights and depths.
Counting the sun and moon’s cycles,
Discerning gain and loss with precision.
Mountains and valleys—he knows their vastness,
Seas and rivers—their depths he fathoms.
Within the four directions,
Every being, every thing,
He perceives down to the finest hair.

Expanding the path of the square-inch heart,
Seeking the true essence,
Nine nines as his compass.
Fixing the elixir field’s subtle shifts,
Moving above and below.
When the sum of three thousand is complete,
Through division, eight hundred merits align.
The wondrous One Vehicle—
[...] grasped,
The ultimate truth leaves nothing behind.

**Third Verse: Admonishing the Negligent Daoist**

Idly adjusting cap and robe,
Falsely claiming purity,
Letting the inferior horse and mad monkey run wild.
Amid the thicket of fame and profit,
Vainly parading causes and conditions.
Day by day, chasing waves, following currents,
Never once stilling the limpid spiritual source.
Pitiful! Such idle posturing,
Betraying the longing for the profound mystery.

Search your heart—
Fear not the empty passage of days and months,
Snow weighing down your temples.
Best to rein in emotions, gather thoughts,
Plant wisdom in the heart’s field.
Recognize the primal, numinous awareness,
Ever till the Dao, ceaselessly hunt virtue.
After three years of effort,
Form and spirit both perfected,
Freely attaining the soaring crane’s ease.

---

**To the Tune of "Water Melody"**

Men speak of the joy of no-birth,
Days and months harmonize in accord.
Soaring high, the crow’s flight reveals,
Beyond separation, dwelling in the sacred bough.
Auspicious omens swell—elixir pearls,
Light gleams on the silver toad’s purity,
Revealing the moon’s fair maiden.
Gathered at the Jasper Pool’s feast,
Again and again, drunk on golden waves.

Two in harmony,
Seven returns of fire,
Ninefold gold refined.
The immortal body complete,
One truth abides—defiant of all.
Gathering and scattering, who binds them in darkness?
Coming and going, I alone am awake—
The mystery is not so vast.
In the square inch of the heart,
The dharma-realm is wholly embraced.

---

**To the Tune of "The Great River Flows East"**

Life’s greatest treasure—
Endowed with the five agents’ true qi,
A thousand spirits’ ancient gift.
Head and feet round and square, mirroring heaven and earth,
Yet molded by yin and yang’s kiln.
Autumn moon, spring blossoms,
Yesterday, today—
All vanish with the rosy face.
The road ahead treacherous,
When the time comes, hands and feet helpless.

Count it well—
Cast off this body,
Fine robes, high rank—
All but idle trinkets.
Best to shatter the heart within,
In stillness harmonize dragon and tiger.
Conceive the numinous treasure,
Heaven’s light bursting forth,
Transforming into a vault of luminous pearls.
Externally merging with the empty realm,
Towering, freely striding on rosy clouds.

**Second Verse**

Jingshan’s fine jade,
Forged by the craftsman into a vessel,
Its form discerned by heaven and earth.
Two apertures open, dividing sun and moon,
Eight trigrams, nine palaces—all unfurl.
The square-inch heart holds the pivot,
Revolving the true essentials,
Wood and metal in tender embrace.
The reclusive man finds delight,
Turning the Qian trigram’s wheel.

Gently inverting the primal essence,
Relying only on what lies before the eyes,
In darkness, thunder and lightning arise.
A thousand coils, a hundred circuits—
Following the old path,
Silver threads weave in meandering flight.
Fragrant dust, rich aroma,
Filling the belly with savor,
The pure body now revealed.
Light flies like snow—
This time, the true face is known.

**Third Verse**

The initial work—chaos,
In the mechanism’s turning,
The qi of Kan’s center.
Stealthily rising, misty vapors emerge from the earth,
Ascending, transforming into auspicious clouds.
Lightning flashes, thunder roars,
Yin and yang unite,
Bringing forth a curtain of fine rain.
Flying over the imperial river,
It becomes the divine water of the jade crucible.

Flowing, nine transformations birth gold,
Refined within Li’s chamber,
Transmuted into the yang body.
Spirit transforms, leaving form behind,
Wielding wondrous power—
Alone commanding heaven’s canopy, earth’s mat.
Steadfast, soaring,
Adapting to every circumstance,
Unfettered, at ease.
Embracing fusion as one,
Suddenly transcending birth and death.

**Fourth Verse**

The Heavenly Origin Teaching manifests,
Golden lotuses bloom in season.
Scholars, commoners, officials—all revere,
The pratyekabuddhas and śrāvakas expound.
Those who awaken find coolness,
Those who turn away suffer heat—
Many mouths proclaim the true formula.
All people, open your eyes—
Illuminating the ancient moon of the heart.

Knowing all forms are empty,
No deluded thoughts arise,
The very substance dissolves.
The realm is real, unstained,
All distinctions cut off.
Ten thousand realms—one mind,
Before you, solitary awakening,
Silent, perfectly bright, and clear.
Pure, untouchable,
The great void—one, undivided.

---

**To the Tune of "Water Dragon Chant"**

Careering through officialdom, heart greedy for rank,
When will official duties ever end?
Strength enough to shoot the sun,
Fame high as the clouds—
Yet what has it availed till now?
Cease talk of success in fame and merit.
Best to retire, swiftly seek return.
Feasting on the ancients’ lees,
At ease on the lake,
Sailing a small boat,
Delighting in true flavor.

Awakening to the carefree life of clouds and water,
Unfettered, at ease, without entanglement.
The sky’s vastness opens the chest,
Regulating spirit, nurturing qi,
No bonds, no ties.
Nature and life both in accord.
Revealing true form,
Merging past, present, and future.
Behold the self-strengthening hand—
Cutting iron, severing nails,
Abandoning worldly ties.

**Second Verse: To Li Yuanfa**

A ceaseless qi surges through joints and channels,
Steaming, flowing through a hundred vessels.
Gathered in the Qian crucible,
Dragon and tiger take form,
Nature and emotion entwined.
Essence transforms, soaring high.
Seven returns of effort,
Nine refinements complete.
The great elixir refined,
Spirit’s power revealed,
Fragrance and savor
Permeating the body.
Radiant, the cinnabar light gleams,
Illuminating the spirit terrace—
A single speck, bright as snow.

Ever pure, ever pristine,
No excess, no lack—
Perfect clarity, radiant and translucent.
The true heart-moon emerges,
Shining through the cosmos,
Utterly free of dust or speck.
Lofty as the vast emptiness,
Its wondrous, birthless power
Stands firm through ten thousand kalpas.

**Third Verse: To Yang Daokuan**

Renowned for mastery in the three mysteries,
His brush captures the ancient forms of the Mysterious Origin.
With gold he traces on silk,
Majestic and sublime,
Revealing the original true visage.
Adorning the sacred hall with offerings,
He subdues all directions—
Terrifying the hearts of demons.
The teachings he expounds,
A true wind, rich and profound,
Moves all people to turn and follow.
Outwardly, his demeanor commands reverence;
Inwardly, he must discern—
All things depart from the heart.
This subtle function,
Non-doing, non-acting,
Yet within the formless, a form appears.
Responding to change without hindrance,
Embracing the ten directions,
His profound capacity unfolds.
In accord with the vast void’s single point,
A living path of emptiness,
His spiritual powers flourish.

**Fourth Verse: The Idler’s Joy**

The idler savors the taste of zither and books,
While the wandering peddler hawks his medicinal charms.
Suddenly, he sees through
The folly of seeking fame,
Wasting true purpose.
A burden before the withered tree,
He must cast off all inferior ties,
Discarding every entanglement.
The moon of nature, unveiled,
Shines unwavering, ever bright.
Forgetting spirit and qi,
He nurtures the empty body.
Refining true wisdom, not void,
Toward the vast emptiness,
He becomes a vessel of divine wonder.
In purity and clarity,
Boundless and expansive,
Not a speck of dust obscures.
Perfect enlightenment fuses the three times,
Adorned in full majesty—
The Dharma-body, pure and complete.
Manifesting thusness, luminous and clear,
Abiding in true constancy,
Thoroughly realizing the birthless principle.

**Voice Slow**

At the humble gate, nurturing vastness,
Hiding jade’s brilliance,
He guards simplicity, forgetting schemes.
His hands hold heaven and earth,
His body sustains the myriad transformations.
Qi churns daily in the three fields,
Turning a single channel,
Flowing ceaselessly.
Through the hundred bones,
Nectar quenches thirst,
Jade liquid sates hunger.
Bathing the wondrous body of the primordial spirit,
In perfect accord,
All movement and stillness shine.
Neither submerged nor born,
The empty realm’s form is flawless.
Standing alone, alert and clear,
Defiant of emptiness,
In the actuality of non-doing.
Delighting in true essence,
His virtue’s wind spreads afar,
The banner of the Dao raised high.

**Second Verse**

The mysterious pass stands vigil,
Embracing the One, never parting,
Knowing the white, guarding the black, concealing the mechanism.
Fire’s movement, a pure breeze,
Lightly blows through the three passes, crossing the sea.
Transformed fluid descends, forming the four images,
Becoming true mercury,
Gently immersed in the flowery pond.
After nine revolutions,
The golden body is achieved,
The spirit chamber radiant.
The perfect, luminous true form appears,
Unified in the human realm,
Heaven and earth’s myriad transformations wondrous.
Neither existing nor void,
Unstained by defilement,
Flawless.
Alone, he wields the illumination of emptiness and stillness,
Knowing fundamentally
No thing binds him.
The true emptiness’s function,
Manifests the sharpness of the returning blade,
The wisdom-sword raised high.

**Third Verse: To Wang Yanbao**

Shedding self and others,
Cold as ice, beyond high and low,
He awakens—today is yesterday’s error.
Examining the numinous essence,
In vain he endured ten thousand kalpas of delusion.
Now, encountering the great unfolding of the true wind,
He is chosen among immortals,
His name inscribed in the celestial academy.
With single-minded resolve,
He dares to cast off flesh and blood,
Discarding the light and the fat.
Seeking the wondrous joy of mist and clouds,
He quiets all entanglements,
Falling delusions, no more acting.
Guarding the One True,
With penetrating illumination, he upholds strict discipline.
Resting in the wondrous body of primordial emptiness,
The spirit-light accompanies him,
Entering and exiting as he pleases.
Ahead, the path is clear—
Surely he will ascend the shore of awakening,
Steadily climbing the immortal’s ladder.

**Ascending the Cinnabar Sky**

True Yang arises,
Returning to the Gui earth,
Qi deeply settled.
Within the recumbent moon’s heart,
Yin and Yang are born.
Dragon and tiger transform,
Timely mating, no need to seize.
Together they form the three bodies,
The yellow sprout grows long,
Fragrance fills the Qian crucible.
Listen—
The cauldron speaks.
Nature like a pearl,
Heart like the moon,
Breast like jade,
Body like gold.
Manifesting the nine Yangs,
Utterly extinguishing the faintest Yin.
The original true form,
Responding to conditions, hidden or revealed,
Ghosts and spirits revere.
Equal to the vast emptiness,
Flawless, dustless,
Striding across antiquity, soaring through the present.

**A Sprig of Flowers**

A jade pot, a golden world,
Sun and moon share their radiance.
The immortal lad’s livelihood,
Enamored of the wind’s grace.
Seeking medicine at the river’s source,
Daily he gathers in the southwest.
Returning to the azure sea,
First condensing golden essence,
Nine transformations restore the origin—unbroken.
Permeating the body, fragrant mists arise,
Bursting forth in great luminosity.
The pure body of longevity appears,
Defiant beyond the world.
One may depart the realm of sound,
Ever alert—
Movement and stillness never obscured.
A single body contains all,
Embracing past and present,
Gathering and dispersing without attachment or hindrance.

**Plucking the Plum Blossom: To Elder Zhang, a Good Friend**

Spring departs, autumn arrives, frosting the temples.
Days pass, months follow,
Consuming the rosy complexion.
Lead wanes, mercury dwindles, the sea’s source dries.
The jade nectar exhausted,
The golden orchid withers.
Nurture well the three origins, seal the five passes.
Soaring high with sun and moon,
Light shines upon Mount Ao.
Condensing the round treasure, cold as frost.
Before the eyes, thusness—
Beyond things, at ease.

**Fragrant Journey: Li, the Assembly Leader, Asks About the Dao**

The Great Dao is formless,
Forcibly given a name.
Dividing the five qi,
It fuses and embraces creation.
Pervading the six directions,
It encompasses all beings.
Fundamentally without emotion,
Without scent,
Without sound.
Through human awakening and diligent practice,
Transformation is birthless.
One must still the heart,
Profoundly, darkly.
Neither void nor existing,
The wondrous body moves freely.
This true constancy,
Soaring through past and present,
Alone, ever alert.

**Second Verse**

Diligently seeking the wondrous Dao,
Finding joy in forgetting cares.
Let go of the snail’s fame,
The fly’s profit—rest the heart.
The six senses cease their opposition,
A single qi, soft and focused.
Fire does not wane,
Water does not lack,
Harmoniously replenishing.
The hundred vessels flow,
Circulating through the four seas.
Gradually, cinnabar congeals,
Pure light floats.
The wondrous body of emptiness,
Unobstructed, unconfined.
Responding without fixed direction,
Illuminating all things,
Manifesting in every head.

**Third Verse: Asking About the Gate of Cultivation**

The Dao’s body is level,
Yet the blind cannot walk it.
Seeking its edges,
Clinging to dharma, refining skill.
Wandering strange paths,
They obscure the way ahead.
I urge all people—
Raise your eyes,
Recognize the birthless.

Deeply still, profoundly clear,
Brewing wakeful clarity.
Unlocking heaven’s gate,
Earth’s door firmly sealed.
Yang ascends the hidden path,
Soaring past the divine capital.
Passing layered towers,
Returning to empty earth,
Cinnabar congeals, perfected.

**Fourth Verse: Mistaking the Aggregates of Suffering**

Mistaking the aggregates of suffering,
They clog the heart’s chamber.
Chasing conditions,
Discriminating in haste.
Better to gather the ten thousand realms
Within the palace of the mind.
Dissolve deluded traces,
Know all forms—
Embody emptiness.
Illuminating the empty source,
True emptiness in action.
Revealing the mind’s dharma,
Movement and stillness—bright emptiness.
At Kunlun’s summit,
Leaping through the void.
This very emptiness—
Untouchable,
All-pervading, harmonious.

**Lyrics to *Jiang Shen Zi Ling***

Metal conceals wood’s nature, wood conceals metal.
The body eludes search,
Fire arises in the crucible.
Two substances refined,
Geng and Jia determine rise and fall.
Returning to the root, restoring the origin,
The true body appears.
Soul and spirit gather,
Pure, without shadow.

The message of the nine yangs arrives of itself.
Ears hum with zither tones,
Conveying pure sound.
Calling forth the numinous,
Surpassing ancient and modern.
Every realm, every void—
Nothing is not manifest,
Lucidly,
The dharma of this true heart.

**Second Verse: A Recluse of West Mountain Visits**

By karmic affinity, we meet—
Like a mustard seed piercing a needle.
Speaking of the true heart,
Dissolving the three yins.
Yang naturally ferments,
Jade nectar poured without cease.
Companions in drink,
The clinking of jade rings in the ear,
A stringless melody—
Echoing the zither of the wind.

Mysterious vapors stir the breast.
Ninefold gold,
Even ghosts and spirits revere.
One with heaven’s light,
Transformations—elusive to trace.
Empty as emptiness,
Yet wondrous being arises.
The heart radiant,
Thoughts submerged.

**Third Verse: A River’s Nine Bends—Dragons and Tigers Rush**

A river’s nine bends—
Dragons and tigers surge.
Intent fierce,
Qi harmonious.
Winding around Kunlun,
Thunder shakes heaven and earth.
Spouting golden sands,
Light blazing,
Merging with the void.

The dharma-body, ethereal and vast,
Transforming endlessly,
No trace of form.
Ever responsive, ever still,
The dharma-realm reveals perfect interpenetration.
Encompassing all in one mind,
Form and emptiness blend.
No discrimination,
Accord with the true wind.

**Fourth Verse: Once Indulging Cleverness, the Body Decays**

Once indulging cleverness,
The body decays.
Seeking the mystery,
Guarding humility.
Heaven endures, earth abides,
Yet the will wavers, hesitant.
The dharma weak, the horse unruly,
No bridle to restrain—
A storm of wind and flowers,
Rampant, unrestrained.

Familiar realms traversed,
The heart at ease.
Admiring terraces and pools,
Galloping in light carriages.
Scattering harmonious qi,
The immortal’s path—
Separated by clouds and mud.
Once more, extend the hands that sustain heaven and earth,
Grasp the true,
Eternally numinous.

**Fifth Verse: Admiring Chrysanthemums**

Mountains cold, leaves of trees
Tinged with pale yellow.
Autumn’s breath seals,
Dew congeals to frost.
All things return to their roots,
Yin qi ushers desolation.
Only the eastern fence’s yellow chrysanthemums bloom,
Spraying icy splendor,
Exhaling pure fragrance.

Distinctly round,
Manifesting the Double Ninth.
Born at the center,
Radiating golden light.
Fully revealing thusness,
Divinely wondrous, exuberant.
Face to face, in an instant,
All is recognized.
The moon of the heart shines,
Awareness forgets form.

**Sixth Verse: To Attendant Li the Younger**

Worldly affections cling like glue,
Dao-affection estranged.
The numinous terrace dimmed,
Veiled in dust.
Unfearing as mountains,
Yet the body flees, defeated.
The present precious form—
Unawakened,
Through countless kalpas,
A rotting, weary vessel.

Better to gather lead,
Secure at Wudu’s steps.
Plant the medicinal sprout,
Congeal the spirit-embryo.
Ninefold refinement complete,
The lotus of the square inch blooms.
The body merges with pure light,
Hidden or manifest—
Following the eye’s gaze,
It is Penglai.

**Lyrics to *Jiang Mei Yin*: To Li Yuanfa**

Unmoved by honor or disgrace,
Utterly without care.
Passing spring and autumn,
Attaining ease.
Shattering all entanglements,
Nothing clings to the heart.
Within heaven, one heaven—
A living practice.
Taming dragons and tigers,
Freely circling,
The Dipper never rests.

Purple-golden frost congeals—
There is a reason.
Three cycles complete,
Jade lads gather.
The dharma-realm, clear heaven,
Wind and moon alone respond.
The wondrous vessel perfected,
Worthy of selection.
Toward the immortal’s court,
Seizing the banner,
First in the tally.

**Second Verse: To Assembly Head Liu**

Grain for food, silk for clothing—
Greedily sought.
Furrowing the brow,
Scouring for profit and fame.
Fiercely clinging to clay,
Molding vessels, flaunting elegance.
Vainly reaching the treasure mountain,
Yet returning empty-handed.
Only bound to this wheel of rebirth,
Unwilling to cease.

Better to turn the light inward,
Cultivate this body.
Rein in the horse and monkey,
Retain mercury and lead.
The fiery crucible,
Timely stoked and drawn.
Refine the one true,
Round and luminous treasure.
Shining through the cosmos,
Flawlessly radiant,
Its price beyond recompense.

**Lyrics to *Mu Lan Hua Ling***

Within the two strings,
The true creation is concealed.
Yin and yang reverse,
Kan and Li inverted.
The Dipper’s qi drives into the furnace-dragon.
Refining by the hour,
The medicinal forest unspent.
Exotic fragrance wafts,
Wind-borne, ethereal.
Golden flowers bloom,
Congealing into the round treasure.
Pure and luminous,
Not carelessly formed.
Like the void itself,
Great light fuses and illumines.

**Lyrics to *Ta Suo Xing***

Still and indifferent, forgetting schemes,
Serenely nurturing simplicity.
A hint of wonder—
Others scarcely discern.
Darkly, dimly,
The spirit-pearl is cleansed.
Drowsily, silently,
The moon of the heart unfolds.

Clouds of ten thousand kalpas disperse,
One sky, bright and clear.
The mouth pure, the body bright,
Like ice and snow.
Neither increasing nor decreasing,
Manifesting perfect completion.
Wakeful, untrammeled,
Without birth or extinction.

**Second Verse**

Movement and stillness—
Forgetting schemes.
Cleverness does not arise.
Awakened, all worldly passions are pared away.
The lamp of the heart,
Trimmed, never dim.
Wisdom-light pervades,
Vast and boundless.

Ever pure, ever clear,
Neither attached nor indulgent.
Upon the realm of the one true,
Freely abiding.
Neither ox nor image,
Nor person—
Standing alone,
Spreading true joy.

**Third Verse**

A single branch of *ling* wood,
Slender as a crane’s scripture.
Flesh light, body red—
The reclusive one praises it.
In walking, standing, sitting, lying,
Never apart.
Piercing clouds, crossing waters,
Ever constant.

Dispelling the deluded ford,
Guiding back from crooked paths.
Aiding peril, assisting danger,
Communing with the divine.
Timely stirring,
Tiger and dragon contend.
The tip lifts sun and moon,
Heaven and earth gleam.

**Lyrics to *Nan Ke Zi***

The body—empty as void, pure.
The heart—tranquil as Mount Hua.
Myriad conditions, false thoughts—
No interference.
Abiding in non-thought,
Everywhere at ease.

**The Pearl of Awakened Sea**

The pearl of the awakened sea gleams bright,
The moon of Chan’s sky chills the night.
Perfect clarity—no need to polish tenfold—
Let go, draw near,
A single point expands earth and heaven wide.

**Second Verse: To Those Who Turn from the Dao**

Long still, yet thoughts stir anew,
Sweetly lost in the sea of desire’s snare.
Immortal and mortal paths diverge like cloud and mud.
From this moment parted,
No glance back at heaven’s ladder.

Do not learn the wren’s ambition,
Endlessly clinging to a slender branch.
Like the leviathan of the northern sea, may your will take flight.
In a span, become the roc,
Poised to soar o’er heaven’s pool.

**Third Verse: Zhang Daoyi Asks of the Yellow Sprout**

Yang stirs, yin follows in change,
The yellow sprout humbly grows tall.
Five uneven leaves unfurl in the Yellow Court,
The pearl-bud blooms,
Unleashing purple-golden radiance.

First the elixir’s grain is formed,
Pure light fills the vast cosmos.
Gracefully, it pierces the body with rosy dawn’s glow.
Within and without, luminous,
The dharmadhātu stirs in clarity.

**Fourth Verse**

In sitting, lying—ever serene,
Breath flows slow and unbroken.
Warm, the nine qi rise in the eastern lead crucible.
The body’s field seethes,
Day and night sipping nectar’s wine.

Three elixirs dwell within the belly,
Not a thing lingers in the heart.
Nurtured, the sturdy form merges with emptiness.
In arising and vanishing, ever wakeful,
The true form reveals its primordial face.

**Song of the Golden Goblet**

The heart at ease,
Delighting in forests and springs.
Incense of sandalwood, the clay censer’s dragon-scented warmth.
Cold cups stir joy,
Steaming tea’s mist.

Emotions profound,
A belly full and content.
Companions—leaping deer,
Crying apes.
Pure, the spirit’s source,
Fire-born lotus.

Cool clarity shines, dispelling all dust.
The five eyes see bright,
Attaining the profound mystery.
Crimson gleams the sea,
Moon sinks in the deep.
Perfect clarity’s form,
Boundless in response.

**Lyrics to *Jie Pei Ling*: Lament for the Moth**

The moth’s inborn nature,
Lost in bitter realms.
Ever chasing the candle’s flower-shadow,
It hurls itself to death,
Scorched and seared—yet still unaware.
All amiss, mistaking
The firefly’s fleeting glow for chill beauty.

Drawn to brightness with intent,
Longing for the dark’s embrace.
Alas, no merit in enduring hunger’s brief pang.
Once the fiery light is seen through,
No more self-immolation—
Form and life both fade.
Alone, it finds delight
In the cool, clear realm.

**Cultivating the Pure Heart**

A heart serene nurtures vastness—
star-dust stirs not.
Near woods and springs,
no wheel nor hoof intrudes.
A life of quiet ease,
with moss encircling the gate,
a courtyard swept by winds of fallen blossoms.

Cranes cry in the cold dew,
apes wail beneath the bright moon.
Each day they keep me company—
pine flowers, jade-like herbs.
I savor effortless being,
never seeking beyond this form.
Awakened to the pearl within my robe,
here is Penglai before my eyes.

**To the Tune *Lang Tao Sha*: Let Go of Forms—All Is Empty**

Vainly clinging to hollow emptiness,
mired in stubborn void.
Toiling in vain, blind to the emptiness within.
Within emptiness, the wondrous body blends,
for emptiness is not empty.
This truth is true emptiness—
in every thing, emptiness shines.
Thoughts arise, yet none contend with emptiness.
Only when green emptiness reveals itself as deep wisdom
is perfect emptiness fulfilled.

**To the Tune *Wan Nian Chun*: Listening Within**

Silent, I hear within my body
fire-dragon and water-tiger vie in roars.
Truly wondrous!
Waves crash loud,
coiling ‘neath the canopy of heaven’s light.
Frost-gold refines,
the crucible forges true creation.
A treasure gleams—
earth radiant, sky pristine,
a body unstirred by dust.

**II**
A life at ease,
each day ruled by wind and moon.
No cares weigh the heart.
Still, I listen to the apes’ cries,
as if recounting the discourse of no-birth.
Utter cool clarity—
not a speck of dust in sight.
Great luminosity,
within and without resplendent,
as if dwelling in the realm of empty space.

**III**
**Mid-Autumn**

An autumn night’s silver toad,
a sky of ten thousand leagues, light as washed.
A gentle breeze,
brushing the cosmos clean,
crystalline, without the slightest veil.
Starlight dims,
revealing the fullness of perfect clarity.
Beneath the white canopy,
my spirit soars,
climbing the green cassia in person.

**To the Tune *Wu Ling Chun*: A Warning to the Dharma-Enforcer**

Words may lead one to grasp truth,
but truth demands forgetting words.
Once the fish is caught, cast the trap aside—
clinging to the trap invites the lash.
Seal lips, still the tongue, make no explanations,
silently delve the profound mystery.
Refine qi, cultivate the heart, sever false ties—
a cold moon illumines the azure sky.

**II**
**Wang Xiaoxian Asks About Chan**

The Dharma-realm’s true heart abides in stillness,
in its very presence, all ties dissolve.
Within and without, luminous body manifests—
no earth, no heaven.
Grasping at Chan’s form, Chan drifts farther,
Chan’s nature like the moon sinking in the deep.
In motion or stillness, ever serene,
the spirit’s function is true Chan.

**To the Tune *Nan Xiang Zi*: Seven Returns to Subdue True Yin**

True Yin submits to sevenfold return,
guest and host reverse—strength fails.
Beyond the three realms, the wondrous soars,
suddenly arriving,
piercing earth and sky, radiant through ages.

In this very body, thoughts sink deep.
A crane-borne heart rides the pure wind.
From north or south, no hindrance—
at will, I drink,
true joy, true delight, free to chant and roar.

**Gazing Toward Penglai**

**The Cultivator of Truth**

Cultivator of truth, hold fast to yielding will—yet firm must be your resolve.
The golden crucible, ever filled, preserves the elixir of life;
the jade furnace, oft kindled, burns the incense of cavernous truth.
Mind and realm alike—all is cool and clear.

Profound mystery!
Alone you reign as sovereign of the Dharma.
All specters and demons turn to ash,
the three yangs and nine qi marshal strength as warriors.
Wherever you tread, radiance shines resplendent.

---

**The Worldly Wanderer**

Worldly wanderer, thought by thought, enslaved by greed and gluttony.
Like gibbons leaping from cliffs, the heart indulges in fleeting joy;
like a frail steed battling the wind, the mind labors in vain.
Familiar realms—relentless torment.

Clinging to bitterness as if sweet,
the heart’s affairs teem like tangled hair.
How much better to smash the tumult of passions,
to till the Dao in joyous ease!
Can the path of birth and death then be escaped?

---

**To the Tune *Cai Sang Zi***

The wondrous Dao of emptiness—guard it with steadfast heart.
Emptiness itself surrenders to your embrace,
coalescing into the embryo.
Within the formless, sun and moon are planted.

Moment by moment, drink the wine of Kunlun’s peak,
drunk, recline upon the cinnabar terrace.
Command the Three Terraces to submit—
in a single flash, the clouds of ten thousand kalpas part.

---

**To the Tune *Xi Jiang Yue***

A single yang stirs in the palace of Kan,
twin arcs of wind rise, storming the heavens.

**The Three Passes transform, droplets cascade in streams,**
the Four Symbols’ true cinnabar begins its transmutation.
Five-hued radiance arises in the crucible’s glow,
the Six Spirits harmonize in ceaseless flow.

The Seven Stars govern use, all ends in peace,
the Eight Directions reveal a body luminous and clear.

---

**To the Tune *Jian Zi Mu Lan Hua***

Strife of insects—nothing true;
see through it, and the heart’s visage is cast off like sandals.
Chronic ills, clouds and mountains—
monkeys and cranes keep company, the day spent in leisure.

A pot of wind and moon,
pure and luminous, illumines all.
Within and without, both void—
where the empty heart touches, all is pervaded.

---

**Its Second**

Forgetting mechanism, seek the wondrous—
the myriad dharmas are empty, resolved in the heart.
No bounds, no edges—
a single expanse of clear light, a sky of ten thousand leagues.

Bright, immaculate body,
not a mote of dust, not a fly’s speck of obscuration.
Within and without, perfectly fused—
abiding rightly in the empty Dharma Realm.

---

**Long Thoughts of the Immortal**

Crucible of heaven and earth, refining yin and yang.
Yin transforms to pure yang, void and image as one.
The wondrous body fuses, boundless and free.

Wind bears me, I bear the wind—
wind and I bear each other in the Dharma Realm.
Formless, yet not empty.

---

**To the Tune *Ru Meng Ling***

The myriad dharmas on the heart’s tip—how trifling!
The crescent moon draws forth water and fire.
Refined and tempered, golden essence congeals,
advancing, it emerges as pearls of perfect clarity.

Attain fruition, attain fruition—
the undifferentiated void is myself.

---

*End of Scroll Two of the* **Stimulating the True Collection**
*(Originally, this lyric was mistakenly titled "The Staff of Ling Shou.")*
*Scroll Three of the* **Stimulating the True Collection**
*Composed by Liu Zhiyuan, Master of Penetrating the Mysterious, of Golden Peak Mountain*

**Chapter One: The True Heart**

Master Ziyang the Perfected One states: The true heart is the ancestral seat of nature on the left, the solar *hun*; the ancestral root of life on the right, the lunar *po*. At its center dwells the Valley Spirit, the imperial chamber of the body—indeed the pivotal crucible of returning cinnabar, the fundamental gateway to the Dao. Master Chunyang calls it the sea-turtle: the essential vessel for cultivating the true. Should one refine the true beyond this, there would be no cauldron, no return—like preparing food without a vessel, expending great effort yet reaping scant merit.

This heart is not the shadow of the six dusts, nor the fleshy mass of the physical heart. Though formless, when tapped, it responds—it is the abode of spirit and qi, the true heart beyond the heart. To recognize this heart is to perceive one’s nature.

Master Ziyang says: "The great heart must fail; the small heart must prevail"—know this to be so. If one can reverse the body to reside within the heart, abide in samādhi’s right reception, follow the sun and the hour, and guard spirit and intent with unwavering constancy, then in refinement, the numinous body congeals, supple and strong, transforming endlessly. Like a mirror, it responds yet remains still, illuminating all without bias, returning to oneness without a trace of stagnation.

In sitting and lying, walking and standing, speaking and silence, movement and stillness—be as stable as Mount Tai, as pure as empty space, vast and unconfined, perfectly rounded. No thing can touch it, no subtlety remains obscure: this is the realization of the true heart’s function. Those who fail to recognize this heart or perceive this nature engage in blind cultivation, sitting in vain like withered ashes, and even with hoary hair, they shall not succeed. How much worse for those who study yet do not encounter the Way, or encounter it yet do not practice, or practice yet lack diligence!

Some stubbornly claim they can attain the wondrous Dao without leaving their chambers—how utterly deluded!

---

**Chapter Two: Heaven Within Heaven**

Master Heshanggong states: "Mysterious yet again mysterious" refers to the heaven within heaven. This is not the chaotic fusion of spirit and qi, nor the illusory realm where sun and moon, the myriad forms, wind and rain, thunder and lightning appear—such visions arise from uncontrolled spirit and qi, following deluded thoughts. This is but a double layer of illusion.

Only this one heaven possesses above a gate of life and below a portal of death. It is the singular mysterious female within the body—not the heart, kidneys, or the valley passage, nor the bladder or the cinnabar field. It is the palace where sun and moon unite, the meeting ground of yin and yang, a vessel of emptiness rooted in spirit and qi.

It has no path, no boundaries; it is smaller than the smallest, yet vaster than the vast. Near, it encompasses the square inch; far, it embraces the eight wilds. When the ninefold work is accomplished here, the medicine is complete; when the three natures merge here, the elixir congeals. Here dwell the white snow and yellow sprouts, the divine water of the Flower Pool, where the embryo forms and the body is shed.

Here the nine palaces and eight trigrams gather, the four images and five phases converge, mercury and lead coalesce, and the heavenly stems and earthly branches revolve. Truly, this is the heaven of mysterious creation, eternal spring without night—the treasury of divine illumination, the realm of utmost emptiness and purity.

This heaven’s blessings are realized in an instant, as easily grasped as the palm of one’s hand. Yet it remains obscured by dense yin, veiled ever deeper. It cannot be opened through clever conjecture, nor forced by clinging to texts or images. Only through the heart’s dynamic practice, with the Dao’s power firm and robust, can one bear the weight of its transmission, expand true wisdom, and attain it.

As the Perfected One Danyang once said:
*"Grasping the three essentials, the numinous terrace remains pure,
Yet mist-locked and smoke-shrouded, it will not open.
Only when Chongyang’s teachings arrive again,
Does the clear wind blow forth the bright moon."*

Thus, one must receive it through heart-transmission to fully comprehend it; it cannot be grasped through minor knowledge. Without this, even if the elixir congeals and the embryo forms, attaining a body of long life and the six supernatural powers, it has never been achieved.

---

**Chapter Three: The True Earth**

Master Pingshu once wrote:
*"Tiger leaps, dragon coils—waves surge rough,
At the central field, the mysterious pearl is born."*
And again:
*"If li and kan lack wu and ji,
Though they contain the four images, the elixir will not form.
Only when true earth is embraced by both,
Do golden sands return."*

This clarifies that earth is the center of the five phases, the master of the three fires, governing the eight directions and rooting the nine qi—it is called the true empty earth. It is the great cauldron for planting medicine, the palace where the primordial treasure is born, gathering the light without shadow and receiving the fluids of the eight waters. It is the pure land of awakening, the realm of eternal brightness without night.

Above, it unites the sun and moon cauldron; below, it grasps the dragon and tiger furnace. It steals and refines the qi of heaven and earth, giving birth to the crystals of li and kan. Those who receive its dharma cannot fail to ascend as heavenly immortals.

Have you not seen the myriad commentaries stating that lead and mercury are sown in the earth, reaped morning and night? Yet if sown too shallowly, the seed floats and does not grow; if too deeply, it rots and does not sprout—how much worse if one fails to find the true earth! Like roots and sprouts, with earth they live, without it they perish: this is the eternal principle.

Know clearly that the yellow sprout grows, the jade bud blooms, and the true creation is cultivated—all depend on this earth. The true spirit and intent are one with it. Without gathering the three primal powers and the seven returns, the mechanism of the yang spirit cannot be achieved, and transformation cannot be completed. When spirit arrives here, qi responds; when qi arrives, spirit becomes numinous. With numinosity, form manifests, appearing without limit, responding to stillness as it arises—how great is the divine function of this earth!

As the Perfected One Changchun said:
*"If the inch of heart can be directly embodied,
One shall ascend to the Great Luo for all time."*
This clarifies the true earth’s function.

Those who abandon this in their practice are like lost travelers seeking home or those who mistake stones for valleys—how can they ever find life?

**Chapter Four: Heart and Breath Interdependent**

Having attained insight and resolute determination, one must untie bonds, release burdens, restrain anger, and still desire. Of utmost importance is the interdependence of heart and breath.

Breath is the method of nurturing life: it should be soft and continuous, fermenting the primordial qi, never allowing it to scatter with joy or anger. Always preserve it, warming and nourishing the primordial palace, gradually congealing its essence until it transforms into the cinnabar treasure.

Where the heart abides, the breath abides; where the breath moves, the heart moves. Using the heart as the method to gather thoughts, one should ever maintain clarity to protect the wondrous source of numinous awareness, never allowing that awareness to stir with delusive conditions. Thus shall the vast and luminous spirit be revealed, the essence ever bright and undimmed.

If one can employ both the heart and breath in tandem, what could surpass this? Surely neither can be lacking. Have you not heard: to awaken to the eternal yet fail to grasp destiny is the foremost malady in cultivation; to grasp destiny’s foundation yet remain deluded about the ancestral nature is like a mirror seeking its reflection without a precious glass?

Only when the body is free of affairs and qi does not scatter, when the heart is without contrivance and spirit is undisturbed—only then is it achieved. Yet to purify thoughts and regulate the heart, to nurture breath and sustain life, this is the interdependent method. Should one lose the central balance, it becomes the false view of contrivance; if no method is attained, no form embraced, this is the function of quiescence. Should one lose the central balance, it falls into the false sect of dull emptiness.

Thus, the method cannot be clung to, nor can it be discarded; it resides in the space between use and abandonment. One must awaken the universal eye, open true wisdom, embody yet not cling to form, and apply the four practices of acting, stopping, allowing, and ceasing without falling into the illness of attachment. In walking, standing, sitting, and lying, the four dignified postures must not follow delusive thoughts. Free from the grasping of discriminating emotions, the heart becomes like wind in empty space—without reliance or cessation, unstained and unattached. The heart empties itself, penetrating and illuminating the One Reality, suddenly unbounded and unimpeded.

This is the essence of the two wondrous methods, the timeless practice of all ages, the foundation for ascending to the One Vehicle.

**Chapter Five: Dying Yin to Generate Yang**

The Three Sages’ Jade Instructions state: “The world does not understand dying yin. Yang is the root of life, while yin is the root of death to yang. Simply absorb the numinous tortoise to put the yin stem to death, and spirit will naturally arise—do not mistake the death of the yin stem for the death of the Dao.”

Alas! Those who cultivate the body know only to suppress desire. Little do they realize that with a single thought of the heart, qi scatters with the heart, and essence perishes with qi. Have you not heard the words of the Perfected One of Everlasting Spring: “A single thought of lust stirs, and the harmonious qi of the hundred bones is harmed”?

Only those who attain the method can put the yin stem to death as if the six desires and seven emotions vanish in the moment, the Three Corpses and Nine Worms utterly extinguished without trace, all myriad concerns suddenly stilled. Thus, the true thought of reality arises, and even in the presence of phenomena, the heart remains unmoved—like white jade cast into mud yet unstained, as steadfast as Mount Tai. The Three Passes close without residue, the Gate of Life’s key is flung wide open. The ninefold radiance transforms qi, the five metals birth misty clouds; the double-headed jade deer rears high to spit golden wind, the three-inch crimson dragon lowers to gather the liquid of wood. The medicine furnace refines mercury, the crucible and cauldron congeal frost; the body transforms into pure yang, form and spirit both wondrous. Leaping beyond the confines of heaven and earth, released from the bonds of yin and yang—this mechanism is the urgent task of cultivating the body.

Some claim that without dying yin, desire instantly vanishes—such cases may exist, but I have never witnessed them.

**Chapter Six: Qi and Spirit Deviations**

After the adept’s qi attains primordial chaos, the original qi returns to its source, overflowing and coursing through the body, causing frequent stirrings that resemble madness. Each movement occurs in eighty-one cycles, leading some to mistakenly believe in possession by another soul—this is not so. If this qi deviation is not corrected, it becomes a spirit deviation, manifesting as visions of gods and ghosts, knowledge of fortune and misfortune, causes and effects, which some mistake for divine insight and numinous clarity—this, too, is not so. If this spirit deviation is not corrected, it becomes demonic illusion, where inner deviations summon outer deviations, giving rise to myriad strange phenomena.

Such a person with such an affliction harbors the seed of calamity, the root of losing life and body, the ghostly path to ruin. Outwardly appearing correct yet inwardly false, how is this different from a sheep in tiger’s skin or one who grasps reeds while mistaking them for orchids?

Why do those of us who are gentlemen of the Dao not discern this early? If one seizes the mechanism and aligns spirit and qi correctly, refining them with the proper method, the hun and po harmonize; refining them with precise measures, spirit and essence coalesce. Gradually congealing and transforming, the numinous flesh reveals its form, condensing into the sacred embryo. Golden light fills the chamber, swirling and enveloping; the true form transmutes into pure yang, spirit dwells in the true abode, flying forth from the crown of the head. My presence becomes luminous, radiance pervades all, inner and outer shining brilliantly, merging with the Great Void without distinction. This is the true realm.

Thus, nature and life are both perfected, pervading and fusing without obscurity. Only then can one hear the whispers at the ear and perceive with the eye behind the head—this is the universal discourse of the mysterious gate through the ages.

**Chapter Seven: Verifying the Function of the Dao**

Someone asked: “I have heard that those who cultivate in youth have strong foundations, but in old age, lead is depleted and mercury scarce. How is this?”

Between the time before parents were born and after death, where are the essence, blood, qi, and fluids? After demise, they return to earth, water, fire, and wind. In these two intervals, existence seems absent yet is present everywhere—how can one distinguish self from other, or speak of form? Why engage in false cultivation, leaving the heart ever more doubtful and unresolved?”

I replied: “Excellent question. Let me tell you. Long ago, Chen Ninwu answered Yu Chan: ‘The Dao is originally formless, likened to dragon and tiger; the Dao is originally nameless, compared to lead and mercury. Taking heaven and earth as the crucible, Kan and Li as the medicinal substances, through the work of seven returns and nine reversions, one refines a body of pure yang for eternal life.’

This is not attained by clinging to form or contrivance. It quietly resides in the realm of the indistinct and obscure—where is there self or other, form or appearance? Its body shines without shadow, its spirit functions freely, its nature contains myriad virtues, its function transcends a hundred errors.

Yet the original true neither clings nor departs. In movement, it gathers intent and enters the mysterious darkness; in stillness, it merges spirit and emerges into empty quiescence. Between movement and stillness, inner and outer radiance mutually reflect.”

A body is like a crystal pagoda, illuminating earth and shining upon heaven, its radiance all-pervading and undimmed. The original nature is like a pearl in a dish, perfectly luminous, vibrantly alive, flawlessly pure. Thus manifesting the wondrous essence of the original body, its transformations flow without stagnation, names and forms do not abide—united with the Dao in truth, one realizes that what came before and what remains after all things vanish are equally empty.

This great matter of karmic affinity is the very Way of the Heavenly Immortals. Some may assent, then take their leave with these words.

**Chapter Eight: The Five Teachings**
The Great Dao is formless and without substance, utterly empty and profoundly quiescent—inaudible when listened for, invisible when gazed upon, intangible when grasped. Yet though its body bears no image, cultivation follows an ordered sequence.

One must first awaken from delusion to attain the beginning, comprehend the beginning to reach the end, achieve the end to return to sudden enlightenment, and fully realize sudden enlightenment to enter perfect completeness. From this, we know that the beginning descends from the origin into manifestation, moving from non-being into being. Next, one gathers manifestation back to the origin, returning from being into non-being. Finally, both origin and manifestation are forgotten, being and non-being are both transcended—seeing through all forms as illusory, only then does one merge with the Dao.

Naturally and spontaneously, every phenomenon reveals truth, every thing becomes luminous, pervading all realms and empty space—all is the treasure of one’s own home. This is not attained by clinging to images in search of mystery or parsing texts for understanding. This radiant clarity arises from the mind’s dharma, thoroughly realized yet unobstructed, emerging from profound stillness and non-doing.

If one neglects the work of beginning and end, merely lashing the mind to force entry into principle, claiming sudden awakening without cultivation, directly pointing to the original emptiness—pure as the void—this is mere verbal comprehension while the heart remains unenlightened. Sitting in dry emptiness until death, one achieves nothing. Have you not heard: “Sudden awakening to the One Mind must be perfected through the myriad practices of complete cultivation; a moment’s enlightenment to the Dao requires the long grinding of aeons”? Alas, cultivators of the body—why not ponder these words again and again?

If one hears without depth, knows without clarity, knows without clarity, cannot exhaust its essence—then practice yields no accomplishment. Is this mere empty talk?

**Chapter Nine: Forgetting Form to Nurture Qi**
Humans, endowed with the essence of the Three Powers and formed by the Four Great Elements, cling to the self and thus experience pain and itching, craving wealth and honor, seeking comfort in dwelling and satiety in food. Daily, they cherish and protect themselves, yet in bondage, they fall into decay. To nurture the original and nourish the plain, one must clearly perceive qi—only by forgetting form can this be achieved.

The True Man of Everlasting Spring once said: “One must ultimately risk life and limb—how long can one cling to protecting face and head?” Is this not the function of forgetting form? He also said: “The heart is like an unmoving mountain; qi is like the ever-tidal sea.” Is this not the mechanism of nurturing qi?

The True Man of Cinnabar Yang said: “When the body is empty, qi circulates.” This teaching is not false. Moreover, the *Yin Fu Jue* states: “All who cultivate the body must kill the heart, embrace the One, treasure qi, and refine essence.” Clearly knowing that the qi within the body must not scatter, the practitioner should dull the senses and break the body, becoming like withered wood. The Gate of Heaven opens wide, the Earthly Door is firmly sealed. With right mindfulness present, all myriad thoughts vanish. Breathing is soft and continuous, as if existing, as if not. Gathering and refining the harmonious qi, one opens the cave of dragon and tiger, connecting with the true qi of the Great One’s primordial palace. Day and night, yin and yang ascend and descend without cease; water and fire are drawn and replenished without error, warming the lead crucible with gentle, unbroken heat.

Cultivating the true fire, one does not transgress the three barriers or the hundred transformations—this is what “gentle and unbroken” means. Those who dwell in the upper heavens—are these empty words? When the Sea of Qi is purified, evil cannot invade. Always like a hen brooding her eggs, like a deer nurturing its antlers, one eternally guards the One qi to return to the root, attaining the Dao of preserving life and achieving immortality. Those who rode the carp into the water and rode the carp out—was this not achieved by forgetting form?

**Chapter Ten: Forgetting Qi to Nurture Spirit**
For those who advance in cultivation: when principle is attained with perfect balance, fire does not burn dry, water does not overflow. The two are harmonized according to measure, and the One qi is subdued in the furnace without escape. The Golden Elixir is refined and returned to congeal the true—how can one cling to it without forgetting?

If one does not forget, it is like crossing a river and not abandoning the boat—difficult to reach the other shore; or like recovering from illness yet continuing to take medicine—harming the upright qi. Master Ping Shu said: “Do not use ordinary lead; having used true lead, discard it.” This is the true esoteric method of using lead. “Use lead yet do not cling to it”—these are sincere words.

Thus, when the work of nurturing spirit is urgent, one must settle into stillness and forget qi. When the heart does not generate activity, principle does not kill spirit. This undying spirit is not the spirit of thoughts, intentions, or deliberations—it is one root with heaven and earth, one body with the myriad things. Nurturing it with subtle mechanism, the body seems as if not there. The sun and moon mutually illuminate, inner celestial light shines forth—appearing like a luminous pearl, resembling the full moon. Illuminating inner vision, day and night are distinct, transforming into a treasury of spiritual powers.

Thus, spirit is offered to spirit, and spirit becomes numinous—like a crane riding the wind, its comings and goings unfathomable. Do not mistake this for mere marvel; one must return to nurturing the empty valley, steadfast as an unmoving mountain. Suddenly, one day, a transformed body is born—sending forth and gathering in are at one’s command. This is the full attainment of the Way of nurturing spirit.

Have you not heard the words of the True Man Zhang in *The Song of Unfastening the Jade Pendant*:
“The yang spirit leaves the body, dark and profound.
In an instant, it roams the Three Isles.
Once entry and exit are mastered, restrain it—
seek further mystery.
Merge with true emptiness, and the Great Void is complete.”
Truly, these are the words!

**Chapter Eleven: Forgetting Spirit to Nurture Emptiness**
Those who have attained the method of refining spirit guard the spirit in the mysterious palace, pure and undefiled, yet cannot yet merge with emptiness and transform. One must forget this spirit to nurture emptiness. Thus, one neither abides in non-doing nor exhausts doing—neither clings to the already-extinguished extinction nor gives rise to the not-yet-moved movement.

At this juncture of cessation and continuation, when the mind abides in stillness without thought, one pierces through the emptiness of all dharmas and the unreality of all appearances. Each delusive condition dissolves upon encounter, and all defilements naturally cease. There is no abiding in abiding, no thought in thought—obscurely, it seems to act without acting, serenely, it merges emptiness with emptiness. The substance of this emptiness suddenly becomes unbound.

Should one fail to grasp the transformations of nurturing from beginning to end: if nurtured above, it scorches the eyes and reddens the face, losing the refinement of the true heart. If nurtured below, it sinks into the elixir field, merely sustaining the path of grains. If nurtured externally, one chases shadows and squanders golden sand. If nurtured internally, one adorns the heart’s subtleties, constricting without universality. Thus, each clings to one aspect, fostering delusion in turn, contending over this and that, gain and loss, unable to free themselves—unworthy of discussion.

The supreme subtlety lies in realizing the nurturing of qi and spirit to attain inner vision. Within, one perceives the emptiness of body and mind; without, the emptiness of all things. In all matters of seeing, hearing, sensing, and knowing, one does not cling to appearances, attaining utmost purity and great clarity. Thus, one recognizes it face-to-face, abides in tranquility with mastery, and gradually merges with the Great Void. Within, one embraces the radiance of sun and moon; without, one blends with the bounds of emptiness. Without premeditating the mind in the Great Void, one naturally unites with it, free from the slightest obstruction or the faintest stain. Internally and externally, above and below, no distinctions arise—only a serene, unmoving effort, pure and forged into oneness.

At this point, heaven is not heaven, earth is not earth, and one knows not where the self resides. Gathered, it forms shape; dispersed, it becomes qi—lucid and unbound, standing solitary and transcendent. This is called shattering emptiness to attain completion.

Yet words cannot exhaust meaning, nor meaning exhaust words—transcending both, it is transmitted beyond teaching, beyond the written line.

**Chapter Twelve: Fusion Without Attachment**
It is said: Only because the eye does not see itself can it see objects; only because a mirror does not illuminate itself can it reflect objects. If it were to see or illuminate itself, it would be too occupied to attend to others. The marvel of vision and reflection lies in their focus elsewhere, thus reversing light upon objects, making all things radiant and flawless—dust becomes earth, a drop becomes the sea. One realizes the non-duality of principle and phenomena, the unity of movement and stillness.

Thus, the inner mind does not arise, knowing external realms are fundamentally empty. One naturally follows conditions without clinging to distinctions, freeing the heart from obstructions. Like gold refined a hundred times, impurities vanish and brilliance emerges—evidencing the precision of Dao-power, the cleansing of the mind’s profound vision. External dust is instantly relinquished; one sees the emptiness of all appearances, delusive conditions do not arise. In the perfect clarity of true reality, not a single thing remains, nor any suffering aggregates to obstruct. All realms are gathered into one mind.

Having merged appearances with essence to return to the source, one manifests true realms from the original mind, revealing the wondrous existence of the formless. Establishing methods to respond to change, one deploys the power of concentration and wisdom, manifesting various expedient means to cultivate the right knowledge of myriad practices, revealing the pure true nature like empty space. Empty and formless, what thing could obstruct it?

Thus, the profound measure enters the microcosm without being small, encompasses the Great Void without being large. Only this mind and this realm, secretly fused and perfectly merged, utterly transcending traces—this is the true emptiness of the essential Dharma-realm.

If one does not establish merit, the mind and realm remain obscured, unable to simultaneously dissolve form and emptiness, yet falsely claiming to fuse the ten thousand things without attachment—how deluded!

**Chapter Thirteen: No Cultivation, No Attainment**
There are those of the Lesser Vehicle who cling to emptiness and fixate on annihilation, leaving nature without refuge and dharma without rectification. Fearing form as an obstacle, they extinguish form to reveal emptiness, or separate from form to reveal emptiness. Seeing all appearances as illusory, nothing worthy of embrace, they fail to perceive the creative emptiness within, the wondrous existence of emptiness—though not governing, it mysteriously coalesces within emptiness. How unlike the illusory flowers in the sky or the mirage’s semblance of existence, which are not truly present.

They claim sudden awakening to no-cultivation, yet do not understand the cultivation within no-cultivation, the seeking within non-seeking. How do they differ from the ignorant, who fundamentally neither cultivate nor seek? Like beasts of burden, merely refraining from active thought—can this be called emptiness?

Truly, without entering the vast sea, one cannot obtain the wish-fulfilling pearl. Without cultivating the practices of wisdom and expedient means, one cannot adorn the Dharma-body. Without seeking the original true luminous essence, one cannot perfect the Dharma-nature.

Once delusive thoughts suddenly cease, the original true essence becomes manifest—there is no other truth to seek; this is the seeking within non-seeking. The Dharma-body being complete, it responds to conditions as they arise—there is no other true essence to cultivate; this is the cultivation within no-cultivation.

Thus, neither delusion nor truth—what is there to cultivate, what to attain? The numinous awareness is fundamentally without a single thing; why cling to the toils of life? The body remains as unmoving as Mount Tai, the mind as unobstructed as empty space—revealing the wondrous essence, radiant and free from all names and forms. Seeing the emptiness of all things, where is there cultivation or attainment?

**Biographical Account**
Master Liu Zhiyuan of Tongxuan, a native of Gaolouli in Xici, was a disciple of Chaoranzi. For twenty years under his teacher’s guidance, his demeanor showed neither joy nor anger. Thereafter, like the wind swaying grass, countless scholars and commoners sought to serve him as their master.

Master in his daily life slept without startling dreams, walked without heeding the path, sat like withered wood, and dwelled as an unfeeling stone—ever silent, his mind never entangled with things. When visitors came to call, before the conversation had run its course, he would appear as if in a stupor, his mouth unresponsive to questions, his gaze not meeting their eyes. Yet those who parted from him gained some wondrous insight or direction. Had the power of the Dao not long been etched into his heart, how could he have reached such a state?

Whatever he coughed or spat forth became as resplendent as strings of pearls or the jades of Zhao, and his brushstrokes flowed like the sap of oak—without need for labored search, he composed a collection, which he titled *Awakening the Real*.

At the age of fifty-nine, on the nineteenth day of the seventh month, he departed by *shijie*. He left behind a gatha:

A moving corpse on earth, chasing wind and dust,
Nurtured thusness to realize the original real.
Scooping earth to embrace heaven—no form remains,
Yet body fully revealed across the ten directions and three realms.

When his funeral procession set forth, wind and rain escorted it for over thirty *li*. Yet near the spirit casket, the wind left the banners still, and rain did not dampen the mourners’ clothes. Auspicious vapors merged with the rainbow, and rare fragrance wafted like musk. All who attended the burial were struck with awe. With one voice, they marveled, saying: "This is truly the response of his Dao cultivation!" How truly magnificent.

—Dong Yongchong, *Ancient Melodies*

The dragon, ah, the dragon returns to the sea palace.
The phoenix, ah, the phoenix soars through the cinnabar skies.
Alas! The true man who has penetrated the mysteries—
His belly ample, his marrow rich with the finest essence.
To learn the Dao and attain the Dao—how profound!
To cultivate the real and realize the real—how wondrous!

—Zhang Guobao, *Six-Character Verse*

Nurturing azure locks and a numinous frame,
He shed his immortal bones, graceful and refined.
Wherever he roamed, he stood majestic and grand,
With perfect clarity, mastering the wondrous art of non-arising.

—Qu Chan’gong, *Following the Rhyme of the Previous Gatha*

The numinous true one shed his shell and left the mortal dust,
Wisdom merged with perfect clarity, the Dao united with the real.
In the realm of form, he could not be found,
Yet in the formless realm, his full body was revealed.

—Wang of Xishan’s *Stone Records*

My teacher, Uncle Bo, shed his shell like a cicada,
None who heard did not raise their hands to their foreheads in awe.
A single thunderclap shook the earth,
Leaving immortal traces for ten thousand ages.
Unfettered, he scorned the wind’s purity,
Carefree, he rode the moon’s whiteness.
His great name is recorded among men,
While he dwells as a true guest beyond the heavens.

—*Seven-Character Impromptu Verse*

The Master spoke of reaching sixty, then suddenly left his bones,
Ascending into the formless, never to come or go.
His immortal ascent was surely among the first ranks,
As Penglai’s heights trembled with a single thunderclap.

—*Another Verse*

The immortal’s merit complete, he cast off the world’s cage,
Riding the wind, ethereal, leaving no trace.
Hu Mountain remains as before—where is the man?
Only a shimmer of waves bathes the emerald peaks.

—*The Lower Scroll of the Qizhen Collection Concludes*
