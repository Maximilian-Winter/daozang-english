**The Golden Elixir Hundred Questions Classic**

In days past, there was **Li Guangxuan** (昔李光玄者), a man of **Bo Hai** (渤海). **Orphaned and bereft of breath** (少孤连气), he had but a few servants (僮仆数人), yet his household amassed **wealth in pearls and gold numbering in the millions** (家积珠金巨万).

At the age when one **begins to wear the cap of adulthood** (弱冠), Guangxuan **followed his fellow villagers** (逐乡人), **traveling by boat** (舟船) between **Qing Society** (青社) and the **Huai-Zhe regions** (淮浙), **engaging in trade and commerce** (货易巡历). Later, he **crossed the sea** (却过海) and met a **Daoist recluse** (道人) aboard the same vessel. Day and night, the recluse conversed with Guangxuan, recounting his **journeys through Silla, Bo Hai, and Japan** (巡历新罗、渤海、日本诸国).

Guangxuan then asked the recluse: *"Does China lack those of noble pursuit? Why must one cross the sea to wander?"* (中国岂无好事耶，争得过海游历).

The recluse replied: *"In this world, I am like a **fleeting cloud** (浮云). My heart holds no other concerns, thus I traverse the sea."* (我於世上，喻若浮云，心无他事，是以过海).

Guangxuan found this strange and **from then on, day and night, he sought to engage the recluse in discourse** (异之，因更日夜与道人攀言论). The recluse then asked Guangxuan: *"What further **resources and possessions** (资产) does your household hold?"* (郎君家更有何资产).

Guangxuan answered: *"I was orphaned young, with only a few brothers and servants (兄弟僮仆数人), yet my family’s fortune is immense."* (余少孤，兄弟僮仆数人，家财巨万).

The recluse said: *"With such wealth at your disposal, why risk the **perils of distant seas** (远涉风波), pursuing further gain? The **vast ocean stretches endlessly** (漫漫大海), its **waves roll ceaselessly** (浩浩长波). A single moment of **shipwreck and ruin** (倾危), and the **creatures of the deep** (虫鱼) would feast upon you. What wisdom is this?"* (既家资如此，何得远涉风波，更求其利，漫漫大海，浩浩长波，一旦倾危，虫鱼得便，此何智也).

Guangxuan responded: *"I do not risk these winds for wealth. I **ponder in darkness** (暗思) the world of men, all of which is like **dream and illusion** (梦幻). The **morning mist and dew** (朝霞晓露) fade swiftly—how could they endure? The **flicker of a stone’s spark or lightning’s flash** (石火电光) passes in an instant. So too is human life—**brief and fleeting** (瞥然则灭). It is worth contemplation."* (我非为财涉此风波，余暗思人世，皆如梦幻，朝霞晓露，岂可久长，石火电光，瞥然则灭。人生若此，宁可思惟。)

*"The graves of the old are still un-dried, yet new mounds rise in succession. **Gold and jade are scattered across the land** (垒金遍地), yet none of it **avails the living** (全不关身). **Piled high as the heavens** (积玉倚天), yet how could they **preserve one’s life** (留命)?"* (旧冢未乾，新坟相次。垒金遍地，全不关身。积玉倚天，岂能留命。)

Thus, Guangxuan ventured across the boundless seas, entering distant lands, his intent to seek the **True Ones** (真人) and question the **accomplished sages** (达士), hoping to learn some **method** (术) that might **save life before death** (救生前).

Upon arriving in those distant lands, however, he found no such encounters—no **virtuous and wise** (英哲)—and so he returned home, his sincerity unshaken, not for wealth or gain.

The Daoist said: *"You are still young, and should cherish the glory and splendor of the world. With such brilliance, you are truly a man of great potential. Do not grieve over the **fate of immortality** (仙分)—only cultivate yourself diligently, and you shall attain the **True Way** (其真)."*

Guangxuan, hearing the Daoist’s words, bowed respectfully and replied: *"I am but a lowly worm, how could I ever become a dragon? A caged parrot, how could I ever resemble a phoenix? I do not dare aspire to **great enlightenment** (大悟), but only hope to glimpse **some small wisdom** (小知). If the **Noble One** (高人) does not deem me too vulgar and ignorant, would you deign to offer even a little instruction? I would cherish it all my life and never betray your kindness."*

The Daoist asked: *"Do you seek **longevity and life-preservation** (延年保命), or the **Golden Elixir and Great Medicine** (金丹大药)?"*

Guangxuan answered: *"I do not dare to choose."*

*"But if you truly seek instruction from one who knows, I may grant it. You may serve it all your life."*

The Daoist continued: *"The Golden Elixir and Great Medicine—without encountering a **Perfect Sage** (至人), one cannot master them. As for preserving life and extending years, that is the **path of knowing the principles** (轨则). If you take to it, I shall have no regrets."*

Guangxuan replied: *"I am young and foolish—how dare I presume to enter the **mysterious gates of the Dao** (玄妙之门)?"*

The Daoist said: *"The Dao resides within the body—there is no need for external pursuits. If you can **withdraw from worldly desires**, abandon **lustful attachments** (世绿), sleep on stone and rinse with spring water, embrace stillness among the pines, and **preserve your primordial qi** (元气不散), then **eternal life** (长生) may be attained.

For **primordial qi** (元气) is the **mixed essence within the body** (混元之气), the **foundation of human life** (人之根基). When the mind is still, the qi settles; when the mind wanders, the qi scatters. Thus, the **Perfect Ones** (至人) **cultivate stillness**, reject **right and wrong**, cut off **gaze and glance**, ensure their breath does not stray beyond the nostrils, and **focus their thoughts constantly on the elixir field** (丹田).

If the **Three Fields** (三田) are **nourished**, a thousand years may be preserved. Moreover, **inhale the fresh and exhale the stale**, rinse the mouth and swallow the saliva—these are all **paths to longevity**, all **methods of fortifying the body** (固身之道).

An ancient verse says:
*'Qi is the elixir that adds years,
Essence is the mushroom that prolongs life.
Those who rush and hurry in the world,
Seeking outside when they should seek within—
This is the way.'*

If you practice this diligently, morning and night, without tiring, you shall surely attain the **Way of Longevity and Eternal Life** (延年长生之道)."*

The Daoist then asked Guangxuan: *"Do you see my beard, hair, and form?"*

Guangxuan replied: *"The Noble One’s beard and eyebrows are extraordinary—your hair is bound like a child’s, your face youthful, your lips vermilion, your teeth gleaming white."*

The Daoist said: *"This is the result of practicing the Way. I have now surpassed a hundred years and know no sickness. Do you recognize me?"*

Guangxuan bowed twice in gratitude, saying: *"A young and insignificant man like me has heard the **Great Dao** (大道). How could this not be the Noble One’s compassionate guidance, pointing out the **secret passes** (秘关)? I shall cherish this teaching all my life and revere your virtue."*

After disembarking at the eastern shore, the Daoist wished to travel to **Silla** (新罗) and **Bohai**, bidding farewell to Guangxuan. Guangxuan, overcome with emotion, tearfully took leave and returned home.

Upon arriving home, Guangxuan devoted himself entirely to the **Supreme Dao** (至道), disregarding worldly pleasures, and left his homeland once more to dwell in the **Cloud Islands** (云岛) for over ten years. Following the Noble One’s instructions, he **propagated the Supreme Dao** (弘持至道), and his **qi and strength multiplied a hundredfold**, his form becoming extraordinary. Thus, those who had sailed with him before began to call him the **Sea Guest** (海客).

One night, Guangxuan reflected on how worldly men sought **transcendence** (出世之门) and the **Way of Golden Elixir** (金液之道). If he remained here, he would never encounter such teachings. So he abandoned the Cloud Islands, gradually making his way back to the **Central Kingdom** (中华), touring famous mountains and the **Five Sacred Peaks** (五岳), paying homage to **sacred realms** (圣境), and earnestly seeking **accomplished sages**.

First, he visited **Mount Tai** (泰岳), then traveled to other mountains, and in the eighth month of the **Year of the Goat** (己酉年), on the third day, he arrived at **Shaoshi Cave** (少室洞) in **Songshan** (嵩高山), staying there for over ten days. Later, he ascended southward to **Kunlun Rock Valley** (骯岩谷).

After walking about five or six *li*, he suddenly encountered beneath a pine grove an elderly man—his form and spirit half-aged—carrying a bamboo staff with three **gourds** (瓢) hanging from its tip, dressed in coarse robes and a long headwrap, slightly different from ordinary people.

The man asked Guangxuan: *"From where have you come?"*

Guangxuan replied: *"I am from Bohai. I have dwelled in the Cloud Islands for many years, and now, having traveled from overseas, I seek the **famous mountains and sacred lands**. Today, I have arrived here."*

The man asked again: *"Each person has their own path—why do you wander the mountains alone? What do you seek?"*

Guangxuan answered: *"Though all have their paths, I alone have abandoned wealth and status, laughed at honor and nobility, and taken no delight in worldly splendor. I seek only the **mysterious and true Dao** (妙道至真), and thus I have come this far."*

The man asked again: *"Since you began seeking the Dao, how many years have passed? How much of it have you attained?"*

Guangxuan replied: *"Over twenty years, both within and beyond the seas, I have gone everywhere."*

The man asked again: *"In these twenty years, what have you encountered?"*

Guangxuan answered: *"In these two decades, I once met a Daoist on a ship who taught me to **nourish my essence and qi**, guide and stretch my limbs, and follow his methods to cultivate the Way."*

The man asked again: *"Having attained this Dao, what more do you seek?"*

Guangxuan replied: *"I have heard that **immortals possess the even more refined Golden Elixir Way** (金液妙道), and the **Refined Elixir reaching the Governing Vessel** (还丹至卫). I fear wasting my years, so I have searched every mountain."*

The man asked again: *"In your search for the Golden Elixir Way, have you met anyone?"*

Guangxuan answered: *"For over twenty years, I have not encountered a **true sage** (达者)."*

The old man smiled faintly and asked again: *"Do you recognize me now?"*

Guangxuan said: *"I still do not recognize the Virtuous One."*

The old man said: *"I am Master Xuan Shou."* Again, he asked Guangxuan: *"What is your surname and given name?"*

Guangxuan replied: *"My surname is Li, my given name is Guangxuan."* The old man laughed again: *"I am called Xuan Shou, and your name is Guangxuan—our names correspond. I have found my man. As Confucius said: 'He who awakens me is Shang.'"* Again, he spoke to Guangxuan: *"When you seek the Golden Elixir Way, is it to uplift the world or only for yourself?"*

Guangxuan said: *"In my search for the Golden Elixir Way, I seek first for my own body, and second to uplift those who have the potential to follow the Dao. This is not merely for myself."* The old man said: *"If your sincerity is true as you say, then I may transmit it to you. If it is only for your own sake, the immortals will not permit it. I possess this Way, and you may receive it."* Guangxuan, upon hearing this, wept and bowed twice, saying: *"The Immortal’s refined Way—how could it be lightly passed on? Heaven and Earth would surely protest, and the spirits would hold me accountable. I beg you to take pity on my humble life and allow me to follow you for decades, day and night in earnest devotion, so that I may eventually be granted this profound and mysterious teaching."*

The old man said: *"No, if you lack virtue, even if you devoted your entire life to toil, this Way would still not be entrusted to you. I see that your immortal bones are marked, and your saintly foundation is pure and mature. Now that we have met, at this moment of our encounter, if you focus your resolve and sincerity, and listen to what I say, you shall be taught."*

Master Xuan Shou then set aside his bamboo staff and sat upon a stone. Before him was another stone. He said to Guangxuan: *"Sit and listen to my supreme Way."*

Guangxuan began: *"Master, you bestow upon me the gate of the supreme Way—how dare I sit so casually?"*

The old man said: *"Sit, for the Way is profound and mysterious. Even if we exhaust all the words of this day, we may still not finish, so how could I let you stand and listen for long? Just sit and listen to what I say."*

Guangxuan bowed twice more and knelt, then listened.

The old man said: *"The Refined Elixir is not a separate medicine. True Oneness is the foundation, lead and mercury rely upon each other, and the Yellow Sprout is the root—only then can it be accomplished."*

Guangxuan rose and bowed again, then asked the old man: *"I have seen that all Daoists in the world speak of the Yellow Sprout, but I do not know its true principles. What is the Yellow Sprout, and with what medicine is it made?"*

The old man said: *"Lead extracted from lead is the true treasure. Mercury refined from the metallic mercury, lead and mercury forming the elixir—this is called the Yellow Sprout Child. There is an ancient song that says:*
*'The Yellow Sprout is forged from lead and mercury,*
*Its yin wheel holds the yang splendor.*
*Without the Yellow Sprout’s essence,*
*The Refined Elixir’s path is blocked.*
*The world refines common medicines,*
*All mistaking lead for the Yellow Flower.*
*The Yellow Flower is lifeless,*
*How could it reach the immortal realm?*
*The Yellow Sprout is not in medicine,*
*But in the inner alchemical form, its essence is taken.*
*If you reach the Yellow Sprout’s realm,*
*Gold and silver are but empty boasts.'*

*This is what I mean."*

Guangxuan said: *"I have seen in *The Five Analogies of Metal and Stone* that it says: 'Lead contains great poison—how could it be used to refine the supreme medicine?' Master, you said:"*

The old man said: *"Lead may have poison, but this is because the world does not understand how to extract and use it. Take, for instance, the croton seed in medicines—it is not without poison. If one knows how to use it properly, it can cure countless ailments; so too with lead. In *The Er Tao Zhi Pian*, it is written:*
*'Lead contains gold, gold contains treasure,*
*Seeing the treasure, separate it—*
*The wise attain the Way.*
*Better to refine the gold within lead,*
*Than to forge the treasure within gold.*
*This is not the lead of the common world.*
*The world simply uses lead directly,*
*Hoping to obtain the Yellow Sprout,*
*But never attaining it—*
*They do not recognize its true nature.'*

Guangxuan said: *"Is there more than one kind of lead?"*

The old man said: *"Lead is not of two kinds. For example, if you nurture a child by cutting flesh from your parents’ bodies and placing it within your own womb, expecting the child to be born, it would be difficult indeed. If you separate from your parents, how could the child be born? The ancient song says:*
*'The tripod tripod, originally without tripod,*
*The medicine medicine, originally without medicine.*
*Use lead, yet do not use lead,*
*You must act within the lead itself.*
*The Yellow Sprout is lead,*
*Yet it is ten thousand miles from lead.*
*The Yellow Sprout is not lead,*
*Yet it begins with lead.*
*Lead is the Father of the Teeth,*
*The Teeth are the children of lead.*
*The child conceals the mother’s womb,*
*The mother conceals the child’s embryo.*
*Knowing white to guard black,*
*The divine illumination comes naturally.'*

*This is what I mean."*

Even unto the various scriptures, they praise only the efficacy of lead. To abandon its lead is like discarding one’s parents, yet still seeking the child. The ancient song says:
*"Do not destroy my lead,
That my life may remain whole.
Do not destroy my chariot,
That I may return home.
When lead severs the River Chariot, all actions are in vain.
When lead cuts off the River Chariot, nothing succeeds.*

*Again it says:*
*The Dark Origin arises from the Golden Ancestor,
Majestic and enduring from beginning to end.

*Again it says:*
*A single thing containing five hues,
Forever the blessing of the Immortal.*

*And in the *Tao Zhi Pian* it is written:*
*The One is the water’s number,
The origin of the Five Phases.
Its hue aligns with the North’s domain,
Encompassing the Five Phases—
Cultivate it to harmonize with the Dao,
And naturally grasp the truth.
Thus it can generate Heaven and Earth,
Become female and male,
Then return the solar essence to the lunar cave,
Condense the refined essence from the void,
And produce the purple qi’s essence,
Concealed and in harmony with the True.
None but the divine can perceive it.

The world fails to understand its use,
Thus even a hair’s breadth error leads to a thousand miles’ loss—
How could it not be clear?

The ancient song says:
*'Use lead, yet do not use lead,
You must act within the lead itself.*
At the precise moment of using lead,
Is using lead right or wrong?

*Again it says:*
*'Use lead, yet do not use lead,
Lead is the old elixir field.*
This is the art of neither discarding nor employing it,
Whereby yin and yang follow their order.
Enlightenment brings attainment—
It lies within the lead itself.
Study it carefully.*

*And in the *Yuan Yang Zi Song* it is said:*
*The True Yin and True Yang are its Way,
Yet they stand before you—why seek afar?
Ordinary men year after year refine the spirit elixir,
Then suddenly see green and yellow and call it good.
The worthy must seek the true method,
Lest their vital essence be wasted in vain.
But if one obtains the True Yellow Sprout,
Those who ingest it shall never age—
This is evident.*

**Light Xuan said:** I have heard the world claim that cinnabar and mercury are the Yellow Sprout—what is the reasoning?

**The Master replied:** These are not the words of one who grasps the Dao. Cinnabar and mercury, lacking fixed form, have no substance or shape—
Yin cannot generate, the female cannot conceive.
As Li Qi’an said:
*"Cinnabar and mercury dwell together,
Yet the two women never recognize each other.
Self-establishment is already unstable—
How could they produce the Great Elixir?"*

The Yellow Sprout arises from the union of Kan and Li,
Where metal and water mutually generate,
The male crowned, the female veiled,
Yin and yang in perfect accord—
From non-being to being, yin moves, yang responds,
Only then can it be formed,
In accordance with ultimate truth.
Thus the *Song of the True Yin Lord* says:
*"The true qi of the North is the River Chariot,
Binding the solar Yang to form the golden sand.
Two passions nurtured in one body,
The Vermilion Bird refines and births the golden flower.
When the golden flower blooms,
It is the treasure of Heaven and Earth—
He who understands this attains the supreme Dao."*

**Light Xuan said:** I have also seen the world claim gold as the Yellow Sprout, silver as the Yellow Sprout, ground cinnabar and silver as the Yellow Sprout, live silver as the Yellow Sprout, or smelted, refined, and dried lead as the Yellow Sprout—even using *mita* (lead oxide) as the Yellow Sprout. What is the reasoning?

**The Master replied:** These are all incorrect. All such substances are coarse and stagnant—
Refine them, and their color fades, their form withers;
Burn them, and they scatter as dust and ash—
Reduced to powdered bone, they yield nothing.
They are solitary yin or meager yang,
Striving to rival the supreme elixir.
Ingesting them sears the five viscera,
Shortening life—
How could they compare to the Yellow Sprout in the Great Dao?

The Yellow Sprout is the union of lead and mercury,
Metal and wood in parallel,
Dragon and Tiger intertwined,
Water and fire in balance—
Embodying sentiment and nature,
With spirit following essence,
Becoming the cause of return and rebirth,
Clarifying the principles of inhalation and exhalation,
Achieving yin’s embrace of yang’s gestation,
The mother whole as the child is born—
Receiving the essence of Heaven and Earth,
Transmitting the Great Dao of the Primordial Void.

The ancient song says:
*"Metal does not reveal its body,
Wood does not display its form."*

*Again it says:*
*"Cinnabar and wood’s essence,
When united with metal, merge as one."*

*Again it says:*
*"Conceal the body, gather the spirit to sate the Tiger’s hunger,
The Tiger comes to devour the living essence within."*

This is perfectly clear.

**Light Xuan said:** Though the Yellow Sprout is said to be crafted from lead and mercury, with metal and water generating each other, my confusion remains. I humbly pray the Master clarify further.

The Master said: *"Suppose one asks how to plant a tree. On fertile fields where fine fruits grow, first the land is plowed and tilled, then the best soil is chosen. When the season arrives, it still depends on balanced winds and rains, on the timing of the seasons urging it forward—by year’s end, the harvest is complete. The cultivation of the Yellow Sprout follows the same principle.

To combine lead and mercury, to align with the trigrams *Kǎn* and *Lǐ*, to let water and fire follow their natural course—when the time is ripe and the conditions complete, transformation unfolds without equal. Once the Yellow Sprout is formed, the Great Dao becomes effortless.

The ancient song says:
*'Lead-mercury teeth, lead-mercury teeth,
Uniting the Three Flowers, drawing in my qi,
Forming cinnabar—first hearing the sun,
Refining with fire, cycling through five hues,
Entering divine brilliance, once a servant,
Now the Dao is unerring—when the three are complete, one attains immortality.'*

This is clear.

Light Xuan said: *"Now that the Yellow Sprout is obtained, its root is understood. But how does one proceed to the Supreme Medicine? I again humbly seek the Master’s instruction."*

The Master said: *"The Supreme Medicine relies solely on the Five Phases; no extraneous substances may be added. If any others are introduced, it will not be the Supreme Medicine.

The ancient song says:
*'Seize the Eastern Green Dragon in its bound form,
Pair it with the Western White Tiger.
Then take the Southern Vermilion Bird,
And finally meet the Black Tortoise of the Void.
Within the void, seek the void’s path—
Do not stray from the central way.'*

This is clear."*

This five is the very essence of lead and mercury—
only thus can the elixir be perfected.
If any others are introduced, it cannot be achieved.

It is like a family of parents and spouse—
no outsiders may be admitted.
Lead and mercury, the Five Phases, are the same.

When subdued into medicine, bones, flesh, vital essence, *qi*, and blood vessels remain intact—
only then may it be ingested.

The ancient song says:
*"Why speak of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth?
Preserving life and guarding spirit are the Dragon and Tiger.
The scholar fails to recognize the Five Phases’ essence,
forcibly claiming others as parents and spouse.
Wood governs *qi*, the Tiger rules bone,
water commands blood, and flesh embodies earth.
The Dao of immortality lies in the Hall of Separation—
when the Five Phases unite, gold takes its master.
The Five Phases must be born of mercury’s own essence;
dissimilar substances cannot serve as companions.

Again, the *Song of Master He Lan Seeking the Great Sage* says:
*The Green Dragon rises, the White Tiger rests,
the Black Tortoise soars, the Sovereign sits still,
while the Yellow Dragon coils in the central embrace.
Mother pities child, child pities mother—
within the furnace, a cloud forms as one.
Ingesting it, the elixir’s efficacy knows no bounds.*

This is the truth.

Light Xuan said: *"Though the Supreme Medicine is forged by subduing Dragon and Tiger,
and the Five Phases’ essence births the elixir,
what is most critical when forming the pill for ingestion?"*

The Master said: *"On the day of refining, it is a single essence—
mercury’s divine water, the womb of the elixir—
ground into violet-golden powder,
its hue bearing five colors, manifesting the Five Phases’ embodied form.
It is called the Golden Liquid Reversion Elixir;
the divine immortals of antiquity all followed this same method."*

The ancient song says:
*"A single essence of mercury becomes the elixir of immortality,
yet if it flows, fire’s suppression proves difficult.
If it meets the River Vehicle to form violet powder,
instantly it transforms into Golden Liquid Elixir.
The true method of gold elixir is not red—
mercury alone is profound and mysterious.
The elixir’s efficacy is verified by the Swordsman’s test;
those who ingest it attain true immortality as divine immortals."*

Another song says:
*"Reverse-extracting to obtain mercury,
then burning it into sand.
Within the womb, it receives the Five Phases—
when the month is complete, the Yellow Sprout appears.
Lost paths reveal nothing,
yet across the void, the distance yawns.
If one reaches the River Vehicle’s domain,
only this is the realm of immortals."*

This is clear.

Light and Primordial says: *"To suppress fire with mercury—
if it becomes the ultimate medicine,
yet since ancient times, many have used cinnabar and mercury to suppress fire,
so why do those who take it never extend their years?
When they attempt alchemical transformation,
it proves equally futile.
What does this mean?

The Master replied:
These are all who fail to grasp the subtle arts of Daoist immortals,
who do not follow the principles of the Immortal Scriptures,
who do not adhere to the Five Phases in their preparation,
and who miss the essence of solar and lunar elixirs.
Some mix it with inferior substances,
others stray far from the True Principle.
Even if they produce a thousand pounds of suppressed fire,
it is no better than common stone or clay.
Not only does the transformation fail,
but even ingestion brings untimely death and shortens life.
Thus, the *Transmission of the Sage King* states:
In ancient times, there were two brothers
who took one pound of mercury
and refined it in the Yang Mountain Valley for three years,
until it turned the color of red glass,
claiming it was the ultimate medicine.
Each brother took half a pound,
and within six months,
they had to wear padded garments to move,
and even required others to support them.
This barely prolonged their lives,
yet they suffered calamity to their bodies.
Was it not because the medicinal category was wrong,
and the methods misaligned?
This can be taken as proof.
The key lies in seeking the True Source—
if one attains the authentic origin,
one will never fail."*

Guangxuan asked: "Since the yellow sprout is the foundation of the greatest medicine, formed by the Five Phases, and its source is understood, how does it transcend the mundane world? I do not yet know the precise proportions or when the refining began, yet it achieves completion. I humbly pray the Master, in his compassion, to further instruct me."

The Master replied: "The proportions of the Immortal’s elixir are not arbitrary—they follow the Great Dao. The timing of the gold elixir’s refining must be precise, and it does not depend solely on the furnace’s form. Moreover, the cauldron embodies *Yin* and *Yang*. Fire must originate from *Zi* (Water) and *Li* (Fire), and one must discern the cosmic omens. Only when returning from *Li* to *Hai* (Water) does luminosity first appear—just as the child in the womb, it requires the sun’s fullness, or the chick in the egg, awaiting its time. The proportions are when *Er* (2) and *Ba* (8) unite, and the timing is when one star’s cycle brings rain, then the Dragon ascends with clouds and thunder, the Tiger roars at the cliffs—thus extending the years of all beneath heaven. This is no mere mortal concern.

An ancient verse says:
*'Er-Ba* astonishes the maiden,
*Shiliu* is lead’s refined essence.
When *Yang* arises, fire ignites;
when *Yin* is exhausted, it must cease.
Stars cycle with rain,
and the elixir attains its spirit."

Moreover, Tao Yuanming’s *Wang Jiangnan* poem states:
*"The elixir of longevity*
*is born of the Five Phases’ work.*
*At *Zi* and *Wu*, the gates open,*
*and *Mao* and *You* govern the seasons.*
*Fire unites *Yin* and *Yang*—*
*Dragon and Tiger devour each other.*
This is the very meaning."

Guangxuan said: "Now that the Great Elixir’s methods are clear, it truly benefits all living beings. At this fortunate encounter, I have also seen various scriptures state:
*'Day-Soul, Moon-Spirit,*
*White Tiger, Green Dragon,*
*Cinnabar, River-Chariot,*
*True Lead, True Mercury—*
their names are countless, confusing the mind.
I do not know which is the true name.
I beg the Master to clarify these doubts,
so that future seekers may know the Dao’s path
and escape the dusty world."

The Master replied: "All these names refer to one path. *Day-Soul* is the essence of *Yang*, *Moon-Spirit* aligns with *Yin*. *Green Dragon* is Wood, never straying from its cardinal direction. *White Tiger* is Metal, dwelling in the west. *River-Chariot* is the elixir’s golden fluid—an honored name among the Immortals. *True Lead* and *True Mercury* are the titles of those who have attained the Dao. As long as one understands their transformations, why hesitate? Beyond the Five Phases, there is no other principle."

Guangxuan asked: "I have also seen the *Yellow Emperor’s Yin Symbol Scripture* say:
*'A hundred methods of gold elixir exist,*
*yet their essence lies in the *Shen Water* and *Hua Pool*.*
I do not know what *Shen Water* and *Hua Pool* are. Beyond the *Hua Pool*, does the gold elixir succeed or fail? I beg the Master to clarify this lingering doubt."

The Master replied: "Beyond the *Hua Pool*, the gold elixir fails. Even a hundred or a thousand methods are mere empty contrivances. Within the *Hua Pool*, it is most wondrous and divine. Thus, the Yellow Emperor attained transcendence through it, and Ma Ming achieved the Dao by this means. The principles of the *Hua Pool* are already detailed in the earlier chapter on the Five Phases, explained thoroughly. Therefore, the *Song of Yuan Yangzi* says:
*'The *Shen Water* and *Hua Pool* are rare in the world,*
*their transmission forbidden to the vulgar.*
Many take mundane lead and mercury,
making them seem alike to deceive the ignorant.'"

Guangxuan asked: "I have also seen the scriptures say:
*'Three-Five and One—*
*the utmost essence of Heaven and Earth.*
I do not know what this refers to."

「The Master said: Earlier, I explained it thoroughly, but now you ask again about the Three-Five—it is also the proper count of the Five Phases. Moreover, it is not a separate category, nor does it originate from mundane substances. You should further investigate and seek its fundamental source, for only then will you truly grasp its essence.

Do you not see the ancient song that says:
*"Yin Kan confuses with One,*
*Yang Li displays Five Colors."*

You do not know why the Three is essential—
it is the spirit of the Five Phases embodied.
Refining the elixir requires mastery of the formulas,
and the Mystic Passages are known from ancient scriptures.
When the *Qiong Dan* is perfected,
the Celestial Chariot rides upon the Five-Colored Clouds.

Guangxuan asked: *"Among the myriad elixirs of the world,*
*how can the Golden Liquid Returned Dan alone*
*extend life, preserve vitality,*
*and even grant transcendence?"*

The Master replied: *"Your dullness still fails to comprehend. Listen now as I elucidate.

Indeed, all who inquire of the Way are born under the Five Phases,
and even the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys—
how could they abandon Yin and Yang, the Five Phases?

The Returned Dan is the refined essence of the Five Phases’ *qi*,
containing the luminous spirit of all phenomena.
It attains the marvelous virtue of Purple Gold,
and is renowned for its flowing elixir.
Those who consume it will naturally fortify their limbs,
strengthen their organs,
and achieve longevity by its power—
this is the very cause of their immortality.
The results are evident before our eyes.

The misguided only cling to the ancient song:
*'Gold sand enters the Five Viscera,*
*its mist disperses like wind and rain.*
*Steaming and refining reach the Four Limbs,*
*their complexion becomes radiant and fair.*
*Withered old men regain youth,*
*aged women become maidens once more.*
*White hair turns black again,*
*fallen teeth grow back anew.*
*They are called True Persons’ Children,*
*and escape the calamity of death.'*
This method may be understood.

The Stone Elixirs, too, belong to the Five Phases,
yet they are not recorded in the Way.
If taken raw, they harm the body—
like fire suppressed, they are but worthless fragments.
They can only treat minor ailments.
How could one compare them to the Great Elixir?
The truth is clear, and the genuine source is not obscured.

The Herb Elixirs also change with the seasons,
unable to withstand frost and snow.
Their flavors may harmonize,
but they only remedy wind and dampness—
how could they match the Great Elixir’s supreme efficacy?

The True Dao is profound and distant,
requiring discernment between right and wrong
to measure its depth and shallowness.

Guangxuan asked: *"If the Great Elixir of Golden Liquid*
*can grant longevity and even ascension,*
*what further use does the world have for it?"*

The Master replied: *"The misguided do not realize*
*that the Golden Liquid Returned Dan has its applications.
This elixir, when fully refined in a year,
its ten months complete—
opens the furnace to reveal purple dust turning gold,
and lifts the cauldron to see yellow sprouts gleaming bright.
It encompasses the Five Colors,
and gathers the hundred spirits.
First, it is tested by being mixed with mercury,
whereupon yellow gold is instantly formed as proof.
After ingestion, it eternally fortifies the sinews and bones,
saving lives and benefiting families—
this is no idle claim.
The ancient song says:
*'Cinnabar, cinnabar,*
*saves lives and benefits families.*
*It can save my life,*
*it can save my family.'*
And Tao Yuanming’s *Viewing the Jiangnan* also states:
*'Ten months full, the cauldron opens—one cluster of red.*
*Fragments of jade-like frost hold Five Colors,*
*the Spirit of the Embryo is dissolved in the Mystic Water, its chime resounding.*
*The *qi* restores with fragrant vigor—*
*this is the attainment of the supreme treasure.'*

Guangxuan asked: *"Apart from this elixir’s mastery over mercury,*
*what other elixirs can subdue it*
*and produce the supreme treasure?"*

The Master replied: *"Beyond the Yellow Sprout’s supreme elixir,*
*no other preparation can truly control mercury."*

Guangxuan asked: *"Why cannot other elixirs subdue mercury?"*

The Master replied: *"Mercury is the utmost essence of Heaven and Earth,*
*the vital spirit of the Five Metals.
Its nature is fluid and unrestrained,
and it cannot be tainted by impurities.
Thus, the vulgar say:
*'Mercury is unadulterated,*
*Asafoetida is not genuine.'*
This reveals the true principle—
hence, all other substances cannot enter it.

The Yellow Sprout is indeed mercury,
but when it absorbs the essence of the Five Phases
and receives the pure *Yang Qi*,
its cycle of years and months is complete—
its form solidifies, its spirit perfect.
Once mercury is subdued by it,
what remains impossible?
The *Yin Fu Jing Commentary* states:
*'The Flying Mouse severs the Monkey,*
*the River Chariot subdues mercury.'*
If there are impurities,
no result can be achieved.
Another song says:
*'On the Riverbank, you marvel at the woman,*
*most luminous and divine.*
*Seeing fire, she takes flight,*
*never staining herself with filth.*
*Hidden by ghosts, concealed by dragons,*
*no one knows her abode.*
*To subdue her,*
*the Yellow Sprout is the root.*
*This is clear.'*

Guangxuan asked: *"Master, have you not heard of the ordinary methods?"*

*"To point toward the profound and mysterious,*
*the Dao of Golden Liquid is fully known,*
*and the Gates of Dragon and Tiger are instantly awakened.*
*Yet, for years on the seas,*
*I only sorrowed over the ten thousand miles of waves.*
*Today, amid the dust of the world,*
*I suddenly glimpse the realm of the Three Pure Ones.*
*Though I know the path to immortality,*
*I pity the common folk.*
*Now, I wish to further clarify,*
*and hope the Master will guide me once more,*
*so that all my confusion may reach the true source.
*This is my disciple’s sincere and heartfelt wish."*

The Master said: *"Your surname and given name*
*are already inscribed on the Elixir Field.*
*My teachings are profound and mysterious,*
*yet none are concealed.
*If you come to inquire,*
*I will elucidate them plainly.
*Do not harbor doubts,*
*and waste your life in vain."*

「光玄曰：我深恐世人不解铅汞之奥妙，不识五行之真谛。乃以四黄（黄金、黄铜、黄铁、黄丹）制伏水银，又使八石（八种矿石）成为至药，如炮制矾石、雄雌矾之类，无不遍寻。磁石、胆绿之辈，亦悉将入用。然而，指神符霜为黑锡，认圣无知为青盐，火锻百回，水飞千遍，忽三年守鼎，五载临炉，运火则山谷空虚，苦心则形神枯槁，终无所成，徒怨神方。今欲启问：求诸石药中，五矾之内，究竟有何至事？制得水银否？

伏望先生慈悲，特为开示。

先生曰：世间所问之事，乃至细微末节，未有不因其理，制伏相依，种类相取，而成事者。若穷究诸理之例，得彼类形，何事不成，何因不立？《周易》所谓“水流湿，火就燥，云从龙，风从虎”，圣人作而万物睹。此即理例相依也。若有水能与脂乳相共，相通入油，胶漆相须，雪霜同固，此则形类相取也。可不明白乎？

夫水银者，乃金之魂魄，本五金之精华，与铅同根，与水共体。若以五行相孕，金水相生，得气传华，方乃得成至药。将制水银，万变千通，世无比类。故《陶植篇》云：“金为水母，母隐子胎；水为金子，子隐母胞。水者金之子，子藏母腹。”此言金水自相含孕，蕴椟于母中。因造化而生，又子继父体，为母立兆基。此言砂产于金，汞流于子，以金养汞，继体而荣，道合自然，事归于至妙，不可不思也。

若用矾石之药，杂类之徒，则金体全乖，祖宗并失，还返无由而得，金水无由而生。可谓雀鸥同巢，鼠猫共穴，将胶补釜，以漆涂疮，徒然虚老百年，万无一得之也。古歌曰：
世人好假不好真，
竞将石药和水银。
姥女化归烟雾散，
曾青磁石自相亲。
炮矾胆绿倾家产，
多为疏狂枉作尘。
若遇神仙谈至理，
终知白首永无因。
此可知也。

且药石者，大约七十二件，多至一百余般。古之至人，尽辨酸咸苦涩，著其经论，或梼研使用，治世人之诸疾；或修炼合和，辟人间之邪珍，无关大事，得至长生。假饶别得玄方，穷极制度，亦是暂留髭发，岂能久固筋骸？世间迷昧之徒，嚣薄之辈，谬传方术，诬调神仙，矾石欲同铅汞，或以柳槌研合，或以桑叶相和，醋煮蜜蒸之时，不论遍数，水飞酒飞之日，动占时光。言固济则铁石非坚，说覆籍乃寻常莫匹，极至三年满足，一鼎灰尘。却云鹦犬来冲，致得龙蛇变去。殊不知己之非理，但将怨恨于真仙。如此之流，世问满目。

更有用尽寰中众石，海内诸矾，铜精、铁精、石绿、土绿，罄竭资金，皆无所就。情意稍迷，心神益乱，不信仙方宁远，岂知大道无烦？谓灵丹不在此问，言至药生于海外，便向波斯国内而求白矾紫矾，或向回纥域中寻访金刚玉屑。动经多岁，惑说万途，纵饶觅得将来，亦无用处。愁发因兹变白，苦心为此归泉。如此皆为不晓药之情性，不知药之类聚。且矾共石，不与金同；水银既是金魂，石药又如何入用？夫至药者，紫金，为五彩，成身成金，可因一体，五彩恰同五脏。又见古歌曰：
金可作，命可保；
金不作，徒自误。
此不虚传也。

大药既成，金液变体，元是水银，何用矾石之徒？此得形类相须。前云至理人不知之，上山求鱼，入海网兔，此则倒见，可不悲哉？

光玄曰：大药既是金液成形，矾石又不相入。切见世人多假五金为柜，伏制水银，亦是经岁经年，千机万巧，皆无所成，多是虚费工夫，是何理也？」

「The Master says: The Five Metals (五金) are mere material substances of the mortal world, fundamentally distinct from the True Elixir (至药). The *Huang Ya Pian* (黄芽篇) has already fully expounded upon this—you must carefully examine and study it.

Alchemy possesses profound and subtle Dao (道), as well as mysteries beyond measure, all of which must be orally transmitted from master to disciple before one can succeed in refining the elixir and attaining its essence. Observe how mortals blindly rely on superficial theories, rigidly adhering to ancient formulas, and recklessly manipulate mercury (水银), attempting to forge the True Elixir (至药). Yet they fail to grasp that the Five Phases (五行) interact like a woman bearing child—lead and mercury (铅汞) must complement each other, as the morning rooster nurtures its egg (若晨鸡之抱卵).

The most refined and wondrous Dao (道) is boundless in transformation, and even the slightest deviation disrupts its natural order. Hence, Tao Zhuang (陶植) of Wang Jiangnan (望江南) sings:
*"Still the elixir must be passed by hand,
Trusting old formulas will only mislead.
Upside-down, downside-up, confusion without end—
Do not blame the Dao/Way for your own folly."*

And the Bhagavān’s (菩萨) rhyme goes:
*"Every household has the elixir of longevity,
Yet mortals use it all with error and confusion.
Qi and climate (氣候) shift like clouds in flight—
Where, pray, might one find it in search?"

They gaze yet fail to recognize it,
Scrambling instead within lead’s embrace.
This substance lies not in *Huang Ya* (黄芽),
But in wasted years and hollow toil.

Upon closer reflection, this truth is indeed profound.

Light Xuan (光玄) says: The Master states that the Four Yellows and Eight Stones (四黄八石) lack any principle of the Great Dao (大道), and do not harmonize with mercury (水银). Moreover, when *Long Guang Huang* (龙光黄) is refined into a liquid, and mercury is immediately congealed into sand, what is the logic behind this?

The Master replies: You do not yet understand. Listen to my detailed explanation.

Mercury (水银) embodies the True Yin (正阴).
Sulfur (硫黄) is but a False Yang (假阳)—when True Yin is subjected to False Yang’s influence, its form may temporarily alter, but it will never endure. If True Yang (正阳) subjugates it, and the two remain inseparable from beginning to end, this is the great principle of Yin and Yang (阴阳).

Moreover, sulfur is the essence of alum (矾石), alum the vital fluid of iron (铁之津华), and magnetite (磁石) the mother of iron. When cinnabar (朱砂), magnetite, and sulfur are refined together, they instantly produce purple powder (紫粉)—this is a single process.

Though sulfur, as iron’s descendant (铁之孙胤), and mercury, as gold’s refined essence (金之精魂), may briefly unite, they ultimately cannot achieve true transformation.

Yet if one meticulously probes the path of Dao (道), the roots and origins will become clear.

Light Xuan (光玄) says: The Master’s words on alum (矾) reveal that it cannot subjugate mercury, nor does it share mercury’s nature. Yet I see that green vitriol (绿矾) and green salt (青盐) are combined to refine mercury, producing powder or frost—what is the reasoning here?

The Master replies: Mercury is the soul and spirit (魂魄) of gold (金). Green vitriol is the vital fluid of iron (铁之津华). In terms of the Five Metals (五金), their essences share a common origin, but when discussing lead and mercury (铅汞), iron and copper (铁铜) are distant relations.

Thus, even if green vitriol temporarily refines mercury into powder, upon further heating, it reverts to its original form—no true transformation is achieved, just as if no refinement had been done at all.

Light Xuan (光玄) says: If alum behaves this way, then why does green salt (青盐) join alum in refining mercury?

The Master replies: Salt has no affinity with mercury. It merely aids in coloration when alum refines mercury—its function is no other. Just as when sulfur is sublimated (飞烧), and salt is layered upon it, the resulting product is white; without salt, the color would not be white. This is but one example.

Such matters are trifling, unrelated to the Great Elixir (大丹). You need only investigate further to forever dispel your doubts.

Light Xuan (光玄) says: The Master’s teachings on the Five Phases (五行) and lead-mercury (铅汞) form the foundation of the Great Elixir (大丹). All alum and mineral medicines (矾石药) are irrelevant.

Upon deep comprehension of the True Dao (至真), one attains its grand principles. Yet I also observe how mortals amass and refine human urine (童便), repeatedly distilling and decanting it, or boiling and simmering it, then extracting its frost (霜) and purifying its dregs (滓), claiming this to be the essence of the Five Phases (五行) and the root of the True Elixir (至药). Some even consume it, or further refine it into mercury sand (砂汞)—what is the logic here?

The Master replies: This is the deluded folly of the ignorant. Urine is merely the waste product of human consumption—what else could it be? If there were a Dao of longevity and fortification, then daily meals would naturally prolong life, and why bother with refining and purifying dregs?

Those who practice refinement in vain believe this substance can extend life—how mistaken they are! Thus, the deluded fail to grasp the True Dao (至理). Even if they refine it, they produce nothing but powder and frost, identical to common salt (大共盐花一般). No true transformation into the Elixir is possible.

Investigate the True Dao (至理) deeply, and do not trust the common teachings. The Three Islands (三岛) are not distant, nor the Nine Heavens (九天) far away.

Light Xuan (光玄) says: I also see how mortals gather mulberry twig ash (桑柴灰) for refining, claiming it to be the foundation of the True Elixir (至药), and using it to process cinnabar (朱砂), mercury (水银), and realgar (曾青). When questioned on its origin, they say they found it in the *Yin Zhen Jun Ge* (阴真君歌), which states:
*"The Dragon dwells in the Shock position (震位), at sixty-four (六八),
Yet forty-eight (四十八) is where it resides—this is the mulberry (桑) character."*

They cite the verse:
*"Harvest before the silkworm’s meal begins,
Refine after the fire’s transformation."*

And they say that the tortoise of Fan Cao (樊曹) and Yuan Xu (元绪) descended from the sage’s essence (降圣人之质), making it the root of the Great Elixir (大药)—nothing else.

How does this principle work? I beg the Master to clarify once more.

The Master replies: The foundation of the Great Elixir (大丹) has been fully explained in previous chapters—there is no falsehood within it. Mulberry twig ash (桑柴灰) is but another fabrication of the ignorant, a tradition passed down by fools, with no substance at all.

Moreover, the *Yin Zhen Jun Ge* (阴真君歌) states:
*"The Dragon dwells in the Shock position (震位), at sixty-four (六八),
The Tiger’s number originates in the first palace (一宫)."*

Forty-eight (四十八) refers to the division of the Great Elixir (大药), as well as the name of its position in the formula—it is not the mulberry (桑) character.

The common folk fail to grasp this truth, mistakenly identifying it with mere emptiness, like deer chasing sunlight or monkeys seeking reflections in water. Ultimately, what will they gain? Their efforts are but wasted labor.

The Great Elixir (大药) is purely the Five Phases (五行)—no other elements are involved. Mixing alum and minerals only leads to further confusion.»

「The followers of the *Sang Zǐ* (桑紫) are clearly far astray. Hence the *Shēn Tóng Què* (参同契) says: *"The solitary hare does not suckle the horse, nor does the swallow yield the phoenix."* This is what I mean.

*Guāng Xuán* (光玄) remarked: *"I also see that many people take the smoke from calcined *áo tū* (鳌突), claiming it to be the utmost essence of wood, to be paired with the Green Dragon’s position. Then they cite the *Yuán Yáng Zǐ Gē* (元阳子歌): 'To recognize cinnabar as the essence of wood, bring it to the western position to join with metal.' The confused seekers, where do they find their Dragon and Tiger? Their bewildered inquiry is lost in the void. They speak of this as if it were true.*

*Guāng Xuán* further sought *Yōngzhōu* (墉州) well salt, some claiming it as the essence of *Tài Yīn* (太阴), paired as the White Tiger’s symbol. They cite the verse: *"Deer’s strength attaches at three mouths, forty times multiplied and guarded together. The central field nurtures eleven, cross-eyed below, surveying left and right."* They say this is the true Dao of Dragon and Tiger. How does this logic apply to the Great Elixir? I await your instruction.

The Master replied: *"The most true and wondrous Dao is not distant, yet people do not see it. The utter falsehoods are easy to discern, but the ignorant remain long in error. Thus, wisdom and folly oppose each other—jewel and stone are not equal. Truly lamentable, indeed worthy of pity."*

The Great Elixir (至药), being slippery and transformative, connects the celestial with the mundane, prolonging life and extending into immortality. Those who grasp it understand the Five Phases (五行) naturally; those who are lost remain forever suspended in confusion. Once the Golden Elixir (金丹) is perfected, poverty and illness are forever banished.

As for the smoke of calcined *áo tū* (鳌突) and its kind—these are but dead matter of the world, no different from broken tiles and rubble. Burn them, and no vital *mài* (脉) arises; refine them, and their essence is utterly consumed. What transformation could they achieve? How could they form the Great Elixir? The truth lies before us, yet people fail to see it.

Hence the *Yuán Yáng Zǐ Gē* (元阳子歌) states: *"True Dragon and true Tiger are true kin."* The essence of wood in the western position reveals the interplay of *Yīn* and *Yáng* nurturing each other—how could it refer to those who chase smoke and emptiness? *Yuán Yáng Zǐ* (元阳子) was a master of the Dao, not an ignorant scholar; how could he mislead the dull and obtuse with his words? Their falsehoods are indeed chaotic.

Dragon and Tiger are the very substance of the *Huán Dān* (还丹), the core of lead and mercury. All immortals recognize this, and the scriptures do not err. Hence the *Jīn Dān Míng* (金丹铭) proclaims: *"The true position of cinnabar is not red—it comes to the southern palace in all seasons, belonging to the southern *Yáng* (阳) *Bǐng Dīng* (丙丁) Fire. Thus its form is red. Extract the mercury from cinnabar’s water-silver, belonging to the central *Yīn* (阴) *Jiǎ Yǐ* (甲乙) Wood, and its form becomes the Green Dragon’s likeness. Black lead’s original nature is not black—it internally embraces *huái yù* (怀玉), containing the Five Virtues (五德), belonging to the northern *Yīn* (阴) *Rén Guǐ* (壬癸) Water. Its form is black. Extract the refined essence from lead’s *jīng qì* (精气), pairing it with the western *Yáng* (阳) *Gēng Xīn* (庚辛) Metal, and its form becomes white—the White Tiger’s symbol."*

Another verse states:
*"When the Five Phases (五行) do not follow their natural order, the Dragon emerges wrapped in Fire.
When the Five Phases are inverted through alchemy, the Tiger arises wrapped in Water."*

The *Jīn Dān Zhí Fù* (金丹职赋) further declares:
*"Fire, when bound and rotated, becomes the Dragon; Water, when turned westward, becomes the Tiger."*

And the *Lǐ Bǐng Chán Gē* (李柄蟾歌) says:
*"Tài Yīn* (太阴) resides in the southern palace, *Tài Yáng* (太阳) faces north. The Fire of Wood is called mercury; the Water of Metal is called lead.
When refined in the central palace’s vessel, their natures assist each other’s completion.
When *Yīn* departs, *Yáng* is revealed—the Dragon and Tiger serve as proof.
The numinous Elixir of Dragon and Tiger has its efficacy; how could the smoke-chasers or the *Xuán Jīng* (玄精) types compare to those who attain the Great Elixir?"*

Reflect again and again—there is no deviation. Do not trust the ignorant; their doubts obscure the true Dao.

*Guāng Xuán* (光玄) further said: *"The Master’s teachings on the Dao of *Huán Dān* (还丹) have fully illuminated the profound. I have heard that in the past, the King of Huái Nán (淮南王) refined *Qiū Shí* (秋石) and attained the Great Elixir, ascending to the heavens after ingestion. I do not know what *Qiū Shí* (秋石) is."*

*"Moreover, the *Dān Jīng* (丹经) often mentions the title *Shèng Wú Zhī* (圣无知), and the world claims it refers to green salt. I do not know if this is correct. I humbly pray the Master does not conceal the profound principles."*

The Master replied: *"The King of Huái Nán (淮南王), Líu Ān (刘安), refined *Qiū Shí* (秋石) to achieve the Great Elixir—there is no other Elixir. The same substance has many names. The Sage acts according to the times, just as this."*

「Lǜ Jīn Hǔ (绿金虎) is the original essence of the Elixir, its refined white form, belonging to the Western direction, governing autumn—hence its name. It is also of the same nature as *Huáng Yá* (黄芽, "Yellow Sprout") and *Hé Chē* (河车, "River Vehicle").

*The Shèng Wú Zhī* (圣无知) is likewise the core essence of the Elixir, the profound realm of lead and mercury. At the time when the Five Phases (五行) are subdued, it spontaneously generates flesh and bones; when all phenomena are encompassed, it nourishes the blood vessels entirely.

The Daoist seeks the True without knowing, the Sage contemplates it beyond reckoning—thus the name *Shèng Wú Zhī* (圣无知). It is no other path.

How could it be *qīng yán* (青盐, "green salt")? Such a claim is a delusion leading others astray.

*Guāng Xuán* (光玄) said: *"The Master’s teachings—when the medicine aligns with the Five Phases to form its body, encompassing all phenomena, lead and mercury interdependently, the Tiger and Dragon in mutual gestation—when ingested, it fortifies the five viscera and moistens the skin; when applied, it transmutes mercury into gold, restores poverty and benefits others. What is this principle called? It is named the Great Return-to-the-God Elixir (大还神丹).*

*What kind of Immortal knows this wondrous Dao? Who first discovered this marvelous method?*

The Master replied: *"Gold is the offspring of water, mercury its vital essence. Together, they form the root of the Five Phases, enduring countless ages yet unable to coalesce. There was *Líng Yáng Zǐ* (陵阳子), originally a true sage of the primordial era, a lofty figure of antiquity. He knew this root’s source and kept it as a secret wondrous method.

Thus, he paired the South with the North, the West with the East, harmonizing these four directions without deviating from the Central Dao. One year of refining fire, ten months of furnace operation, seven returns without loss, nine returns to full completion. When the Dragon ascends and its spirit returns, the Tiger submits and its essence is restored—hence the name *Zǐ Jīn* (紫金, "Purple Gold") for this wondrous technique, the Elixir of Seven Returns (七返神丹). This is what is meant.*

An ancient verse says:
*九还七返三五一，龙虎相交入神室。
灰池炎烁天地精，金液还丹功乃毕。*

*Guāng Xuán* (光玄) said: *"The Master has opened the celestial path, illuminated the profound gate, revealed the method of immortality and demonstrated the safeguard of longevity. He discerns truth from falsehood, right from wrong. Now, though I still have minor doubts, I must again seek clarification."*

The world sees many who seek only crude herbs,
binding mercury in haste—
*"The southern hills are not distant,"* they say,
*"nor the northern wastes far from home."*

They scour the earth for roots and shoots,
plucking fragrant branches in vain:
red *qín* and *wūjū* fill their baskets,
*zhāngliǔ* and *wǎsōng* overflow their chests.
Some boil with sesame oil for endless hours,
others crush *dìdǎn* to draw its natural juice.
They wash *tiángōngcǎo* clean of roots,
mix *rénxiàn* with *mǎxiàn* in equal measure,
combine *lóngdǎn* with *tùsī*—
yet before the powder forms,
they already dream of golden elixir.

Such fools are as ants in number,
squandering wealth, exhausting their spirits in folly,
yet when no result comes,
they rail at heaven and earth—
unaware how to proceed.

I beg the Master to clarify my confusion,
to dispel my ignorance,
lest I waste my life in vain.

The Master said:
*"Though all are human, wisdom varies as the clouds.
Some grasp truth in their hearts unseen,
while others, though it lies before them,
cannot see it—
like clouds that rise to heaven
or stones that sink to earth.
One cannot press clouds to stay,
nor lift stones to fly.
Fate is set; change is impossible.*

*"Yet mercury—
that borrowed *yin* essence,
the refined *xiǎnshuǐ* of the void—
takes ten thousand years to form,
its spirit bound to the five metals.
Heavy as gold, yet pure as jade,
untainted by dust—
why should it elude the eye?

*"But herbs?
Spring they sprout, summer they grow,
autumn they wither, winter they die.
Their stems are frail, their roots fleeting—
boiled, they turn to sludge;
burned, they crumble to ash.
To bind them with mercury?
Heaven and earth lie between—
fools who claim success,
deceiving the world with empty words.

*"Some say, *'In the north, the Three Sovereigns’ herbs grow,’*
others, *'In the south, Shu’s elixir thrives.’*
All false tales, spun from ignorance.
Passed down through ages, twisted beyond truth.
The wise see clearly;
the foolish remain lost."*

Guāng Xuán said:
*"By the Master’s words, my doubts dissolve—
the pine’s green now clear,
the jade’s form revealed.
Yet still I wonder:
Can herbs truly bind mercury?"*

The Master replied:
*"Tortoise hair grows long,
rabbit horns are fine—
yet both are myths."*

Guāng Xuán said:
*"If herbs cannot bind mercury,
then those who claim to transcend the world—
hermits who fast for years,
adepts who refine for decades—
whose names are recorded in the Celestial Register,
whose essence does not scatter in the Three Fields—
how do they achieve such power?
How do their elixirs work?
This is true within, manifest without—
a complete alchemical art.
Does it not prolong life?
Does it not transcend the world?

*"Yet common folk—
ignorant of the Dao,
unaware of true teachings—
greedy for gain,
obsessed with wealth,
they hoard jade to extend their years,
pile gold to preserve their beauty,
yet indulge in every pleasure,
dress in silks, feast without end.
Their orifices leak,
their Three Fields grow weak.
Even the Nine-Turn Elixir would fail them.
Pity them, if pity could reach them.

*"But follow my teachings,
and you shall grasp the Great Dao."*

Guāng Xuán said:
*"The Golden Flower’s path,
the Mystic Water’s gate—
those who attain it ride white deer to Kunlun,
drive green oxen toward the East.
They endure as heaven and earth,
witness the rivers’ changes.
How fortunate to meet such truth,
to learn from the genuine transmission!

*"The Master does not teach the ignorant,
nor err by a hair’s breadth.
Emperor Yán once received the True Text—
a debt of deepest gratitude.
The Celestial Sovereign’s birth of Xu Jié—
another boundless kindness.
I am overwhelmed, speechless with awe.

*"Now I would gather herbs,
prepare provisions,
and refine them here in this mountain.
But I fear the Master’s wisdom may differ.
I beg further instruction,
to follow your guidance."*

The Master said:
*"This wondrous Dao is rare in the world.
If you truly understand,
guard it as your life—
do not speak of it to the unworthy,
do not associate with those who do not know.
A single careless word,
a hint to the uninitiated,
will bring ruin to your seven generations,
and destroy yourself.

*"Keep this secret as you would treasure.
Though this mountain is a famous peak,
it lies near the capital,
where war now rages—
weapons shake the four seas,
the heartland is trampled.
This is a land of marching armies,
a refuge for the fleeing masses.
How could one refine the elixir here?
How dare one forge the divine pill?

*"Far beyond, in the lands of the *Hàoyuè*,
or in Jiang-Zhe’s blessed regions—
whether at Luofu, Maoling,
or Lushan, Tiāitái—
these places are now at peace,
sanctuaries of the sages.
Choose a hidden valley,
a sacred spot,
and there refine the Great Medicine,
forge the Golden Elixir.
You shall be free of calamity,
and surely ascend to heaven.

*"My words are true—
follow them without doubt."*

Guangxuan said: *"A humble disciple I am—
a mortal among the myriad things beyond the Two Principles,
my cultivation of qi still unrefined.
Often at the Three Fields,
I fail to encounter the Mysterious Pearl,
wasting countless years in vain.
Yet now, by fortune, I meet a True Sage—
my doubts dissolve as the Three Purity Paths open,
the alchemical work of the Golden Elixir fully revealed.
Your kindness is as deep as the Bohai’s depths,
your favor as heavy as the mountains.
I know not how to repay it.

The Master said: 'Your fate has brought you to me.
I possess profound mysteries—
all now entrusted to you.
I see the world’s affairs in turmoil,
men rushing along the Way,
unaware their bodies are but dew on a sphere,
yet greedy for honor and wealth.
They fail to grasp their fleeting lives,
only toiling for worldly survival.
Such fools—how I pity them!
You must record what I teach,
spread my transmission far and wide,
uplifting those with affinity,
guiding the multitude.
This is how you repay my kindness.
I ask no more.

But you must also cultivate with single-minded devotion,
ascend swiftly to the celestial paths.
The sun and moon within the jar are entirely transformed,
the cosmos in the cave is utterly distinct—
do not linger long in this mortal world,
lost in its fleeting glories.
Listen carefully, be vigilant,
and keep away from the unworthy."*

Guangxuan heard these words,
his tears flowing as he bowed twice,
standing aside.

The Master asked: *"Have you ever drunk the Mysterious Wine upon the seas?"*
Guangxuan replied: *"Never in my life."*

The Master then took a gourd from his bamboo staff
and instructed Guangxuan to draw water from the mountain stream.
Guangxuan descended, filled the gourd from the stone spring,
and presented it to the Master.
The Master took it, poured half onto the ground,
leaving only half.
He then took a single pill—
the size of a yellow soybean,
glowing red and violet—
and dropped it into the gourd.
He sealed it with a leaf,
sat upon a rock,
and after some time,
the gourd transformed into wine,
its red-violet fragrance unlike any mortal brew.
The Master drank first,
then commanded Guangxuan to finish it.
Upon drinking,
Guangxuan felt his spirit brighten,
his limbs relax beyond measure,
his body transcending the ordinary.

He bowed in gratitude,
then stood.

The Master said: *"The hour grows late.
Return to your lodging.
I am weary and will go to the rear mountain—
a grass hut near the southern peak,
by the water’s edge.
Come visit if you have time."*

Guangxuan said: *"If I have no other business,
may I escort you to your dwelling?"*

The Master replied: *"I am exhausted,
and you must be weary as well.
Go now and return tomorrow to seek me out."*

With that, he took his bamboo staff
and vanished southward,
his steps swift as flying clouds.
Though a path existed,
the Master seemed to traverse it like a cloud crossing a ridge—
gone in an instant.
Guangxuan gazed after him in longing,
then returned to the mountain temple,
sleepless through the night.

At dawn’s first light,
he sought the way once more,
but found no trace—
no path led south,
pine moss blotted out the sun,
the stream’s murmur mingled with the mournful cries of monkeys,
white clouds drifted with the crows,
and not a soul was seen.
Only the southern peak loomed empty before him.

Guangxuan knew the Master was no ordinary man,
nor of this mundane world.
He sighed repeatedly,
his sorrow beyond words.
He then returned to his lodging,
recorded the Master’s secret teachings,
and spread them among the world,
hoping those of like mind might ponder them deeply.

Thus ends the *Hundred Questions on Golden Elixir Alchemy*.
