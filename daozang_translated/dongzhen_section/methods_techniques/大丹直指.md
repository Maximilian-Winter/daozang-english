**Direct Pointers to the Great Elixir, Fascicle One, with Preface**
*By Qiu Chuji, the Perfected One of Long Spring, Master of Daoist Teachings*

The immortal scriptures say: "Observe the Dao of Heaven, grasp the movements of Heaven—this is perfection." To embody Heaven’s patterns and model oneself upon them is fitting.

Heaven and Earth originate from the Great Void as a single *qi*. When stillness reaches its extreme, it moves, transforming into two. The light and pure ascend, becoming yang and Heaven; the heavy and turbid descend, becoming yin and Earth. Once divided into two, they cannot remain still. Thus, Heaven’s *qi* first stirs, descending to merge with Earth’s *qi*, then rises again when it reaches its limit. Earth’s *qi*, inherently unable to ascend, is drawn upward by Heaven’s *qi* in their union, descending once more when it reaches its limit. This ceaseless mutual dependence between above and below gives rise to the myriad things. Heaven transforms into the sun, moon, and stars; Earth transforms into rivers, seas, and mountains—thereafter, the myriad things are born in succession. For the myriad things to come into being, they must receive the *qi* of yin-yang’s ascent and descent; to mature, they must be refined by the essence of the sun and moon.

The sun and moon follow fixed paths in their revolutions. Without the Central *Qi*, they cannot pivot or turn. The Central *Qi* resides where the Northern Dipper dwells. The handle of the Dipper, *Po Jun* (Breaking Army), is the Great Sage of the Central Heaven—not the north, but the celestial pivot that shifts with time, directing the sun, moon, and stars in their movements. As the *Dipper Classic* states: "Where the celestial pivot points, day and night revolve without cease."

Heaven and Earth’s ascent and descent, the sun and moon’s revolutions—none deviate from their appointed times, and thus the myriad things are transformed without end. For humans share the same endowment as Heaven and Earth. At the beginning, the two *qi* of father and mother unite, coalescing into a pearl. Within it lies a single point of primordial yang true *qi*, enveloped by essence and blood, connected to the mother’s life-stem. After conception, the mother senses the presence of this entity. With every inhalation and exhalation, her breath reaches it, merging with the original *qi* of the embryo. First, the two kidneys form, followed by the other viscera in succession, until the tenth month, when the fetus is complete and the *qi* is full.

Before birth, within the mother’s womb, the child’s hands cover its face, the nine orifices unopened. Nourished by the mother’s *qi*, it exists in a state of undifferentiated unity—this is the *qi* of the prior Heaven. Once the *qi* is full and spirit complete, the essence replete, the navel no longer receives the mother’s blood, and the life-stem detaches. The spirit and *qi* ascend, the head turns downward, and birth occurs. As soon as it leaves the womb, the hands open, the *qi* disperses through the nine orifices, and breath enters and exits through the mouth and nose—this is the *qi* of the posterior Heaven.

Within the navel, one *cun* and three *fen* deep, lies the primordial yang true *qi*, which has never been disturbed. Yet, forgetting its original face, one dissipates it over time, leading to illness, premature death, sorrow, thought, joy, anger, and fleeting pleasures. The navel, located at the center of the body, is known by many names: the Central Palace Life-Storehouse, the Chaos Spirit Chamber, the Yellow Court Cinnabar Field, the Spirit-*Qi* Cavity, the Returning Root Orifice, the Rebirth Pass, the Primal Chaos Orifice, the Hundred Meetings Cavity, the Gate of Life, the Supreme Unity Spirit Furnace, and the Original Face—its designations are numerous. This place contains the essence and marrow, connecting to the hundred vessels, nourishing the entire body. It is bare and unadorned, utterly unobstructed. Yet ordinary people cannot access it, for they are ensnared by the seven emotions and six desires, forgetting their original abode. Their breath reaches only the *Qi* Sea, which lies above in the diaphragm-lung palace.

Since the breath never reaches the Central Palace Life-Storehouse to connect with the original true *qi*, metal and wood remain isolated. How then can the dragon and tiger unite to generate purity? Moreover, they do not comprehend the mechanism of movement. As the *Yin Fu Jing* states: "Heaven unleashes its killing mechanism." How can the fluids circulate to refine spirit and form?

The heart pertains to fire and contains the essence of true yang, called *mercury*, the Wood Dragon. The kidneys pertain to water and contain the primordial yang true *qi*, called *lead*, the Metal Tiger. First, cause the *qi* of water and fire to interact above and below, ascending and descending in union. With intention, draw out the true essence and true *qi*, merging them in the Central Palace. Refine them with the fire of spirit, allowing the *qi* to circulate throughout the body. When the *qi* is full and the spirit robust, the Great Elixir coalesces. This not only extends life and enhances longevity; with concurrent cultivation of merit and practice, one may ascend to the rank of a sage.

The details are meticulously set forth below.

The *Diagram of the Five Phases Reversed and Dragon-Tiger Conjoined*—each person possesses it in full, every individual completes it perfectly.

The *Diagram of the Five Phases Reversed and the Celestial Fire Regimen*—Heaven and Earth ascend and descend, the sun and moon come and go, opening and closing, advancing and retreating, existing and perishing. The *Book of Changes* states: "To know advance and retreat, existence and perishing—is this not the mark of the sage?"

The *Oral Instructions and Diagram for the Five Phases Reversed and Dragon-Tiger Conjunction*:
The instructions say: The Dragon is the fluid of the heart, the *qi* of true yang above; restrain it so it does not rise out. When it meets the *qi* of the kidneys, they naturally unite. The Tiger is the true One Water within the *qi* of the kidneys; restrain it so it does not descend. When it meets the fluid of the heart, they naturally conjoin. When Dragon and Tiger unite, a grain like a millet seed is obtained. This method is called the Conjunction of Dragon and Tiger; through this alone, the medicinal substances are revealed.

The method of gathering the medicine: Many people practice at the hour of *zi*, when the *qi* of the kidneys arises, and at the hour of *wu*, when the fluid of the heart descends. If unoccupied, this is feasible; if preoccupied, the timing may pass, and the method remains unknown. The wonder of Heaven and Earth lies in this: when the *qi* of the kidneys ascends, it is *zi*; when the fluid of the heart descends, it is *wu*—this is not bound by fixed hours. For beginners, close the eyes and inwardly observe the Central Palace, cutting off thoughts and forgetting concerns, calming the mind. Fill the mouth with saliva, neither spitting nor swallowing, and thus partake in the work of the *daogui*. There are further oral instructions, which cannot be written here.

Gently draw in the body, without rising, sit upright with crossed legs, knees raised—not merely sitting as usual. The left hand cradles the external kidneys, the right hand covers the Gate of Life at the navel, sealing the mouth’s portal and opening the Celestial Gate of the nose—this is the Gate of the Mysterious Female. First, decisively sever the two, then draw in breath through the nose. The in-breath is absorption, rest, *yin*, water—it must enter softly, so no sound is heard within the nose. With intention, lightly guide it into the Central Palace, reaching the *weilü*, where one "fills the Chaotic Pool and splits open the Primordial Aperture." When the *qi* reaches its limit, it rises from the three barriers of the spine to the nose and is gently released. The out-breath is exhalation, dissolution, *yang*, fire—it must exit softly, so no sound is heard within the ears. Let the *qi* leave naturally, without the intention straying from the Central Palace.

Intention is nature, spirit, true earth, the Yellow Dame. The breath that enters the Central Palace meets and merges with the primordial yang true *qi*. As the scripture says: "Connect with the boundless *qi* of Heaven and Earth to extend the limited body of father and mother"—this is the union of Heaven and Earth in their virtue. Cause the *qi* of water and fire to ascend and descend, mutually dependent. The ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth are one and the same. Draw forth the true *qi* from the kidneys—lead, the Tiger—and the Wood fluid from the heart—mercury, the Dragon. Their conjunction and fusion in the Central Palace is called the Five Phases complete and harmonized as one family, naturally smooth and delightful. As the scripture says: "*Qi* entering the navel is breath; spirit entering *qi* is the embryo. When embryo and breath unite, it is called the Great One containing the true." This is the Conjunction of Dragon and Tiger, which is the medicinal substance. Once the medicine is present, like a mother with child, one senses something in the Central Palace—round and luminous, lively and vibrant. Then use the fire talisman to refine and cook it, so the medicine does not scatter.

In this method, one first feels dryness in the throat and senses the heart’s fluid; next, one feels tastelessness, like a mute eating tin—its flavor is indescribable. This is the union of *qi*, called conjunction. Each day, perform one union to obtain one thing, shaped like a millet seed, returning it to the Yellow Court. This alone can extend life and prolong years. If refined with the fire regimen, after three hundred days, it naturally coagulates into a form like a pellet, its color like a red tangerine, called the Inner Elixir—like a dragon with a pearl. A dragon with a pearl can ascend; a person with an Inner Elixir naturally attains immortality and avoids death.

The oral instructions say:
*Yin* has *yang* within, the intestines have *yin*,
Within *yin* and *yang*, seek again.
If students do not grasp the subtle principle,
They waste time in vain pursuit.

The *Explanation of the Fire Regimen for the Five Phases Reversed and Dragon-Tiger Conjunction*:
Master Huayang Shi Zhenren said: The kidneys are water. Within water, *qi* is born, called true fire. Within fire, the true One Water is hidden—this is the *yin* Tiger. The heart is fire. Within fire, fluid is born, called true water. Above water, the *qi* of true yang is concealed—this is the *yang* Dragon. Thus, Dragon and Tiger are not the images of liver and lungs but the true *yin* and *yang* of heart and kidneys. When these two substances merge as one, use intention, and it becomes the hour of *zi*. Naturally, it coagulates—know that the winter solstice is not confined to the hour of *zi*. Its form is the size of a millet seed; each day, one grain is obtained. Monks call it *śarīra*; Daoists name it the Mysterious Pearl. Each day, true *qi* increases by a *zhang*, extending life beyond measure. After three hundred days, the *qi* coagulates and the Elixir forms, shaped like a pellet, its color like a red tangerine—naturally, one attains immortality and avoids death.

The instructions say:
The Five Phases reversed guard the path,
The Dragon emerges from within fire.
The Five Phases do not proceed in order,
The Tiger is born within water.
The *yang* Dragon originally emerges from the *Li* Palace,
The *yin* Tiger returns from the *Kan* position.
When these two meet, it is the root of the Dao;
When the Five Directions are traversed, the Elixir is named.

**[The Cyclical Reversal of the Five Phases: Fire Timing and Celestial Circulation]**

Fire timing governs the movement of fire and the progression of stages. Fire is the heart, the spirit, the nature, *Li*, the sun, and intent. Before gathering the medicine at the moment when the two *qi* ascend and descend, if intent does not abide in the Central Palace, how can the medicine be stabilized? How can it be set in motion? The sage conceals and hides, drawing the fire of the sun into the inch of earth at the Central Palace. The hours of *xu* and *zi* are precisely intent. Spirit and nature are said to emerge and enter without fixed time, their direction unknown. As soon as the two *qi* ascend and descend to gather the medicine, fire is applied in the Central Palace according to the hour.

The timing of fire is likened to a grindstone: from without, it gathers years, months, days, and hours into the center. As the scripture says: *"The Dipper’s handle revolves through the celestial cycle; in man, it meets in the gathering of the drill."* It also says: *"If fire is applied for three thousand days, its wondrous use lies in a single hour."* The Central Palace corresponds to the Palace of *Zi*; intent directs the arising of a single *yang*. As the scripture says: *"The moon’s fullness depends on oral instruction; the hour of *zi* lies in secret transmission."* The two *qi* are like the moon’s two crescents—when the two half-moons unite, they become full. When intent reaches the Central Palace, it is the hour of *zi*.

The movement begins with the *Fu* hexagram, proceeding to the three *yang* of water and metal, where the two kidneys balance, warming the navel, corresponding to the *Tai* hexagram of earth and heaven. At this point, one must hold fast, free from all distraction and thought, for only then do Dragon and Tiger unite in mating. Gradually, *yang* *qi* rises upward, suffusing the entire body with warmth, corresponding to the *Qian* hexagram. The medicine pierces the crown, like wind and rain, like surging waves—when the medicine is ripe, it transforms into golden liquid, descending like a cool spring, corresponding to the *Shun* hexagram. As it gradually cools to balance, it corresponds to the *Pi* hexagram. When the fire of the Cinnabar Field wanes, it corresponds to the *Bo* hexagram—this completes one celestial cycle. This method is called the *Celestial Fire Timing*.

When applying it, slightly gather the body, gently contract the flanks and abdomen, and concentrate the breath. Weigh the dosage precisely, silently guiding the heart’s *qi* downward to the Cinnabar Field. The breath through the nose should be soft and continuous, as if present yet not forced. Intent should always abide in the Central Palace. Intent is the child of spirit; spirit is the mother of *qi*. Spirit directs *qi*, which naturally enters the *Weilü* point, passes through the three barriers of the spine, ascends to the *Niwan* point at the crown, enters *Kunlun*, and returns to the Cinnabar Field, circulating endlessly. The true *qi* of the north, the *qi* of the kidneys, is the River Chariot. As the saying goes: *"The River Chariot dares not pause even for a moment, carrying it to the peak of Kunlun."* The Central Palace is the mechanism of intent; when it touches the mechanism, the Celestial Pass responds—this is the secret movement of spirit.

The instructions say:
*When spirit enters *qi*, it forms the embryo;
When *qi* enters the navel, it becomes breath.*

Following this method at the proper time, the *qi* of the navel and abdomen gathers and naturally warms. If used to supplement deficiency and replenish *qi*:
- In spring, apply four *liang* of fire over three months;
- In summer, apply six *liang* of fire over three months;
- In autumn, apply eight *liang* of fire over three months;
- In winter, apply two *liang* of fire over three months.

If used to refine the mating of Dragon and Tiger:
- For the first hundred days, apply five *liang* of fire from *you* to *hai*;
- For the second hundred days, apply ten *liang* of fire from *shen* to *hai*;
- For the third hundred days, apply fifteen *liang* of fire from *wu* to *hai*.
After three hundred days, the fire is complete, the Elixir coagulates, and pure *yang* *qi* is born. One breath held while counting a hundred prayer beads equals one *zhu*; twenty-four *zhu* make one *liang*. Adjust the count of beads according to the time.

**Oral Instructions:**
*Contracting the flanks and guiding the heart is fire;
Holding saliva and drawing breath forms the Elixir.
If the adept fails to grasp these subtle principles,
A hundred years pass in vain.*

Initially, do not count the fire; after half a year, when the joints are unobstructed, begin counting the fire on the first day of the first month.

**Exegesis on the Cyclical Reversal of the Five Phases and Celestial Fire Timing**
Master Huayang Shi said: The heart is the ruler of the five *yang*; the kidneys are the ruler of the five *yin*. The five *yin* ascend as water; the five *yang* descend as fire. When employing the time of *Qian*, direct the heart’s *qi* downward into the Cinnabar Field—this is called *advancing fire*. If used to supplement deficiency and replenish *qi*, apply the regular count: one year’s practice seizes ten years’ *qi*, supplementing ten years of deficiency. When practicing the method of Dragon-Tiger mating at the time of the Earth Gate, the true *yin* and true *yang* of heart and kidneys coagulate into a millet-seed-sized grain, returning to the Yellow Court. Apply fire timing according to the fixed count, and after three hundred days, the inner refining of *yin* and *yang* fire naturally completes the celestial cycle.

The above method, without Dragon-Tiger mating or the alternation of upper and lower fire timing, is the peaceful and constant practice for ease and longevity. If Dragon-Tiger mating is combined with it, it becomes the fire of *refining the Elixir through addition and subtraction*: five *liang* refines essence into mercury, ten *liang* refines mercury into cinnabar, and fifteen *liang* refines cinnabar into the Elixir. After three hundred days of precise fire timing, the Elixir naturally forms, and pure *yang* *qi* is born.

Refining the five viscera is called *refining* *qi* *into spirit*; refining the four limbs is called *refining form and absorbing* *qi*. If the five viscera are not refined, nor the four limbs, yet the Elixir forms, one may still attain longevity. If form is refined, one becomes an *Earth Immortal*, with both form and spirit perfected. If *qi* is refined, one becomes a *Spirit Immortal*, shedding the husk to transcend the mundane.

The True Man said:
*Refine the body without mingling with yin ghosts;
Burn the Elixir without letting the Fire Dragon fly.
Fair maidens and handsome youths in their prime—
When blossoms fall at dusk, reunion is hard.
Do not avoid the master’s heartbreak;
When the time comes, seal the Yang Pass.*

Without practicing fire timing or inner refinement, this is a lesser method for peaceful longevity. When the three passes behind the back are open, it is called *the return of the Three Fields*. When the Five Phases are employed in the Central Palace, it is called *the reversal of the Five Phases*. Gradually entering the middle stage, one attains the Way of immortality and avoids death—this is called a *Land Immortal*. If transmitted to the unworthy, the sin extends to nine generations. Be cautious, be cautious.

**The Elbow-Behind Flying Golden Essence Formula and Diagram of the Three Fields’ Reversal**

This method is called *Elbow-Behind Flying Golden Essence*. The practice is performed between the hour of *zi* (11 PM–1 AM) and before the hour of *wu* (11 AM–1 PM), when qi is born. Don your robe, sit upright, clench your fists, and concentrate the spirit. First store, then ascend; first ascend, then recline.

Thrusting the chest and arching the spine opens the Middle Pass.
Sitting level and raising the head opens the Upper Pass.
First ascend, then store at the lower waist. Gradually lift the waist from the abdomen, raising the body while thrusting the chest and arching the spine—this opens the Lower Pass. Once qi becomes abundant below the Upper Pass, lift the waist, raise the body, and sit upright with a single thrust, passing through all Three Passes. This replenishes the brain’s marrow, naturally reddening the face, strengthening the bones, whitening the flesh, and lightening the body—it is the method of *rejuvenating the old and returning to youth*, the Way of immortality and avoiding death. The young who practice it will not age; the old who practice it will return to youth.

**Oral Formula:**
*Elbow-behind golden essence follows its sequence,
Store the body, recline and rise to pass the Three Passes.
If the adept grasps the subtle principle,
Rejuvenation and returning to youth will not be difficult.*

**Exegesis on the Three Fields’ Reversal and Elbow-Behind Flying Golden Essence Formula**

Master Huayang Shi said: At the hour of *zi*, the essential qi of the lungs gathers in the kidneys, called *Golden Essence*. Golden Essence is the undivided state of Metal and Water, where the qi of the lungs and kidneys merge as one. When applying this method, guide it from the *Weilü* Pass (Lower Pass) below the tailbone to the *Jiaji* Pass (Middle Pass), then from the Middle Pass to the *Yujing* Pass (Upper Pass). After sequentially opening the passes, thrust through all Three Passes in one motion, entering directly into the *Niwan* (Mud Pill Palace). This not only replenishes the brain’s deficiencies but also extends life, rejuvenates the old, and returns one to youth. Moreover, it draws the kidney’s qi without violating the *Yellow Court*. When the *Lower Fire* is refined to perfection, pure Yang qi is born.

For the elderly who are already frail, if they have previously cultivated inner work alongside this method, they must not practice this alone. It can restore youth, and within a hundred days, their face will redden, bones strengthen, qi flourish, and body lighten. If combined with *Dragon-Tiger Intercourse*, *Circulating Heaven Fire Timing*, and the three methods practiced together, it becomes *Withdrawing and Adding Lead and Mercury*, subtly extending life and increasing longevity.

The method of *Withdrawing and Adding* resembles the timing of *Gathering the Medicine* and *Circulating the Fire*. If demonic obstructions arise due to stray thoughts, one may fail to control the qi, causing it to descend and leak—this is perilous and requires *Withdrawing and Adding*. Exhaled qi is *Lead*, the qi of the kidneys. Inhaled qi is *Mercury*, the qi of the heart. When qi enters and lingers in the Central Palace, guide it with intention past the *Weilü* Pass, lift the body, arch the spine, and withdraw the external kidneys, causing qi to ascend from the *Weilü* through the *Jiaji* Double Passes, straight to the *Tianguan* (Heavenly Pass), entering the *Kunlun* (head). This prevents the Dragon from rushing upward and the Tiger from fleeing downward, halting stray thoughts. If the qi has not yet passed, recline and withdraw again until it does—this completes *Elbow-Behind Flying Golden Essence*.

At first, it is strenuous, but with time, it becomes effortless.

The True Man said:
*Atop the head, a toad-palace blossom,
Morning roams Peng Isle, evening returns home.
Able to ride the Qian horse, gallop the Dragon steed,
Skilled in driving the Kun ox, harnessing the Tiger chariot.*

He also said:
*Below Jade Capital Mountain, lambs contend,
By the Golden Water River, stone tigers sleep.
A golden needle lifts twin butterflies,
Spiraling, they fly to the King of Chu’s palace.*

Generally, the high takes the low as its foundation, the deep takes the shallow as its beginning. If one practices only *Dragon-Tiger Intercourse*, it merely supplements deficiency, benefits qi, quickens the blood, and nourishes the complexion. If one practices only *Fire Timing*, it only pleases the flesh and strengthens the sinews. If one practices only the *Flying Golden Essence* method, it only rejuvenates the old, strengthens the bones, and lightens the body. If all three formulas are practiced together, the benefits are profound.

For when Dragon and Tiger unite, a millet-like substance returns to the Yellow Court. Without *Fire Timing*, it cannot be refined and congealed. The *Circulating Heaven Fire Timing* merely gathers empty qi in the Cinnabar Field; without the *Dragon-Tiger Intercourse*’s Mysterious Pearl, it cannot be retained and stabilized. These two methods are mutually indispensable. When combined with the *Elbow-Behind* method, which draws kidney qi into the brain, it does not rely solely on the Yang within Yin, nor does it violate the pure Yang Elixir—it is the mystery within mystery, the subtlety within subtlety.

After a hundred days, sweet saliva fills the mouth, the body radiates divine light, bones strengthen, the complexion reddens, the flesh whitens, and the abdomen warms. After two hundred days, one gradually loses taste for meat and fish, constantly perceives rare fragrances, walks as if flying, and naturally sleeps less. After three hundred days, hunger and thirst cease, cold and heat are endured, saliva, sweat, tears, and nasal mucus vanish, and illnesses and calamities are eliminated. In stillness, distant music is heard; in seclusion, a red glow gradually appears. If such signs manifest, do not doubt—they are minor confirmations. Practice with utmost sincerity, and the divine marvels are beyond enumeration.

**Diagram of the Three Fields’ Reversal and Golden Liquid Returning Elixir Formula**

The lungs are the *Flowery Canopy*; the throat is the *Heavy Tower*; the mouth is the *Jade Pool* and *Dui Gate*; the nose is the *Heavenly Gate* and *Heavenly Pillar*; the space between the eyebrows is the *Jade Hall*; the forehead is the *Heavenly Court*; the crown is the *Heavenly Palace*; the ears are the *Twin Market Gates*.

Kidney qi transmits to liver qi; liver qi transmits to spleen qi; spleen qi transmits to lung qi; lung qi transmits to heart qi; heart qi transmits to spleen qi; spleen qi transmits to kidney qi—this is the *Five Phases’ Circulation*, called the *Lesser Returning Elixir*. Entering the Middle Field, the Middle Field entering the Lower Field, and the Three Fields’ reversal is the *Greater Returning Elixir*.

This method of *Golden Liquid Returning Elixir* requires lifting the waist, raising the body, and sitting upright. Close both ears tightly to prevent leakage, press the tongue against the upper palate, and let the clear, cool, fragrant, and sweet saliva be swallowed without rinsing.

The above *Elbow-Behind Flying Golden Essence* method sequentially opens the passes, culminating in a single thrust through the Three Passes, guiding the Golden Essence into the brain to replenish marrow and benefit qi, resulting in a reddened face, strengthened bones, tender complexion, and lightened body. Adhere strictly to the timing: lift the waist, sit level—neither raising nor reclining—and naturally feel the true qi enter the brain.

Swiftly press both palms tightly over the ears, allowing the kidney qi to naturally ascend into the brain for transformation, while the Golden Liquid descends like water trickling through ashes. Each day, conduct the *Descending Fire* once or twice—beware of excess or deficiency: too much fire causes headaches, too little prevents the Golden Essence from ascending. Proceed with caution, adjusting as needed. If the fire burns too fiercely, the entire body grows feverish; do not advance the fire further, lest the flames scorch the head and eyes, inflame the temples, or blister the mouth and tongue, thereby damaging the medicinal elixir. Instead, reduce the breath and intent, withdraw from the Central Palace, and let the fire follow its natural course—thus avoiding harm. Yet guard against stray thoughts or wayward imaginings; this is the time for *bathing*.

When the fire reaches the balance of Metal and Wood, poised between ascent and stagnation, between fulfillment and delay, hold fast to right mindfulness, allowing not a single thought to arise. Should a thought emerge, it is but dust and grime—dust being yin, and yin being demonic. Once obstructed by demons, the Three Passes close and cease to flow. Sever such thoughts at once, and the two qi will spontaneously unite to congeal the *Greater Elixir*.

The Master says: *"Wash away the dust and grime."*
The Dao says: *"Bathe the Golden Elixir."*
The *Awakening to Reality* states:
*"When Punishment and Virtue stand at the gate, the medicine awaits—*
*Here the Golden Elixir must be bathed."*
In the second month, as the three yin and three yang harmonize in warmth and flowers bloom, a sudden cold wind or rain may strike, preventing fruit from setting—this is *Virtue overshadowed by Punishment*, akin to demonic obstructions during practice. In the eighth month, as the three yin and three yang shift toward coolness and all things wither, a return of warmth may coax flowers to bloom anew—this is *Punishment tempered by Virtue*, like maintaining right mindfulness to restore yang harmony.

Thus, *"Bathing guards against peril, its subtlety lies in withdrawal and addition."* This is the oral instruction.

The *River Chariot* transports it into Kunlun—
the gates of the twin markets must be firmly sealed.
Strike the thunderous drum of roaring lightning,
then swiftly gather the sweet rain to sprinkle heaven and earth.

**The Oral Instructions on the Three Fields’ Reversion and the Golden Liquor’s Returned Elixir**
Master Huayang says: The preceding methods—Dragon-Tiger copulation, the Fire Times of the Microcosmic Orbit, and the single circulation of Flying Golden Essence behind the Elbow—are but techniques for peaceful longevity, extending life to two or three hundred years. Yet they remain within the cyclic transformations of the Five Phases’ generation and transmission. If the work is not amiss, they refine but a single qi.

This Golden Liquor Returned Elixir does more than replenish the brain and enrich the marrow. Through the withdrawal of lead and addition of mercury, one gradually regains the traces of youth, the brain solid and the marrow full. When the method is applied, the divine water naturally descends from above with a start, clear, congealed, and sweet. It flows back down from the lungs into the Yellow Court, and is called the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir. Just as the false yang of the two qi is pressed to transmute cinnabar into gold and called the Golden Elixir, so a single grain of this Golden Elixir can grant longevity, equaling heaven and earth in duration—thus it is called *internally perfected*.

If one has not first laid the foundation but seeks only the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir, attempting to obtain it without the proper method, the divine water will not descend. Even if one forces it, compelling the crown water to descend, it will lack the sweet, refreshing taste, leaving the brain depleted and inviting many ailments—offering no benefit to the practitioner.

**Signs of Progress in Practice**
At first, one gradually senses warmth in the Elixir Field and Yellow Court, with true qi ascending and the sound of wind and rain in the ears. Gradually, within the crown, there arises the chiming of zithers and jade, while in the Celestial Pond—within the cheek’s gate—golden liquor bubbles like frozen springs descending. It may flow over the face, or rise into the brain, or appear as dewdrops, or enter the mouth from the upper palate, its taste sweet and refreshing. Over time, the crown resounds with the music of reed pipes, lutes, zithers, and flutes, or the cries of cranes, gibbons, and cicadas, or the chime of bells—all manner of natural harmonies beyond compare.

At the outset, one may dream of thunderclaps, for the true qi has burst open the yang bone of the crown, opening the Nine Palaces. When the spirit first enters the Central Palace, it suddenly surges upward, causing alarm. In moments of seated stillness, one may feel a great presence leap up, but upon opening the eyes, nothing is there. This occurs when the yang spirit is not yet robust—take care not to be startled or disturbed. With time, as the spirit strengthens, there will be no more unpredictable appearances or vanishings, and transformations will be boundless. One will come to know this naturally.

In all perceptions, do not cling to appearances. Simply let things unfold naturally; if you cling to appearances, it is but illusion.

The Perfected One says:
*"The jade nectar, brewed, descends from heaven;*
*The divine medicine forms as the seas run dry.*
*Drink wine—let it be a hundred cups—*
*Roam east and west, your ladder and ferry."*

Since ancient times, the divine water has flowed from its lofty source,
rushing forth from the Yellow Court in an instant.

**The Five Qi’s Ascent to the Origin and the Diagram of the Great Yang’s Body-Refinement**
This is a perfected method for attaining immortality. It is so closely guarded that even father and son do not transmit it lightly. Should one carelessly reveal it or share it with those bound by oath, calamity and grave misfortune will surely follow. Beware.

This method is called *The Great Yang’s Body-Refinement*. It may be practiced at winter solstice when yang is born, or in any of the four seasons. Sit upright, lift the waist, remain motionless, close the eyes, and still the thoughts. Silently circulate the mother qi of the heart’s fire, which naturally fills the four limbs with qi until the body is forgotten. The breath through the nose becomes soft and continuous, effortlessly sustained.

Practice this whenever leisure allows in the four seasons. Sit upright without leaning, and the five qi of the Elixir Field will stir within. Remain centered and unmoving, and the five qi will surge forth in all directions.

The kidney’s true qi refines the bones, making the body light as a feather—one may ride the wind and command the mists.
The liver’s true qi refines the sinews, hardening them like jade—one may outrun a galloping horse.
The heart’s true qi refines the blood, turning it white as cream—one may endure all cold and heat.
The lung’s true qi refines the skin and flesh, making them lustrous as snow—one may change the bones and transform the form.
The spleen’s true qi refines the muscles, hardening them like stone—one may transmute qi into gold.

Once the Elixir is formed, the five qi ascend to the Origin, gathering without dispersing. Then, using the preceding method to transport them, they are conveyed internally to the five viscera and externally throughout the four limbs. The five qi refine the form, consolidating it without decay—this is called *the wondrous union of form and spirit*, equaling heaven in years.

**Oral Instructions**
*"Once the Elixir is perfected, the five qi naturally ascend;*
*Only when qi is true may the Original Spirit appear.*
*Refining the form and changing the bones—no ordinary guest—*
*One becomes a long-lived being beyond the mundane world."*

**The Oral Instructions on the Five Qi’s Ascent to the Origin and the Great Yang’s Body-Refinement**
The Perfected One says: When the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir transforms into gold, pure yang qi is born within it—this is *qi within qi*, already an earthbound immortal, whose lifespan may equal that of heaven and earth.

The ancient and modern Perfected Ones further raise the pure yang qi from the Elixir, ascending it into the four limbs—this is called *The Great Yang’s Body-Refinement*. The qi naturally transforms, and form and spirit become wondrously united. Following the five qi, one changes the bones and alters the countenance, becoming naturally resistant to cold and heat.

The once-withered and decrepit form is refined into uprightness; the once-wan and withered body is refined into rosy vitality. Not only does one reverse aging and return to youth, but the body becomes light and the bones strong—one may rise on the wind and stride through the mists. This is called *the Flying Immortal of the Southern Palace*, a feathered guest amidst the dust. Though one has not yet shed the shell to ascend as an immortal, one may already soar and roam freely, ranking above earthbound immortals and below divine immortals. All this is due to the five qi of the Elixir Field refining the form and pervading the four limbs.

The work of refining the form is no small matter.

The Perfected One says:
*"When the five steeds are unruly, metal and water are subdued;*
*A single dragon ever rides the fiery clouds in flight.*
*Roaming the world takes but half a day’s work—*
*No need to mount the phoenix or ride the dragon."*

When the five qi are unregulated, the Elixir is already formed;
when a single yang pervades externally, the fire flies lightly.

**The Diagram of the Three Fields’ Union and the Oral Instructions**
This is a perfected method for attaining immortality. When the divine water from the crown descends to the Elixir Field and the true qi ascends, it is called *Union Achieved*.

Striking once to penetrate the Three Passes and enter the brain is called *Flying Golden Essence Behind the Elbow*. This method is named *Water and Fire in Union Achieved*.

For this practice, use the middle hour of the yang period: sit upright, stretch the waist, strike once to penetrate the Three Passes, and close the ears. Divine water descends; stretch the waist, raise the abdomen, draw a long breath through the nose, and silently guide the heart-fire upward. At the moment of *Zhen* and *Gen*, strike once to penetrate the Three Passes, and golden essence enters the brain. When the count of supplementation is complete, the face reddens, the skin whitens like cream, and the body lightens. Only then may one strike once to penetrate the Three Passes, allowing golden essence to enter the crown. Tightly close both ears to prevent kidney qi from escaping, merging it with the celestial workings. Golden essence descends like ash being sprinkled, and from above, a cool, sweet flavor fills the upper palate. Divine water fills the mouth; if swallowed, it returns to the Yellow Court, called *Golden Liquid Returning Elixir*.

At this moment, when sweet water descends from the upper palate and is swallowed, stretch the waist, raise the abdomen, and silently guide the heart-fire to draw true qi from the Elixir Field upward. Simultaneously exhale through the nose, lifting true qi to fill the four limbs. Above, water; below, fire—they meet beneath the *Double Storeyed Tower*, called *Union Achieved*.

**Oral Instructions:**
Divine water from the crown enters the central source,
True yang within the Elixir returns to the upper field.
When water and fire unite in *Union Achieved*,
It ascends from the court to the Great Luo Heaven.

**Exegesis on the Union Achieved of the Three Fields’ Qi**
The Perfected One says:
*Earth’s Union Achieved is tile—tile lasts a thousand years.*
*Wood’s Union Achieved is charcoal—charcoal lasts a hundred years.*
*For humans to attain longevity, nothing surpasses the method of Union Achieved,*
*Which is the shared work of Returning Elixir and refining the form.*

*Golden Liquid Returning Elixir* transforms the Elixir into gold; *Great Yang Refining the Form* refines the body like jade. At the moment before the Returning Elixir fully returns, when the refined form is about to arise, water above and fire below meet beneath the *Double Storeyed Tower*—this is the time of *Union Achieved*. Use the hexagram *Earth-Heaven Peace*, which is the hour after *Zi*.

Each time, take one grain, shaped like a golden millet, and return it to the Yellow Court. Each grain generates a beam of golden light, which, when circulated outward, radiates through the skin and hair, filling the room with golden brilliance. This is not merely longevity without death but the moment to shed the mortal shell and ascend as an immortal.

The Perfected One says:
*The two luminaries forge a seven-jeweled palace,*
*A single channel flows into jade-like nectar.*
*When water and fire converge in mutual inquiry,*
*The hexagram transforms into Earth-Heaven Peace.*

Yin and yang ascend and descend in mutual complement,
Water and fire intertwine to enter the lower field.
When *Union Achieved* is flawless and true qi is full,
A single grain of golden elixir endures for ten thousand years.

The above methods—*Golden Liquid Returning Elixir*, *Great Yang Refining the Form*, and *Union Achieved of the Three Fields*—are the means to longevity without death, hence called *Middle Perfection Methods*. One must first achieve success in the *Lesser Perfection Methods*, then proceed without interruption. If practiced without error, verification will come swiftly.

If one skips the *Lesser Perfection Methods* and directly pursues *Middle Perfection* to seek longevity without death, not only will results be delayed, but effort and time will be wasted in vain. If, in *Returning Elixir*, divine water does not descend; in *Refining the Form*, elixir fire does not rise; or in *Union Achieved*, water and fire do not merge—one may falsely slander the immortals’ teachings, dismissing longevity as empty words. They fail to realize that their practice has exceeded proper bounds.

When dragon and tiger unite to form essence, and the fire phase is complete to form the Elixir, use golden essence to replenish brain depletion, allowing the Returning Elixir to transform into the Golden Elixir. Use elixir fire to refine the true body, and simultaneously practice the method of *Union Achieved*—nothing surpasses this goodness.

If one does not concurrently practice these six methods but hastily seeks to burn the Elixir into pure yang qi, refine qi into spirit, and swiftly refine the true numen of qi to merge spirit with the Dao—then *Golden Liquid Returning Elixir*, *Great Yang Refining the Form*, and *Union Achieved of the Three Fields* need not be practiced. These three oral instructions have been secretly transmitted by ancient and modern Perfected Ones across ten thousand kalpas.

The *Middle Perfection Methods*—*Returning Elixir*, *Refining the Form*, and *Union Achieved*—serve to preserve the form and dwell in the world. Without the Golden Elixir, one cannot extend years; without *Refining the Form*, one cannot transmute the bones; without *Union Achieved*, one cannot escape death. Moreover, without them, even a Perfected One may appear unsightly, a divine immortal may age and weaken, or one may alter the form while retaining a mundane appearance, or preserve mortal bones without *Union Achieved*. In the future, when shedding the shell and departing, the ascent of spirit will be delayed.

After *Returning Elixir*, *Refining the Form*, and *Union Achieved*, within one hundred days of quiescence, observe the four images circulating within; the five qi swirl in abundance. After two hundred days, the eyes perceive golden flowers, the body radiates a halo, blue qi emerges from the crown, and purple mist fills the room. After three hundred days, the spirit becomes numinous, foreknowing past and future events. True qi can dry external mercury, the body lightens to tread wind and mist, and the bones strengthen to rival heaven and earth. If one encounters these states, do not doubt—they are minor verifications. With sincere practice, the marvels are beyond enumeration.

*Great Elixir Direct Pointers, Scroll Two* begins.

**The Five Qi Ascending to the Origin and Refining Spirit into the Crown Diagram**
*By Qiu Chuji, the Perfected Master of the Long Spring Daoist Teaching*

This is the *Great Achievement Method*, wherein one discards the shell to ascend as an immortal. Should one speak of this to the unworthy, calamity will surely arise—guard your words well.

This method is called *Refining Qi to Become Spirit*. The practice employs the hours of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*.

- On *jia-yi* days, refine the liver;
- On *bing-ding* days, refine the heart;
- On *geng-xin* days, refine the lungs;
- On *ren-gui* days, refine the kidneys.
The spleen is not refined; its qi resides within the four viscera. On *wu-ji* days, no practice is undertaken. These are the days for refining the five viscera.

- On *jia-yi* days, practice at the *mao* hour;
- On *bing-ding* days, practice at the *wu* hour;
- On *geng-xin* days, practice at the *you* hour;
- On *ren-gui* days, practice at the *zi* hour.
These are the hours for refining the five viscera.

Following the prescribed times and methods, sit in seclusion within a quiet chamber. Light one stick of incense, and knock the teeth twenty-four times. Rise slightly and sit upright, inwardly observing the viscus being refined. Let the breath flow gently as if present; when stillness reaches its depth, qi arises, and when qi reaches its peak, spirit manifests. Though akin to a dream, it is not a dream—within darkness, spirit and qi ascend.

These days and hours must not be mistaken, for spirit follows the day, and true qi circulates with the time. Examine the day and scrutinize the hour. After one hundred days of refinement, qi becomes full and spirit manifests. When one is about to ascend as an immortal, this is not merely longevity without death.

**Oral Instructions:**
*Follow the day and hour without error,*
*The five spirits converge where the River Chariot stirs.*
*After the true image ascends to the Origin in stillness,*
*Beware lest yin demons spawn external deviance.*

**Exegesis on the Five Qi Ascending to the Origin and Refining Spirit into the Crown**

The Perfected One of Huayang said: With the pure yang qi of the elixir, refine the liver according to the day and hour. After twenty-four days, the green qi appears; after twenty days, the yang spirit emerges of itself. Qi is the body of spirit, and spirit is the master of qi. The same applies to refining the heart, kidneys, liver, and lungs. The spleen’s spirit and qi, following the true qi of the four seasons, also ascend together.

Inwardly observe in stillness: within the crucible, mountains and rivers exist apart, and forms take shape. The two flavors separate like a fetus. Guard against yin ghosts and external demons, the seven *po* and three corpses that follow, mingling with the celestial true to disrupt the yang spirit, preventing its ascent into the celestial palace.

There is a method of *inward observation to ignite the fire*: refine qi so that it gathers into spirit. The timing must not be mistaken. Naturally, qi manifests and spirit emerges. The true qi of the five directions converges, and the yang spirit of the five original colors appears. The true form ascends into the inner court of the celestial palace—this is the moment of *uniting spirit with the Dao*.

If one practices the fire times for three hundred days, without refining the Returning Elixir, without refining the form, and without achieving union, yet follows this method—using the pure yang qi within the elixir to refine the five viscera according to the transmitted qi of the day and hour—this is also a swift path, called *Seizing Merit and Merging Methods*.

If one wishes to remain in the world and attain longevity without death, one should employ the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir, the Solar Refining of the Form, and the Union of the Three Fields.

The Perfected One said:
*On the Three Isles, purple mist veils the phoenix’s splendor;*
*In the nine heavens, the red sun refines the dragon’s essence.*

The *Central Yellow Scripture* states:
- The liver arises in the east; its color is green. When refined, green qi emerges from the body and soars.
- The kidney water lies in the north; its color is black. When refined in due time, black qi stands forth from the body.
When pure yang qi fills the five viscera, the spirit ascends in its original color into the celestial palace.

**The Inward Observation to Ignite Fire and Refine Spirit to Merge with the Dao Diagram**
This pertains to the *Great Achievement Method*, transcending the few to enter sagehood.

The pure yang qi of the elixir is raised into the four limbs—this is called *Burning the Body*. It enters the five viscera—this is called *Refining Spirit to Exit the Body*. It descends demons into the crown—this is called *Discarding the Shell*.

This oral instruction is called *Inward Observation to Ignite Fire*, and it has no fixed time. Whenever one has leisure, raise the intention and practice slightly. Sit in stillness all day, inwardly guarding spirit and awareness, with undivided focus. Always rise slightly and sit upright, silently observing the five viscera. Distinguish only between true and false, lest yin demons disrupt the true.

**The Method of Inward Observation:**
Simply sit in stillness, rise slightly, and raise the pure yang qi of the elixir. Refine the five viscera inwardly so that qi adheres to the spirit’s image and ascends into the crown. Refine the four limbs outwardly so that qi bursts forth as golden light, and the spirit exits the body. Before long, spirit merges with the Dao, and one discards the shell to ascend as an immortal.

Guard against yin ghosts, external demons, the three corpses, and seven *po*, which assume false forms to disrupt the celestial true, mingling with the yang spirit and preventing union with the Dao. Thus, regardless of day or night, constantly follow the qi’s movement:
- At the *mao* hour, observe the liver; liver qi appears green.
- At the *wu* hour, observe the heart; heart qi appears red.
- At the *you* hour, observe the lungs; lung qi appears white.
- At the *zi* hour, observe the kidneys; kidney qi appears black.

When the five-colored qi emerges, the true realm within the crucible differs from the mundane world. Chariots and regalia surpass even those of kings. Do not weary of rising slightly to ignite the fire—true and false naturally diverge.

**Oral Instructions:**
*Banners and regalia everywhere the same,*
*Within the crucible, images fill the space.*
*Again and again, kindle the fire that burns the body,*
*As clarion pipes and reeds ascend to the upper palace.*

**Exegesis on Inward Observation to Ignite Fire and Refine Spirit to Merge with the Dao**

The Perfected One said: Refining qi is easy; igniting the fire is difficult. Silently move the pure yang qi within the elixir, refining the five viscera according to the day and hour. When qi is true, it manifests of itself; when spirit is true, it emerges of itself. They ascend together into the celestial palace.

Guard against yin ghosts and external demons that disrupt the true with the false. At this time, qi follows spirit in ascent, and spirit adheres to qi in rising, moving from the middle field to the upper field. Yin ghosts wish for swift aging; external demons dislike human tranquility. They falsely assemble ranks, vainly stir splendor, and arrogantly mingle with the yang spirit, ascending together. Which is the true image? Which the false form? Mingled, they are hard to distinguish.

Pipes and reeds surround, chariots and horses arise. To discern them, nothing surpasses frequently igniting the true fire within the elixir.

One day to immolate the body, two days to subdue demons, three days to expel the Three Corpses, four days to dispel the Seven Po, and five days to gather the yang spirit. In quiescent inner contemplation, clarity arises naturally, revealing only a blazing fire where figures intermingle. After a brief moment, those from whom songs and music ascend are one’s own yang spirit; those who depart with wailing are the yin ghosts within the body. Soon the fire subsides, and within the crucible all is pure and still—this achievement must not be repeated.

Take heed, for the Ten Demons may yet return. For yin ghosts and external demons often craftily contrive karmic conditions to disrupt the true spirit; in inner contemplation, one must discern them clearly.

**The Ten Demon Lords:**
1. Should sounds of pipes and reeds fill the ears, fragrant blossoms meet the eye, sweet flavors linger on the tongue, rare perfumes assail the nose, and the heart feel ease while the spirit soars—if one cannot perceive this as illusion, recognize it as the **Demon of the Six Desires**.
2. Should gentle breezes ripple, warm sunlight linger, sudden thunder crash, lightning flash, songs resound, or sorrowful weeping arise—if one cannot perceive this as illusion, recognize it as the **Demon of the Seven Emotions**.
3. Should jade towers and ornate chambers appear, with pearl curtains, kingfisher canopies, towering halls, and carved walls, pearls strewn upon the ground and gold and jade filling the halls—if one cannot perceive this as illusion, recognize it as the **Demon of Wealth**.
4. Should one rise as a general or minister, wielding power across the eight directions, with resplendent carriages and robes, envoys bearing banners, a household clad in purple, and boots and tablets filling the hall—if one cannot perceive this as illusion, recognize it as the **Demon of Rank**.
5. Should children fall ill, parents pass away, siblings scatter, spouses part, kin suffer hardship, and relatives endure calamity—if one cannot perceive this as illusion, recognize it as the **Demon of Attachment**.
6. Should one be consumed by fire, plunge from a cliff, face execution, perish by poison, encounter inescapable peril, or be mauled by beasts—if one cannot perceive this as illusion, recognize it as the **Demon of Disaster**.
7. Should clouds of soldiers and horses gather, blades gleam like frost, spears and halberds rise, bows and crossbows draw, and fierce warriors advance to slay—if one cannot perceive this as illusion, recognize it as the **Demon of Warfare**.
8. Should the Three Pure Ones, the Jade Emperor, the Ten Grounds, the Four Saints, the Nine Luminaries, the Five Emperors, and the Three Officials appear, with their majestic processions circling in flight—if one cannot perceive this as illusion, recognize it as the **Demon of Sages and Worthies**.
9. Should jade maidens and fairy consorts array themselves in ranks, with pipes and songs resounding, dancing in rainbow skirts, and crimson sleeves offering golden goblets—if one cannot perceive this as illusion, recognize it as the **Demon of Music and Pleasure**.
10. Should many beauties of extraordinary charm appear, with fragrant allure, night feasts in orchid pavilions, bodies clad in sheer silk, and coy embraces seeking union—if one cannot perceive this as illusion, recognize it as the **Demon of Female Allure**.

Generally, those who cultivate purity and delight in stillness may, upon suddenly encountering splendor, mistake it for reality and remain bound to the mortal frame. Thus trapped in the dark crossroads, they become but earthbound immortals, unable to transcend the mundane and enter sagehood. Yet if one recognizes only what lies before them and rejects external illusions, the Dao may be advanced, and success gradually attained.

If the adept fails to refine the five viscera with the pure yang qi of the elixir during inner contemplation, the five qi and true spirits manifest in five colors, while pipes and reeds play in unison, and processions ascend together. At that moment, yin ghosts and external demons, with their false semblances, mingle and enter the celestial palace. Swiftly ignite the fire within the body: amid the flames, the two armies scatter with wailing, fleeing in all directions, while songs and music grow ever louder. Lofty mountains appear, and as the fire passes, in the cool stillness, landscapes become resplendent. Within, the heavens and earth grow bright—this is the true realm within the crucible. Yet one must not assume all is settled, for the Ten Demons may yet return.

At this time, one is neither dreaming nor awake, neither drunk nor sober. The five true spirits have entered the celestial palace. The four great elements of the central realm govern a heart that is balanced and upright. In this state of reverie, one must not mistake thieves for kin or falsehood for truth. Failure to do so not only keeps one bound to the mortal frame but may also lead into depravity—some fall into wind madness, others into wild delusion, their spirit and qi depleted, their wisdom diminished. Alas, how tragic! Thus the demonic realms are described in detail here. Igniting the fire within the body must be repeated without wearying. Constantly engage in inner contemplation, day and night, until the fire arises.

Between heaven and earth, nothing remains. Gazing upward, only the sky is seen; gazing downward, only the earth. In all four directions, nothing exists. In stillness, music may sometimes be heard, and suddenly rare fragrances arise—these are signs of the present moment, unlike before. The limbs often feel as though ascending like dragons, for this is the time when the immortal sheds the husk.

Before one sits in meditation, a red light appears, shaped like a lotus. The entire body is suffused with true qi, golden in hue. The five phases’ true qi merge into essence, qi, and spirit; the three treasures of the Three Powers unite into the natural Dao. Gathering the spirit once more into the Yellow Court ensures eternal life, free from death. Wherever one goes, yin spirits manifest, riding the wind and treading the clouds, journeying through the dusty world without hunger, thirst, cold, or heat.

If the spirit ascends once more into the celestial palace and the spirit is refined to leave the husk, this is called the **True Person Shedding the Husk**. A hundred days in the mountains, and jade is born within the mountains as the husk is shed; a hundred days in the waters, and jade is born within the waters as the husk is shed. When the true body emerges, this is called the **Immortal**. Returning to the Three Isles, one is no longer within the world of dust. This is the **Shedding of the Husk and Ascension to Immortality**, with its five secrets recorded here.

**Illustration of the Secrets for Shedding the Husk and Ascending to Immortality to Transcend the Mundane and Enter Sagehood**
This method is called **Refining the Form to Merge with the Dao and Shedding the Husk to Ascend as an Immortal**. It is timeless, yet its subtleties comprise five techniques. Master Sea Toad, in stillness, likened the true nature to a crane soaring through the Celestial Gate, emerging beyond the body—naturally, a body exists outside the body.

Master Wang of the Twelve Perfected Ones of the Western Mountains said: In stillness, the flower-tree emerges; gazing back upon the flower-tree, one does not lose one’s original nature. Once emerged, naturally, a form divides beyond the body. The Yellow Emperor, in stillness, released the Fire Dragon, which leapt upward—naturally, a body existed beyond the body, called the **Pure and Tranquil Dharmakāya**. The Two Perfected Ones, Zhong and Lü, both employed the Crimson Tower in stillness, ascending its three tiers step by step before leaping forth—naturally, the husk was shed.

The above methods of **Refining the Spirit to Merge with the Dao and Shedding the Husk to Ascend as an Immortal** yield results as a matter of course. When Buddhist monks enter samādhi and sit to transform, or Daoist adepts enter stillness to release their yin spirits, these are but **ethereal ghosts**, not **pure yang immortals**. Though treasured as formless, they ultimately have no destination—how mistaken are the learners!

Little do they know that only by **refining essence into the elixir** does the **pure yang qi** arise; only by **refining qi into spirit** does the **true numinous immortal** emerge, transcending the mundane to enter sagehood. **Shedding the husk to ascend as an immortal** is the method by which one daily transcends myriad kalpas—an unchanging law of immortality.

**Oral Instructions:**
When the work is complete, you must exit the **Divine Capital**;
Amidst the inner court’s splendor, do not let the self be burdened.
Master the five immortals’ secrets of transcendence,
And refine the immortal’s frame to rise beyond the dust.

**Exposition on the Secrets of Shedding the Husk to Ascend as an Immortal and Transcend the Mundane to Enter Sagehood**

The Perfected One said: Those who cultivate the Dao, once their work reaches the stage of **refining qi into form**, do not wish for long life in the world but hasten to **inwardly observe and refine the spirit to merge with the Dao**. When demons are subdued, they scatter; when the spirit is refined, it gathers. If one hesitates and does not sever the bonds of habit, failing to shed the mortal husk, one remains trapped in the **dim crossroads**, no more than a **land-bound immortal**.

Generally, to have a body is to have afflictions; to be without attachments is to be without burdens. From ancient times to the present, all speak of diligence—when the work reaches **non-action**, how can one cling to the body and refuse to emerge? Thus, **shedding the husk to ascend as an immortal** means **exiting through the crown to refine the spirit**, transcending the mundane to become an immortal.

Yet worldly people, lacking skill in cultivation, believe that merely shedding the husk will make them immortals—how grievously they err! Seated in a secluded chamber, cutting off thoughts and forgetting reflection, with no external states entering and no internal states departing, the **form** becomes like withered wood, the **mind** like dead ashes. The spirit guards within, the intent undivided. In samādhi, the **yin spirit** emerges—dim and formless. This is not a **pure yang immortal**. Even if one succeeds in shedding the husk, how arduous it is!

From ancient times to the present, all the highest Perfected Ones have transmitted the method of **shedding the husk**—truly, it is not difficult. When the work is complete, the **inner elixir** is accomplished, the **pure yang qi** arises, and the **original numinous spirit** manifests. Through inward observation and recognition, one sheds the husk and transcends. Step by step, as required, one naturally transforms into a **Fire Dragon** and exits through the crown, a body existing beyond the body—no different from before.

First, one step, then two; next, three *li* or five *li*. With no deviation in coming and going, no fear in movement, one may then entrust the husk to the mountains and rivers, forever dwelling as a herald of Penglai. This **shedding of the husk** depends entirely on the verification of prior work, with no misstep in sequence—naturally, one becomes an immortal, **ascending the spirit through the crown**.

Yet the highest Perfected Ones have left these several methods to regulate entry and exit, for learners, long subjected to toil, practice day and night without cease. Inwardly observing the spirit’s gathering, they may mistake demonic states for the path, straying into heterodoxy and wasting their efforts, squandering prior merit. Thus, the demons are described in exhaustive detail.

Moreover, when the work is complete and the learner inwardly observes the scattering of demons and the gathering of the spirit, ascending to the Celestial Palace where splendor exceeds the world a myriadfold, they may yet mistake this for the immortal realm. Thus, the secrets of **shedding the husk** are reiterated. Shedding the husk is not difficult—only when the work is complete does it occur naturally. Therefore, the instructions include the **flower-tree and black canopy** to recall the original body and summon the spirit back into the husk, and the **crane’s ascent and dragon’s leap** to elevate the yang spirit, allowing the spirit to exit the body and **shed the husk to ascend as an immortal**.

Among the highest Perfected Ones of ancient and modern times, those who lightly transmit these methods without secrecy condemn their nine generations of ancestors to hell. For those who cultivate the Dao, when the work is complete, they must ascend—there is no alternative.

Let ancient and modern disciples take heed. The secret of the Golden Elixir lies solely in the one **nature** and the one **life-destiny**. **Nature** is Heaven, ever concealed within the crown; **life-destiny** is Earth, ever concealed within the navel. The crown is the root of nature; the navel is the stem of life-destiny. One root, one stem—these are the primal forces of Heaven and Earth, the ancestral origin, the Yellow Court below the navel. The Court ever guards the crown and the navel, forming the **Threefold Refinement**. As the *Huangting* states: *"The zither-heart in threefold refinement dances the immortal embryo"*—this is the way. The zither is chosen for its harmony.

When a person is born, the placenta knots at the navel, linked to the mother’s heart-palace. Once the umbilical cord is severed, what remains is called the stem—the stem of life-destiny. The root is the root of nature. Yet lest the secret be divulged, it is given a thousand names, ten thousand forms, and myriad guises.

Thus, nature within the crown is called **lead**, the **tiger**, **water**, **metal**, the **sun**, **intent**, **Kan**, **Kun**, **wu-earth**, the **maiden of alchemy**, the **Jade Pass**. Life-destiny within the navel is called **mercury**, the **dragon**, **fire**, the **root**, the **moon**, the **corporeal soul**, **Li**, **Qian**, **ji-earth**, the **infant**, the **Golden Terrace**. The crown is **wu-earth**; the navel is **ji-earth**. These two earths form the character *gui* (圭), hence Lü Dongbin’s sobriquet, **Knife and Measure**.

In truth, it is only these two things—nature and life-destiny. Though ten thousand scriptures expound upon them, this alone is the essence. Herein lies the method.

At daybreak until dusk is daytime; from dusk until the final watch of the night is nighttime. Whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, during the day one practices the Way of life-destiny centered at the navel, and at night the Way of nature rooted in the crown. This is done at all times—neither too early nor too late, neither hungry nor full—without cease. After one hundred days, the elixir congeals; after three hundred days, the elixir is complete; after three years, the immortal embryo is formed. Naturally, the yang spirit exits and enters through the crown, coming and going without obstruction—this is the wonder of the true elixir.

**Method of Practice:**
For the daytime practice of life-destiny: simply rub the hands together until warm, then cup them over the navel wheel, focusing the intent solely there. Guard the navel wheel, without thought or distraction, in stillness. One will feel the divine water descend to the navel as the true fire stirs, leaping from the cinnabar field below the navel straight to the crown. Let it proceed naturally, without counting repetitions, maintaining single-minded focus on the navel wheel. When one wishes to rest or pause, do so freely. With time, the cinnabar field will blaze like fire, the spirit will flourish in beauty, and the numinous wonder will be indescribable.

For the nighttime practice of nature’s root: press the tongue against the upper palate, gradually sealing the two apertures of the throat, focusing the intent solely on the crown. Without thought or distraction, remain still. One will feel the true fire surge upward from below, leaping straight to the crown. When one wishes to rest or pause, do so freely. With time, the crown will gradually resound with the distant music of immortals, true fragrance will arise within the nose, and the numinous wonder will be indescribable.

Herein lies the secret of the golden elixir.

**Seated Practice Formula:**
One inhalation draws primordial essence upward,
Two exhalations open the Mysterious Gate at the crown.
Fools do not recognize the true dragon and tiger,
And vainly guess within the cinnabar field.

Profound principle.

Mid-year selects the month, mid-month selects the day, mid-day selects the hour. Guard against perilous constellations: when the lunar mansion is in *Wei*, begin firing at dusk; when in *Dou*, advance the fire at dawn. Accumulate essence, and within essence, qi—when the first yang stirs, this is the *zi* hour. At this moment, the Dipper’s handle has just turned: this is the true *zi* hour. Another method: in the ninth month, begin the sequence from the *zi* hour; count past *zi*, and the ninth month becomes the *zi* hour—this is the correct *zi* hour. At this time, both nostrils breathe qi.

The Golden Lord and the Radiant Maiden are the encircling *Kan* and *Li*, corresponding to the Frost Descent in the ninth month and the Winter Solstice in the eleventh month.

**Subtle Principle:**
Each month, constantly add *Xu*,
At every hour, observe *Po Jun*.
Heaven presents an additional position,
But the living luminaries are not transmitted to others.

Qi does not escape the throat. The Mysterious Pass lies one *cun* and three *fen* within the navel. The primal qi of father and mother is called the cauldron, and the two kidneys are its legs. When the fire phase is activated, the heart engages in work—this is the ignition of fire. When tiger and dragon intertwine, the medicine is the *daogui*. The *Xun* wind honors the key; stirring the Flowery Chamber is the advancement and withdrawal of fire.

Guard against danger and peril: the *mao* and *you* hours, the precelestial *chou* hour, the postcelestial hour of one’s birth, and the hour of longevity. The transformation of the spiritual embryo is achieved by using one’s own life destiny to calculate the four seasons’ hours of longevity. This method completes one celestial revolution in a year, one in a day. A day consists of day and night, using the *zi* and *wu* hours, the hour of birth, and the hour of longevity as safeguards. Together, these are seven hours. Five hundred and sixty hours make one phase, involving gentle nurturing, bathing, life and death, and wild battles. The transformation of the embryo occurs within this process. Guard this secret and do not recklessly disclose it.

Those who casually speak of heaven’s mechanisms
Can only rave, not truly know.
The world’s multitude lacks discernment—
Even when encountering truth, they deny its teachings.
