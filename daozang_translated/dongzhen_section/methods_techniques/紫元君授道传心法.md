**The Purple Primordial Sovereign’s Transmission of the Dao: Heart-Method Teachings**
*Commentary by the Perfected One of Longevity and Yin*

The *Purple Primordial Sovereign’s Transmission of the Dao: Heart-Method Teachings* is traditionally attributed to the Perfected One of Longevity and Yin. It is suspected that this text emerged during the Tang dynasty. Comprising one scroll, the present edition is derived from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, under the "Methods" category of the *Compendium of Cavernous Truth*.

To transmit the Dao, first transmit the heart. When the heart is true, the Dao is undivided; when the heart is false, the Dao is not authentic. The will governs the qi within the heart, and when the qi is perfected within, errors naturally align. If one’s nature lacks constancy, qi arises from the heart—thus, the transmission of the Dao rests in the master’s heart. To receive the Dao’s heart is to bend and conform, yet if the heart does not attain it, how can the master’s heart be without duality? The primordial heart is undivided.

The heart is offered to the master first; if one’s words betray the master’s teachings, they will not attain it. In practice, first observe the heart—if the heart is empty, action will not attain it, and the master’s heart will perceive the error. Words arise from the absence of heart; to study the Dao, first refine the heart. If one’s own heart is not true, the oral transmission of the Dao becomes mere empty talk, deceiving others and oneself. The heart’s original nature turns toward the West, yet the Dao’s heart remains unchanged. In all matters, it is thus: to serve the master, first serve emptiness. To receive instruction is like floating clouds—spending the day in vain delusion, never escaping the realm of birth and death.

The *Purple Primordial Sovereign’s Transmission of the Dao: Heart-Method Teachings* laments the error of a scattered heart. The Dao must reside in the heart; the heart and mouth must not be divided. Guard your heart well, and the gate of the Dao will naturally arrive. If your heart drifts idly, who will willingly follow it? It is like a person employing three masters—where masters multiply, demonic forces arise. A true master does not leave the gate; false masters invite household spirits to chaos. From this, the heart is troubled, and the affairs of the Dao are lost.

Fools deceive the wise-hearted; the common eye deludes the wise eye. The teachings of the Perfected are profound, yet the Dao is never far. To transmit the teachings, first transmit the heart. Daoists, let not your hearts scatter. Though a thousand sayings and ten thousand repetitions be spoken, the true Dao has but one gate. This one gate mirrors the Three Powers; the Three Powers give rise to the Three Elixirs; the Three Elixirs descend from the Three Sovereigns; the Three Sovereigns emerge from the primordial chaos.

From chaos, Heaven and Earth were born; Heaven and Earth arrayed the Four Poles. The Four Poles gave rise to creation; creation gave rise to the myriad forms; the myriad forms gave rise to the myriad things; the myriad things gave rise to the one gate—this one gate resides in the one heart.

Of those who study the Dao, how many truly comprehend the supreme lineage of my immortal teachings? The worthy grasp it; the foolish reject it. The Dao, when taught to others, should be imparted by the master to the worthy, not bestowed upon the foolish. To teach the foolish invites reproach, and the fault lies with the master.

Since the inception of Heaven and Earth, my method has been undivided, rooted solely in the primordial qi of chaos. The common folk, in their delusion, seek external methods, losing the primordial Dao. Thus, humanity is subject to death, generation after generation, in numbers beyond count—all for having lost the root of the Dao.

Now, I earnestly discuss the source of the heart, that it may flow to later generations. Within the heart, it is like cinnabar, once refined into liquid mercury, which binds most potently. White snow submits, and qi transforms into a dragon. The clouds ascend in a single transformation; seven returns are as mercury. My five viscera are alchemized like wind and qi, bones strengthened, will fortified, skin and flesh permeated, and clarity attained like a mirror.

Words, though cumbersome, fail to convey it. The medicine lies in the West; north and south must submit. Sun and moon ascend and soar; success rests in the hand, failure in the heart. The master is my father and mother; husband and wife become companions. Beyond the Four Symbols, killing qi prevails. When it nurtures me, I am present; when it silences me, I sink. Align with my Dao’s mechanism, and it will harmonize with my heart.

When the literary refinement is complete, clouds and dragons descend from Heaven. The world endures without cease. Scholars, apply your hearts! True words teach the heart; when the heart is true, the Dao is upright. Sincerely cultivate the truth, and the Three Elixirs return to life. The Ninefold Mysterious Gate, divine talismans, and numinous sages—when the One of Heaven attains it, knotted cords serve as proof. All depends on the heart. The essential art is without illness. The Primordial Beginning teaches the heart; the Three Powers are ultimately settled. Bowing in reverence, I return to the words: know the heart, know destiny.

Striking the *Dragon and Tiger Song*, it is said:
The Four merge in chaos, the ancestors of the Five Phases.
First, mercury—mercury as agent, agent as qi, qi as sinew.
Second, yang within yin—yang as the sun’s soul, the soul as the sun’s essence, essence as yang, yang as father, father as the placenta.
Third, from white liquid it hardens into solid ice—solid ice is yang within yin, yang as bone. Bone relies on qi to generate white liquid, white liquid as marrow.
Fourth, quicksilver—quicksilver as the qi of flesh, qi as blood, blood transforming into hair. Hair relies on skin to form the dark enclosure, completing the substance.

Thus, three months form the body; ten months give birth to the remainder. Two months of bathing complete the year. Ultimately, it receives Heaven’s configuration, cycling through the Five Phases in rotation, named the supreme treasure of Heaven and Earth. As humans receive the upright qi of Heaven and Earth, they too become supreme beings.

The great Dao’s immortal medicine differs from worldly treasures of value. Gold, silver, coral, agate, pearls, and the like are measured by their merit and price, judged by worth. Only our immortal elixir, radiant as the sun and moon, is the treasure that models Heaven and Earth. Those who ingest it may attain longevity, equal to Heaven and Earth. All relies on the natural primordial qi to achieve the Dao!

This primordial qi is mist and dew in the sky, springs and sources on Earth. Deep as the azure pool’s hue, it is the natural Dao. Immortal scholars, do not err in intent or mistakenly consume alchemical yellow-and-white medicines. If a Daoist attains my natural Dao, the supreme medicine of the Four Qi in chaos, merely consuming it for a thousand days will reveal the path of spiritual transformation is not far. If the Four Qi are insufficient, spiritual transformation lacks foundation—just as a supreme being with incomplete sun and moon cannot be supreme.

Thus we know the perfected person harmonizes the patterns of Heaven and Earth to become sagely, while worldly people take the patterns of temporal things as wisdom. Yet can wisdom alone make one a sage? Only by illuminating one’s own Dao, grasping the world’s opportunities, and moving with the times can one achieve merit and establish the model! Measure one’s undertakings by the depth of one’s nature and the distance of one’s roots—when the time comes, all will be reduced to ashes. Only our Three Clarities Palace’s divine-transformation elixir treasure can preserve life and bestow longevity, equaling Heaven and Earth in duration. This Dao must not be transmitted lightly; transmission depends on finding the right person to entrust.

The Dao in its origin is formless, its root lying in the mutual encroachment of the Five Phases’ qi. Humans in their origin are not perfected; the heart is what perfects them. If the heart is evil, words become inauspicious; inauspicious words lead to estranged conduct, and estranged conduct prevents the Dao’s completion. Therefore, the three grades of cinnabar are entrusted to the worthy, not to the foolish. The foolish, benighted in worldly matters, may spend their days poring over immortal formulas and scriptures, reciting them endlessly, yet never grasp the nature of the Dao. Nature arises from the heart. Abstaining from grains, ingesting qi, practicing daoyin, cultivating conduct, forgetting to govern the Valley Spirit, stabilizing the hun and po, concentrating the spirit and settling the mind—all methods such as these are but empty gates of the Dao, not the true principle of longevity.

The Nine-Crucible Elixir employs the fire-qi of the four seasons, deploying civil and martial [techniques] without cease, maturing late like the lord awaiting his time. Great vessels are rare in sound, precious and difficult to acquire—even perfected persons struggle to recognize them. Lead serves as the outer frame, encircling and aiding; malachite acts as the agent, able to regulate wind and rain. Azurite can serve as the agent for all gold elixirs, transforming into qi, qi into sinews, and sinews into great strength. If the medicine is not perfected, it is like azurite’s power as an agent: just as a person without food has no strength, food resembles qi, qi resembles the agent, the agent resembles food—without food, strength fails, and affairs cannot prevail. All merit arises from strength, culminating in great robustness! If the medicine lacks strength, it lacks efficacy and cannot secure the body.

White liquid and golden blossoms—ice gives birth to dragon and tiger. Dragon and tiger originally transform in mutual succession from the qi of emptiness, following Heaven’s Dao in responsive transformation, thereby attaining the vessels of the four seasons’ celestial patterns. Each receives its generation, like the four seasons’ steaming and fuming, each having its proper return—thus life and death begin. The Dao in its origin is nameless; it is called dragon and tiger. Dragon and tiger embody the two natures of yin and yang, harmonizing and mutually swallowing the qi of subjugation. What is known arises from the substance of being born of the qi of emptiness. Only by cultivating goodness and eliminating evil can it be accomplished.

The Three Ones ascend in proper order, bound by unchanging rules. The Three Ones correspond to the three superior cinnabars, each with its method of returning the hun and guarding the One. Discussing the gate of supreme medicine, the method of the four qi’s sinews and bones, blood and flesh in mutual succession, must not err by even a hair’s breadth—never lose the timing of yin and yang. Each month, fire is initiated on the first day, following the method of counting nine nines. This Three Ones method is the internal Three Ones method, employing twelve months of fire-times to govern the twelve hours, matching the twelve positions, traversing the nine palaces, emulating the eight trigrams, and harmonizing the five phases.

The Yellow Emperor, at the abode of the Royal Person, inquired about the gate of the Three Ones. Thereupon, oral instructions were transmitted, passed down through generations of immortal scholars, never to be recorded in writing. The formulas and secrets are transmitted orally. Without adhering to the rules of the Three Ones, even if one masters myriad minor methods, can transform yellow and white to save the world, and amasses wealth like mountains, one will still inevitably face death. Such is not the method of preserving life. Those who study and comprehend it act wisely.

The resplendent Returned Elixir, bathed in the light of sun and moon, radiant as the stars, reveals the path amid the clouds. When the Returned Elixir is accomplished, its brilliance is unmistakable—like fire within wood, though its color remains concealed, as blue tinged with red qi. Ingesting it for a thousand days transforms the flesh, renews the bones, and opens spiritual communication, stabilizing the hun and po, reversing aging to become youthful. Heavenly spirits assist, connecting with the divine. This must not be rashly divulged. Even before attaining the Dao, one may achieve it; though the accumulation of yin merit may not yet be complete, one attains transcendence and avoids death.

Thus we know the great Dao leaves no traces, yet never loses its root. Humans must not lose the legacy of their parents. Apart from this, all methods of subduing mercury to produce yellow are but false gates of the Dao. The secrets run deep; those who comprehend them are few. Within a hundred years, life and death do not cease. Immortal scholars transmit this, protecting one another in succession. Let no idle words arise, for there is no other cause.

The secrets speak of the supreme medicine, the gate to human longevity. The supreme medicine differs from worldly treasures. The immortal’s elixir treasure, refined a thousand times and transformed ten thousand ways, preserves its original body. Those who ingest it may know the path to spiritual longevity. Therefore, I value time and life over wealth, while fools value worldly treasures, seeking fleeting relief for a day or night, indulging in wives, concubines, and glory—mere walking corpses and wandering ghosts, careless of life and squandering time, bringing about their own destruction. Within a hundred years, the dead are beyond counting.

The Primordial Lord pities the world’s people, who drift without direction. The wondrous Dao within the medicine has already transformed true persons. Let none act recklessly; each of the four should return to their duties, guarding the Dao and embracing poverty, together accomplishing the elixir of precious life. It is also called "you two eights," for two eights make a catty. White liquid and white snow—white snow is solid ice. Thus it is said: combine you two eights with you, uniting the two natures with cinnabar, never letting common people know. The fire-time follows the count of one nine; nine nines correspond to the position of noon.

Within the Three Ones, it is said: three days make one period, three threes make nine, and when the nine count is complete, that which bears a purple-black hue is praised by the Primordial Lord. Cherishing later generations of immortal scholars, the discussed songs and secrets are meant to enlighten the master. Let not the heart be divided—thus may one prepare for longevity!

Know then that Heaven is originally without favor—it takes the heart as its favor; Heaven is originally without partiality—it takes the heart as its partiality; Heaven is originally without calamity—it is man who brings calamity. Calamity arises from man, not from Heaven bestowed upon man. If scholars do not betray their teachers, and children do not defy their parents, then the Dao of Heaven endures long! Thus the transmission from master to disciple is complete!

Therefore, in the utmost affairs there is no duality, and the supreme medicine is without equal. When Heaven and man unite with the Dao, clarity naturally increases their blessings—great and unadulterated. If bones are excessive, flesh cannot prevail; if flesh is excessive, bones cannot prevail. Both bone and flesh depend on sinews to strengthen their power. Power is like a rope—without strength, it is as if a bag cannot hold things; how then can it stand? No infant does not cling to its mother; when an infant loses its mother, it is like medicine without sinews, for medicine relies on its governing power. Without power, there can be no transformative efficacy of spirit.

Those who comprehend see three branches in a single word; those who do not, though they traverse a thousand books and ten thousand formulas, remain fools. Many covet gold and silver first, neglecting to study immortal scriptures. Those who pursue the supreme treasure often favor alchemy, yet before seeing even an ounce, they perish unawares. The wise cherish the supreme medicine; though they have not yet glimpsed the mysterious gate of the elixir, they accumulate goodness. Thus it is.

With no heart for profit or gain, guarding the Dao and embracing poverty, Heaven’s fork does not punish—blessings follow man. The master naturally senses the utmost, as from the time before Fuxi and Xuanyuan, generations have sought immortality!

When the yang qi’s count reaches one hundred and eight, yin qi congeals and binds itself. Suddenly, a purple hue forms the returning elixir—ingesting it grants longevity beyond words. Cinnabar alone, with nothing else, mother and child beget each other without cease. Worldly people squander wealth and treasure, but the enlightened grasp the great returning formula. There are formulas not revealed, sequences not recounted—those who attain them feel gratitude, and may transmit and speak of them.

One is called the father of earth, two the mother of water? Three is named Yellow Sprout, four the seventy-two minerals. Without medicine, the Yellow Sprout cannot form. Heaven generates things—mother and child merge and sink; mother and child do not abandon each other, for the mother emerges from within the child.

Mystery upon mystery lies before the eyes: within yin there is yang, and the Dao is complete. Yin and yang do not part but achieve harmony—refining and ingesting it, one attains immortality.

One is called the completion within the standard, two the great name of the Dao. Gathering continuously, adding to it, it becomes numinous. In Heaven it is mist and dew, on earth the source of springs. When the count of yin and yang is exhausted, one who attains it speaks no more.

Beneath *jiazi*, fire is applied according to the ten-day period. When the period yields mother and child, it remains the same ten-day period. When the count is complete, it naturally cycles—from this, one may become the head of the two divisions.

One is called the true source of Autumn Stone, two the great Dao’s essence and spirit. Gathering the returning elixir, one should depart from the dust—such is the immortal guest of the world.

Sun and moon are not my form; yin and yang naturally compose my substance. Within the creation of Heaven and Earth, the six directions all return to one. The altar-turtle serves as the palace, veiled again and again. One ten-day period makes one period; one bathing returns to veiling. When the count is complete, it becomes numinous and sacred—Heaven and Earth communicate everywhere.

The preceding verses on the altar-turtle as palace are my spirit-chamber. Here ends the transmission of the heart-method of the Dao by the Purple Primordial Lord.
