# 修真十书武夷集

**Preface to the Reconstruction of Zhi Zhi Hermitage in the Wuyi Mountains**
*From the Forty-Fifth Scroll of the* Ten Books on Cultivating the Dao: Wuyi Collection, *by Bai Yuchan of Hainan*

The Wuyi Mountains, as recorded in the *Liexian Zhuan* of the Qin era, were where Qian Keng refined the elixir. Qian Keng presented pheasant broth to Emperor Yao, who enfeoffed him at Pengcheng; later, he was called Peng Zu, living to seven hundred and seventy-seven years before passing. Throughout his life, he concealed himself in the Wuyi Mountains, consuming lingzhi and drinking from waterfalls, able to ride the wind and command qi, soaring through the void—was he not a transcendent? Keng had two sons: the elder named Qian Wu, the younger Qian Yi, whence the name Wuyi Mountains derived.

At the first bend of the Nine Bends Stream, the head of the thirty-six peaks, the earliest curve of the land, the Celestial Matriarch of Taimu first built her hut there, followed by Zhang Zhan, who entered her chamber to continue her work. Later, the female adepts Yu Daochao and Yu Daoyuan of the Qin era retreated here to seclude themselves. The place was so secluded as to be indescribable, surrounded by thickets of bamboo. Those who came to gather firewood and glimpsed them called them the "Hairy Women" after the bamboo, a name that endures to this day.

During the Jin, Lou Shizhong, and in the Tang, Xue You, both refined their essence and nurtured their primordial qi here before departing. In our dynasty, it is said that Li Taozhen of Dongjing, Li Tiedi of Luobin, and Li Mojing of Yanshan successively built their hermitages here. Chancellor Li Gang once sought out these three Lis, confirming a dream of snow from his past, intending to construct a "Hermit’s Pavilion for Officials" here. Thereafter, generations of nuns resided in the hermitage, naming it Chan Hermitage and the site Chan Cliff.

Alas! Extraordinary figures appear but rarely in the world, and the hermitage fell into ruin, the land overgrown with brambles. Only the name "Zhi Zhi" remained, its origins lost to time.

Zhan Meizhong, styled Meizhong, a descendant of generations of scholar-officials and a man of heroic spirit, sighed one day: "Sima Qian explored the Nine Doubts, and Han Yu ascended Mount Taihua—both were moved by antiquity and sighed with emotion. Was this mere love of the strange? In this turbid world, the path of officialdom is fraught with obstacles. Why not cultivate friendships beyond the mundane and pursue the study of cinnabar and mercury? Perhaps one might ascend in flight or achieve liberation in death. The Dao of immortality can be sought—why not strive for it? I do not claim mastery, but I wish to learn."

Just then, Bai Yuchan of Qiongzhou emerged from Min and Yue to arrive in Wuyi, harboring the intent to clear the brambles and hew the undergrowth. His aspirations resonated with Zhan Meizhong’s long-held thoughts. Together, they searched for the site of Zhi Zhi Hermitage, sweeping away centuries of untrodden moss and cutting through miles of creeping vines, until they found the place. In the spring of the bingzi year of the Jiading era, they gathered laborers and timber to begin construction.

Yet the difficulties of founding were great. Before long, Bai Yuchan departed for Tiantai and Yandang. Upon his return, the hermitage was completed. Meizhong wished to persuade him to stay, arranging the hermitage as a retreat for the three Lis. But Yuchan, wary of the comings and goings of officials in their crimson robes, with their carriages and steeds, which would disrupt his affairs and disturb his mind, said to Meizhong: "The hermitage is complete thanks to your surplus wealth and effort. In the blink of an eye, halls and chambers have been erected—who but a master of thunderous skill could achieve this? Now, select those who are steadfast in the Dao, patient in spirit, content with simplicity, and fond of tranquility to reside here. Let them cultivate the land for a few seasons, and the flowers and trees will flourish. As for me, I shall enter seclusion on Luofu Mountain, but I will return to reside here permanently."

Meizhong replied, "So be it." Then he said, "Since you are leaving first, will you not write a record of this hermitage for me, to pledge your return in the future?"

Yuchan replied, "Very well."

This hermitage leans against Manting Peak, faces Huxiao Rock, with Tianzhu Peak to its left and Tieguai Peak to its right. A few steps inward lies Zhu Xi’s Hall of Humaneness and Wisdom; a single call outward reaches the Temple of the True Assembly of Prince Wei. Nearby stands Chongyou Abbey, with its hundreds of corridors and dozens of storied pavilions, their jade tablets and brocade cases filled with imperial calligraphy, their jeweled caskets and jade coffers storing the remains of immortals. The great monastery of the Golden Body of Great Cloud stands beside Zhi Zhi Hermitage.

Behind it, waterfalls cascade from cliffs a thousand fathoms high, like melting snow; before it, the emerald stream brims with waters where dragons bathe. Above lies the Heaven-Mirroring Pool, which connects to the Weak Waters; below lies the Cave of Ascending Perfection, which leads to Penglai. Among the thousand peaks and ten thousand ravines of Wuyi, the myriad mountains and rivers—none surpass the splendor of Zhi Zhi Hermitage.

Here, clouds veil jade grottoes, mist shrouds gemstone forests; purple cypress seals cinnabar, clear springs wash jade. Gibbons follow feathered adepts, cranes cry over fields of lingzhi. A single note from an iron flute gathers the immortals of the grass; three cups from a conch shell evoke the ethereal strains of celestial hymns. Truly, one may sing the hymns of the Purple Void or chant the immortal melodies of jade-winged transcendents. Dust does not obscure the eye; past and present are but a moment. The affairs of the crimson canopy and rainbow bridge remain vivid as ever.

How wondrous! Green grass, green; a hundred birds sing. Here, one may play the qin at dusk or compose poetry at leisure. Wine may be drunk while gazing at the scenery; without verse, the heart still finds its song. Where do the immortals dwell, so distant and elusive? The Lord of Wuyi resides on the northern slope of the mountain. A lone boat plies the waters, returning whence it came; where to seek the jade flowers that fill the grotto?

Is this not the most secluded and sublime place of Zhi Zhi Hermitage?

Zhan Meizhong surely knows that the Jade Emperor will host another banquet, and Bai Yuchan will refine the elixir of seven returns and nine reversions. This text is not written in vain.

Should future days bring extraordinary events, they shall but affirm that Zhi Zhi Hermitage was not built in vain.

I recall that in the flourishing years of Yuanyou, a man erected a thatched hut on Huotong Mountain, calling it Jiji. Within a few years, the builder had already shed his mortal form, and the hut itself vanished. Later, during the Longxing era, another sought to restore it; within a year or two, this restorer encountered the original founder—both then ascended as immortals. Such tales are recorded in *Accounts of Immortals Gathered*.

Now, the affairs of Meizhong bear a striking resemblance. For "zhi zhi" signifies "to halt where one ought to halt"—an idea echoed in the *Zhouyi*'s *Gen* hexagram, which embodies the meaning of twin mountains. This principle elucidates the doctrine of "zhi zhi," while the *Lotus Sutra* speaks of "zhi zhi, wondrous and beyond thought," and Zhuangzi declares: "An empty chamber gives birth to brightness; auspiciousness resides in *zhi zhi*." Thus, across the Three Teachings, *zhi zhi* holds profound significance.

Consider still water as a mirror, the moon as the object of contemplation. One may chant poems of the Six *Zhi*s or compose rhapsodies of the Eight *Zhi*s—indeed, there are those who embody this principle in full. The name *Zhi Zhi* was not idly chosen in antiquity, nor is the hermitage’s revival in our time without purpose. Surely one who has deeply grasped *zhi zhi* now dwells within its walls.

For green mountains and white clouds are nothing but *zhi zhi*; fallen blossoms and flowing streams are likewise *zhi zhi*. The cries of birds and mournful apes, the desolate moss and broken lichen—all embody the meaning of *zhi zhi*. Those yet unable to attain *zhi zhi* may study under one who has already realized it, for in every action—walking, standing, sitting, or lying—there exists an unceasing *zhi*, far beyond the mere chatter of withered wood or cold ashes.

I, too, am one of the *zhi zhi* company. In recording the people of this hermitage, I join them in entering the *zhi zhi* samadhi, offering reverence to the Three Pure Ones of the Highest Heaven and guiding all beings to realize *zhi zhi*.

*Zhi zhi* is not the cessation of *zhi*, but rather the cessation of the cessation of *zhi*—nothing more.

To Master Zhi of the Palace, Wang Nanji of the Cave Chapters

The ancient *Xi Ce* states: "The southern flight of the *geng* hides in repose."
Just as the sunlit scholar-tree sways in the balmy breeze,
the cicadas’ evening clamor stills at the Jade Luminous Palace.

I look up to the Palace Master, a true person—
his bearing the grace of rivers and mountains,
his heart the vastness of wind and moon.
A person among immortals, rarely met.

Once, I gathered the old records of the herb-gathering immortals’ lineage:
Wang Qi was the bright disciple of Lao Cong’s kindling,
Wang Nan the kindred spirit of Zhuang Zhou’s sealed casket.
In the boundless heavens of Yushan, Wang Yong wielded thunder’s peak;
in the Brahma-guardian heavens of Xuyan, Wang Shao discerned the workings of fate.
The man of Lu, Wang Shuo, refined the jade-cloud elixir on Floating Jade Mountain;
the man of Qin, Wang Qiao, tempered the nine-spirit elixir in Heavenly Flower Cave.
Later came Wang Chang and Wang Min in the Han and Jin,
Wang Mao and Wang Zaiqing in the Wei and Tang.
In recent times, Cloud Crane Master composed the *Three-One Numinous Chapters*,
Smoke Pine Master the *Pivotal Essentials of the Golden Elixir*,
Carefree Master the *Collected Works of the Returned Elixir*,
Pure Emptiness Master the *Guide to the Dao of the Elixir*—
all of their kin.

Their gates have seen immortals and humans appear and vanish, scarcely one or two.
Yet it is said: the phoenix of cinnabar mountains must hatch from the *luan* and *chi*;
the steed of crimson marshes must sire the *qilin*.
So it is with the unbroken line of immortal descendants—
illustrious immortals and perfected beings emerge in succession,
and after a thousand or a hundred years, a true person arises,
presiding over the grotto-heaven,
celestial regalia at his side,
nurturing the essence of heaven,
upholding and illuminating the profound mysteries.
He chews the essence of the Great Primal,
gathers the *qi* of the True One.

In governing his mind, he is like an image in a mirror;
in responding to the world, he is like the moon in water.
His merit and virtue resplendent,
outshining all before and after—
the world’s Daoists and layfolk alike
clasp hands and bow their heads,
eyes straining to see, hands pointing,
all exclaiming:
"Such is his Dao, such is his virtue!"

Thus, I compose these Cave Chapters to sing of him.

The Song says:

A single pearl of the Yellow Dao coils ‘round the gate-tower,
the square-inch heart empty, the grotto-door sealed.
Mulberry fields remain unchanged while the sea’s waters recede;
jade trees bloom, their green leaves lush and deep.

The Lesser Grotto’s jade missives fall upon dragon and tiger;
who presides over the moonlit altar’s fragrant chimes?
The Perfected One soars down on a divine simurgh,
heavenly escorts, somber-faced, return to the Purple Palace.

A thousand peaks, ten thousand peaks lock in azure mist;
three trees, two trees—where gibbons cry their last.
Wind scatters willow catkins in the third-month chill;
a man stands at the city gate, a misty riverside village.

Born with divine spirit, ever majestic,
he laughs, carrying off a scroll of the *Yellow Court*.
Seated in the jade palace, he rules over gruel of jade,
star-caps and rosy skirts fill the hall’s eaves.

From across the four seas, incense-bearing pilgrims arrive like candles,
crawling on elbows and knees, they come like clouds.
The Love River’s waves stretch boundless,
flowers bloom on iron pillars in the City of Darkness’ spring.

Grasping yin and yang in a single breath,
his long whistle makes ghosts and gods weep.
Wielding his sword, he summons rain with a flick of his ring;
inscribing talismans, he calls forth thunder with a stroke of his brush.

In those years, he was summoned to the inner Daoist sanctuary,
yellow hemp and purple ink vied in brilliance like stars.
Returning, a hundred neglected tasks were joyfully restored,
the grand design, resplendent, was laid out anew.

Recalling the first kalpa of the Dragon Han,
he shattered the Primordial’s baggage of delusion.
A cauldron full of lead-frost, flames soaring—
do you know, sir, of green cheeks and snowy teeth?

Pines and bamboos sigh in the clear wind,
a white crane departs, the thatched hut left empty.

**Visiting the Immortal: A Gift of Ten Thousand Records**
The idle brush, the flying reeds—just as the first key turns,
the Blue Maiden still precedes, the night’s journey fraught with peril.
For days on end, the east wind brings biting cold,
the oriole’s song fades, plum blossoms fall.

A guest arrives at Wuyi, seeking traces of the divine,
the Eight-Character Grotto’s door unlocked, no bolt in place.
Last night’s rain swelled the stream’s head;
peach petals fill the brook, red and glowing.

Green moss carpets the ground, evenly spread,
fragrant grasses stand silent, mist veiling all.
The pounding of herbs echoes, the Elixir Well runs dry,
a rainbow bridge snaps, the rosy curtain drawn.

The ancient pine wind mimics the phoenix flute,
as dusk falls, clear guests fill the valleys and peaks.
Mountain light stills, the old pines and bamboos unchanged,
within the grotto, a somber air—gibbons and cranes grieve.

The loom-rock study stands empty,
the Purple Ridge’s cinnabar mounds long desolate.
Mist darkens the level woods, tigers roar,
a jade-green pool blooms, an old dragon leaps.

Steep cliffs—birds dare not fly past,
ten-thousand-foot emerald cliffs, sheer and towering.
The golden toad in the mountains cannot be found;
by the rocks, pluck and chew yellow mushrooms.

My life drifts carefree, untethered,
in springs and stones, mist and clouds, I find true joy.
Clad in green hemp, a green bamboo hat,
a jade staff slung across my shoulder, I tread the brambled peaks.

I love only the mountains and forests, bearing the weight of cities,
yet scorn fine foods, preferring wild greens.
With a cold eye, I lie on stone, entering the realm of *Huaxu*;
I dream of the Great Void, untouched by axe or chisel.

Entering the grotto, not half an hour passes,
yet in the blink of an eye, ten days and nights have gone.
Today, the rain’s feet retreat from the cloud-tops;
I long to return, yet the mountains and streams bind me.

I wish to build three thatched huts here,
breakfast on rosy clouds, drink from the waterfall’s spray.
Fate has already allotted me a share of the divine;
I know beyond the Dao, there is no heaven and earth.

Yet I fear heaven’s many offices—
even when the nine-fold elixir is complete, I dare not swallow.

**Song of the Immortals in the Painting**
Before the wine of Sun Quan is drained,
the painter’s brush hovers, poised to leave the silk.
A single dot of congealed ink resembles a living fly—
when scraped, it does not fly; the heart startles in surprise.

Xianzhi, inspired, lifts his brush—
the brush seems to fly, tracing its own lines.
Playfully, he stains pine-soot to make a cow,
its horns laid back, it sleeps on the mossy mound.

Xiao Bi grasps the crane’s essence,
his heart unobstructed by creation’s bounds.
A plain silk scroll becomes a slice of sky,
snowy feathers poised to rise, piercing the azure mist.

Monk Guan, drunk, sleeps soundly;
awakening, he dips his brush, makes stone blocks.
He splits mountains, rips rocks, lifting clouds,
now like a crouching tiger, now like a raised fist.

Kai’s painted orchids hide jade shoots—
when opened, they have already flown away.
How to make emerald leaves form a chilly thicket,
four seasons ever wafting spring’s breeze?

I hear that in the Southern Studio, Yuwen Huan
with his skilled brush and wondrous ink sweeps away reed-warts.
Neck lowered to drink, neck raised to fly,
he captures the lotus withered, the sand bar lean.

In the Tang, the recluse Wu Daozi
beyond his paintings of immortals, often drew gibbons.
He depicted them clutching their young, falling to cold springs,
or like a drawn bow, racing toward distant trees.

Ji Cheng’s painted tigers are always fierce,
ghosts and gods dare not meet their gaze.
One sees only the paper come alive with ferocity,
an open mouth howls, the wind wails in sorrow.

Lord Ye loved dragons, so he learned to paint them—
unaware, his heart’s aperture opened a jar.
No sooner had the brushstrokes on paper resembled a dragon,
than wind-whiskers and wave-manes vied in might.

Han Gan painted horses, capturing their essence,
frost’s whinny artfully rendered in a galloping pose.
Pitiful, their open mouths neigh soundlessly,
only the wind’s edges carve their emaciated bones.

By the riverbank, for whom do the fine grasses grow green?
Only the wind and mist keep them in check.
Ruan Xian gathers the spirit of grasses,
his brush’s tip privately brings them spring.

Of old, Kang Lingzhu painted fish,
tossing heads, wagging tails, a myriad scales complete.
Red-finned purple carp swim in formation,
shattering agate ice, leaping onto frozen surfaces.

Ren Lao’s heart held snow and moon—
his painted plum blossoms even more pristine.
Lu Zhi sniffed them, complaining of no fragrance,
yet they conjure the misty rivers and lakes of Jiangnan.

Zhang Zhen, humble in heart, studied bamboo,
wind and rain rustling, born on brocade scrolls.
Wind-swept branches, rain-soaked trunks seem to transform into dragons—
unfit to be cut as staffs to aid Ge Hong.

Qian Jin painted pines, sweeping away mist and rain,
pine tips stand like cranes, never flying away.
Defying wind, proud in snow—how long?
Their emerald hue unchanged, ever fresh and rare.

Wang Wei’s brush brims with mountains and waters,
a thousand peaks, ten thousand streams—all in a flick of the wrist.
Myriad acres of glassy azure seem to flow,
layers of kingfisher green float upon the waves.

At times, he paints a few withered trees,
a single slice of sunset glow queries the flying duck.
At times, he paints an ancient ravine’s spring,
rolling waves, unheard by men.

At times, flowers fall where crows cry—
just as a thousand woods mourn autumn’s rain.
At times, dusk arrives, crows caw—
at the mist’s edge, temple bells hasten the moon’s delay.

At times, he shifts the banks of Xiao and Xiang,
relocating them to Dongting’s shores, Pengli’s banks.

At times, he transplants the peaks of Tiantai,
facing Yadang’s chilly mist and rain.
Since the ancients departed, none have learned—
those who study grasp but the husk.

Ghosts and spirits are easy; dogs and horses hard—
the world’s artisans glimpse not even a speck.
Yet in your red-and-ink, brush and water,
you carve from the heart what the mind has painted.

One stroke refined, a hundred strokes refined—
leaving for posterity an undying name.

Zhuo’an, laughing, leans on a staff of plum,
a worldly immortal, this clumsy master.
Crown and tablet cast aside, he leaves the jade gates,
heaven’s men escort him to rule the Lin Palace.
His body dwells where stars and dew converge,
his heart abides in misted cities, moonlit courts.

Not that he rubs his hands till they darken—
no elixirs needed, his face glows crimson.
A century yields but a tenth of dullness,
all things reckoned—all is emptiness.

He sees through the spider’s vain web-spinning,
the parrot’s speech trapped in its cage.
Leisurely he savors the world’s flavors in stillness,
quietly he fathoms heaven’s secrets in silence.

To learn cunning is not so fine as to hide it;
to forget the mechanism differs from wielding it.
The void speaks not, yet the void is vast;
creation makes no sound, yet creation is just.

The Six Thieves find no purchase in his idleness,
the Ten Demons grow lazy attacking him.
Gathering spirit, he gains the power of feigned stupidity;
cultivating qi, he masters the art of silence.

To summon rain, he need only call the flood’s echo;
to rouse thunder, he but invokes the numinous cavern.
If this world will not suffer him to stay,
he will learn to ride the white crane on the wind of heaven.

**In Praise of the Lineage of Celestial Masters**
*By Bai Yuchan of Hainan*

**The First Celestial Master, Lord of Orthodox Unity and Serene Response,**
named **Daoling**, styled **Fuhan**:
Before Cloud-Brocade Mountain, he refined the Great Elixir,
and the demons of the Six Heavens shivered to their bones.
Once he rode the crane back to the Mystic Bureau,
mist and rain whispered over the Jade Altar.

**The Second Celestial Master, Successor,**
named **Heng**, styled **Lingzhen**:
In the early years of *Guanghe*, the Great Elixir was perfected—
what skill did he lack to serve the Han’s numinous spirits?
At midnight, his jade chariot soared through purple dew,
while spring winds and rains filled Yangping.

**The Third Celestial Master, Heir,**
named **Lu**, styled **Gongqi**:
Laughing, he cast aside the bronze seal as governor of Hanzhong,
hiding in the mountains, exchanging a peck of rice for divine might.
When Wei troops encamped along the riverbanks,
with a flick of his finger, waves surged into a thousand-foot peak.

**The Fourth,**
named **Zi**, styled **Yuanwei**:
Leaning on his staff, he climbed to the summit of Boyang’s cliffs,
where an old alchemical furnace still locked in evening mist.
Through the ages, a pair of dragon-and-tiger stones remained—
in what year did the Vice Minister ascend as an immortal?

**The Fifth,**
named **Zhaocheng**, styled **Daorong**:
From thousands of miles away, his radiant spirit shone,
while cinnabar ashes chilled and purple clouds congealed.
Two tigers returned to the forest, unseen by men;
a few stalks of fungus sprouted where cranes pierced the tomb.

**The Sixth,**
named **Jiao**, styled **Dexin**:
Jade slips of alchemical script hid in a latticed casket,
cloud-desks flew through the air, cranes trailed their plumes.
After bidding his disciples farewell and departing,
a pale moon fell into the cold pool that night.

**The Seventh,**
named **Zhonghui**, styled **Dechang**:
In those years, he fasted and refined the immortal elixir,
summoning rain and calling thunder as though in idle play.
Across the four seas, disciples received the register of the law—
laughing, he took his staff and left for Crane-Crying Mountain.

**The Eighth,**
named **Jiong**, styled **Yanchao**:
The moment his cinnabar talismans were inscribed, ghosts and gods wept;
at ninety, he shed the red dust of the world.
To this day, where he built his hut on the cliff,
phoenixes roost in the green bamboo at midnight.

**The Ninth,**
named **Fu**, styled **Dexin**:
The mountains and waters of Shangrao were the finest south of the Yangtze;
his monastic staff flew sideways, poised to build a hermitage.
Suddenly, he met a perfected one beyond the mists—
returning speechless, he hid among the pines.

**The Tenth,**
named **Zixiang**, styled **Linbo**:
As the night deepened, his chamber filled with divine light,
and the sacred elixir materialized in his palm.
Beyond the tomb, cranes cried at that moment—
only rainbow robes remained to shroud the jade coffin.

**The Eleventh,**
named **Tong**, styled **Zhongda**:
For forty years, he shut his door and concentrated his spirit;
a green phoenix and red simurgh bore his cloud-borne carriage.
For months, his jade coffin held a golden body, translucent—
his chamber brimmed with celestial fragrance, a single cup of wine.

**The Twelfth,**
named **Zhongchang**, styled **Derun**:
Summoned by crane-script to the imperial capital,
he returned to divide his form and transform into a radiant being.
Last night, drunk, he spewed wine—
awakening, he sipped again from the jar’s spring brew.

**The Thirteenth,**
named **Guang**, styled **Dezhao**:
For years, he fasted and studied flight,
piercing the autumn sky with a single speck of blue.
As dusk fell over the forest on a wind-and-moonlit night,
the *Step-in-Void* chant echoed faintly from the grotto-heaven.

**The Fourteenth,**
named **Cizheng**, styled **Ziming**:
His alchemical crucible could dry quicksilver to life,
and with a single thought, he fed the poor of his household.
In the void, he struck up the *Cloud-Soaring* music—
white cranes arrived amid the wind and rain of spring.

**The Fifteenth,**
named **Gao**, styled **Shilong**:
On the Elixir Terrace, a jade-bearded elder—
the Celestial Master Zhang Shilong through the ages.
He toyed with rivers and mountains in poetic art,
exhaling and inhaling wind and moon in wine’s divine power.

**The Sixteenth,**
named **Yingshao**, styled **Zhifeng**:
Alone, he tilled a field of idle clouds,
his thatched hut silent as he recited the *Yellow Court*.
Later, he spoke of fasting and returning to the mountains—
on moonlit nights, the sound of an iron flute was heard.

**The Seventeenth,**
named **Shun**, styled **Zhongfu**:
A magistrate of Guixi, he hid in his mountain home,
quietly building a thatched hut with two or three idle days.
On the day of his corpse-liberation at ninety,
people still saw him with the face of a youth.

**The Eighteenth,**
named **Shiyuan**, styled **Zhongliang**:
In the Jade Pool of divine water, he reared white crows;
in the jade furnace, he stoked the fire to congeal cinnabar.
The immortals’ wondrous arts went unrecognized—
in an instant, he could make peach and plum blossoms bloom.

**The Nineteenth,**
named **Xiu**, styled **Dezhen**:
The Jade Bureau’s jade scrolls bore dragon-and-phoenix script,
and the Three Primes’ ordination drew scholars like clouds.
Turning, he trod the path to Penglai—
after bathing, he burned incense and entered his tomb.

**The Twentieth,**
named **Chen**, styled **Jiande**:
In a single breath, he drained the wine sea,
wearing the cap and robes of the Primordial Altar for over a century.
Unfed by the world’s smoke and fire,
he could transmit the celestial script of lightning flowers.

**The Twenty-First,**
named **Bingyi**, styled **Wenfu**:
A golden tortoise entered his belly in a dream, leaving him perplexed—
in the jade chamber, a banished immortal was born.
For over a hundred years, the elixir passed through the ancestral seal;
when he took up the tablet to return to the immortals, the earth quaked.

**The Twenty-Second,**
named **Shan**, styled **Yuanchang**:
He visited famous mountains and paid homage to grotto-heavens,
only to meet living immortals along the way.
On the day he returned, his bones transformed and his yang revived—
counting on his fingers, ninety years had passed in the mortal world.

**The Twenty-Third,**
named **Jiwen**, styled **Zhonggui**:
With a jade bowl, he prayed over water, stirring waves and clouds;
beneath his brush, thunder roared, making ghosts and gods weep.
Before and behind Dragon-Tiger Mountain,
how many had the Master brought back to life?

**The Twenty-Fourth,**
named **Zhengsui**, styled **Baoshen**:
He dwelled in the misty waters of plows and harrows,
building a thatched hut beyond the high pines.
Bestowed the title *True Serenity Master*—
one lane of immortal scriptures, one stove of incense.

**The Twenty-Fifth,**
named **Qianyao**:
Grasping his *zhenna* staff, he entered the grotto-heaven,
where the grotto-heaven lay vast, veiled in cold mist.
Emperor Renzong personally inquired about the golden elixir’s secret—
laughing, he pointed to the slanting sun and the clamor of cicadas.

**The Twenty-Sixth,**
named **Sizong**:
In a cinnabar crucible, he refined golden essence,
silently praying to the Celestial Sovereign to ascend the purple void.
As the moon sank halfway down the mountain, the Elixir Well’s waters—
the cries of gibbons startled the stars across the sky.

**The Twenty-Seventh,**
named **Xiangzhong**, styled **Gongchen**:
When the benevolent emperor bestowed the purple robe,
he was but a serene child of seven.
Idly singing a verse of grotto scripture,
he knew not that phoenixes and cranes filled the sky.

**The Twenty-Eighth,**
named **Dunfu**, styled **Yanzhi**.

**The Twenty-Ninth,**
named **Jingduan**, styled **Ziren**:
From the thorned siege he returned, laughing—
his heart, once set on an inch of merit, now ashen.
In what year did the white crane return to its grotto-abode?
Within the sunset’s shadow, the wild apes’ cries mourn.

**The Thirtieth,**
named **Jixian**, styled **Zunzheng**:
A man of Chengdu, surnamed Liu, built his walls—
once the elixir ripened, he shed his traces and entered Luofu.
A few sheets of imperial calligraphy remained in the jade tower,
yet the Master of Emptiness and Stillness had already turned away.

**The Thirty-First,**
named **Shixiu**, styled **Chaoying**:
A carefree gentleman of the Pure Capital,
he concentrated his spirit, gathered his qi, and refined the Cinnabar Yang.
A wisp of cloud, a lone crane—no trace left—
midnight’s wind, a thousand miles of frost.

**The Thirty-Second,**
named **Shouzhen**, styled **Zunyi**:
With a crane’s neck and lightning’s cheeks, his bones were already immortal—
on the altar of stars, he chanted jade verses with a long whistle.
Since his return to the immortals from the imperial gate,
a single pillow of pure wind has spanned ten thousand years.

**Mulberry Lord’s Prayer for Rain, with Annotations on the Well of Celestial Radiance**
The Well of Celestial Radiance binds the Jade Pool’s luminous glow—
*Qian* is the *hai* direction, the northwest, the Gate of Heaven.
Within the heavens’ essence lies the realm of jasper brilliance,
above the breath of Brahma, within the Jade Talisman’s heart,
where the Jade Pool dwells, and the boundless city—
the abode of the Thunder Gods.

The Sacred One of Alliance and Might commands the Azure Youth.
Among the Nine Heavens dwells the Perfected of Primordial Alliance and Might,
a sacred figure. The Perfected issues decrees,
summoning the Eastern Barbarian Thunder Generals,
surnamed Zhu, named Azure Youth.

Hurling fire ten thousand leagues into the *Kan* and *Zhen* palaces—
*Ten thousand leagues of hurled fire* is the Thunder Master’s might;
*the eight-fold chime of flowing bells* is the Thunder Mother’s authority.
From *Kan* to *Zhen*—from north to east—
for earth arises in the northeast, which is the Thunder Bureau’s domain.
Thus the *Book of Changes* says: *Thunder lies within the earth, returning.*

The Rain Riders swiftly depart for Mount Tai Meng—
the thunder chariots, rain steeds, wind carriages, and lightning shafts,
all the retinue of the Thunder Gods.
With furious speed they descend from the void—
thus they come to Mount Tai Meng.

The Mulberry Lord, mighty among the Three Mountains of Grand Unity—
the Palace of Azure Jade and Grand Unity,
where the Radiant Spirit Lord of the Mulberry presides on the left, governing rain,
and the Auspicious Spirit Lord of Eastern Brilliance on the right, governing snow.
The left palace holds three mountains; the right, four ramparts.
The Mulberry Lord is the mighty spirit of the left palace’s Three Mountains.

The thunderbolt shatters stone, and the springs’ sources flow—
the Thunder Gods wield their mallets and axes to split rock,
unlocking the parched springs’ veins.

*Kun*, *Zhen*, *Xun*—earth, wood, and fire—converge with the Radiant Spirit—
*Kun* governs the west, *Zhen* the east, *Xun* the south.
The west’s metal restrains the east’s wood;
the east’s wood kindles the south’s fire,
which in turn nourishes the central earth.
Earth subdues water—thus the Radiant Spirit, the Water Marshal.
The Fire Lord dwells in the west, leading General Xin in the east,
Thunder Duke Shao Yang in the south.
The Five Quarters’ Barbarian Thunders assemble at the Jade Pivot’s central palace—
the Jade Pivot is the pivot of the Dipper.
Within the Dipper lies the Director of the Capital Waters—
the Radiant Spirit, Huang.
Thus the fury is unleashed.

Four fierce steeds charge with the Fire Lord’s might—
the Thunder Gods’ steeds gallop to the four quarters;
the central palace’s fire descends from the void—
a phrase from the Thunder Liturgy.

Flowing Essence and Dense Radiance rush toward Zhu Rong—
the Water Spirit is named Xuan Qi, styled Flowing Essence;
the Rain Spirit is named Fei Kuang, styled Dense Radiance;
the Fire Spirit is named Hui Lu, styled Zhu Rong.
Here, the Water and Rain Spirits drive the Fire Spirit onward.

The mighty gods of Mount Tai and Hua ascend the clouds—
Tai Hua is the Eastern Marchmount’s minister;
the mighty god is the White Tiger Spirit of the Western Marchmount,
rushing into the clouds.

Ink-black toads and soot-black worms soar through the void—
ink-black toads and soot-black worms, like dark clouds,
billow through the empty sky, pouring down rain.

They veil the scorching sun, and rain gathers in thick clouds—
dense clouds amass, obscuring the blazing sun,
brewing the yin rains.

Guan Bo shakes the Kunlun peaks—
beneath the Southern Fire Star Lord dwells the Spirit Lord Guan Bo,
who shakes the Kunlun Mountains, whose summit holds the Celestial River.
This speaks of the Fire Spirit stirring mountains and overturning the Milky Way.

The Hidden Spirits churn the sea, dark and deep as one—
the Water Spirit is named Xuan Qi;
the Wave Spirit is named Fan Hai;
the River Spirit is named You Ling.
Here, the Wave Spirit labors, the River Spirit toils,
and the Water Spirit joins them in bringing rain.

Feng Yi drums and dances, howling the long wind—
the Lord of the Six Waves, the Heavenly Thearch, is Feng Yi.
With drumming and dancing, he summons wind and rain.

The Weak Waters of Penglai achieve the merit of the Capital Waters—
Penglai has its Director of Capital Waters;
the Weak Waters have their Director of Water Merits.

Dragons and eagles, swift and keen, first quell the fiery calamity—
the Thunder Bureau’s fire-dragon chariots and fire-eagle steeds
first suppress the scorching peril.

Crimson-haired, with mighty wings and eyes like dawn—
the Fire Marshal Deng, wielder of the fiery decree,
has crimson hair, flesh-wings on both sides, and silver fangs gleaming in the sun.

Thunder and lightning spew venom to drive the Five Dragons—
the Thunder Duke and Lightning Mother exhale their toxic might,
driving the Five Dragons of the seas.

The four seas darken, shrouded in the gloom of the netherworld—
the four seas grow dim, enveloped in the netherworld’s murk.

A single peal transforms the four seas’ murk—
one thunderclap, and the four seas’ scorching haze turns to gloom.

The Rain Riders arrive like a legion, rivers surging in flood—
the Rain Steeds descend like a battle array, and the rivers rise in torrents.

Golden light and flowing essence sever the drought’s rainbow—
golden light and flowing essence belong to the Southwest Thunder God,
a spirit with a human head and divine body, wielding a fire-sword to cleave the drought’s rainbow.

The cavern’s yang and hidden spirits summon the thunder’s seal—
the cavern’s yang and hidden spirits belong to the Northeast Thunder God,
a spirit with a human head and fish body, who summons the Thunder Masters and the numinous rains.

The Jade Thunder Vast Master transforms Kongtong—
the Jade Thunder Vast Master, the Southeast Thunder God,
a spirit with a human head and tortoise body, shifts to a hue of darkest yin,
filling the thunder precinct’s Kongtong citadel.

The Void Sovereign of Mount Taihua sweeps away demonic blaze—
the Void Sovereign of Mount Taihua, the Northwest Thunder God,
a spirit with a human head and serpent body, scours the land of drought’s scorching fiends.

The Dark-Yellow Host of Many Beams cries out as vanguard—
the Dark-Yellow Host of Many Beams, the Wind Gods,
who sound their call at the thunder array’s forefront.

The sacred springs unleash the flood-dragons’ might for the Heavenly Duke—
*Ci* means to supplicate; *quan*, the dragon pools.
*Zi* means to unleash; *shen*, the flood-dragons.
To "wield the Heavenly Duke’s might" is to execute the celestial sovereign’s authority.

The Fire Decree Marshal overturns the vault of heaven—
the Fire Decree Marshal Deng, soaring beyond the vault’s void,
lashes at demonic specters and drives off serpents and vermin.

Drought’s chieftains and drought’s demons are the ghostly fiends of parched earth;
strange serpents and monstrous insects are the hidden dragons of languid gloom.

Goulou Jili blazes with fiery traces—
in the thunder precinct, *Jili* is the name of the fire-dragon,
speaking of the fire-dragon’s searing, radiant path.
(As recorded in *The Purple Tenuity Thunder Canon* by Attendant Wang of Fangzhang.)

Dengseng Zeyi obeys every command—
in the thunder precinct, *Dengseng Zeyi* is the name of the fire-chariot,
speaking of the fire-array marshal heeding the Five Thunders’ decrees.
(As recorded in *The Thunder Canon* by Attendant Wang of Fangzhang.)

The Fourth Brother of the Weaving Maid serves with loyal devotion—
in the thunder precinct, the Weaving Maid’s Fourth Brother is the Great Immortal of Thunderclaps,
whose heart is loyal and true, petitioning rain for the people.

Aiding me to rescue from drought and amplify merit—
the Thunder Gods, Wind Gods, Rain Gods, and Lightning Gods assist in drought relief.
As the *Dharma Canon* states: for each drought averted, one’s hidden merit advances a rank,
equivalent to saving one hundred twenty lives. For droughts exceeding twenty days, promotion is three ranks.

Crimson kites and purple geese soar without end—
in Master Ye of the Tang’s *Thunder Canon*, there is a talisman of the crimson kite and purple goose,
cast into the southeastern water jar while reciting the Wooden Lad’s incantation to summon wind and rain.
(As recorded in the Fangzhang Dharma Canon.)

Seizing the cruel, binding the malevolent, dispatching them to Northern Deng.

Seizing the cruel dragons and binding the drought demons,
dispatch them to the Northern Yin Heavenly Prison to interrogate their crime of prolonged drought.
May the Purple Void Primordial Sovereign descend to seize them—
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the Fire Bell Marshal’s ordinance!*

The Purple Void Primordial Sovereign is the Jade Pivot Envoy.
The Fire Bell Marshal is the Divine Lord Guan Bo.

A vermilion memorial from Chen Guo of the Dharma Bureau, offering gratitude and reporting affairs:

From the disciple of the *Shangqing Great Cavern Treasury*, the Five Thunders Tri-Bureau Adjudicator, and Director of the Northern Culmen Demon-Quelling Institute, your subject Bai Yuchan bows twice and respectfully submits:

Your subject has heard the words of the Supreme Ultimate Immortal Xi: *"Those who study the Dao are like bare flesh brushing against a naked blade."* Upon reflecting on this, none can help but tremble.

Master of Emptiness and Stillness Zhang Jixian has said: *"A human life of a hundred years is but the flick of a finger; close your eyes, and the wind-knife arrives in an instant."* Upon reflecting on this, my dread only deepens.

Your subject, a mediocre and unlearned wretch, has presumptuously occupied the Dao’s gate, striving to establish teachings and govern the heart—yet day and night, I am shaken by fear. Ashamed of my own foolishness, I confess my lapses in discipline and virtue.

Scholars from the four directions flock like ox hairs in multitude. If I were to universally receive and instruct them in the Dao and virtue, I fear the leakage of celestial secrets. Yet if I were to reject them and startle them with precepts, I would obstruct and repel later learners. Should I select the worthy and exceptional to initiate one or two, I again worry that the mediocre might slip through, and the vulgar might approach with disdain.

Your subject has long been favored by my teacher’s grace, having presumptuously received the profound mysteries of the Dao. I treasure and bear the heart-seal, never treating it lightly, reverently observing the precepts and prohibitions as though treading on thin ice, concealing my name and shunning fame. How could I, a mere youth with no knowledge of protecting my own feathers, dare to embellish my words? In truth and sincerity, on this auspicious day, I prostrate myself and present this memorial, offering it to the Three Heavenly Bureaus.

According to the records of the disciples of the Supreme Three and Five Meritorious Works and the Orthodox Unity Alliance威, the devotees Shi and others have each already submitted their heart-vows to the Heavenly Court, beseeching transmission and initiation. Their petitions have been transcribed and submitted to the relevant departments, and in accordance with the statutes, certificates have been issued to confer upon them their ritual offices. A day was then chosen to establish the altar, split the talismans, break the contracts, assign generals, and command troops, dividing responsibilities and appointing officials. Thereafter, the elixir hall and jade scriptures were employed to transmit the heart-mantras and oral instructions.

Now, with united sincerity, we respectfully select this day of the present month to ascend the Wuyi Mountains’ Ascendant True and Mysterious Transformation Grotto-Heaven, where we shall perform a several-part Pure Offering of Thanksgiving to the Lofty Perfected of the Three Realms, inviting the exalted Perfected to repay the mysterious creation, and further praying for blessings upon both our own persons and those of your subjects.

In my foolishness, I venture to present my humble insights to Your Celestial Majesty. There are seven great difficulties for those who practice the Dao, and six profound terrors—why is this so?

First, the world’s customs are degenerate, moral teachings have collapsed, and the deluded point blindly at one another—this is the difficulty of encountering a true teacher, hence the first great difficulty.

Second, texts are riddled with errors, methods are contradictory, steps are misplaced in presentation, and phrases are omitted in measurement—this is the difficulty of obtaining the true method, hence the second great difficulty.

Third, precepts and prohibitions are strict and clear, statutes are stern and solemn, yet they are hard to practice and easy to violate, leading many to stray from the truth—this is the difficulty of upholding the true precepts, hence the third great difficulty.

Fourth, the alchemical fire scorches harmony, lewd winds incite goodness to decay, the upright qi is severed and lost, and the primordial essence withers—this is the difficulty of preserving the true qi, hence the fourth great difficulty.

Fifth, the majestic demeanor of the exalted Perfected, the attire and colors of the divine generals, are hard to contemplate in the square inch of the heart, and a single impure thought disrupts them—this is the difficulty of maintaining true visualization, hence the fifth great difficulty.

Sixth, the celestial deities and earthly spirits, with their upright majesty, oversee merit and establish standards, scrutinizing even the finest detail—this is the difficulty of cultivating a true heart, hence the sixth great difficulty.

Seventh, whether at dawn or dusk, in cold or heat, when urgent petitions arise, one must respond without daring to be negligent in seeking reward, and all the more must exert oneself—this is the difficulty of establishing true merit, hence the seventh great difficulty.

As for the six profound terrors: Should the transmitted scriptures, talismans, seals, and mantras be recklessly shown to the unworthy, one will inevitably incur the retribution of the Wind-and-Thunder Hell, where blades will rend the body—this is the first profound terror.

Should the received precepts be violated at inopportune times, and external defilements encroach, one will inevitably incur the retribution of the Ash Pool Hell, where flames will brand the body—this is the second profound terror.

Should one revere the Three Treasures and pay homage to the numinous Perfected without knowing the taboos, one will inevitably incur the retribution of the Fire Net Hell, where wind-knives will torment the body—this is the third profound terror.

Should the divine generals’ incense and fire be neglected day and night, and their summoning lack proper timing, one will inevitably incur the retribution of the Frigid Ice Hell, where yellow ropes will bind the neck—this is the fourth profound terror.

Should the mind be careless or heavy, affairs be handled with inconsistency, or one be diligent at times and lazy at others, one will inevitably incur the retribution of the Iron Pellet Hell, where iron oxen will plow the tongue—this is the fifth profound terror.

Should one’s practice of the Dao become manifest and bribes be offered, leading to greed and avarice, one will inevitably incur the retribution of the Dark Hell, where myriad sufferings will assail the body—this is the sixth profound terror.

When considering these seven great difficulties and six profound terrors, your subject’s shoulders shrink, his heart aches, and his nose stings. I, a single dull and mediocre man, rely entirely on the compassion of the Supreme, which permits your subjects to bare our livers and spill our gall, confessing our sins and faults, praying that any transgressions may be pardoned and absolved.

Regarding the aforementioned disciples who have received the transmission, I humbly beseech Your Sagely Compassion to deign to issue a decree, granting my petition and entrusting it to the Supreme Mystery Capital Department for verification. The previous and subsequent submissions should then be promptly reported to all relevant offices and subordinate bureaus. I further pray for the command to dispatch the generals and marshals required in the Dao, who shall lead troops and command officials, arriving in due course at the ritual altars, incense halls, and administrative precincts of the ritual officers named so-and-so, where they shall station themselves to defend and protect, awaiting summons.

When troops follow the seal’s command and generals proceed with the talisman’s authority, in every instance of ritual practice, they shall dispatch talismanic orders in accordance with the statutes. Through prayers and exorcisms, the great numinous efficacy shall be manifested, retributions shall be made clear, names shall be inscribed in the Jade Register, ranks shall be assigned to the Golden Roster, and they shall receive the authority to command troops and wield the power to oversee the governance of spirits and demons. They shall act as Heaven’s agents to transform, serve the state to save the people, slay demons, eliminate evil, and establish the upright.

Should this be granted, I shall be both overjoyed and startled, spurring myself to diligence in body and mind, privately accumulating merit. When three thousand merits are complete and eight hundred deeds are perfected, I shall ascend to the immortal capital, awaiting promotion and selection. The ninefold ancestors and sevenfold forebears shall together attain good merit, and the six paths and three realms shall universally partake of good fruits.

Your subject, in his foolishness, respectfully relies upon the Two Officials’ Direct Affairs Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Left and Right Official Envoys, the Yin-Yang Divine Central Clerks, the Wind-Riding Courier Clerks, the Post-Horse Memorial Clerks, and the Flying Dragon Cavalry Clerks—two of each—to carry out their duties.

For the sake of the devotees Shi and others, who have advanced to the ritual altar for transmission and initiation, your subject presents this vermilion memorial of confession, thanksgiving, and petition, offering it to the Three Heavenly Bureaus. It is respectfully submitted to the Supreme Void Primordial Master’s Palace and the Supreme Clarity Bureau’s Purple Numen Palace, with the hope that it may be reported.

With utmost reverence and trepidation, your subject prostrates and kowtows, bowing twice to make this known.

To the Supreme Clarity Mysterious Origin Supreme Ultimate Great Dao Supreme Dao Lord, the Primordial Void Master, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Supreme Master, the Heavenly Emperor Lord, the Heavenly Emperor Master, the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital, the Nine Black Masters, the myriad layers of Daoist luminaries, the twelve hundred official lords, and the Jade Court of Supreme Clarity below: Your subject, surnamed Bai, a candidate for immortality selected by the Golden Portal and promoted as a presented scholar, now stationed at the southeastern corner of the Chongyou Abbey’s ritual altar, prostrates upon the earth to await your command.

This vermilion memorial of confession and thanksgiving is respectfully submitted by your disciple of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Precious Register, the Five Thunder Three Offices Judging Official, and the Director of the Northern Culmen Bureau for Expelling Demons, your subject Bai [so-and-so].

We humbly observe: when the purple simurghs cry beneath the moon and the Azure Sovereign unfurls feathered canopies at the Pivot Palace; when white cranes call to the clouds and the Red Emperor descends with rainbow banners at the Mechanism Lodge—we receive the Golden Portal’s edict of silk and bamboo and descend with the Jade Terrace’s covenant talismans, granting amnesty to the black-haired masses for their transgressions and averting calamities for the common folk. We prepare offerings of jujubes, chestnuts, cypress, and pine, gazing upward to the star altars of maple, locust, and willow. We establish the breaking of *jia* and *geng* days, discerning the configurations of *ce* and *kui*; we pace the *kan* and *li* of *zi* and *wu*, stepping through the rhythms of dark and new moons. With heartfelt words, we read aloud before the Dragon Countenance, praying that the Sagely Mind may deign to regard this humble ant-like memorial.

We reverently consider the Northern Culmen Purple Tenuity Central Heaven Grand Emperor: Your Majesty’s Dao rivals that of the Primordial Beginning, and your virtue aligns with the August Heaven. From the misty palace, you govern with effortless grace; from the frosty terrace, you bestow ranks. The Radiant Yang Great Sage assists with the *Lian Zhen* and *Wu Qu* stars; the Yin Essence Luminous Lord collaborates with the *Wen Qu* and *Lu Cun* stars. You wield the handle of fortune and misfortune with clarity, and the power of life and death is concealed within the Hidden Origin. The *Po Jun* star holds the honored position of the Water Palace, while the Northern Culmen governs the administration of the celestial river. All misfortunes are dispelled, and all sins are confessed; no illness remains uncured, and no evil goes unvanquished.

Your subject, the Daoist of Chongyou Abbey in Wuyi Mountain, Wufeng County, who oversees the ritual affairs of devotee Shi, has been graced to belong to humanity and fortunate to receive sagely transformation. Yet, born of mortal flesh and dwelling in the fiery prison of worldly toil, the six roots have incurred transgressions of desire and attachment, while the three karmas have led to the retributions of delusion. The eight trigrams have offended the directions and boundaries, and the five phases fear the changes of destiny’s cycles. The Three Officials pursue the soul, and the Four Bureaus record faults. Afflictions and misfortunes accumulate, illnesses and adversities linger. We now lay bare our foolish hearts and presumptuously beseech the Celestial Hearing.

May the radiance of jade illuminate and the brilliance of jasper shine forth. May the Spirit Kings of the Startled Ram expel the calamities of the life palace; may the Messengers of the *Tāluó* extend the years and repay the months’ vows. May the sixty officials of the Northern Dipper swiftly eradicate the seven harms and eight difficulties; may the seven thousand divine generals of the Southern Mound thunderously strike the nine perils and three disasters. Within the Dipper’s celestial bowl, may demonic influences be slain and disasters cease; beyond the steps of the Great Unity, may venomous toxins vanish without trace. May the Celestial Pass soar at dawn, and the Cinnabar Origin merge with the luminous scene. May the Dark and Mysterious expel the afflictions of epidemics, and the Jade Light extinguish the calamities of water and fire. May the assaults of malevolent spirits and earthly *qi* be repelled, and the arrows of the Life-Recording Turtle Lord be corrected. May the registers of Fengdu be erased, and the names in the Mountain Bureaus be removed. May the talismans of official misfortune, illness, and slander instantly perish; may the obstacles of retribution, karma, and affliction henceforth be driven away. May the healing officials of the Dharma bestow the medicines of the Six Dawns from the Brahma Palace; may the Heavenly Physicians descend the nine-times-refined elixirs from the Immortal Capital. May the five *qi* circulate freely, and the six pulses be at peace; may the three palaces ascend and descend, and the seven fluids flow harmoniously. May the constructive and defensive *qi* be tranquil, the meridians and collaterals unobstructed. May the *Gou Chen* conceal its luminous scene, and the Florid Canopy hide its form. We offer water and present flowers, our devotion boundless.

With our feet treading the earth and our heads touching the heavens, we pray for your mighty flood of blessings. We humbly present this memorial, earnestly awaiting your enlightened response.

With utmost reverence and trepidation, your subject prostrates and kowtows, respectfully submitting this memorial.

On a day in the first month of the ninth year of Jiading, the *bing-zi* year, your disciple of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Precious Register, the Five Thunder Three Offices Judging Official, and the Director of the Northern Culmen Bureau for Expelling Demons, your subject Bai, submits this memorial.

Your subject, surnamed Bai, a candidate for immortality selected by the Jade Emperor of the Golden Portal and promoted as a presented scholar, now stationed at the ritual altar, prostrates upon the earth to await your command.

This vermilion memorial of confession, thanksgiving, and petition for transmission and initiation is respectfully submitted to the Orthodox Unity of the Great Mystery Capital, the Celestial Master of the Balanced *Qi* Lineage, the South Marchmount Master of the Qingwei Heavenly Transformed *Qi*, and the Perfected of the Red Emperor: the Vice Envoy of the Five Thunders of the Divine Empyrean Jade Mansion, and your disciple of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Scriptures Register, your subject [so-and-so], kowtows twice and respectfully addresses this:

We humbly submit that memorials and petitions open the gates of confession and thanksgiving, while soaring spirits and riding *qi* pave the path to audience and reverence.

The transmission of the true and the initiation into the wondrous serve to inherit the wind of the Orthodox Unity; the advancement in rank and ascension in grade follow the method of recommendation and selection; the propagation of the Dao and the dissemination of transformation serve to expound the teachings of exorcism and salvation; the eradication of evil and the establishment of rectitude serve to uphold the Way of purity and forthrightness.

If this disciple may speak: when the heart’s square inch remains turbid, how can one grasp the clarity of the Dao? When the oral instructions and methods fail to manifest efficacy, how can one know the exorcistic and salvific power of the teachings? When words and deeds lack purity, how can one understand the laws of recommendation and selection? When the true and the false remain undistinguished, how can one recognize the wind of the Orthodox Unity? When form and spirit fail to merge in perfect harmony, how can one know the path of audience and reverence? When the deluded and foolish remain unenlightened, how can one comprehend the gates of confession and thanksgiving? Such are the unchanging principles.

This disciple has thus come to understand: only after purifying the heart and confessing one’s transgressions may one submit memorials and petitions; only after concentrating the mind and gathering the spirit may one soar in spirit and ride the *qi*; only after disciplining the heart and studying the Dao may one transmit the true and initiate the wondrous; only after rectifying the heart and sincerely aligning the will may one advance in rank and ascend in grade; only after dedicating the heart to benefiting all beings may one propagate the Dao and disseminate transformation; only after cleansing the heart and purifying the self may one eradicate evil and establish rectitude. Does Your Majesty deem this correct, or not?

The reason this disciple submits memorials and petitions arises from the vast and empty void, and as for soaring in spirit and riding the *qi*, there is no other cause—save that within this defiled and evil world, on behalf of Your Majesty, I have selected the worthy and chosen the virtuous, and among them, there is but one who, if initiated into the transmission of the true and the wondrous, may advance in rank and ascend in grade, propagate the Dao and disseminate transformation, eradicate evil and establish rectitude. Should there be even the slightest merit or the smallest virtue, it would suffice to slightly aid the governance of Heaven. Though this be this disciple’s achievement, it is entirely Your Majesty’s work.

In this manner, the Dao and its methods are glorified, and in this manner, the customs of the world are guided. Clearly manifest before the eyes and ears of humans and gods, a single memorial of tribute is presented, ascending to the Three Heavenly Bureaus. Reverently, for the Nine Purple Palaces of the Li Mansion, in the celestial region of the Dipper and Ox, in the Great Song Empire, the disciple [so-and-so], whose life is bound to the command of [such-and-such] and whose destiny is tied to [such-and-such] star, affiliated with the Celestial Master of [such-and-such] *qi* lineage in [such-and-such] realm, states: summoned by the Three Black Lords of the Middle Prime Festival, this day, with reverent offerings of incense and tokens, I kowtow and present myself at the Dao to make this declaration.

I humbly reflect that, though undeserving, I have dwelt in this flourishing age and gained entry into the realm of the mysterious; though unworthy, I have been admitted to the ranks of the ordained and been fortunate to transmit the teachings and methods. Though I have diligently studied, I have yet to awaken to the numinous truth. Having had the good fortune to encounter a master’s guidance, I now bind my thoughts and prostrate myself in earnest, baring my heart and swearing an oath to Heaven. I beseech the transmission of the *Nine Numinous Flying Steps Memorial Method* of the celestial realm, that I may ascend in spirit and submit memorials, presenting myself in audience and reverence. Moreover, I sigh with self-reproach, for such rare opportunities are difficult to encounter. I also seek the transmission of the *Great Method of the Purple Pivot, Jade Dawn, Cavern Yang, and Flying Sanskrit Refining Salvation* of the Most High, to summon and command hidden spirits and perform the rites of refinement and salvation.

Having submitted this memorial, and having performed the rites of refinement, if there are exorcisms to be done, how shall efficacy be attained? I further request the transmission of the *Great Method of the Five Thunders of the Most High*, to pray for rain and beseech clear skies, to summon winds and call forth snow, to seal mountains and breach caves, to fell temples and expel evil, to sever dragons and subdue tigers, to drive away drought demons and sweep away locusts, to heal illnesses and avert disasters, to reward the good and punish the wicked. With utmost sincerity in every step and gesture, I vow to transmit the true oral instructions with a sincere heart.

In accordance with the words of this petition, no concealment is permitted. Previously, I had it transcribed and submitted to the Capital Bureau, and it has already been presented to the Celestial Court. Should my name be inscribed in the Jade Register, my rank will surely be recorded in the Golden Roster. A day shall be chosen to establish the altar and transmit the methods, following the rituals to dispatch generals and exchange troops, drinking the blood of the covenant and breaking the rings to sever the bonds. Yet I fear that at the moment of the oath and during the transmission, when I assess my own worth, I find my heart filled with shame. Should I, by some chance, profane the true and incur punishment, I have repeatedly presented my case before the Emperor to plead my circumstances. Considering this foolish and base one’s ignorance and transgressions, I rely on Your boundless mercy to grant forgiveness.

This disciple, burdened by the sins of seven lifetimes and the errors of three generations, beseeches the opening of the Gate of Immaculacy to allow a path for renewal. Pursuing the wondrous meaning of the true methods, I study to attain the state of the subtle and the imperceptible; refining stillness and concentrating emptiness, my heart naturally attains purity. With diligence, I lead the people and transform the realm, aspiring to ascend as an immortal and deliver the world, roaming freely. May my seven generations of ancestors be delivered, and may all the generals and officials of the various bureaus be honored with promotions. May the Three Realms receive grace, and may the myriad spirits attain blessings. Were it not for the great unfolding of compassion by the Most High, how could this humble disciple presume to submit this petition?

This disciple, in all humility, commands the two officials of the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Left and Right Official Envoys, the Yin-Yang Spirit-Decision Clerks, the Wind-Presenting Cavalry Clerks, the Memorial-Submitting Posthorse Clerks, and the Flying Dragon Cavalry Clerks—each to dispatch two officers. This disciple, on behalf of [so-and-so], respectfully submits this vermilion memorial of confession, thanksgiving, and petition for transmission and initiation, to be presented to the Three Heavenly Bureaus, and requests its delivery to the Palace of the Supreme Void Primordial Man of the Grand Tenuity Bureau and the Purple Cloud Palace of the Grand Tenuity Court. May it be duly reported.

This disciple, with utmost reverence and trepidation, kowtows twice and respectfully addresses this to the Supreme Void Primordial Man, the Great Dao Lord of the Grand Tenuity Primordial Ultimate; the Supreme Lord Lao, the Supreme Primordial Man; the Heavenly Emperor, the Heavenly Primordial Man; the Nine Elders of the Immortal Metropolis, the Nine *Qi* Primordial Men; and the myriad officials of the Grand Tenuity Jade Court of Your Majesty.

On the [such-and-such] day of the [such-and-such] month of the year of the Great Year Star, the memorialist, your subject [so-and-so] of the White surname, a Selected Immortal Graduate of the Jade Emperor’s Golden Gate, presently awaiting your command at the Chongyou Abbey, respectfully submits this.

*Memorial of Merit Discussion at the Thunder Bureau*
To the Orthodox Unity of the Great Mystery Capital, the Celestial Master of the Balanced *Qi* Lineage, the South Marchmount Master of the Qingwei Heavenly Transformed *Qi*, and the Perfected of the Red Emperor: your disciple of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Scriptures Register, [so-and-so] of the White surname, kowtows twice and respectfully addresses this.

This disciple is a minor clerk of the Divine Empyrean’s Thunder Bureau, somewhat versed in the affairs governed by thunder, unworthily bearing the books bestowed by thunder, and well-acquainted with the methods enacted by thunder.

Yet in their inquiries, records may err, transmissions may stray; thus amid complexity, guidance is offered, amid error, correction is made—obscure points yield their secrets, subtle ones their measures—difficult to know yet easy to practice, difficult to transmit yet easy to learn. What this disciple has mastered has reached this point, and I now lay it all before Your August Presence.

I have heard that when the two *qi* of yin and yang coalesce, they form thunder, and with the advent of thunder and lightning, departments and jurisdictions were divided. The Nine Heavens’ Thunder Ancestor thereby distinguished the Five Attributes, while the Perfected True King of the Divine Empyrean employed them to govern the Three Realms. Yet when I examine the Golden Tripod and consult the Jade Registers, I find that regarding the Five Thunders, doubts persist.

The *Thunder Writ of the Jade Pivot* states: the first is Heavenly Thunder, the second is Divine Empyrean Thunder, the third is Water Bureau Thunder, the fourth is Dragon Thunder, and the fifth is Earth Altar Thunder. The *Thunder Writ of the Divine Empyrean* states: the first is Wind Thunder, the second is Fire Thunder, the third is Mountain Thunder, the fourth is Water Thunder, and the fifth is Earth Thunder. The *Thunder Writ of the Great Cavern* states: the first is the Sagely Fullness, Numinous Might, Quaking Thunder; the second is the Roaring, Howling, Thunderclap Thunder; the third is the Eight Numinous, Eight Fierce, Shaoyang Thunder; the fourth is the Wave-Rolling Water Thunder; and the fifth is the Upright Thunderclap, Lightning Flash, Great Cavern Thunder. The *Thunder Writ of the Immortal Capital* states: the first is Heavenly Thunder, the second is Earthly Thunder, the third is Wind Thunder, the fourth is Mountain Thunder, and the fifth is Water Thunder. The *Thunder Writ of the Northern Culmen* states: the first is Dragon Thunder, the second is Earth Thunder, the third is Divine Thunder, the fourth is Earth Altar Thunder, and the fifth is Demon Thunder. The *Thunder Writ of the Great Unity* states: the first is the Eastern Azure *Qi* Wood Thunder, the second is the Southern Vermilion *Qi* Fire Thunder, the third is the Western White *Qi* Metal Thunder, the fourth is the Northern Dark *Qi* Water Thunder, and the fifth is the Central Yellow *Qi* Earth Thunder. The *Thunder Writ of the Purple Palace* states: the first is Spring Thunder, the second is Summer Thunder, the third is Autumn Thunder, the fourth is Winter Thunder, and the fifth is the Xuanyuan Thunder. The *Thunder Writ of the Jade Dawn* states: the first is Purple Tenuity Thunder, the second is Dengdu Thunder, the third is Fusang Thunder, the fourth is Mountain Bureau Thunder, and the fifth is City God Thunder. The *Thunder Writ of the Great Empyrean* states: the first is Jia-Yi Thunder, the second is Bing-Ding Thunder, the third is Wu-Ji Thunder, the fourth is Geng-Xin Thunder, and the fifth is Ren-Gui Thunder. The *Thunder Writ of the Great Ultimate* states: the first is Divine Empyrean Thunder, the second is Earth Prison Thunder, the third is Water Bureau Thunder, the fourth is Nine Provinces Thunder, and the fifth is Village Earth Altar Thunder.

The thunder writs transmitted by the Most High, as recorded in the ten preceding texts, each differ in their accounts. Which of the ancient Five Thunders is to be regarded as correct? Even the thirty-six thunders handed down through the ages remain doubtful—indeed, they invite further scrutiny.

The thirty-six thunders are as follows: first, Jade Pivot Thunder; second, Jade Treasury Thunder; third, Heavenly Divination Jade Pillar Thunder; fourth, Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Thunder; fifth, Fire Wheel Thunder; sixth, Dipper-Infusing Thunder; seventh, Wind-Fire Thunder; eighth, Flying Swift Thunder; ninth, Northern Culmen Thunder; tenth, Purple Tenuity Pivot Thunder; eleventh, Divine Empyrean Thunder; twelfth, Immortal Capital Thunder; thirteenth, Great Unity Heaven-Shaking Thunder; fourteenth, Purple Palace Thunder; fifteenth, Iron Armor Thunder; sixteenth, Shaoyang Thunder; seventeenth, Reverent Fire Thunder; eighteenth, Earth Altar Commanding Demon Thunder; nineteenth, Earth Spirit Fire Crow Thunder; twentieth, Three Realms Thunder; twenty-first, Grave-Severing Thunder; twenty-second, Great Awesome Virtue Thunder; twenty-third, Six Waves Thunder; twenty-fourth, Green Grass Thunder; twenty-fifth, Eight Trigrams Thunder; twenty-sixth, Primordial Unity Hawk and Hound Thunder; twenty-seventh, Whistling Mandate Wind and Thunderclap Thunder; twenty-eighth, Fire Cloud Thunder; twenty-ninth, Yu’s Step Great Unity Commanding Thunder; thirtieth, Great Ultimate Thunder; thirty-first, Sword-Tip Thunder; thirty-second, Inner Mirror Thunder; thirty-third, Outer Mirror Thunder; thirty-fourth, Divine Treasury Heavenly Pivot Thunder; thirty-fifth, Great Brahma Dipper Pivot Thunder; and thirty-sixth, Jade Dawn Thunder.

Is this truly what is meant by the thirty-six thunders? Or is it not? If the Five Thunders alone are so manifold, how much more so the thunder methods? Are these the extraordinary and wondrous techniques wielded by divine immortals and perfected beings? Or do the discrepancies arise from inconsistencies in the records of the scriptures and registers?

Consider the deities of the thirty-six thunders: the Celestial Cavern Heavenly Perfected Deities, the Complete Fire Complete Perfected Deities, the Heavenly Raven Heavenly Guard Deities, the Mighty Ding-Xin Deities, the Ice Wheel Water Bowl Deities, the Flowing Light Fire Wheel Deities, the Dripping Past Shouting *Ka* Deities, the Great Unity Primordial August Deities, the Biting Net Sparrow-Tongued Deities, the Heavenly Thunder Wind-Leading Deities, the Fire Hound *Qi* Hound Deities, the Fire Eagle Fishy Smoke Deities, the Heavenly Pass Thunderclap Deities, the Iron Armor Flying Lightning Deities, the Immortal Capital Fire Thunder Deities, the Mountain Thunder Fire Cloud Deities, the Wind-Fire Primordial Brightness Deities, the Fire Earl Wind and Thunderclap Deities, the Gou-Lou Auspicious Benefit Deities, the Weaving Maiden Four Songs Deities, the Jade Thunder Vast Master Deities, the Cavern Yang Hidden Numinous Deities, the Four Brightnesses Public Guest Deities, the Fire Light Flowing Essence Deities, the Void-Riding Great Flower Deities, the Metal Essence Pure Thought Deities, the Azure Fang Iron-Faced Deities, the Scattering Smoke Thunderclap *Qi* Deities, the Thunder Master Pass Earl Deities, the Wood Wolf Astral Light Deities, the Reverent Fire Statutes and Mandates Deities, the Shaoyang Fire Chariot Deities, the Wolf Fang Fierce Officials, the Six Waves Rolling Water Deities, the Flying Eagle Running Hound Deities, and the Flowing Metal Fire Bell Deities.

Are these the thirty-six deities—or are they the thirty-six thunders? Here, too, doubt cannot be avoided.

Now, as collated from the *Cinnabar Empyrean Scripture of Radiance*, the Winnowing Basket Star governs the celestial thunders; the Chamber Star governs the terrestrial thunders; the Straddling Star governs the aqueous thunders; the Ghost Star governs the numinous thunders; and the Bond Star governs the demonic thunders. The celestial thunders pertain to the Winnowing Basket Star, hence the deities of the Celestial Crow, Celestial Garrison, Celestial Cavern, and Celestial Perfection. The terrestrial thunders pertain to the Chamber Star, hence the deities of the Thunder Master, Pass Earl, Fire Earl, and Wind Thunder. The aqueous thunders pertain to the Straddling Star, hence the deities of the Wood Wolf, Cavern Yang, Metal Essence, and Vast Master. The numinous thunders pertain to the Ghost Star, hence the deities of Reverent Fire, Statutes and Mandates, Shaoyang, and Wolf Fang. The demonic thunders pertain to the Bond Star, hence the deities of Ding Xin, Di Xi, He Lou, and Jia Ye. Thus, I alone regard this as correct.

The thunder methods transmitted from antiquity to the present comprise several grades, their numinous efficacy and manifest proofs resplendent throughout the world and posterity. Thunder and lightning are things that cannot be concealed—who does not know of their existence? Thunder and lightning serve to manifest the majesty of Heaven and to activate the function of the Dao. If the majesty of Heaven were not manifested, how would the destinies of the hidden and the manifest differ, and who would mete out fortune and misfortune? If the function of the Dao were not activated, how would the two qi of yin and yang execute generation and destruction? When the two qi of yin and yang activate the function of the Dao, they manifest the majesty of Heaven; when the destinies of the hidden and the manifest manifest the majesty of Heaven, they activate the function of the Dao. Thus, rewards are not obscured in darkness, nor are punishments concealed in calamity.

As for the altars of the earth gods and the ranks of the local deities, these are all sacrifices; the numinous platforms and ancient traces are all spirits and gods. Among them, there must be both kindness and malevolence. The wealthy chambers and humble servants all partake in sustenance; the upright and the deceitful are all of the same generation. Among them, there must be both good and evil. If spirits and gods commit offenses, to whom shall the generation appeal? If the generation incurs transgressions, how shall spirits and gods make their grievances known?

Alas! It is for this reason that August Heaven establishes the Thunder Citadel, sets up the Thunder Prison, appoints the Thunder Officials, divides the Thunder Governances, dispenses the Transformations of Thunder, displays the Punishments of Thunder, employs the Thunder Spirits, commands the Thunder Soldiers, exerts the Might of Thunder, and wields the Instruments of Thunder—all to grasp the handle of reward and punishment and to hold the power of generation and destruction. In the yin realm, these may seal mountains, breach caverns, slay demons, and restrain toxins; in the yang realm, they may eliminate the inauspicious, execute the rebellious, punish the treacherous, and slaughter the cruel. Thus are the functions of the Dao activated and the majesty of Heaven manifested. Here, the two qi of yin and yang attain their proper deployment, and the destinies of the hidden and the manifest achieve their responsive effects.

Within Heaven and Earth, the myriad things stand established—none fail to receive the yin and yang qi in their ceaseless generation. That which possesses form and thought is human; that which is formless yet possesses thought is a ghost. Humans dwell in the yang; ghosts dwell in the yin. By this, they traverse the Four Modes of Birth and cycle through the Six Paths. Were it not for the thunder and lightning of Heaven, how could punishments be displayed and the obstinate and foolish be corrected?

I, your servant, have been blessed with good fortune since my former existence and have presumptuously joined the ranks of the thunder officials. I have vowed to practice and uphold this without the slightest negligence. On this auspicious day, I prostrate myself and present this memorial, submitting it to the Three Heavenly Courts. I respectfully dispatch the Mute Master of the Wind-Fire Primordial Radiance within the Dharma, the Fire Earl Wind Thunder, the Thunder Master Pass Earl Divine Lord, the Fire Bell Thunderclap Heavenly Immortal, the Azure Fang Iron-Faced Great Immortal, the Dragon Thunder Rolling Water Divine Lord, the Wind-Fire Dragon Rider Heaven-Shaking Sea-Boiling Divine Lord, the Thunderclap Fire Light Silver Fang Dazzling-Eyed Divine Lord, the Reverent Fire Statutes and Mandates Great Spirit, the Thunder Duke Fire Chariot Marshal, the Three-Five Iron-Faced Fire Chariot Great General, the Three-Five Shaoyang Commander-in-Chief General, the Thunderclap Fire Chariot Rank-Smoke Envoy, the Four Sages Hearing and Inspecting Return-Chariot Envoy, the Floating Cloud Descending Hail Valiant, the Horizontal-Body Flying Cloud Envoy, the Mountain-Moving Sea-Overturning Iron-Armored Envoy, the Cavern Wind Drum Heaven-Shaking Might Red Script Envoy, the Wind Hail Metal Bell Fire Bell Envoy, the Five Thunders Flying Swift Envoy, the Thunder Formation Left and Right Envoys, the Scattering Clouds Dispensing Fire Prohibiting Flames Envoy, the Western Terrace Thunder Rain Officer, the Heaven-Bearing Stone-Carrying Grand Tenuity Commanding Might Sword Thunder Spirit Officer, the Four Seasons Wind Rain Command Jade Light Metal Essence Superior Officer, the Demon-Swallowing Demon-Devouring Heavenly Armored Spirit Officer, the Cinnabar Prime Minister of the Ministry of Punishments, the Dragon-Capturing Demon-Seizing Mountain-Shaking Divine Lord, the Sea-Blowing Wave-Raising Numinous Splendor Fierce Officer, the Flying Clouds Running Lightning Spirit Officer, the Grand Year General, the Plague and Pestilence Managing Envoy, the Five Directions Thunder Duke Generals, the Heavenly Thunder Dazzling Light General, the Water Thunder Lightning Flash Six Dragon General, the Left and Right Divine Generals of the Jade Pivot Palace, the Left and Right Divine Generals of the Northern Culmen Palace, the Left and Right Divine Generals of the Penglai Thunder Bureau, the Thirty-Six Thunder Drum Valiants, the Howling Mandate Wind Thunder Great General, the Generals and Commanders of the Various Five Thunders Bureaus, the Officers and Soldiers of the Various Five Thunders Bureaus, and the Five Directions Barbarian Thunder Envoys—all to accompany this memorial to the Capital Palace, where merits and achievements shall be reviewed, diligence and efforts examined. Those recorded shall be promoted; those appointed shall be transferred; those assigned shall be installed; those selected shall be elevated.

On the *xinhai* day of the twelfth month of this year, I shall command the Five Thunders officials, officers, and soldiers to proceed in advance to the Primordial Response Grand Tenuity Mansion to record merits and inscribe achievements. Furthermore, on the morning of the first day of the *bingzi* year, the first day of the Celestial New Year, they shall ascend directly to the Jade Purity to present themselves in audience and petition. On the seventh day of the third month, they shall be permitted to attend the Heavenly Court’s Selection and Reward Assembly. By the morning of the *jiazi* day of the first month, the dawn of the Grand Unity’s Review of Spirits and Deities, the Five Thunders generals and officers shall each attain a merit. Awaiting the morning of the fifteenth day of the first month, the dawn of the Upper Prime Heavenly Mansion’s bestowal of blessings, they shall all proceed to the Northern Culmen Purple Tenuity Pivot Palace to receive their customary promotions, each advancing one rank.

I humbly pray that my ninefold ancestors of the mysterious and my sevenfold ancestors may together attain promotion, and that the spirits and gods of the Three Realms may all partake in blessings and benefits. Thereafter, I vow to pray for clear skies and beseech for rain, to summon snow and raise clouds, to command lightning and call forth thunder, to drive winds and descend hail, to seal mountains and breach caverns, to fell temples and expel demons, to execute and behead dragons, to subdue wolves and tigers, to dispel water and fire, to expel drought and locusts, to exorcise disasters for the people, to drive away evil and cure illnesses, to issue talismanic commands, and to manifest responsive retributions.

May I, your humble servant, beseech Your Majesty to bestow the black essence of the Purple Numinous and Mysterious Unity, allowing it to flow into my three burners and five viscera, filling and overflowing within the Three Origins and Nine Palaces, so that my heart may expand and my body flourish, my spirit become clear and my qi invigorated, that I may study the Dao and attain the Dao, seek immortality and attain immortality.

Your servant, in all foolishness and reverence, through the offices of the Two Palaces’ Direct Envoys of the Orthodox Unity, the Left and Right Palace Envoys, the Yin-Yang Divine Formula Clerks, the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Clerks, the Stalwart Wind Post Riders, the Relay Horse Memorial Clerks, the Flying Dragon Riders, and two officials from each of these ranks, now presents this memorial—a vermilion petition of merit-discussion from the Thunder Bureau—submitted this day to the Three Heavenly Courts, to be forwarded to the Palace of the Supreme Void-Primal Venerable, and to the White Tiger Palace of the Capital Inspectorate. May it be duly reported.

With utmost awe and trepidation, I prostrate myself and bow twice to make known to the Great Clarity’s Mysterious Primordial Supreme Ultimate Great Dao, the Supreme Dao Lord, the Void-Primal Venerable; to the Supreme Venerable Lord Lao, the Supreme Venerable; to the Heavenly Thearch Lord, the Heavenly Thearch Venerable; to the Nine Elders of the Immortal Metropolis Lord, the Nine Qi Venerable; to the myriad, countless, layered Dark Dao’s Twelve Hundred Official Lords; and to the Jade August One of the Great Clarity.

In the twelfth month of winter, on the twenty-seventh day of the *xinhai* cyclical sign, at the auspicious hour, in the eighth year of the *Jiading* reign, *yihai* year of the Great Song, at the southwest corner of the *Chongyou* Abbey on Mount Wuyi, I bow twice and present this.

Your servant, surnamed Bai, a Selected Scholar of the Golden Watchtower, presently awaiting command at the memorial-submitting station.

*Xiuzhen Shishu Wuyi Ji*, Scroll Forty-Seven, concludes.
*Xiuzhen Shishu Wuyi Ji*, Scroll Forty-Eight.

**Master Bai Yuchan of Hainan’s "Song of the Crooked Arm"**

Long ago in the First Palace of Azure Radiance,
I rode a dragon in drunken fury—what cause?
A half-drop from the golden flask spilled,
Unseen, yet the mortal world drowned in flood.

The Jade Thearch raged, demanding of the Divine Empyrean:
"Who dares ride the dragon and stir chaos?"
Since parting from Thunder City with one backward glance,
Heaven and earth have stretched immeasurably far.

Exiled to the dusty world, my heart wavers,
Refining the golden elixir, awaiting the crane’s return.
Once back in the Divine Empyrean to pay homage to the Jade Thearch,
I was reinstated to command the winds and thunder.

The Five Thunders sealed deep within the Jade Clarity Palace,
White cranes summon winds, shrieking through the azure void.
Speak of such hardships,
And the Three Thousand Jade Maidens knit their brows.

The Supreme Heavenly Thearch visited the Purple Clarity,
A million jade maidens crowding like clouds.
I should not have lifted my gaze—
Suddenly, the Heavenly Guards brandished their fire-bells in rebuke.

I bear no grudge against the Jade Thearch,
Yet the jade maidens no longer dance in rainbow skirts.
How could celestial immortals,
Be sullied by a single scattered youth?

Awakened from the dream of Southern Branch, I saw my past folly—
Where the green fades, we parted in flight.
The cold pines vainly lock the jade maidens’ dreams,
While I alone remain unable to return.

The Jade Bureau’s officials are few,
Yet the Supreme Thearch pities my toil.
Suddenly, an edict descends, hastening my return—
Apes wail through ten thousand mountains, the white clouds drift empty.

The Queen Mother of the Jasper Pool feasts the immortals,
Two orchestras of reed pipes and songs crowd the brocade banquet.
Mistakenly, I plucked a single immortal plum to eat—
And once more descended to the mortal world, years uncounted.

I have not been in the human realm a hundred years,
Yet it seems but a moment in the Three Heavens.
Once I was an officer of thunder and lightning,
Now cease doubting—what sort of immortal am I?

In days past, I roamed carefree on Mount Taihua,
Feasting on jade nectar, gazing at jasper blossoms.
Clad in a six-ounce robe,
I knew not the mortal world had ramie hemp.

Having attained the rank of celestial immortal,
Thrice I was cast down from the heavenly steps by divine censure.
Weary of heaven’s many offices,
I sought instead the grottoes of the mortal world to wander.

White clouds follow me to Mount Tiantai,
Then turn back along the Golden Flower Road.
At the Perch of the Phoenix, I lingered,
While wild apes wailed below Mount Wuyi.

Let the clear wind and bright moon know:
In Yangzhou, there is a crane I cannot ride.
Last night, before the Five Phoenix Tower,
I watched the white clouds drift aimlessly in the sky.

Disheveled hair, tattered robe,
When vexed, I drink and recite poems in drunkenness.
I’ve wandered the dusty world unrecognized—
I am the son of the Eastern August Thearch.

Twenty years have passed in vain,
My flesh too heavy to ascend to heaven.
I shake my sleeves and laugh at myself,
My purse empty—not a single coin.

I carry a pearl at my side,
Seen, it seems present; sought, it vanishes.
When the golden rooster crows, none see me,
Only the moon’s cold light fills the Great Void.

I know not sutras nor sit in meditation,
Hungry, I eat; weary, I sleep.
If the Jade Thearch does not favor me,
I remain a mortal, my bones untransfigured.

I do not cast my gaze upon the vulgar,
My empty self roams the Five Lakes and Four Seas.
In the depths of the grotto-heavens, none tread,
By the stream, how many springs have the peach blossoms seen?

Seas turn to mulberry fields, fields to seas—
Such words are hard to believe.
Yet one thing surpasses me:
The king knows not such leisure.

**Inscribed at the Perch of the Phoenix**

Before the pavilion, jade-like greenery forms dense thickets,
The phoenix perches in the branches, mist and rain dissolve into emptiness.
A single note of flute or pipe, yet none sleep—
The bright moon bathes the entire grove in clear wind.

Sounds of zither and harp, wind stirs the pillow,
Shadows of jade-like trees spill across the moonlit courtyard.
A white phoenix alights beyond the branches to roost,
Deep in the night, it punctures the verdant grove with light.

Bamboo has for years tended wind and moon,
How many nights has the phoenix lodged in clouds and mist?
A guest in the grove plays the flute and departs,
The bamboo transforms into a dragon, the phoenix ascends to heaven.

At the Pavilion of the Pan Clan, I drank through the night,
Drunk, I faced the bamboo and played the jasper flute.
Who knows how many phoenixes have come?
The phoenix gone, the man departed, the bamboo stands desolate.

**Night Discourse at the Pavilion of Pure Excellence**

The dying lamp blossoms like crimson filling the hall,
Wine’s fervor unspent, poetry’s passion surges.
Cold clouds and moth-like stars seal the emerald sky,
A grove of bamboo whispers to the night wind.

The reclusive scholar leans on the tower, whistling like a jade dragon,
Cicadas weep dew, falling upon the parasol trees.
Hand in hand, we discourse on literature, opening our hearts—
Sweet slumber beckons, our words left unfinished.

Incense coils like flying serpents through the curtains,
Neighboring roosters herald dawn—where is the bell?
Rubbing my drunken eyes, I grasp the railing,
The tea kettle cold, I summon the jade youth.

Three companions in straw sandals, seven-foot staffs,
Tread through green mountains, how many layers?

**Night Feast at the Pavilion of Pure Excellence, Presented to Ni Meichuang and Daoist Wu Yinnan**

Before the mountain, a resounding song—my voice dries,
A long whistle pierces the Gate of Azure Clouds.
Master Meichuang brings a hundred flasks,
Through the night we converse, autumn rain turns cold.

Lamps glow red, casting jade insects in intricate patterns,
The Daoist roars, slapping the bed in laughter.
Sharing a couch, Yinnan and I strike a pact,
Eager to see serpents slither across the paper.

Setting down the cup, I strain my eyes, seized by poetic frenzy,
Seizing a brush, half-dozing.
Laughing, I dip Kunlun in the vast sea,
Writing tens of thousands of new verses.

**Inscribed on the Wall of the Pavilion of Pure Excellence**

Two rare blossoms, one censer of incense,
A heart untroubled, thus pure and empty.
On the wall, a zither; on the bed, a sword—
A resounding song, a slow, ethereal chant.

My aspirations beyond the mundane are inherently refined,
The mountain pavilion’s pure excellence suffices for all things.
I pour myself three or two cups of wine,
Play three or two games of uncontentious chess.

**Again Inscribed at the Pavilion of Pure Excellence**

A grove of bamboo whispers in the night wind,
From the southern pole, a single point of cold pierces the void.
A jade censer exudes rare fragrance, distant as the Jade Palace—
Here, one knows there dwells an immortal elder.

Within the Pavilion of Pure Excellence, secluded and exquisite,
A white-bearded Daoist holds a sandalwood tablet.
His brows lift, parting the clouds over the stream,
His gaze flashes, shattering the moon atop the peaks.

On the jasper chamber’s wall hangs a jade zither,
After dancing with the sword, a heart of ancient times.
Parted from Penglai, drunk, I played the flute—
Today, upon meeting, I sing a long ode.

Heavenly spirits rebuke the Dao, green mist rises,
Before me, Wang and Zhao all wear pearl-studded slippers.
The weary dragon coils its tail, the green serpent dies—
With a flick of the finger, the Milky Way pours forth.

A single flourish of the cinnabar talisman sends gods and ghosts fleeing,
Thunder and lightning shake heaven and earth.
Truly, such marvelous efficacy was unknown in ancient times—
Yet still, it has not been gathered to the celestial thoroughfare.

The moon is cold, the wind clear, a white crane cries,
A jeweled censer scatters rosy mist toward the distant Jade Flask.
The Master of Mount Wuyi delights in poetry and wine—
Once I saw you, but now you are gone.

**Inscribed on the Hall of Pure Emptiness**
The moon shifts, casting flower shadows beyond the window,
The wind carries the sound of pines to the pillow’s edge.
After dancing the long sword, I brew tea and taste it,
With a new poem composed, I embrace the zither and sleep.

Fresh wine is poured like green snail marrow,
Incense coils burn like purple horsewhips.
At the head of Nine-Bend Stream stands the Temple of Divine Protection—
Within the Hall of Pure Emptiness dwells a transcendent.

**First Encounter with the Lazy Old Man’s Poetry**
A handful of spirit soars far beyond the dust,
The Lazy One is no ordinary man.
Tao Yuanming’s pines and chrysanthemums remain evergreen,
Xie Lingyun’s pond and grasses are in spring’s prime.

He has already planted *gouqi* in the fields of magic mushrooms,
No need to grind the mossy steps with a chariot’s wheels.
The family’s robe and bowl are passed to dragons and phoenixes,
He himself points to the ice-pure flask, heir to Yingbin.

**Two Poems Presented to the Lazy Old Man**
Autumn’s mirror reveals stars at my temples,
Everywhere, streams and mountains are Dongting’s expanse.
Fierce rain strikes the lotus, tilting the green pond,
A gale snaps the bamboo, flinging it over the wall.

Purple swallows take flight from the water-chestnut isle,
White gulls tuck their necks to sleep on the desolate shoal.
I don a bamboo hat to seek the Lazy One,
Bringing a breath of crisp air through the lattice.

The Lazy Old Man and Old Bai form a bond across years,
Autumn enters the misty, sparse-rain sky.
Drunk, he dreams a perfect black-sweet dream,
At times, he lets the grass-script run wild.

Leaning on his staff, he repays the debts of streams and mountains,
With cups of wine, he befriends the wind and moon.
The Green Lad gallops across the moat,
The Wooden Clerk weaves heroic verses.

Jinhua is but a handful in size,
Yet it holds two immortals of poetry and wine.

**Six Six-Character Poems Presented to the Lazy Old Man**
The weary one coldly dwells on Guye,
The layman loftily sleeps in Vimalakirti’s realm.
Dull in poetry’s covenant and wine’s pact,
He merely burns incense and sips tea.

When the wine turns foul, he sniffs the flowers,
When sleep is deep, he pours tea to wake.
Autumn arrives on the wutong branches,
Night brings the sound of wind and rain.

His golden body is green as bamboo leaves,
The Jade Maiden white as lotus blossoms.
Hearing you are slightly unwell, body freed,
I lean on my staff, wishing to visit your home.

Lotus and herbs resent the wind’s havoc,
Rice seedlings gain spirit from the rain.
Recalling Mount Wuyi’s Nine Bends,
Last autumn, I poled a boat along the stream’s edge.

Drunk, I transformed into a butterfly on my pillow,
Awake, my brush gave birth to serpents.
Long days, my heart is free of cares,
When hungry, I merely dine on rosy clouds.

Autumn rain recognizes sorrow in segments,
Evening clouds pass before the eyes like blossoms.
The Phoenix Perch Pavilion stands desolate,
Yet Mount Wuyi once had immortals.

**Arriving Drunk at the Lazy Old Man’s Study and Singing**
Freshly opened white wine, lotus pods bought,
Poured full, tung oil shines in the jade vat.
The Moon Maiden peeks through the green canopy,
The Wind Spirit gently stirs the emerald gauze window.

You suspect I am today’s Huangfu,
I fear you are the old Pang of yore.
After drinking, I spit pearls that stick to the paper,
Laughing, I pit my brush’s strength against others.

**White Lotus Poem**
Yuanming returned to the Western Heaven,
No longer part of the Eastern Grove’s community.
No sign of Zhang Changzong,
No one speaks of this.

Whose home planted the green lotus,
Scented winds ripple the jade waves?
Beneath the waves, crystal emptiness,
From which emerges the Jade Mansion’s maiden.

Graceful, silent, and delicate,
Her ice-like skin bears the morning’s rain.
The Eastern Lord is like summer’s sun,
Yet this flower feels no heat.

A single point of natural fragrance,
Following the wind into the painted hall.
Plucked and placed in the corner of the seat,
She entices the jade-like gentleman.

Suddenly, my mood shifts,
As if gazing upon a beauty’s face.
I send word to the Pavilion of Bright Moonlight,
Do not house the pair of flying swallows.

**Failed Elixir**
Eight ounces of sun and moon’s essence,
Half a catty of cloud and mist’s fragments.
Light as a swan’s feather,
Heavy as a thousand scales of iron.

White as snow in the sky,
Red as a gibbon’s blood.
Gathered into a jade gourd,
Sealed, not daring to leak.

At midnight, sudden wind and thunder,
Smoke fills the vast emptiness.
Such flavor and feeling—
A mute bites his tongue in silence.

Clutching my belly, I laugh,
Lest my heart and brain grow fevered.
Better to mend my fishing rod,
And cut another section of autumn bamboo.

*The Forty-Eighth Scroll of Cultivating the True: Wuyi Collection Concludes*
*The Forty-Ninth Scroll of Cultivating the True: Wuyi Collection*

**By Bai Yuchan of Hainan**

**To Grand Preceptor Wang**
Laughing, you stride from the palace gates,
A single long whistle turns ten thousand peaks green.
Returning, carriages and horses crowd like clouds,
Sweeping away court stars—awake from a dream.

Ruby agate cups brim with white wine,
A coral pillow leans against a vermilion screen.
Yet you must seize this strength to study,
To become one of the Tang’s five transcendent sages.

**Matching Lu Gen’an’s Rhyme**
I once stood at the head of the morning court,
My office as cold and clear as autumn skies.
Wind, flowers, snow, moon—worth a thousand gold coins,
Water, bamboo, clouds, mountains—worth ten thousand households.

The sea traveler’s pact with gulls remains unbroken,
The frontier elder’s lost horse seeks no more.
Beyond the bright window and upright desk,
Butterflies flutter through the dream of *Huaxu*.

**Inscribed on Zhang Zhineng’s *Xiu Ran* Pavilion**
Untouched by the world’s slightest dust,
A solitary man dwells in quiet seclusion.
On clear nights, a saint beneath the wine jar,
By day, poems from his brush move the gods to tears.

Tender grass grieves the hoe’s green purity,
Fallen blossoms, unraked, love their crimson evenness.
Chess sounds sever the path to *Huaxu*,
As he burns incense in the *Boshan* censer at dusk.

**Matching Ye Zai’s Rhyme on *Zhen Wujiu* Studio**
Snail-horn, fly-head gains—how detestable!
Why ask again of profit and fame?
Learn the wondrous precelestial Dao of high antiquity,
And embrace the single sincerity of the *Doctrine of the Mean*.

Heaven and earth are the sun and moon’s ancestors,
*Kan* and *Li* are the essence of sky and earth.
When study reaches *Zhen Wujiu*,
A single word uproots the thatch, riding the great *Tai* prosperity.

**On the Autumn Equinox, Thinking of Clerk Chen**
A noseless, earless leaf falls—
Where is the wind that maddens and topples?
Ninety days of heat swept clean away,
The sweat in my breast already vanished.

I trouble the astute Judge Pan,
To tell Clerk Chen, our Friend Long:
If tonight brings no rain, the moon will be fine—
One cup of wine must still be shared with you.

**Fifty-Six Characters Composed in a Dream**
Drunk and sober, I lean on my staff to visit Pine Pass,
Just at dusk, amid deepening mist.
Departed, yet returning—autumn’s lingering heat,
Seemingly absent, yet present—mountains in the rain.

By the stream, a few late blossoms fall,
At the sky’s edge, a crescent moon bends.
I sense the lingering smoke burying my sandal teeth,
Step by step, imprinting the moss’s mottled traces.

**In Hu’s Hidden Hut, Lamenting Spring**
I leave all creation to *Zhurong*,
As the Eastern Emperor returns to *Taihua Palace*.
Mountains stand sharp as green jade,
Waves shimmer, soaking bronze’s sheen.

Willows reach the sky—doves summon rain,
Crabapples fall to earth—butterflies shun the wind.
Best to take staff and sandals to the western garden,
Where ten thousand purples and reds vanish in a single night.

**Sending Spring Off from the Lodge of Rest**
Poems flow naturally from the brush, rich with material,
Heaven’s craft carves fine mountain streams.
Fish, knowing the water’s warmth, leap without cease,
Orioles, seeing flowers fly, cry endlessly.

The tree-top turtledove’s wife calls for rain,
Bamboo behind the hut teaches its shoots to rise from mud.
After ten cups of *Taibai*, one is dead drunk—
At the mouth of the Peach Blossom Grotto, the sun sinks west.

**Occasional Lines in Hu’s Winning Hut**
The Daoist is used to eating sesame rice,
Arriving in the world—how many years has it been?
Before the White Jade Tower, the moon of night is empty,
Above the Purple Gold Hall, spring mist rises.

Leisurely, he pours a cup of *Zhonghuang* wine,
Bored, he sweeps a thousand chapters of *Neijing* scriptures.
Last night, *Zhongli* passed down kind words,
Teaching me to become an earth-walking immortal for now.

**To Old Fan of Tiantai**
Since parting, how many springs have startled us?
Meeting again, we laugh, embracing the southern breeze.
Ashen-faced, dust-covered—no one recognizes us,
Refusing to eat grass-cloth, disdaining worldly fuss.

In Zhe’s Tiantai, you’ve long resided,
Your name, Fan Bing, unknown and obscure.
I send these new poems to you,
To deliver to Zhao Cuiyun of Qianshan.

**To Wu Caoqiu**
I hear that on Green City Mountain lives Old Hao,
His words, entering my ears, now ten years past.
By chance, with the carefree traveler and the joyless maiden,
I came to Tiantai and met him.

His clothes are plain hemp,
His speech all alchemical texts.
I think you are already over a thousand years old—
Who says immortals do not exist in this world?

**To Vice Minister Su**
Past and present shift like shoulders,
I suspect you are Su Shi reborn.
The whole city lacks a single *Bo Le*—
Could there be a day without a *Le Tian*?

Just now discussing literature, we part abruptly,
Unknowing when we’ll clasp hands again.
Suddenly, an iron flute sounds—
Its notes reach the ancient grottoes of Jinhua.

**Painting of the Heaven-Opened Library Tower**
Layered eaves rise into the azure void,
A thousand peaks, ten thousand peaks, sending and welcoming.
Clear clouds, already wiped away, linger unfinished,
At the stream’s end, the last glow of sunset gleams.

Nature’s craft, morning and night, applies its touches,
Ink and colors shift in depth and hue.
Leaning on the railing, I stretch my thousand-mile gaze,
Yet grieve that this scroll cannot be fully unfurled.

**To Master Wei**
I once saw you on Jiuhua Mountain,
Morning feasting on jade milk and jasper flowers.
At night, a deer-horn cap beneath the moon of Green City,
At dawn, a crane cloak draped in purple palace mist.

Occasionally, you carry a sword in the human world,
Yet have not taken your zither to the immortals’ home.
Laughing, we meet amid pines and bamboo,
Burning incense, sipping tea, sharing new words.

**Visiting Yangzi Cliff**
Halfway up the sky, autumn wind sighs through ten thousand pines,
Qiang flowers half-fallen in the reddening sunset.
Hermitage smoke veils the ancient immortal altar,
Wild grass hides the empty cinnabar cauldron.

Where do people gather purple mushrooms?
I come at noon, yet find no one.
A single note of flute and pipe—laughing, I raise my sleeves,
Autumn’s hues fill my breast, my poetic mood thickens.

**After Visiting Yan Cliff, Parting with Its Master**
The west wind blows me to this cliff’s wanderings,
My eyes brim with emerald pines and bamboos.
Jade swallows do not fly on moonlit nights,
A stone bell’s chime startles the frosty autumn dawn.

Alas, we part—north and south diverging,
Suddenly turning back, torn between leaving and staying.
Go first to the human world to prepare elixir ingredients,
Then return to the mountain’s peak to build a thatched hut and rest.

**Inscribed on the Shu Family’s *Nan Lao* Pavilion**
A separate cave-heaven in the human world,
Stalwart pines rise in dense, auspicious mist.
Virtue like cassia seeds, unaware of the years,
Fortune like flowing water, endless in time.

Before the *Xuan* grass hall, affairs of a thousand ages,
Atop the lotus pond, two immortals.
The man in *lai* robes, playing with colors, remains unharmed—
He weaves all the streams and mountains into green wind and moon.

The thirty-third heaven’s first day,
Beneath the Jade Emperor’s palace, wispy smoke curls.

Unknowing of kalpas, what era is this now?
Just the second year of Yan Kang’s reign.
Weak waters admit no boat—homeward bound like an arrow,
While Hua Xu’s dreams invite a roaming immortal’s play.

Seated before the *Nan Lao* Pavilion, staff in hand,
I kindle incense and steep tea in emerald depths.

**To the Lute Guest Lu Yuan-zhang**
A shard of frigid crystal in hand,
Ten fingers strike and pluck like jade’s chime.
The tune plays *White Snow* and *Yang Chun*’s mode,
Its melody the sound of lofty mountains and flowing streams.
Pine tops echo crane cries at midnight’s half,
Cold mist hangs still, the wind’s chill whisper.
Paper quilt and tile pillow cold as water,
Tossing sleepless, no dream comes.
Rising to scratch my head, I strum one piece,
Chanting done, the autumn moon illumines the mountain.

**Inscribed on the Hermit’s Lodge**
Fine pines, fine bamboos, fine streams and hills,
Carriages and horses throng, coming and going.
Travelers hear the new wine’s white froth,
Entering, they tread through tender moss’s speckled green.
I say this pure seclusion beyond the world
Is yet like a bustling marketplace’s clamor.
Valleys’ grain and mulberries fill empty huts,
The host attends guests, never idle.

**Rainy Inscription at a Traveler’s Inn**
Wind stirs the vast sky, autumn rain hangs,
The road slick as moss, I lazily shake the whip.
Entering, I bid the servant buy a cup of wine,
Grind ink, lean by the window, chant a verse.
Yellow bamboo beneath the far eaves, yellow ants war,
White reeds mirror the water where white gulls sleep.
A long whistle, then I depart,
Turning back, the lone village fades in evening mist.

**Golden Immortal Pavilion at Immortal Crag**
Cold mist seals the Brahma-king’s abode,
A single censer’s smoke coils like a coiling snake.
Autumn rain falls like jade flowers across the sky,
The clear stream swells green, submerging level sands.
Ancient pines and jagged rocks vie in height,
Green vines drag trees, veiling clouds.
Bamboo roots upturn, crow wings aslant,
Midnight’s cold wind stirs roosting crows.
The wooden fish calls for congee, butterflies wake,
At the cliff’s edge, the waning moon sinks into the cinnabar well.

**The Indolent Hut**
Once a name in the Scarlet Towers’ pure capital,
This life drifts, carefree, following nature’s truth.
Across the window, an ancient inkstone holds water of bygone ages,
On the wall, a neglected lute gathers days of dust.
Leave the creeping grasses unweeded, still by the stones,
Let fallen blossoms lie unbrushed, even with the moss.
Enlist the wind as a gate-keeping servant,
Borrow the moon as a wine-companion.
Histories and classics hold silent, ancient savor,
Barriers and mountains stand unmoved, a painting’s spirit.
With tea at hand, I’ll not wage snail wars,
Without dreams, I’ll not take a butterfly’s form.
What idle matters occupy me?
Beyond the eaves, birds know the same spring.

**The Joyful Studio**
A recluse’s retreat amid pines and bamboos,
A small hall reclines beneath the northern mountain’s shade.
Deep night, the cold moon chills the thatched door,
Dawn’s rise, the clear wind refreshes the paper quilt.
Grasping the sword, I drink wine from the cup’s face,
Stowing books, I disturb the wall-hung lute.
Since glimpsing Fuxi’s visage,
Who through the ages has known the nurturing of a vast heart?

**Heavenly Valley Hermitage**
Halfway to heaven, a singular peak juts,
A tiny thatched hut holds rich savor.
Flanking the path, new pines beckon the night moon,
The grove’s dense bamboos summon autumn winds.
Wild birds greet with intricate calls,
Rock flowers vex with their riotous red.
Leaning on my staff, I follow the flowing stream,
The brushwood gate often sealed by white clouds.

**The Chamber of Descending Perfection**
Jade chimes resound, colored incense swirls,
Beyond the window, azure birds cry at midnight’s half.
Pines and bamboos, silent, vie for earth’s stillness,
Stars seem pluckable, the sky feels low.
Golden chariots rise at the yellow-clouded eave’s corner,
A jade ladder unfurls from the moonlit roof’s edge.
Bowing to the Purple Emperor after the first feast,
The *bu xu* chant fades, begging for the elixir’s measure.

**To the Indolent Hut’s Lu, Vice Officer**
Mountain hues congeal in layered emerald clouds,
Crow cries startle the setting sun to red.
I’d carry the lute to play beneath autumn’s moon,
Or snatch the chessboard to move with the evening breeze.
Once drunk and asleep, I know affairs grow few,
Several chants clear, the heart feels empty.
The Indolent Hut keeps no company,
Its barred brushwood gate holds rich savor.

**Lu Shu-yu’s Pavilion of Pure Poverty**
Utterly carefree, heedless of heaven,
At five *zhang*’s height, the sun lingers, yet he sleeps on.
Stream fish and village wine hold uncommon savor,
Wild greens and mountain grains cost no coin.
An urn for a window, a painted gate blocks the narrow path,
Dry firewood and white rice boil in clear spring water.
Sometimes leaning on a staff by the verdant pines,
He is the human world’s blissful immortal.

**The Inferior Recluse**
Worldly warmth and chill sting the nose,
The cave’s gate stands ajar, green mist chills.
Grasping a three-foot sword, I dance in the wind,
Holding a lute, I play to the moon.
I hew bamboo to let water pass,
Lean on pines half the day, clasping scriptures.
In the heart’s leisure amid mountains and forests,
I refine the elixir of deathless life.

**The Forty-Ninth Scroll of *Ten Books on Cultivating Perfection: Wuyi Collection* Concludes**
**The Fiftieth Scroll of *Ten Books on Cultivating Perfection: Wuyi Collection***

**Written by Hai'nan Bai Yuchan at Simwei Hall, Visiting Lingbao Abbey**

At Simwei Hall within Lingbao’s sacred precinct,
A pact of subtle alliance, a covenant of steadfast intent—
Thus named, I chant:

Within Simwei Hall, emptiness reigns,
A lofty scholar’s retreat, where tastes diverge.
Moon cold, a few blossoms bloom in stillness,
Wind clear, a lone crow’s cry traverses the void.
Who knows the marvel of the heart’s work?
Seeking a world untouched by worldly burdens.
Has the ninefold inner elixir formed yet?
Swiftly ride the white crane to Heaven’s thoroughfare.

**Inscribed on the Wall of the Upper Clarity Method Hall**

Autumn rain hangs from the sky, wind sharpens the cold,
Chill mist seals the mountain above the eaves.
A bird darts past the half-cliff’s edge,
Sheer crags sever clouds—timeless leisure.
The vulgar know not this secluded quiet,
Where immortals hide between being and non-being.
Last night, the skiff’s pole slipped from my grasp,
Drunk, I cast the frosted rod into the emerald bay.

**Hall of Great Emptiness**

The hall stands cool and still, refreshing the spirit,
Unstained by a speck of the human world’s dust.
Eaves magpies clamor in the wind, calling dusk,
Courtyard blossoms scatter dew, lingering spring’s end.
The land of Hua Xu holds no dreams now,
Yet in the Dragon Han’s first kalpa, this body once was.
Incense smoke drifts beyond the window,
A lone crane’s cry—who calls from the cloud’s edge?

**Returning Elixir Poems of the Three Flowers Abbey**

The Crimson Palace lies at ease, free of dust,
Kan’s tiger and Li’s dragon wage countless battles.
White snow flies through the void as lead blooms,
Yellow clouds shroud the crucible as mercury flowers unfold.
Tortoise and serpent embrace unity, forming the elixir,
Raven and hare congeal truth, shaping the sacred embryo.
At midnight, beneath Yingzhou’s cold moon,
A chill wind carries the crane to Penglai.

**Three Poems Sending Off Jiang Zigong**

I wished to build a thatched hut by Yang Village,
Yet my traces drift once more to rivers and lakes.
Looking back, a footstep seems as distant as the sky,
Since parting, barely a month has passed.
In fleeting moments, I think of old friends,
Across a thousand miles, I long for word.
The memory of you lingers, unbearable to forget—
A wisp of blue cloud dots the great void.

Spring arrives, traversing lush fields,
Clouds fill the spring sky, water brims the streams.
Wind ripples green waves, barley sways,
Sun shines, red rain falls on peach-lined paths.
The cuckoo’s cry fades, startling the cold hare,
The butterfly’s dream ends, roused by the dawn cock.
You dwell east of the river, sending word home—
As crabapple blossoms fade, swallows carry mud.

You reach Lead Mountain, I remain in Xin Prefecture,
The bamboo sedan creaks, then rests once more.
Through misty rain and slanting winds, the road winds,
A scattering of fallen blossoms grieves the cawing crow.
Why weep like Ruan Ji?
Come, wander with Red Pine instead.
One day, when I ascend Penglai,
Will you follow, bearing a grain of golden elixir?

**Sending Off Master Zhang**

Since you left Mount Wu,
How many perils and hardships have you endured?
On the Jiang’s left bank, rain has dogged your travels,
Spring’s deep roads slick with moss.
Crows cry, petals drift on flowing water,
Wind howls, gibbons shriek from ancient terraces.
Lifting your gaze, four mountains stand like walls—
Even you, returning, may find your heart ashen.

**Presented to Du Xingyuan**

Beyond the seas, three mountains form a grotto-heaven,
Golden towers and jade chambers house immortals.
In Nanke’s land dwells the Cassia Rock Elder,
By White Horse River, Horse Ziran.
Whale flesh, sweet, feeds the aged Guang,
Yellow hemp rice, ripe, nourishes Peng Qian.
The golden elixir refined, the furnace holds no fire—
How many years since the peach bloomed again?

**Niqingfu of Dan’an**

Secluded land, idle folk, spring days stretch long,
All is forgotten—self and world alike.
A thin moon’s light draped over returning to the poetry shop,
A gentle breeze sliced into the realm of drunkenness.
Wax-flavored streams and mountains, leisurely chewed,
Water-shield broth with pine and bamboo, savored in stillness.
Plucking the lute, I shatter worldly affairs,
A pure desk, bright window, a single burner’s incense.

**Nijingfu of Keshan**

Dusk clouds stretch across green slopes, the sun slants,
The song tower’s echoes fade, crows call beyond the woods.
Green bamboo sways, shadows dancing in the wind,
Peach blossoms bloom in profusion amid the rain.
Three cups of pale wine invite the bright moon,
A half-finished game of chess startles the falling glow.
On Keshan’s heights, he chants,
Laughing, wields his brush, ink strokes writhing like serpents.

**In Response to Poems Presented by Jiang Zhiguan**

New geese arrive, trailing a wisp of cloud,
Reading them, my hair stands on end, my scales bristle.
Unfurling grand lines, a few strokes of ink,
I envision the master’s face, all smiles.
On the couch, guests and friends speak of noble virtue,
In the mountains, the capped and gowned mingle with the mundane.
Tomorrow, I’ll wash my hands, tend the incense burner,
Fearing you may be an acquaintance from Penglai.

**In Praise of the Bell**

I hear the numinous palace is to cast a bell,
The August Emperor bestows ten thousand catties of bronze.
A single mold’s release—no trifling matter,
For a thousand ages, know the alchemy’s craft.
Struck, stars scatter, the moon falls,
Rung, clouds part, the wind howls.
Now, to extend our sovereign’s years,
I point and laugh at the jade towers clinging to the azure sky.

**Jingtong Abbey**

Beyond Jingtong Abbey, clear clouds are locked,
Walls gleam like flying jasper, tiles layered like scales.
Wild birds, unconcerned, cry at dawn,
Cliff blossoms, intentional, bloom through the four seasons.
Carved from wind and moon, a land of immortality,
Seizing mist and rosy clouds, a body that never ages.
Since Master Xu Jing departed as an immortal,
I wonder to whom he entrusted the elixir’s secret.

**Dan’an**

All my life, I sought only joy in purity and emptiness,
Claiming the quietest dwelling in the human world.
An ancient wall bears a three-foot sword,
A secluded window holds a bed of books.
Distant mountains brighten as the sun rises,
Withered trees chill as the wind combs them.
Savoring the subtle flavor of leisure,
I gather clouds and mist for sustenance.

**The Rockery**

When were these groves of bamboo planted?
Strange stones and patterned bricks cradle green moss.
Feathered guests wander the crags, arriving with the rain,
Immortal elders pluck herbs, parting the clouds.
Mount Tiantai still arches like brows,
Ma Dang remains open like eyes.
Last night, pearl-gatherers reported
The isle of Penglai lost beyond the sea.

**Prayer for Rain Answered by Marshal Zhou**

Drought demons scheme, demanding the *yu* rite,
When will the true man bring rain?
First, present the phoenix memorial to the golden palace,
Then cast the iron talisman into the dragon pool.
With a flick of the finger, thunder roars in three peals,
Lifting my gaze, clouds rise in an instant.
Laughing, I adjust the Dipper’s handle,
Tipping the Silver River to spill ten thousand bushels of pearls.

**Parting Lines for Master Geng and Hermit Wu**

A Chance Meeting on Verdant Heights

A shared laugh as we meet in emerald mist,
Green locusts and towering willows lend their cool.
My heart stirs with waters, bamboos, mist, and clouds—
Let winds, blossoms, snow, and moon be the ones who know.

The sun sets; three cups of idle wine,
Idle hours yield eight lines of effortless verse.
Tomorrow, clouds will drift beyond the blue peaks—
Shall we turn to hear only gibbons and cranes sigh?

Meng Valley

Pale mist lightly binds a few pines,
Night deepens, the ancient valley wind sighs.
Clouds veil the grass, unfolding green in the ravine,
Birds carry fallen blossoms, crimson on the jade cliffs.

Since immortals departed, no golden sword remains,
Since officials arrived, jade paulownias stand.
Who will now retreat to these secluded peaks?
Southward, a few lone summits brood in silence.

Plum Window

A southern window frames a few eaves,
A touch of warmth stirs to life.
Branches bear snow’s lean grains,
Walls catch the wind’s pure chill.

Frost-laden wine warms itself,
Moonlit dreams refuse to form.
From where does the flute’s note come,
Sending its few strains at dusk?

Zhang Jinfu’s Quiet Lodge

Shedding the world, he sleeps amid clouds,
His breast holds another heaven.
Five or six couches line the walls,
Two or three rafters span the roof.

Wind and moon offer true savor,
Streams and mountains wear their old green.
In stillness lies true stillness—
Gibbons cry at dusk along the forest’s edge.

Reflections on the Start of Autumn

Years fly swift as arrows,
Sun and moon leap like pellets.
The Fire Emperor relinquishes his seal,
The White Emperor dons his cap once more.

Just as we rejoice in the end of heat,
We are made to dread the coming cold.
Life is but this—
Unbidden, the nose stings with sorrow.

Lei Yizhen’s "A Recluse’s Farewell to Spring"

Heaven would not keep spring,
The Eastern Lord steals away unseen.
On the emerald paulownia’s boughs,
A sighing wind bears rain.

Awakening from Traveler’s Slumber

Clouds pile jade upon the mountains,
Rain entreats the grass to deepen its green.
A single dream of Southern Branch—
Suddenly, a crow’s call rouses me.

On the Four Immortals

Han Xiang:
White snow fills the night sky,
A single golden sprout heralds spring.
After returning from Blue Pass,
What care for the world’s folk?

Chen Qi:
A scroll no one can read,
A thousand goblets shared with guests.
Peach blossoms bloom, nearly spent,
Yet still he lingers by the cold crags.

He Xiangu:
No trace in the celestial gardens,
Yet the Tang annals record her name.
Who knows the Red Jade Grotto?
A thousand years echo with night gibbons’ cries.

Cao Guojiu:
He stole the Jade Capital’s peach,
Trampled the capital’s grasses to dust.
White snow fills his straw cloak—
Within lies the treasure of the golden elixir.

Inscribed at Hu Yungan’s Villa

Boredom turns to bamboo; flowers are scorned,
Idly gazing at mountains, I raise the blind.
A fine bird’s cry wings past the eaves,
A pure breeze lends its strength to the silver toad.

A single brazier at Mount Bo, its small snakes chilled,
No one else sits alone on the rush mat.
The brushwood gate is entrusted to the wind’s latch—
Beyond the eaves, white clouds come and go.

On Han Xiang

Your uncle played the part of death to the hilt,
Emerging from the snow with no thought for the world.
Fortunate to have that basket of blossoms from years past—
Even now, it’s passed to some idle monk.

The Solitary Firefly

Night still, I sit frost-chilled by the water pavilion,
A lone firefly flickers among the grasses.
In a flash, it skims the silver pond’s surface—
Two stars of floating light, now high, now low.

*Cultivating the True: Wuyi Anthology, Scroll Fifty* concludes.
*Cultivating the True: Wuyi Anthology, Scroll Fifty-One* begins.

**Composed by Bai

I come to mourn with this verse as Liu Miaoqing entered the waters and departed.
On the Miluo River, the waters gurgle and sigh—
fish and turtles know not the old dragon’s weeping.
In vain do we ply the dragon boat, seeking where?
Why not prepare a single oar from Qu Yuan’s living hand?

By the Wu Hou Temple on the banks of the Great Yu River,
evening sun fills the trees, crows cry out.
Passersby burn paper money here—
why not pour a cup of wine from Wu Zixu’s living days?

Since the deaths of Qu and Wu, the world has grown desolate,
yet their names endure through the ages as if but a single dawn.
By the river, how many shed tears?
Their icy souls and snowy spirits cannot be summoned back.

Alas, the Daoist Liu Xinyue—
his body was poor, his nature fierce.
Though in youth he fell into the wind and dust,
in the end he awakened sharply and cast it all aside.

His heart was noble, yet his name reeked of filth.
One day he died by the banks of the Wuyi Stream,
and with the waters of the Nine-Bend Brook,
washed clean a body heavy with a thousand sorrows and ten thousand hates.

Cao E sought her father’s corpse and drowned herself,
dying as a heroine’s spirit among women.
Liu Cui and Xiao Qiong both perished in the waters—
all that remains is a vast, empty stream.

Why could you not endure a little sorrow,
only to bind your heart with resentment?
Your jade-like flesh sank into the emerald pool,
as the wind howled at dusk and the waters flowed emptily.

The Nine Bends of Wuyi Stream—
none cast their lines, the waters flow in vain.
The thirty-six peaks of Wuyi—
none weave thatched huts, only the mountains remain.

By moonlight, I sought but found no trace,
only the ceaseless cries of mournful apes.
How much worse when a night of pattering rain falls,
forcing one to chant every sorrowful verse.

Enough, enough—Xinyue, you too were wise.
A hundred years of life are empty if one does not die.
Overturning the Four Great Elements, startling fish and dragons,
you trampled the depths of the jade-green pool to shatter the sky.

Li Bai rode a whale to seize the moon,
He Zhizhang slept beneath the waters amid frost and snow.
Even the ancients passed away in the waters—
all mastered the art of transcending life through water.

I, bound to Xinyue as his disciple,
come here as the mist swirls in sorrow.
The sky is vast, the waters cold, a thousand mountains dark—
I pour a libation of water, my heart heavy with grief.

The west wind blows these two streams of molten iron,
turning them into the urgent notes of a flute’s song.

**A Record of Cultivating Immortality and Building the Immortal’s Palm**
A stream stretches green, emerald bamboo rustles in the deep forest;
two banks encircle the blue, jade-green moss carpets the earth.
This is where the flying tin staff alights, where the phoenix mounts,
a dwelling where clouds linger and cranes rest.

Mandarin ducks transform and manifest,
palaces of lapis lazuli carved with grains of rice.
Butterflies array themselves like agate walls.
Those who meet here are all immortals—
in the end, they grasp the affairs of the mountain forests.

For the recluse of the Smoke Pot, a high-minded scholar,
I seek the *Complete Writings on the Marvelous Awakening of Emerald Emptiness*—
a single scroll.

At this moment by the river,
a lone maple leaf drifts beyond the pale clouds and crescent moon,
evoking the essence of autumn.
For the mountain hermit, both heart and landscape are clear and refreshing.

Long have I admired Han Jing and Li in the midst of water and clouds—
south wind and north branch, yet never face to face.
The Master of Hainan said:
The high-minded scholar of the Smoke Pot refines the Great Harmony,
his body brimming with white marrow,
heavenly maidens scatter flowers,
his Dao awaits true purity—
ancient harmony unites mouth and heart.

At the Ying Mountain Daoist Abbey,
I hear of the *Complete Writings on the Marvelous Awakening of Emerald Emptiness*.
Amidst my thirst, he could have aided me—
has this man returned?

Autumn’s chill fills my staff and sandals,
all the more so in these six hundred *li* of pure and wondrous streams and mountains.
Will you whip your blue ox, drawing near the boundless,
to visit me at Kongtong’s gate?

With a sidelong glance, we speak of golden friendship,
craning our necks, we await the early rounding of the embryo.
A cloud-borne crane lets out a long laugh—
and that is all.

White Jade Toad of Hainan’s *Ode to Yearning for Immortals*

The divine lad has departed—
the immortal’s jade pendants, far gone.
Alas, our parting words lost in the fleeting moment of clasped arms,
leaving me unable to forget.

Stirred within, I compose *Ode to Yearning for Immortals*,
to express my humble admiration and sincerity.
On the twenty-seventh day of the seventh month, the eighth year of Jiading.

I yearn for immortals—my divine companions,
their rosy robes swaying—where do they dwell?
To see a crane’s long cry would yet suffice,
for Penglai lies but half a step away.

Yet only their calligraphy lingers among men,
each line of characters like autumn geese in formation.
Their words of sincerity and integrity were wondrous,
who could fathom such formless intimacy?

*Ode to Seeing Cranes*

At midday in the Three Flowers Abbey,
suddenly twelve cranes—black-robed, white-gowned—
soared, cried, and danced above.
Thus I composed *Ode to Seeing Cranes*,
presented to Ni Meichuang and Vice-Palace Lu.
On the twenty-third day of the seventh month.

Immortal paintings on paper hang on ancient walls,
day and night veiled in smoke.
Clay-molded Zhongli, wooden-carved Lü,
are not the Primordial Sovereign of the Great Dao.

In this dusty world, no elixir formulas remain,
the mute Daoists all refuse to speak.
The Scattered Man of Wuyi does not shame the immortals,
he seeks only three bowls of snow each day.

White cranes, white cranes—whence do you come?
When will the cinnabar steps and crimson gates open?
Do not cry out in vain in the empty sky—
how swift the cold wind and drifting clouds!

When the cranes call, I have no ears;
when they spread their wings, I have no eyes.
Penglai is but half a step away,
yet I spend my life as an old porter.

*Inscribed on the Wall of Yulong Abbey*

Master Jingyang departed in the great peace of the Kang era,
the stone turtle’s ashes cold before the ancient cave.
Laughing, he slew the white dragon on the smartweed shore,
drunk, he rode the yellow crane through the clouds.

The golden elixir and jade fragments are no more,
yet the iron sun and stone casket remain.
Where now are his forty-two household members?
Only the apes’ cries on Western Mountain, the smoke of cypress trees.

*Ni Zhaoqing’s Rhapsody Presented to the Divine Lad Ye*

The divine lad Ye abandoned Confucianism to follow Master Red Pine,
his Dao lofty, his virtue pure—
his form like earth and wood,
his spirit towering and unadorned,
truly one among immortals.

By chance, he returned after praying for rain,
and I deeply regretted not keeping pace,
apologizing for my inadequate companionship in his refined discourse.
I craft these verses to convey my longing,
hoping earnestly for his instruction.

The divine lad’s appearance is pure and wondrous,
his Dao transmits the teachings of the Recluse.
After three years in the chamber, his elixir is ripe,
his skin radiant, supple, glowing.

He ties silk to cover himself, content in abundance,
the gleaming purple mushrooms can sate his hunger.
He leaps into the gourd—none see him—
morning he roams the Five Peaks, evening the Jasper Pool.

At times he mingles in the world of dust,
his short hair in a topknot, his beard flowing.
In an instant, dragons and snakes spring from his brush,
his inspiration poured into new poems.

I suspect he delights in the tranquility of mountains and waters,
returning to his old retreat, hanging his cap low.
I wish to ride the floating clouds to the azure vault,
to ascend the crimson gates and follow him forever.

*Again*

How divinely gifted is the divine lad—so wise!
With ten scrolls in a single breath, his fame grows.
Were he not Li Taibai of the Tang,
Jingtong the Perfected would be reborn.

His words strike like thunder from stone, startling all present,
his treasured scrolls soothe the multitudes.
The Eight Trigrams and Five Phases serve his art,
the golden elixir and great medicine form naturally.

His coarse sleeves outshine embroidered silks,
his silver hooks astonish ghosts and gods.
The immortal mountains are fit to retain his jade pendants—
why must he walk atop Penglai’s peak?

*Song of Longing for the Divine Lad*

His noble spirit soars, untethered—
who could restrain him?
His fragrant verses, like trailing vines—who plucks their wonders?
I alone, entranced, am lost in rapture,
regretting I cannot swiftly behold his purple-mushroom brows.

I gaze for the beauty at the edge of the sky,
face unknown, yet heart acquainted.
The blue ox does not cross—how I envy Hua’s bridle,
the golden waves still—his pure wine forgotten.

His lines stand tall, radiant as a rainbow’s molt,
the Dipper and Northern Stars dare not shine.
The black apes howl at the trees, the fine steeds draw back,
the frost-feathered magpies fold their wings—ghosts and gods grieve.

The celestial pipes sound—not by human breath—
how could they mingle with frogs and worms in the filth?
When may we clasp hands and discourse on the mysterious?
The peaches of immortality are not yet ripe, their fragrance elusive.

Golden tablets and jade scripts lie scattered,
green clouds lock the branches of the soaring forest.
Exiled to the dusty world, he departs the jade steps—
the mundane dust and vulgar vapors are not his place.

Worldly ties remain unfinished, like boiling gruel,
vainly he startles the maidens and infants.
When will the jade melodies of the azure heavens take flight?
The green phoenix long promised a feast at the Jasper Pool.

One day, riding deer, we shall follow,
before the Jade Bamboo Mountain, together we’ll gather mushrooms.

*Postscript*

Alas, how many years have I yearned for the Dao,
scouring all elixir texts to learn immortality.
Lead and mercury blend without method,
seeking golden connections lacks karmic affinity.

I toil over *The Transmission of the Dao*,
yet bathing fails to enlighten me to *The Awakening to Reality*.
The jade formulas have never been annotated—
do not waste effort poring over paper relics.

A half-word lightly received from a perfected one’s teaching
demands a single backward glance at rivers and mountains.
Diligence in practice follows yin and yang,
reversing and cycling, distinguishing before and after.

The Yellow Dame’s matchmaking—how could it depend on the spleen?
The golden essence soars—not confined to the elbow.
If one can seize the true essence of heaven and earth,
only then may one endure as long as heaven and earth.

Respectfully inscribed by Zhao Ruqu, Cultivator of Emerald Clouds,
Acting Magistrate of Chong’an County, Jianning Prefecture,
after burning incense and bowing his head.
