**The Direct Pointers Personally Transmitted by Master Bixu**

From my youth, I studied the Dao. In early manhood, I left home, wandering rivers and lakes to seek the essence of virtue and the Dao. I recited and deeply pondered the alchemical classics, verses, and records of past masters since Ancestor Zhang Ziyang, exploring their words for meaning. I also sought out those who had attained the Dao, exhaustively investigating its essentials. Later, I traveled through famous mountains and great rivers, sacred grottoes and blessed lands, praying before stone inscriptions and steles. In my later years, I met Master Haiqiong, who imparted the essentials of the Great Dao. I also encountered the Recluse Anran at the Red Mound Grotto-Heaven, who composed various chapters to bestow upon me, through which I finally grasped the profound teachings of Master Haiqiong.

Only then did I realize that in my youthful studies, all I sought, heard, and saw were but "building a house beneath a house" and "grafting branches upon branches"—never understanding that a house is simply a house, and a branch merely a branch. This matter lies right before our eyes; why seek it afar? Now, I transmit it to you. You must interpret the words to grasp their meaning, awaken sharply, and apply effort—no need for doubt, for the Dao resides within!

The Supreme Dao cannot be named in words; the Supreme Spirit cannot be grasped by thought. What can be named is not the Dao; what can be imagined is not the Spirit. The Spirit is endowed by the Dao, harmonizes with nature, roots in yang, is empty and numinous without trace, manifests without fixed form. It transcends beyond heaven and earth, which cannot confine it; it emerges beyond the reckoning of past and present, which cannot exhaust it. Truly, it is real and most real, mysterious and profoundly mysterious.

In man’s four great constituents and one body, all belong to yin—only the primordial qi is yang. This qi is not the breath of exhalation and inhalation, nor does it have visible form or shadow. As the ancients said: "When seen, it cannot be used; when used, it cannot be seen." Before this qi received form, while still in the womb, one first received it, then the two kidneys and two eyes were born, from which the heart, liver, spleen, and lungs arose, followed by the nine orifices and four limbs, forming the complete human image.

This qi resides precisely in the emptiness between, called the Gate of the Mysterious Female. The details can be found in the *Song of the Mysterious Female* by the former masters. Nowadays, people slaughter sheep and observe the space between the two kidneys, where the lumbar region has an empty membrane. Within it, qi breathes and pulses, extending to the flesh before ceasing. When this qi is alive, blood and qi flourish, hun and po unite, inwardly containing the five colors, with warmth like boiling water. When a person dies, blood and qi scatter, and this aperture becomes depleted. This qi is the great elixir of golden cinnabar.

Thus, the masters say: To regard the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, intestines, gallbladder, essence, fluids, snivel, saliva, qi, blood, and humor as the Dao is incorrect. To consider spirit, essence, hun, po, and intent as the Dao seems plausible but is not so in reality.

In the human body, the left foot corresponds to greater yang, the right foot to greater yin. The soles of both feet are the Bubbling Spring, emitting the two qi of water and fire. These ascend from the feet to the Tail Gate, merging at the two kidneys. The left is the Kidney Hall, the right the Essence Palace—one water, one fire, one tortoise, one snake, mutually interlocking. Between the two kidneys lies an empty aperture, called the Mysterious Female. The qi of the two kidneys passes through the Mysterious Female, from which the qi issues forth via the yellow and red pathways. It ascends along the double passes of the spine, traversing the twenty-four vertebrae, penetrating the heart and abdomen, entering the Gao-Huang, converging at the Wind Mansion, and ascending to the Mud Pill Palace. From the Mud Pill Palace, it descends to the Bright Hall, dispersing to irrigate the Five Palaces, then flows down the Heavy Tower, returning to its original palace. Day and night, it circulates endlessly, all naturally so—it is not something achieved by manual effort.

Yet today, people stray into side paths, unaware of the principle of emptiness and naturalness, the silent operation of the Dao. Instead, they recklessly engage in bending, stretching, exhaling, rubbing, guiding, and visualizing, giving rise to deluded thoughts and actions, thereby inviting illness. Like the White Lotus Daoists, each grows sallow and emaciated; like the Qi-Cultivating Daoists, all suffer from parasitic diseases. These are the proofs.

The qi within the human body is the same for all, neither more nor less. Those who cultivate it succeed; those who do not, fail. Its circulation, coming and going, has a fixed rhythm, like the tides, which respond unfailingly to the waxing and waning of the moon. The Dipper’s handle in the heavens shifts naturally from midnight to noon. Like a woman’s menstruation or a patient’s malarial fever, it arrives punctually without fail.

This qi, when encountering yang, becomes yang fire; when encountering yin, becomes yin water. Fire is the fluid of wood; water is the essence of metal. The left kidney is Kan (Water), containing Wu (Yang Earth); the right kidney is Li (Fire), containing Ji (Yin Earth). Wu and Ji, the two earths, combine to form the solar jade. It is also called "metal within water." Metal is the "blade," hence it is named the "blade jade." Fire is wood; water is metal—metal and wood are inseparable, water and fire share the same realm. This metal, wood, water, and fire are all one earth, and this one earth governs the five phases.

The masters say: "The five viscera lack qi; the six bowels lack essence"—this is precisely what they mean. This qi revolves ceaselessly, naturally, without need for human effort. When speaking of the "three chariots of rolling and turning," the "Yellow River," and "Cao Creek," these are metaphors—such things cannot be achieved by human force.

It always arrives at midnight as yang fire, at noon as yin tally, at dawn as the fluid of wood, and at dusk as the essence of metal. Within dawn lies Jia (Yang Wood), within dusk lies Geng (Yang Metal)—thus, one must gather and employ Jia and Geng. Within midnight lies Wu (Yang Earth), within noon lies Ji (Yin Earth)—thus, one takes the true earth from midnight and noon. In truth, it is one and the same.

To gather and employ, one uses Jia and Geng; to circulate fire, one is not bound by Zi and Wu. Without a natural and thorough understanding of the ascent and descent of Qian and Kun, the waxing and waning of yin and yang, the maturity of medicinal materials, and the subtle movements of water and fire, one is not fit to discuss these matters.

Yet masters have explained this in great detail, and later generations remain confused; they have spoken concisely, and later generations grow doubtful—why is this? It is because they cling to emptiness and do not know where to begin their practice, resulting in failed fetal breathing and a lapse into mere vacuity. Or they neglect naturalness and become mired in forced delusion, wasting their spirit and mind, even inviting illness.

"Emptiness" refers to what cannot be seen or heard; "naturalness" refers to what can be met and gathered. Now, the methods of gathering, employing, and firing are transmitted step by step with utmost precision—simply adhere to them faithfully, and verification will follow.

The oral instruction states: Before entering stillness, one must first arrange and prepare the gathering of medicinal materials. Day and night, practice seated meditation. Once settled, the bones and joints open, the meridians unblock, and from the bladder to the spine, movement arises like a turning wheel. The primordial qi naturally ascends through the three passes to the Niwan Palace, descends the *Chonglou*, and enters the *Jianggong*. Yet its arrival has its time, and gathering too has its time. One must wait for the flourishing hours of Mao and You, sitting in silent composure without forceful stirring. Soon, warmth rises to the crown, and sweet dew flows in the throat, dripping ceaselessly. Then, with the eyes turned inward and the mind guiding it, direct it straight into the *Jianggong* to rest.

Within a single day, Jia corresponds to the waxing moon. From Zi to Mao is the waxing half, yielding half a catty of mercury; from Wu to You is the waning half, yielding half a catty of lead. Gather half a catty each of Jia-mercury and Geng-lead—this is the natural measure. As the saying goes, "When lead meets Gui, it begins to grow—gather swiftly." During the Jia and Geng hours, wood-mercury and metal-lead are born; one must gather them at these times—this is what is meant by "gathering."

Yet in gathering, one does not count years or months. Only after long accumulation does the crucible and cauldron form. The body itself is the furnace; the spleen is the Yellow Court, and the Niwan Palace atop the head is the cauldron. Once the crucible and cauldron are complete, one may plant the medicine.

When the medicinal material first arises, gather and refine it simultaneously. Gathering and planting it makes it medicine; refining and completing it makes it fire. Gathering yields a *zhu* each day; refining yields a catty each day. When gathering medicine, one must select the flourishing qi of Jia and Geng. The method of firing, however, avoids the *muyu* (bathing) phase. These differences exist, yet the method of gathering is like setting the cauldron—one merely follows what comes naturally, meeting it with intention and guiding it with the eyes. Thus, the alchemical classics speak of the "Yellow Matron and the Blue Robe." The Yellow Matron is intention; the Blue Robe is the eyes. Meeting with intention is called "the Yellow Matron’s matchmaking"; guiding with the eyes is called "the Blue Robe’s transmission."

The qi of the human body moves when intention moves and stops when intention stops—unobstructed and unceasing. This is called "planting the medicine," which enters the cauldron, after which the firing process begins.

The ancients said, "The sage transmits the medicine but not the fire." This is not to say the fire is not transmitted, but that fire and medicine share the same source yet follow different paths, share the same nature yet serve different functions. Thus, Zi is the first yang, and from Zi to Si, fire completes six numbers, forming Qian. From Zi to Si, one guides it with intention—this is called "advancing the fire" or "adding."

Wu is the first yin, and from Wu to Hai, water completes six numbers, forming Kun. From Wu to Hai, one need not meet it—this is called "retreating the fire" or "withdrawing." Fire is spoken of, not water, because advancing is fire, and retreating is water. This occurs naturally, without human effort, so water is not mentioned.

When the alchemical classics refer to the numbers of the *Hetu* and *Luoshu*, they speak of the firing process naturally aligning with the generative numbers of the hexagrams—not that one must forcibly apply these numbers. When they speak of "morning *tun*, evening *meng*, day *shen*, night *fu*," it is to say these moments silently align with the hexagrams, not that one must strive to match them through effort.

As for the circulation of qi, it flows and irrigates the five viscera and hundred meridians. Hai and Zi flourish the kidneys; Yin and Mao flourish the liver; Si and Wu flourish the heart; Shen and You flourish the lungs; Chen, Xu, Chou, and Wei flourish the spleen. Naturally, this qi circulates, emerging from the flourishing palace—one need not deludedly imagine that at this time, this viscus has this qi, moving in and out.

Yet in the initial stages of gathering and forging the cauldron, there are no prohibitions—act when the time comes, and rest when done. But when entering the medicine and circulating fire, one must choose an auspicious day to enter the chamber, avoiding all mundane affairs. Let the ears, eyes, mouth, and nose forget the four images; let day and night become one, without the slightest gap. The chest should be vast and empty, the inner chamber bright.

If one clings to anything, the hexagram’s structure weakens, and the medicine leaks away. Once in the chamber, one must not seek sleep but remain awake throughout. Wakefulness is yang; sleep is yin. One must always remain alert, constantly vigilant, restraining joy and anger. Anger scatters yang; joy invites yin to overpower. Even the slightest trace of yin will disrupt the yang spirit; even a *zizhu* of yin is a ghost.

Eat until half-full, avoiding rich and fatty foods. Let the five flavors be mild and bland; warm and well-cooked is best. One must follow one’s nature, harmonize with the seasons, and unite with qi. Take emptiness as the city, tranquility as the domain, great harmony as the chamber, stillness as the sun and moon. Abandon the false mind, preserve the true mind. When the medicine appears, gather it; when the fire arises, circulate it.

Within a year, one must refrain from circulating the fire during the second and eighth months (卯 and 酉), for in the second month wood flourishes and fire blazes, while in the eighth month metal prevails and water surges. Apart from these two months, one need not circulate the fire; doing so would only cause harm. Of the twelve months in a year, excluding the second and eighth as periods of "bathing," ten months remain—hence the saying that the embryo is formed. Once pure yang is fully attained, one must no longer circulate the fire, for doing so would damage the elixir. Instead, the work should be transferred to the *Niwan* (Mud Pill Palace), known as "tending the cauldron." At this stage, the fetal immortal has taken form, like a child already born, requiring only nourishment. From this point onward, one need only nurture and warm it, without further need for fire circulation or bathing. After three years and nine months of such practice, the Celestial Gate will open of itself, and the infant spirit will come and go freely, ascending to the heavens. Thus, "tending the cauldron" is but the act of nourishing. This entire process of cultivation, from beginning to end, unfolds naturally, without reliance on forced effort or deluded thoughts—one need only meet the moment with intent.

It is through the accumulation of days and months, the forging of the cauldron and the establishment of the furnace, and the ten months of gestation with fire circulation that the embryo is formed. Yet the master speaks of "a single grain of golden elixir, radiant as the sun"—why? Because a moment’s effort at the right time can seize a year and a half of natural transformation. When the medicine arises and the fire arrives, one need only greet it in an instant—hence the saying that it is accomplished in a moment. Yet the golden elixir is not something that can be forged through days and nights of strained effort and deluded striving.

The terms—medicine and furnace, fire circulation and bathing, fetal breathing and infant spirit, the operations of withdrawal and addition, guest and host, punishment and virtue, floating and sinking, rising and descending, lead and mercury, water and fire, true earth and the *daogui* (knife-spoon), golden essence and wooden fluid—are all but different names for the same thing. Though the interlocking cycles of the scriptures may be familiar and their words easy to speak, putting them into practice is difficult, and maintaining them is most difficult of all.

Generally, minor methods of side paths yield no karmic response, but the golden elixir alone brings verification. When one gathers the medicine, the young must practice for half a year, those in middle age for a full year, and the elderly for three years—utterly forsaking desire, forgetting thoughts, and sitting in silent stillness. After gathering, when the season arrives, the ears and eyes grow sharp, the hands and feet light and strong, and all illnesses vanish. Naturally, the qi of the two kidneys arises, pressing against the spine like a turning wheel; the *Niwan* feels as if bathed in boiling water; the mouth constantly fills with sweet dew, drop by drop. The spirit remains wakeful, all stray thoughts extinguished. Within a little over two months, the sun and moon generate spiritual light, and the heart becomes clear—yet one must not mistake this for the ultimate Dao, lest wild thoughts arise and madness take hold.

After three months of fire circulation, if the work is unceasing and precise, the seven orifices become luminous, and the golden wheel shines within and without, reaching even to spirits afar. At this time, the infant spirit takes form, but one must not yet allow it free movement in and out; rather, one must guard it closely and firmly, lest the fire leak and the elixir fail. When the ten months of fire are complete and the qi is fully received, the process unfolds as naturally as a melon ripening and its stem loosening. Then the infant may come and go, moving a yard or so from the body—but it must not wander far. Upon exiting, it must be drawn back at once, lest it stray and become lost, leading to rebirth in another’s body without return.

Only after three years and nine months, when the time is fulfilled and the bones have aged like those of a child of several years, will the infant understand the weight and depth of worldly affairs and may be allowed to come and go freely. At this stage, one achieves transformation and flight, attaining the rank of a true immortal. Yet even then, demonic obstacles may arise. When one truly enters the chamber and sits in forgetfulness, strange phenomena will manifest—all manner of marvels and wonders in the world may appear before one, as if seen for the first time with the eye of wisdom, or as if divine spirits have drawn near. At this, one must neither rejoice nor be startled, for these are but demonic illusions and not the essence of the Dao. One must grasp the mechanism, still the thoughts, and concentrate on unity, guarding the true form. One must not mistake the false for the real or indulge the passions as nature. By thus holding to the One, the demons will vanish of themselves, and the Dao will be accomplished.

Many, lacking steadfastness and insight at this stage, are seized by external evils, unable to proceed, and instead fall into madness, folly, or even calamity. Thus do later generations dismiss the path of immortality as empty and elusive—what a pity! Once the ten-month embryo is formed and the cauldron is transferred for warming, one must seek the next step upward. This matter is addressed in the *Wuzhen Pian*’s lower scroll on the method of advancing in cultivation, where rare encounters naturally arise. This does not depend on transmitted oral secrets.

As for flying ascension or liberation from the corpse, these occur after the elixir is formed, when one further cultivates great merit according to the depth of one’s practice—this is not a matter of transmitted oral instructions. Those who wish to cultivate this elixir method must proceed step by step. If one acts recklessly out of order, the body will lack the embryo, the infant spirit will not form, and one’s vain pursuit of Chan learning will be like water without a source or wood without roots—leading to a stubborn emptiness that yields no achievement even in old age, ultimately returning to the cycle of rebirth.

After sixty days in the chamber, signs will appear. One must follow the instructions precisely and never interrupt the practice. As the Dipper turns and time shifts, the qi settles and the realm grows still. The mechanism is engaged, the work continuous and unbroken. If weary, one may ascend to the celestial pool to irrigate, allowing the natural ebb and flow. Clouds and mist arise without confusion or delusion, and the numinous light manifests—neither rejoicing nor startling, but simply rolling up the beaded curtain with both hands.

Maintain perfect discipline over all worldly concerns—joy and anger, thought and sorrow, hunger and thirst, cold and heat. Let neither drowsiness nor torpor enter sleep, and keep the mind-king ever luminous. When thirsty, sip lightly the *Decoction of Four Gentlemen* or *White Wood Decoction*. As soon as one sleeps, qi transforms into blood and cannot ascend. Remaining wakeful and alert allows yang qi to rise!

The eyes of ordinary people are nourished by the liver, for the heart governs spirit. This is why the eyes of immortals are jade-green, their hue dazzling. Those who cultivate the Dao must not sleep deeply, for sleep strengthens yin qi, turning it into blood that enters the liver and fails to ascend and nourish the eyes—thus they cannot attain natural numinosity.

I grieve that among those who discuss the Dao, only one or two truly grasp it. I have long wished to transmit it, yet none were aligned in affinity. Now, by chance, I meet you, and our inclinations harmonize. Had you not carried some seed from a past life, how could you comprehend even a fraction? Today, I impart all I have received, recording each step with meticulous care. You must ponder deeply in stillness, seek meaning within the text, and await the proper time to begin practice—then, without fail, you will achieve success.

We shall meet again in four cycles at the appointed place; do not lightly disclose this. Strive diligently! My spoken instructions must remain in your heart, never forgotten. The words I set down in writing should be recited often. Each time you open this scroll, imagine your teachers standing above you—do not treat it lightly.

If you have not yet begun practice, first calm the mind and hold fast to the mechanism below. Never recklessly transmit this to the unworthy. If someone is fit to receive it, you may reveal a rough outline, but do not withhold it from the deserving. To violate this is to invite great misfortune!
