# 修真十书黄庭外景玉经注卷

**The Fifty-Eighth Scroll of the *Ten Books on Cultivating the True: Annotated *Huangting Waijing Yujing* (Outer Radiance Scripture of the Yellow Court)**
*Annotations by Liang Qiuzi*

When Laozi dwelt in leisure, he composed verses of seven characters.
Laozi, born before heaven and earth, enduring beyond them, possessed thirty-six titles and seventy-two names. Emerging from the womb of Mother Li after eighty-two years, he thus composed the *Huangting* to bequeath to later generations.
The Dao cycles endlessly, completing itself by nature.
When one worthy is found, kneel and transmit it.
If none are worthy, remain silent for ten thousand generations.

**Explication of the Body’s Form and Its Myriad Spirits**
Laozi, serene and natural, roamed the eight directions, elusive and unfathomable, his transformations boundless. Of his own accord, he grasped talismans and recorded them, overseeing all spirits.
The Dao admits no duality—its perfection is thus. The Dao has no second parent—it ever abides with the virtuous.

**Above lies the Yellow Court, below the Gate of Origin.**
The Yellow Court resides within the head: the Hall of Light, the Grotto Chamber, and the Cinnabar Field—these three are the Upper Elixir Field.
First, between the brows, one *cun* inward is the Hall of Light; two *cun* is the Grotto Chamber; three *cun* is the Cinnabar Field—these three form the Upper Origin.
The Yellow Court, born of the two halves within the Grotto Chamber, gives rise to the Crimson Child, who becomes the True Person. Constantly contemplate this; guard against loss. The Crimson Child transforms into the True Person in the Hall of Light, named Zidan. Thus, the One dwells in the Hall of Light.
Circulate qi through guiding and pulling, close the eyes to gaze inward, calm the mind and settle the will. In the boundless chaos, refine the essence to ascend to the Muddy Pellet, moving the True Person Zidan.

Within the Hall of Light are ruler and ministers; in the Grotto Chamber, father and mother; in the Cinnabar Field, husband and wife.

**Another Explication:**
The Yellow Court is the spleen, over a *chi* in length, situated above the Great Granary, three *cun* above the navel. The spleen, as the Yellow Elder Lord, is the central spirit, governing within it.
The Gate of Origin lies three *cun* below the navel, the portal of primordial yang before it. Suspended essence shines like a mirror, illuminating the entire body—unceasing, this is the Dao.
Behind it lies the Dark Gateway, before it the Gate of Life.
The Dark Gateway is the two kidneys, like overturned cups, adhering to the spine, three *cun* from the navel, smaller above and larger below. The Gate of Life of sun and moon is also below the navel.

**Inhalation and exhalation enter the Cinnabar Field between the hut of the nose.**
Breathing: exhalation is the emission of qi, inhalation its intake. The hut is the nose, the essential path of expelling the old and drawing in the new. Three *cun* inward from between the brows is the palace of the Cinnabar Field—drawing qi from the nose to enter the Cinnabar Field.

**The Jade Pool’s pure water irrigates the numinous root.**
The Jade Pool is the pure water, the saliva in the mouth. The numinous root is the tongue. One should constantly tap the teeth, rinse with fluid, and irrigate the root of the tongue.
Those who diligently cultivate this may endure forever.
If one practices day and night without ceasing, one may attain longevity.

Within the Yellow Court, a person dons crimson robes—
Visualize the spleen as mother and child, entering from the stomach’s tube into the spleen, clad in red.
The Gate’s bolts and locks secure its double doors.
The gate of the lower Cinnabar Field must never be carelessly opened.

The Dark Watchtower stands towering and majestic—
The two kidneys reside at the gate of the Watchtower, the tower of the earthly palace, the mansion of generative qi.
Above, they connect to the ears; the ears flank the head, hence their lofty height.

Within the Cinnabar Field, the essence-qi is subtle—
Three *cun* below the navel, its form spans three *cun* in breadth and depth.
Its qi is wondrously delicate: preserved, it remains; forgotten, it vanishes—easily lost, hence called subtle.

The Jade Pool’s pure water engenders richness above—
The Jade Pool is the mouth; the pure water, the saliva within.
When saliva gathers upon the tongue, it is called richness.

The numinous root stands firm, never aging nor withering—
The numinous root is the tongue’s root; constantly curling the tongue and tapping the teeth,
practice this without allowing the tongue’s root to wither.
Ever abide in its spirit, and longevity will never fade.

Within the Central Pool, a knight wears crimson robes—
Constantly visualize the crimson-clad infant within the heart, dwelling in the Cinnabar Field,
clad in red silk. In times of fortune or crisis, it may be summoned.

Three *cun* below the field, the spirit resides—
This refers to the spleen, situated below the upper burner of the stomach, above the navel,
where the numinous root’s spirit abides.

Inner and outer must be sealed with double closure—
One must guard one’s essence and preserve it, never recklessly expending it,
as if sealing it with a golden lock and jade bolt.

Within the Spirit Hut, cultivation must be tended—
The Spirit Hut is the nose; the hairs within must be regularly trimmed and removed,
so that when qi flows through the nose, evil is dispelled.

The Suspended Breast’s qi-tube receives the essence-tally—
Beneath the tongue lies the essence-tally; the throat is the qi-tube.
Essence and qi descend from above.

The Upper Prime unites in wondrous subtlety—
The Perfected One ascends and descends the spirit’s path.
Swiftly secure your essence to sustain yourself—
One must restrain qi, return essence, and preserve it, never recklessly dispersing it.
Returning essence to replenish the brain is the Dao of immortality.

Within the dwelling, a knight ever wears crimson—
Constantly visualize the heart’s spirit clad in crimson cinnabar robes,
moving in and out, warding off all misfortune and repelling every evil.

Should you perceive it, you may remain free from illness—
Focus your mind’s essence, meditate without cease,
and if you inwardly behold the crimson infant, the body shall know no sickness.

It lies horizontally, a *chi* in length, binding its summit—
The spleen stretches over a *chi* in length, covering the Granary’s upper reaches.

Should you guard it, you may remain free from harm—
Constantly nurture the spleen’s spirit, meditate without cease,
and you shall know no calamity or illness.

Inhaling and exhaling through the hut’s gate to repay oneself—
Draw qi through the nose, swallow it through the mouth,
and the primordial qi will moisten and nourish, thus repaying Heaven’s bounty.

Preserve and guard it with perfect firmness, and the body shall receive blessings—
Safeguard essence and nurture qi, and the body’s spirit shall gleam with radiance, hence called receiving blessings.

Within the square inch, meticulously store and conceal—
The square inch of the Cinnabar Field: concentrate on preserving essence and qi,
tending it with care and purity, as if sealing a treasure.

Spirit and essence return, and old age reverts to youth—
Return essence to refine the form, replenishing the brain’s qi,
teeth grow firm, hair darkens, and the body does not age.

Guide the Dark Watchtower’s flow to its completion—
Draw the crimson infant from the Hall of Light downward to gaze upon the Crimson Palace,
aligning with the navel’s center. Transform the hexagrams so that essence flows into the Cinnabar Field, nourishing the form.
Also visualize the qi between the two kidneys ascending and descending,
drawing breath from above to the Yellow Court.
(One day, the space between the brows shall serve as the Dark Watchtower.)

Nurture the Jade Tree’s child to strengthen it—
Constantly guard the lower prime’s essence and qi, sealing it as firmly as jade.
Preserve essence and spirit, and it shall flourish like a sturdy branch.

The supreme Dao is unhurried, without haste—
Free from confusion or disorder, calm the mind and settle the intent,
directing one’s course toward the noon hour.
With the back facing noon and the waist aligned with mao and you,
the Spirit Terrace connects heaven and overlooks the central wilds—
The heart is the Spirit Terrace, above connecting qi to the brain’s gate,
below linking qi to the spleen’s center.
Its qi circulates throughout the entire body.

Within the square inch, down to the Pass’s base—
The throat spans a *cun* in width; within the Hall of Light,
the Perfected One descends to harmonize with the Cinnabar Field,
then ascends again to the Hall of Light.

Within the Jade Chamber, the spirit’s gate and door—
Yin and yang are the spirit’s gate and door, governing essence’s restraint.
In men, it is called essence; in women, restraint.
Men store essence; women regulate the monthly flow—hence called gate and door.

All these were taught to me by the Duke’s son—
The heart is the Grand Duke; the left kidney, the Minister of Education;
the right kidney, the Minister of Works.
All receive essence and qi, never to be leaked.
Abiding in the One, one may perceive them.

The Hall of Light’s four directions reach the ocean’s source—
An inch above the brows lies the Hall of Light, where qi flows in all directions,
like the ocean’s boundless origin.

The Perfected One, Child Cinnabar, stands before me—
The crimson infant is the Perfected One, named Child Cinnabar,
dwelling within the Hall of Light. Constantly meditate upon it, and longevity may be extended.

Within the Three Passes, essence and qi run deep—
The Passes comprise three parts: the Heavenly Pass, the mouth;
the Earthly Pass, the lower body; the Human Pass, the two hands.
Grasp and seal the Three Passes firmly, and no evil qi shall arise.

Should you wish not to die, cultivate Kunlun—
Kunlun is the head. Nurture the brain’s mud-pill,
and you shall not die but attain longevity.

The Crimson Palace’s tower rises twelve stories—
The throat’s twelve rings lie above the heart, forming the Crimson Palace.

Within the palace’s chambers, the five qi gather—
The qi of the five viscera: the heart, as sovereign, resides at the center,
while all spirits assemble beside the crimson infant.

The Crimson City’s child stands within the Central Pool—
The Crimson City is the heart; the tongue is called its child; the mouth, the Central Pool.

Below lies the Long Wall of the Dark Valley’s town—
The small intestine is the Long Wall, guiding qi into the bladder.

Longevity’s essential subtlety lies in the bedchamber’s urgency—
The essence of nurturing life lies in sealing the essence-gate.
Abandon lust and desire, focusing solely on preserving essence.

The *cun*-field and *chi*-dwelling may govern life—

The eyes are the *cun*-field, the face the *chi*-dwelling—
To govern life, gaze upward to the upper realm, where the One Spirit abides.
Bind the child to long remain, the heart at peace.
Ever contemplate the form of the crimson child,
so that the hun and po remain constant, the myriad spirits unshaken.
Serene and desireless, the heart knows no fear—
thus it finds its own tranquility.

Observe the will roam with the spirit through the Three Wondrous Luminaries—
Guard the upper realm’s numinous root: the tongue;
guard the middle realm’s numinous root: the navel;
guard the lower realm’s numinous root: the essence-chamber.
At leisure, without cares, the heart is at great peace.
Serene and still, embracing emptiness and passionlessness,
the body finds tranquility, the heart great peace.

Ever preserve the Jade Chamber, and the spirit’s clarity will flourish—
The Jade Chamber is the spirit’s gate and portal;
ever preserve the qi’s coming and going,
and the spirit’s clarity will naturally unfold.
Often contemplate the Great Granary, and hunger and thirst will cease—
The Great Granary is the stomach, the kitchen of the five grains;
contemplate it often, and hunger and thirst will no longer arise.
Summon the Six Ding spirit-maidens to attend—
When the sovereign contemplates the Perfected within the Yellow Court,
the Six Ding Jade Maidens will come of their own accord to guard and serve.
Seal the essence-path, and long life may be attained—
Sever ties with the profane, forsake the vulgar,
and close the essence-path to achieve longevity.

Within the central chamber, the spirit dwells—
The central chamber is the Hall of Light and the Grotto Chamber.
Ever contemplate the crimson child born within it,
and you become a Perfected One.
Hold this thought, and it remains;
neglect it, and it is forgotten.
Wash the body and tend to it, allowing no defilement—
In purity and solitude, burn incense and contemplate the Perfected.
The Perfected of the Crimson Palace and the many Jade Maidens
will manifest their forms and speak with mortals.

Survey the five viscera, observing their rhythms—
Ever contemplate the spirits of the five viscera,
never straying from the body.
The six bowels, cultivated and tended, remain pure as silk—
The six bowels are: the gallbladder as the first,
the stomach as the second, the bladder as the third,
the large intestine as the fourth, the small intestine as the fifth,
and the navel as the sixth, the great repository.
These six bowels must ever be kept pure and clean.

Emptiness and spontaneity are the Dao’s principle—
The twelve qi arise from emptiness, with spontaneity as their origin.
Humans drift far from the Dao, knowing not its truth.
Yet all things possess their spontaneity, and affairs need not be burdensome—
One who knows spontaneity becomes a Perfected One,
sitting in stillness or standing in oblivion,
abiding through ten thousand ages—what burden is there?
Hands folded, non-action—body at peace.
Serene and inactive, dwelling alone in stillness,
the heart settled, the will steadfast,
the upright qi naturally abides—thus the body finds peace.

The dwelling of emptiness lies within the curtained chamber—
The curtained chamber is the secluded grotto chamber;
those who cultivate the Dao ever reside in this realm,
not contending with others—hence it is called the dwelling of the curtained chamber.
Silent and vast, the mouth speaks not—
Dwelling in solitude, contemplating the Dao and pondering the Perfected,
when they appear, do not be startled—close the mouth and speak not.
Serene and desireless, wander the garden of virtue—
Cold brings no need for clothing, heat no sweat;
serene and desireless, dwelling alone in stillness,
emerging or withdrawing to the mountains, scorning worldly glory.

In purity and fragrance, the Jade Maidens abide—
In purity and solitude, with focused mind and self-restraint,
incense burning, the altar cleansed,
the Jade Maidens stand as guardians.
Cultivate virtue, and the Dao’s gate becomes clear—
Let one guard the Gate of Life, sit upright in right mindfulness,
without wayward gaze.
Cultivate the Dao with clarity, observing the exterior to know the interior,
and the spirit will open the Dao’s gate for you.

*By Liangqiūzǐ*

To practice the Dao is to roam in profound solitude,
to enter the pure chamber,
refine the embryo and temper the form,
returning to the spirit’s essence.
Nurture life and guard emptiness—
Emptiness is nature itself.
Guard the Dao to cultivate the body,
align with nature’s harmony,
never departing from one’s own being.

Serene and free from striving, why ponder?
In tranquility and purity,
nurture the spirit and cherish the body,
keeping harm a thousand miles away,
thoughts stilled forever.
Once wings are fully grown, they spread wide—
With the Dao’s learning complete,
the body becomes light,
flickering and indistinct,
as if feathered—
when the time comes, one ascends.
Long life and enduring vision then take flight—
Attaining the Dao, one does not die,
transcending the world to abide forever,
ascending in broad daylight as the soul flies into the Great Clarity.

The Five Phases interweave, sharing the same root—
The five viscera follow the Five Phases,
rising and falling,
yet all diverge from a single throat.
The Three and Five unite in qi, their origin one—
Above and below, Three and Five merge in one chamber;
when Three and Five wane, they return to unity.
Who then contends with the sun and moon?
The left eye is the sun, the father, governing within.
The right eye is the moon, the mother, governing within.
The Dipper is the Seven Stars, the celestial markers,
also known as the Seven Governors.

Embrace jade, cradle pearls, harmonizing the Chamber of the Child—
Luminous as jade, unyielding as stone,
circulate qi while holding them,
mindful as if rolling pearls.
If you master this, all affairs are complete—
Cultivate the Dao, guard the One,
ingest qi to prolong life,
return to the destiny of spirit immortality—
all affairs are fulfilled.
Hold fast to what you possess, never losing it—
Seal the essence, guard it as your own,
and you shall not die, entering the Golden Chamber.
Refining the Dao, one enters the nine chambers,
returns to the embryo, tempers the form,
orders the mysterious and the bright—
true qi settles serenely,
the Three Passes sealed,
no perverse qi arises.

The sun emerges, the moon enters—this is my Dao—
Sun and moon are the two eyes,
flanking left and right,
their governance within the Purple Chamber,
their emergence the Dao’s truth.
Heaven’s Seven and Earth’s Three revolve in mutual guardianship—
Heaven has seven stars, Earth three essences;
primordial qi circulates endlessly.
Rising and falling, advancing and retreating—only in harmony is there enduring presence—
Primordial qi ascends and descends,
above and below merging in chaos,
without fixed form—
heaven and earth, attaining this, achieve long life.

Jade and stone gleam—these are my treasures—
White as jade, like stone,
they reside in the lower region.
Why not guard what you already possess?
Seal the essence, guard it as your own,
receive qi to nourish the spirit.

The heart understands the root and nurtures radiant splendor—
The root is knowing how to guard the One.
Radiant splendor is the face and eyes aglow,
the body suffused with luminous brilliance.
Ingest heaven’s descent, follow earth’s ascent, harmonizing to store essence—
Heaven’s qi descends, earth’s qi rises,
their union completes virtue,
transformations arise in mutual generation—
seal qi, guard essence,
nourish the spirit, refine the substance.

How towering stands the Ninefold Mound—
Within the Muddy Pellet, the sovereign qi shines bright,
the Perfected One and Great Unity dwell within.
Towering—this is the heart.
The Perfected One within may be commanded—
The Perfected Child may be sent forth.
Without stepping outside, one knows all under heaven;
without peering through the window, one sees the Dao of heaven.
The Three Yang Spirits within may grant long life—
Yang is primordial yang, white,
ever-changing in an instant.
The key to long life is guarding the Three Black Spirits.

Five and Seven revolve in mutual union—
The seven orifices and five viscera
harmonize as one in a single chamber.
The Kunlun Mountain is never mistaken—
Kunlun is the head,
where the Perfected One plays within.
Sun and moon revolve, cold and heat alternate,
yet never err.

Shielded by the Purple Palace, the cinnabar tower is complete—
The Cinnabar Field connects upward to the Purple Palace,
within which lie five cities and twelve towers,
where the Perfected One roams in play.
Flanked by sun and moon like linked pearls—
The two eyes,
mysterious qi shining brightly,
emerging like strung pearls,
five colors flickering—
if you constantly dwell upon this,
life knows no end.

Ten thousand years shine brightly, without fixed term—
The Perfected One attains the Dao,
ten thousand years transform the body—
eight for men, seven for women—
from this, life arises.
Abiding with sun and moon,
safeguarded by heaven and earth.

Externally, the Three Yang Spirits come of themselves—
The Three Yang are the three ninefold celestial markers.
When the Infant is born,
one spirit, the hun-po, enters the form.
Internally, nurturing the Three Yin grants long life—
Drawing yang qi through the nose,
taking it in to nourish within.
The Red Child, the Perfected One, the Infant—
these are the Three Yin,
also known as spirit-eaters.

The hun longs for heaven, the po descends to the springs—
Hun is yang, po is yin.
For those in the world without virtue,
hun and po depart the body,
returning to their origins, scattered.
Returning the hun, restoring the po—this is the Dao’s nature—
Restrain the hun, govern the po,
keeping them from action—
the Emperor dwells within,
the Dao is nature itself.

**Commentary on the "Outer Radiance of the Yellow Court" Jade Scripture**
*By Liang Qiuzi*

The jade pivot hangs like a pearl in endless revolution—
The jade pivot turns, qi flows in ceaseless circulation, never resting.

Close the mouth to nurture spirit, rinse and refine the sweet spring as flowing pearls.
The Mysterious Gate’s golden key remains whole and firm.
Yin is the gate, yang the key—when neither harms the other, the qi of harmony is attained,
returning essence to refine the form, thus achieving wholeness and strength.

Bearing earth, suspended in heaven, it pervades Qian and Kun.
Earth bears man, man is suspended in heaven—
the Dao is neither above nor below,
its subtlety resides in the center of Qian and Kun, thus circulating throughout the world.

Its image aligns with the four seasons, red as cinnabar.
The Hall of Light opens in four directions, corresponding to the four seasons—
the dwelling of the Perfected One, the Cinnabar Child.
If you can ponder this, chewing and savoring its qi,
then longevity will be boundless.

Front lofty, rear humble—each enters through a different gate.
Head and feet, kidneys and heart—
the heart is red, the kidneys black,
rooted in the same source yet water and fire contend, thus differing and uniting.
Send it back with the Returned Cinnabar and the Mysterious Spring.
Cinnabar is blood, transformed and entering the lower source,
becoming white essence.
At this moment, draw in the nose and return it,
ascending to the Mud Pill Palace, descending to the mouth,
transforming into jade spring.

Like the tortoise, draw qi to the numinous root—
With the nose, draw qi to the root of the tongue,
swallow and send it to the abdomen, where thunder rumbles in response,
for the true qi causes this.
Within resides the Perfected One, clad in a golden kerchief.
The Red Child wears crimson robes, crowned with a golden kerchief.
Bearing armor and holding talismans, he opens the seven gates—
Donning the talisman of the Six Jia, warding off evil and misfortune,
distributing qi to the seven orifices, ears and eyes become keen.
Some say: back to the north, facing south, girdled with east and west.
The talisman is qi.
This is no branch or leaf—it is the true root.
The essential Dao, no empty script—
Ponder it day and night to endure forever.
Day and night contemplate the Dao, never slackening.
Open the eyes to behold the true, close them to meditate on spirit—
thus may one attain long life.

Immortal and Daoist are not endowed with divinity—
The Dao is not twofold; fulfillment brings it forth.
Sharing a single root, no other spirits exist—
harmonize the heart, settle the will,
and the Dao will daily grow.
Accumulated essence leads to concentrated years.
Without reckless expenditure of yin and yang,
without leakage of essence and spirit,
accumulating essence to receive qi,
one may live ten thousand years.

All men eat grains and the five flavors—
The common folk consume the essence of the earth,
repaying it with their death.
The sage eats the primordial harmonious qi,
repaying heaven with ascension.
Only the adept consumes the great harmony of yin and yang qi—
The student of immortality eats yang qi at dawn,
yin qi at dusk,
and the primordial qi together.
Thus they do not die, for heaven’s phase is complete.
The accomplished do not die—
their years and fate are boundless, merging with heaven.
*Ji* means to unite.

Let us speak of the five viscera, each with its direction—
The five viscera correspond to the five phases,
the four limbs to the four seasons,
with earth as their ruler, residing in the center.
The heart is the sovereign, king of the five viscera.
The heart is like an egg, precarious and hard to stabilize.
When the kingdom has worthy ministers, great peace is achieved.
When the heart abides in clarity, the body is at peace.

Within the mind, movement and stillness allow qi to flow—
By preserving and guarding the inner spirits,
body and heart remain tranquil, never recklessly disturbed,
thus qi flows with ease.
The Dao naturally sustains my spirit’s radiance.
Holding to the One, the Dao guards my essence—
the radiance of spirit and clarity.
By day, luminous and bright; by night, self-guarding—
Contemplate the red qi within the heart, illuminating the myriad spirits.
Guard the light of sun and moon, meditate on the roots of the two kidneys—
by day, guard the light; by night, guard the spirit.
Thirst is quenched by nectar, hunger sated by fullness.
Hunger is fed with the qi of nature,
thirst slaked with the nectar of the Flowery Pond—
free from hunger and thirst, one may attain long life.

Passing through the six palaces, storing at mao and you—
The ears are the roots of the six palaces,
storage emerges at mao and you—
the subtlety is profound, unattainable.
Turning yang into yin, storing it in the nine—
Yang reverts to yin, the body transforms and contends,
returning to be stored in the nine.
Nine is the head, thus the scripture says:
"Left two, right seven, storing nine, residing in one."
Practice this constantly, and you will not age.
At cock’s crow, face outward with unbound hair,
click the teeth thirty-six times,
swallow saliva and qi—
this is the way to distance death.

The qi of the liver is cultivated and long—
Cultivate qi to ascend, reaching the crown to nourish the Mud Pill.
Arraying the five viscera gives birth to the Three Lights.
The five officials and six palaces each govern their domains,
the kidneys above and below each possess sun, moon, and the Three Lights.
The Three Lights refer to the sun, moon, and stars.
Uniting with the Three Burners, the Dao drinks nectar—
The Three Burners are the three passes of the origin.
Hunger is fed with the qi of nature,
thirst slaked with the nectar of the Flowery Pond—
no more hunger or thirst.
Essence awaits heaven and earth, the way of long life.
Essence is my spirit, qi is my Dao—
wearing essence, contemplating qi above and below,
this is the proper way of nourishment.

My spirit, hun, and po reside in the center—
The center’s hun and po are the two kidneys.
Left is hun, right is po—
by day, the hun guards the po; by night, the po guards the hun.
Restrain the hun, govern the po,
preventing them from action.
Jade spring flows, the nose is fragrant—
When yin and yang unite, essence leaks and is lost,
flavors fade, the nose loses its fragrance.

Stand at the suspended pharynx, containing the Hall of Light—
The tongue’s base is the suspended pharynx, the lungs the Hall of Light.
Hold the qi and swallow it, irrigating the Hall of Light,
flowing through the body.
Connect my flowery essence to harmonize yin and yang—
This means to cultivate essence and nurture spirit.
Embrace yin, hold yang,
harmonizing essence and spirit.
Crouch at the Mysterious Gate, awaiting the heavenly Dao—
The gate is the nose, awaiting the upper region’s spirit.
Near to me, yet I guard myself—
Command the spirit and essence to guard the self.
Pure and still, without action, the spirit lingers—
Within, cultivate the Dao through non-action;
without, cultivate the Dao through desirelessness—
the heart untroubled, spirit and essence remain.
Essence and qi ascend and descend, the passes are ordered and governed.

Let qi ascend and descend through focused intent—
guard the singular spirit.
When the seven apertures are unobstructed, age remains unknown;
the seven orifices of the head and face, gates of spirit,
flow freely with bodily awareness, defying old age.

Return to sit at Heaven’s Gate, awaiting yin and yang—
morning draws in yang qi, evening takes in yin qi,
both converging within the mouth.
Descend through the throat to commune with spirit-light,
where twelve sentinels of the hours stand guard,
each wielding jade halberds to protect the passage.
The Perfected dwells within, governing the flow of qi above and below.

Pass beneath the Flowery Canopy, cool and clear—
the brows form the canopy, where spirit resides.
Enter the realm of pure emptiness to behold my form,
entering the Brain’s Chamber to meet the Mud-Pill Sovereign.
With time, the Returned Elixir may grant eternal life—
reversing the years, the body never decays.

Return through the Flowery Pool to stir kidney essence,
traversing from the Brain’s Chamber down the spine to the kidneys.
Gaze upon the Hall of Light, nearing the Cinnabar Field—
one inch behind the space between the brows lies the Hall of Light,
three inches further, the Cinnabar Field.
Summon all spirits to open the Gate of Life,
as the nose draws true qi, ceaseless day and night.
The nose is Heaven’s Root.

Unobstructed, the heavenly Dao conceals the numinous root—
the head, round as heaven.
The numinous root is the tongue.
Yin and yang array like shooting stars—
the seven orifices of the face mirror the seven stars.
At utmost yin, yang returns; gazing at the sun, one sees the starry host.
Essence spreads, qi disperses, entering the Mysterious Court.

The qi of the liver flows like a ring without end,
circling ceaselessly through the body.
The qi of the lungs arises from the Triple Burner—
the Celestial Pass is the mouth,
the Human Pass, the hands,
the Earthly Pass, the lower region.

Crouch at Heaven’s Gate, awaiting the ancient Dao—
Heaven’s Gate is the mouth.
Awaiting the ancient Dao means connecting to the Brain’s Chamber.
Pure fluid, sweet springs flow through the six palaces—
rinsing the Flowery Pool, irrigating the tongue’s root,
streaming through the large intestine, small intestine, gallbladder, stomach,
bladder, and Gate of Life—these are the six palaces.

Following the nose’s ascent and descent, the two ears open—
primordial qi enters and exits the nose, rising and falling,
communing with the ears, enabling their function.

Gaze upon heaven and earth, preserving the Youthful One—
heaven is the head, earth the lower region,
the Youthful One is the spirit of focused intent, guarding the One.
Harmonize essence and radiance to order hair and teeth—
one inhales the five qi, taps the teeth thirty-six times,
swallows saliva thirty-six times—thus governing the Mysterious and White.

The complexion glows, age does not turn hair white—
reversing whiteness, preserving the years,
the face and eyes radiate, hair never grays again.

Descend through the throat—how vast and open!
Within the throat, twelve sentinels stand guard,
each wielding jade halberds to protect its passage.
All spirits gather, seeking one another—
this is the assembly of all spirits.

The mind’s intent abides in the Eight Directions.
Descend into the Crimson Palace, its hue like purple blossoms—
this is the heart-spirit’s crimson qi, its color purple.

Conceal the Flowering Canopy, linking to the Spirit Hut—
the brows are the Flowering Canopy, below they connect the qi to the nose.
Focus on guarding the heart-spirit, passing calls one to another.
When the mind-spirit is stored as the sovereign of the state,
all spirits become its subjects; when summoned, none fail to arrive.

refined thought reaches inward, revealing divine clarity,
and no perverse qi dares intrude again.

one who reverses aging and preserves the years,
refines the elixir and nurtures life, will not grow frail,
and may attain longevity.

The spleen’s spirit roams the Central Palace—

guarding the hall above, roaming the Hall of Light,
becoming the Supreme Unity Lord.
It convenes the five spirits, harmonizing the Three Luminaries—
the spleen governs all spirits within its palace,
gathering them beneath the palace gates.
The Three Luminaries are the radiance of sun and moon.

Above, it joins with heaven’s qi, now in the Hall of Light—
one’s qi ascends, then returns to the brain,
now meeting in the Hall of Light.
It unblocks the six bowels and regulates the Five Phases—
the five viscera and six bowels each govern their domains;
the Five Phases follow the five constants, ruling as the five stars.
Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth reign as kings—
Metal is white, Wood is blue-green, Water is black, Fire is crimson,

whose qi and spirit harmonize, may live three hundred years,
becoming an earthbound immortal, roaming among mortals.

primordial qi flows in and out through the nostrils and mouth,
communing with the Yellow Court.
The Yellow Court is the spleen.
Inhaling and exhaling the Void, one perceives one’s form—
grasping firmness, refining the body,
one sees the form of the Void.

Strengthening my sinews, bones, and blood vessels to completion—
bones become light, flesh ascends.
Flesh transforms into bone, intestines into sinews,
blood into essence, spirit into elixir—
thus one becomes an immortal.
In a trance, unseen, passing through the Azure Spirit—
sitting in disappearance, traversing the brain’s gate,
ever-changing and boundless.

Sitting beneath the Hut, observing the Little Lad—
the nose is the Hut,
gazing upon the Red Child dwelling within.
Day and night, abide in the radiance of divine clarity—
morning and evening, store the spirit, never leaving the body,
its brilliance always before one’s eyes.

Emerging from no gate, entering no door—
having attained the Dao, one may conceal oneself in coming and going,
walking without passing through gates or doors,
thus becoming a spirit.
Serene and desireless, nurturing the flowering root—
serene and desireless, preserving oneself through the Dao,
cultivating the Mysterious and White, nourishing the root of black hair.

Consuming the Dark Qi may lead to eternal life—
this is the white qi between the two kidneys, called the Dark Qi.
Returning to the seven gates, drinking from the Great Abyss—
the face has seven apertures, all unobstructed.
Drinking from the Great Abyss means swallowing the Sweet Spring in the mouth.

Passing through my throat, crossing the Azure Spirit—
qi is the Dao,
qi descends through the throat, traversing the gallbladder.
Inquiring of the immortal’s path and its wondrous merits—
immortals have three thousand six hundred methods,
encompassing myriad techniques.
Attaining the Dao, receiving qi, guarding naturalness,
embracing the undying lineage—each has its wondrous merits.

Consuming numinous mushrooms and Jade Essence—
not only do famous mountains bear mushrooms and Jade Essence;
the five viscera also contain them.

grants a lifespan equal to heaven and earth.

Head crowned with white silk, feet on the Cinnabar Field—
the headband is the moon, the shoes are the sun,
returning essence to replenish the brain—
this is called refining the body, the path of undying longevity.

Bathing in the Flower Pool, irrigating the numinous root—
the Flower Pool is the mouth,
the numinous root is the tongue.
One should rinse with the Sweet Spring, washing the tongue’s root.

The three palaces unite, opening the Gate of Life—
the Grotto Chamber, Flowering Canopy, and Hall of Light are the palaces.
The Gate of Life is the nose.
Opening yin and yang, uniting ears and eyes,
thus granting keen perception.

The five flavors all arrive, returning the good qi—
rinsing the mouth with the Sweet Spring, all five flavors arrive,
returning the elixir, refining the body—
thus attaining longevity.

The Great Dao flows boundlessly; the heart must not fret—
the Great Dao is like rivers and seas, inexhaustible when upheld.
Contemplate and practice guarding the One.
Do not indulge in excessive thoughts, lest the spirit be disturbed.

With hair unbound one walks—thus may long life endure,
parting the locks to feast on sun and moon’s essence,
preserving harmony with sun and moon,
hence attaining longevity.

My words are complete—do not recklessly transmit them.
This Dao must not be recklessly shared with the unworthy.
