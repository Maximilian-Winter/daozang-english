**The Perfected Text of the Nine Heavens’ Eight Registers of the Yellow Writ of the Great Mystery**
**Secret Formula of the Sash from the Mysterious Capital**

The script of the Eight Assemblies of the Supreme Thearch of the Grand Tenuity is inscribed with characters of soaring mysterious purple *qi*. Reciting its text subjugates the myriad evils; wearing its characters allows one to wander the Nine Heavens, overawe the Six Realms, and command the reverence of the ten thousand spirits as their guardian.

Those destined to receive this Dao may wander the Five Marchmounts, enter the Three Clarities, and suppress inauspicious forces.

Within the Grand Tenuity reside the Three Sovereigns and One Thearch. The Sovereigns are the ministers of the Lord: the first is the Sovereign Lord, the second the Sovereign Heaven, and the third the Sovereign Elder. These are the *qi* of the Three Origins, the perfected of primordial chaos, who come and go from the Palace of the Grand Clarity, the Grand Simplicity, and the Grand Harmony.

The Three August Perfected of Heaven concealed the text of the Eight Assemblies in Mount Wei Yu, while the Thearch of the Grand Tenuity concealed one copy in Tortoise Mountain, engraving it within a chamber of green stone.

The Immortal King of the Mysterious Capital once received it from the Three Elder Sovereigns of the Grand Tenuity and secretly transmitted it to immortals, hence its name, *The Perfected Text Worn at the Sash*.

All who receive this Dao from a master must offer five taels of gold and one set of ritual robes, binding the sash as a token of their covenant. The Dao is held in reverence, and its text kept secret.

The Perfected Lord of the Western City once received it from the Queen Mother of Tortoise Mountain, hence its alternate names, *The Yellow Writ of the Grand Tenuity* or *The Nine Heavens’ Eight Registers*.

If transmitted to the unworthy, the corpses of three generations of ancestors will be destroyed, and calamity will flow to their descendants.

Those who possess the *Perfected Text Worn at the Sash* and whose names are already recorded in the Palace of the Grand Tenuity—whether read forward or backward, from any of the four directions—will find its characters form coherent script.

When entering mountains, wandering the Five Marchmounts, or resting at night, one should constantly recite it aloud. Then, fierce beasts, the thousand demons, and the myriad evils will not dare to test you.

Wearing it on the left elbow allows one to traverse the Six Realms, govern the world, and suppress the ten thousand weapons. Moving in any of the four directions, the characters will array themselves in orderly ranks. Inscribe them on green silk with yellow ink and wear them on the left elbow to behold the August Lord of the Golden Gates of Great Peace.

If I wish to command ghosts and spirits, I shall submit them to the Five Characters, beginning from the top and proceeding downward. After five years, I may then employ ghosts and spirits at will.

*The Yellow Writ of the Grand Tenuity* comprises eight scrolls in total. The Thearch of the Grand Tenuity transmitted it to the Most High.

*The Highest Scripture of the Eight Enclosures and Four Gates of the Grand Tenuity, First Scroll*
*The Purple Essence of the Nine Numinous Flowers of the Central Hua of the Grand Tenuity, Second Scroll*
*The Precious Chapters of the Jade Void of the Grand Tenuity, Third Scroll*
*The Radiant Brilliance Within the Precious Clouds of the Jade Chamber of the Grand Tenuity, Fourth Scroll*
*The Mother of Water and Fire of the Three Qi and Nine Transformations of the Grand Tenuity, Fifth Scroll*
*The Five Paths of the Central Spirits of the Grand Tenuity: Stepping Through the Void and Flying, Sixth Scroll*
*The Golden Yang Essence Scripture of the Stone Scenery of the Grand Tenuity, Seventh Scroll*
*The Interwoven Texts of the True Writ of the Eight Records of the Nine Heavens of the Grand Tenuity, Eighth Scroll*

Of the eight scrolls of *The Yellow Writ of the Grand Tenuity*, the first, second, third, and fourth do not circulate in the world. The fifth, sixth, and seventh are transmitted only to those destined to become Perfected Ones. The eighth, which is this text, is to be transmitted solely to those of predetermined faith. Without one who dwells in seclusion, pursues distant aspirations, loves the Dao, and believes in truth, none may receive it recklessly. Reckless transmission will bring punishment upon the three ancestral lines by the Water Officials.

When signs of resonance appear and one is deemed worthy of transmission, bestow it along with its essential teachings. Those who possess it shall become divine immortals.

Purify oneself for three days before receiving it. The recipient shall pay homage to the Thearch of the Grand Tenuity nine times in a year. The homage is performed at dawn on the first day of the lunar month, facing north within a quiet chamber, girded with a sash and clad in ritual vestments. Bow four times, then strike the teeth thrice and kneel to pray:

*"O Supreme Perfected Ones of the Grand Tenuity, Celestial Thearch of the Great August,
Your humble servant [Name] makes this entreaty and declaration:
To the Four August Emperors above, the Life-Controllers of the Grand Tenuity,
To the Purple Mystery and Cinnabar Numinous, resplendent as sun and moon,
To the Golden Essence and Precious Treasures, the Eight Awes of August Heaven,
I pray for longevity, that heaven and earth may endure as one,
That ghosts and spirits become my servants, that metal and stone open before me,
That I may govern the Six Realms and command the ten thousand weapons,
[...] like thunderbolts in flight,
That my years be boundless, my blessings towering,
That fortune flows in and virtue departs not,
That my countenance remain youthful, my eyes clear, my ears sharp,
That my four limbs never decline,
That jade maidens attend me, and I ascend in radiance to the Grand Tenuity."*

Upon completion, rise and bow twice more, then kneel. Perform the Nine Characters and wear the writ, and the characters on all four sides and eight directions will naturally resolve, along with the thirty-six languages of the nations.

The Yellow Thearch obtained this writ and thereby ruled all under heaven, commanded the ten thousand weapons, and employed ghosts and spirits, naturally attaining divine wisdom and sagely intelligence.

He Yu acquired three lines of this text and thereby commanded ghosts and spirits.
Du You and Fei Ci obtained thirteen lines and thereby commanded the spirits of all under heaven.
Xu Guang obtained five lines and, after three years of wearing them, commanded fourteen ghosts and could summon anything in the world.

The Perfected One on Red City Mountain transmitted this to Xu Yuanyou, who in turn passed it to his disciples Sixuan and his second son, Daoxiang.

*The Yellow Center Regulates Qi: The Nine Subtleties of the Mysterious City*
*Essence, once attaining Grand Harmony, governs life without end—Nine Perpetuities.*

The Celestial Eternal Calculates the Numinous, the Attendant Loves the Central Prime of the Upper Perfected;
They come to oversee the Upper Prime’s Crimson Children, universally prolonging life.
The Lower Prime’s Venerable One commands a thousand numina, soaring through the mysterious heights.
The True Lord of Nurturing Life, the Highest Prime Lord, augments the heavens with essence.

The Purple Tenuity’s Vermilion Palace names the Mighty Beasts of Grand Peace.
The register guards your form, driving my nine-mouthed, long-fanged ones.
Heaven’s power, four-eyed, devours tigers, flattens rivers, and feeds.
Golden pillars, eight winds blow the sea, flames spread, striking the eaves.

Mountains scorch, birds flay, the chisel-toothed ones hold serpents, scanning the heavens.
The toothed father, eight-patterned, the flood dragons tread the celestial Dipper.
They resist the mounds, gallop ten thousand horses, fanged axes, fierce eyes devour.
The stone-clenching leopards dance, lions with golden heads consume ghosts.

If mountains split, cypress and earth thunder roar, beasts electrify the heavens.
Oxen shatter mountains, the grubs of a hundred voids fly and run.
Rely on the strong birds within me to prepare your spirit for long augmentation.
Qi and life entrusted, the soul traverses seas and hills—command them.

The celestial beasts follow your body, the Highest True Venerable One,
Preserving long life, attaining divine transcendence, ascending the Nine Subtleties of the Mysterious.
