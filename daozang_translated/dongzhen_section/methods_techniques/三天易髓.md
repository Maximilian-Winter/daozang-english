**Confucians call it the Supreme Ultimate;**
The Fire Talisman points directly:
Heaven and Earth as crucible and vessel.
Above, it props up the heavens; below, it props up the earth—
This very person is the crucible and vessel.

*Ah!*
Once you know where to begin,
The work is simple and easy.

---

**The Hidden Dragon Does Not Act**
As the first yang arises,
Guard stillness,
Constantly preserve sincerity,
And the heart settles into steadfastness.

*Ah!*
When the dragon attains concealment,
Do not advance lightly.

---

**The Dragon Appears in the Fields**
Stir the wind of Xun,
Advance the fire’s work—
In an instant,
The entire crucible glows red.

*Is that so?*
The dragon appears in the fields,
Its light pervading empty space.

---

**All Day Vigilant**
Heaven and Earth unite,
Yin and yang balance—
Eight ounces of mercury,
Half a catty of lead.

*Hehe!*
The maiden of mercury submits,
The infant of cinnabar receives.

---

**Perhaps Leaping in the Abyss**
Water restrains fire,
Metal overcomes wood—
At this time,
It is fitting to bathe.

*(Tenfold power!)*
Perhaps leaping in the abyss,
Preserve the center with utmost care.

---

**The Flying Dragon in the Heavens**
The five qi converge,
The three flowers gather,
Wood and metal unite,
Lead and mercury stabilize.

*Hūm!*
The flying dragon in the heavens,
Clouds move and rain descends.

---

**The Excessive Dragon Has Regrets**
The body is pure yang,
The six yangs complete—
Then cease the fire,
And do not speculate.

*Stop!*
If you do not maintain fullness,
The excessive dragon will have regrets.

---

**Treading Frost to Ice**
As the first yin arises,
Do not act recklessly;
Firmly grasp and hold,
Guarding the city with care.

*Be meticulous!*
Prevent the subtle and stop the gradual—
Treading frost leads to ice.

---

**Upright, Square, and Great**
Encountering the six in the second,
Gradually retreat;
Yin is centered,
Yang is in its hidden position.

*Ditch!*
Misty rain obscures,
Yet it benefits without practice.

---

**Containing Splendor, It Can Be Steadfast**
White snow congeals,
The yellow sprout grows—
Firmly cherish and protect,
Do not speculate.

*Gather!*
The yang crucible is firmly sealed,
Containing splendor, it can be steadfast.

---

**Tying the Sack Without Fault**
Mercury seeks to fly,
Lead seeks to flee—
At this time,
Guard with care.

*Gah!*
Take the bottomless sack,
Tie its mouth shut.

---

**Yellow Skirts, Primordial Auspiciousness**
All yin is exhausted,
The elixir path complete—
The utmost essence congeals,
The primordial qi rests.

*Tut!*
Gather and return to the center,
Yellow skirts bring primordial auspiciousness.

---

**Dragons Battle in the Wilds**
Yin is concealed,
Yang arises again—
At this point,
Guard once more.

*Be cautious!*
If you encounter wild battle,
Its blood will be dark and yellow.

---

**Warming and Nurturing the Spiritual Embryo**
Empty the heart,
Fill the abdomen,
Guard tranquility,
Await the return of yang.

*Ah!*
In an instant,
The celestial cycle is complete.

---

**The Mysterious Pearl Takes Form**
Overturn the crucible,
Kick over the furnace—
The work is complete,
The mysterious pearl is born.

Return to the root and restore life,
Embrace the origin and return to the void.

---

**Fifteen verses, corresponding to the numbers three and five.**

---

**The Dao Speaks of the Golden Elixir**
The Golden Elixir is firm like gold,
Round like cinnabar,
Refined to ever greater clarity—
Thus is nature likened to the Golden Elixir.

The elixir is the crucible and vessel,
The medicine and ingredients.

**Verse:**
Since ancient times, this thing,
Formless and without substance,
Lacking nothing, with no excess,
Without end, without rest.
Its benefit is like gold,
Its radiance like the sun.

**Elixir**
The Daoists call it the Mysterious Pearl,
The Confucians call it the Supreme Ultimate,
The Daoists call it the Golden Elixir—
Three names, one body.
It is right before your eyes,
Yet people do not recognize it.
This very thing—
Do not doubt it further.

---

**Illustration of the Golden Elixir Clearly Revealed**
All illustrations and nine quatrains
Reveal the life’s root as the elixir’s function.
The annotated verses
Manifest nature as the elixir’s essence.

---

**1. Beginning the Work**
Begin the work to establish the elixir’s foundation,
Do not rely on midnight or noon.
In stillness, at the first movement,
It is the time when gui arises.

**Elixir**
Beware of misapprehension—
Spring flowers, autumn moon,
Peach red, plum white,
The scorching heat of the ninth summer,
Winter’s snowfall—
How could summer be so?
There is no method to speak of.

*Ah!*
Do not doubt further.

In the twelfth month, plum holds jade,
In frosty skies, chrysanthemums sprout gold.
When the wind comes, listen to the roaring waves,
When the moon rises, watch the tide’s birth.

---

**2. Setting Up the Crucible**
The outer form is the crucible and vessel,
Within lies the medicinal material.
If you can gather it,
The spiritual embryo will form in an instant.

**Elixir**
Plant hemp to get hemp,
Establish the crucible through non-action.
The formless sets up the furnace,
The crucible and vessel are firm—
No need for effort.

*Tut!*
In emptiness that is not empty,
Refine the supreme treasure;
In non-action that is nowhere,
Smelt the true suchness.

Before white snow blooms,
The yellow sprout first bears fruit.
If you wish the infant to be born,
First let the maiden of mercury die.

---

**3. Gathering the Medicine**
Mercury is sought on the southern mountain,
Lead is sought in the northern sea.
Harmonize with the earth of Kun,
Subdue with the metal of Qian.

**Elixir**
What is it that you gather?
Seeking mercury on the mountain’s peak,
Seeking lead in the sea’s depths,
Scooping the moon from water,
Searching for heaven beneath the earth.

*Hehe!*
Not knowing the true seed,
You waste your efforts in vain refinement.

Enter the sea to seize the flood dragon,
With skill, capture the sun and moon.
Send them to the crucible to burn,
Refine them into a ball of snow.

---

**4. Practicing the Work**
The fire’s timing is no great matter,
Nothing more than wisdom and firmness.
Wood and metal never part,
The supreme treasure grows ever brighter.

**Elixir**
Beware of eyes growing flowers.

**5. Maintaining Fullness**
The fire is great, the furnace hard to steady;
Too much lead, the crucible must peril.
Attain the mean without excess,
And the elixir will not lack mercury.

**Elixir**
Too much is as bad as too little.
To master is not as good as to employ;
To take in much is not as good as to let out little.
Ever harbor the thief’s mind, yet steal nothing from others.

Know this:
Careless storage invites theft,
Alluring appearance invites lust.
Sit within closed doors,
And calamities will naturally lessen.
The household thief is hardest to guard against—
Do not overreach.

**6. Nurturing**
When nature settles, golden sand congeals;
When the heart is empty, the infant is formed.
Yet it must be constantly warmed and nourished,
Lifted out to shine with radiance.

**Elixir**
Hold fast,
The work of nurturing—
Like a hen brooding her eggs.
A hair’s breadth of error,
A thousand miles of loss.

Look closely:
Firmly plant your roots,
Open your heart’s ground.
Raising and guiding the child
Requires a tongueless nurse.
A moment’s neglect,
And the hawk flies past Silla.

**7. Harmonizing the Spirit**
When qi is full, the infant sheds its husk,
Its upbringing wholly entrusted to the mother.
Nurture and teach with the greater body,
Moving in and out without hindrance.

**Elixir**
Do not stir—thirty blows await!
Emerging from being, entering non-being,
Freely roaming at will.
Let go, gather back,
Vast and without attainment.
Subtle as a mote of dust,
Vast as the cosmos.
The infant passes through Heaven’s Gate,
Roaming to and fro.
In an instant, it traverses the eight poles;
In a flash, it crosses the three mountains.

**8. Shedding the Husk**
When the work is complete and merit fulfilled,
Spiritual powers are wondrous and boundless.
Coming and going without obstruction,
In stillness, it meets the Empty Sovereign.

**Elixir**
Stand firm where your feet are—
The root precedes the sprout,
The child follows the flower.
When the flower fades, the child is formed,
Clouds and heaven share the same longevity.
Only when the stone shatters is the jade found;
Only when the sand is gone is the gold revealed.
When the water clears, the fish appear of themselves;
When the clouds disperse, the moon’s brilliance shines.

**9. Consummation**
Kick over the furnace that burns the sky,
Overturn the cauldron that boils the sea.
Rend asunder the emptiness,
Revealing the solitary True Suchness.

**Elixir**
House broken, family gone—
Having attained this one thing,
All affairs are wholly complete.
Utterly luminous and clear,
The emptiness stands stark.

*Hah!*
The one-horned fire dragon soars into the heavens,
Startling the spring with a thunderclap.

When completion is truly complete,
There is no "after" in the real "nothingness."
When "nothingness" is truly complete,
The body merges with the Great Void.

**Explanation of the *Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment***
**Direct Pointers to the *Heart Sutra***

One day, Layman Ji’an, who reverently upheld the *Prajñāpāramitā Heart Sutra*, visited me seeking further elucidation of its meaning.

I said: "This single scroll of scripture is known before it is even recited—what need is there for explanation? To forcibly add annotations would be like placing a head upon a head."

Ji’an replied: "Yet for beginners, the profound meaning is not easily grasped. Moreover, the many interpretations by various masters leave students with lingering doubts. I implore your compassion to enlighten me."

I said: "When the World-Honored One of the future expounded this sutra, he guided all beings by directly pointing to the essential mystery. From the very first phrase to the very last, it does not depart from a single word: *emptiness*. Within it, the samadhi of language repeatedly exhorts, repeatedly explains itself, making it easy for learners to comprehend. Alas, later generations cling to the text, some fixating on form, others attaching to the view of emptiness, ultimately failing to penetrate the essential mystery. Past patriarchs, out of necessity, added annotations, establishing various expedient means to respond to conditions and guide beings, allowing people to enter according to their understanding. But in their eagerness to help, they have instead caused those of the highest capacity to pile doubt upon doubt. This is precisely what is meant by: 'Those of middling or lesser capacity cannot be spoken to of the highest.'

Now, since you have doubts and seek explanation, this is the very root of awakening. I shall not refrain from speaking—listen carefully.

Consider the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sutra of the Great Wisdom That Reaches the Other Shore, the Essential Nature of the Heart*—it is the direct path. In short, the great wisdom that reaches the other shore is the dharma-gate of seeing one’s nature, the shortcut traversed by all. Those who practice this Way observe themselves in their daily conduct, constantly and attentively guarding their mindfulness, never allowing it to lapse. With long and unbroken practice, they attain great freedom, unimpeded in all directions, unbound by creation. Thus it is said: 'When bodhisattvas practice the profound *prajñāpāramitā*,' this is the time of practicing this Way. When effort deepens and power is perfected, wisdom becomes fully integrated, uniting with the original source, entering the sudden and complete. Transcending the ordinary, surpassing the sagely—this is what is meant by 'reaching the other shore.'

At this time, they perceive that the five aggregates are empty. When the five aggregates are empty, what phenomena could remain? Thus they are able to transcend all suffering and distress.

'Śāriputra'—the sharpest child within the house. 'Child' is like the master of a house, referring to the pure dharmakāya. Form is not different from emptiness; emptiness is not different from form. Form is precisely emptiness; emptiness is precisely form. Feeling, perception, volition, and consciousness are also thus.

Earlier in the sutra, the five aggregates are all empty—form, the sharpest child within the house. These dharmas are empty in nature, identical in substance to emptiness, indestructible through kalpas. This is what is meant by: 'neither arising nor ceasing,' without coming or going; 'neither defiled nor pure,' without contamination or attachment; 'neither increasing nor decreasing,' without surplus or lack.

Therefore, within emptiness there is no form, no feeling, perception, volition, or consciousness; no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, or mind; no form, sound, smell, taste, touch, or dharmas. This is called the empty nature, originally without the five aggregates or the six consciousnesses—how could there be the six sense objects? Consciousness arises from the eye realm; where there is the eye realm, there are the five aggregates; where there are the five aggregates, there are the six sense faculties; where there are the six sense faculties, there are the six consciousnesses; where there are the six consciousnesses, there are the six sense objects."

Without the eye realm, how could there be sense objects or consciousness? Thus it is said: even unto the absence of the mind-consciousness realm. The mind-consciousness realm encompasses the prior eighteen realms. Without this mind-consciousness, there is no ignorance, nor is there the exhaustion of ignorance. What is meant by "no exhaustion of ignorance" is merely that ignorance does not arise. If ignorance were utterly extinguished, one would fall into dead emptiness. The *Dan Shu* says: "Quelling thoughts is the nurturing of the fire"—this is what it means.

Ignorance is the root of birth and death. The *Dan Shu* says: "Where thoughts arise is the Mysterious Female; the gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth." Is this not the root of birth and death? Therefore, without ignorance, there is neither old age and death, nor the exhaustion of old age and death; no suffering, origination, cessation, or path; no wisdom, nor delusion; no attainment. With nothing to attain, there is nothing to lose.

Thus all dharma of the mind is empty. To realize the dharma of the mind is called *bodhi*; to realize the emptiness of dharmas is called *sattva*. Beginners rely on *prajñāpāramitā*, and so their minds are without obstruction. This is called moving from existence into non-existence, from the coarse to the subtle, awakening great wisdom to shatter delusion, ever-pure and harmonious with the original nature. At the ultimate perfection, the mind is one with the great void, vast and unobstructed.

With no attachments, there is no fear, and one is far removed from inverted dreams and illusions. The dreaming mind is the work of confusion. Without confusion, the *Dharmakāya* is pure, and thus one can attain ultimate *nirvāṇa*. All buddhas of the three times and ancestral masters of past generations relied on *prajñāpāramitā* to attain *Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi*. Later true learners of the Buddha follow this path, awakening the six wisdoms to purify and harmonize with the original nature, thereby realizing the supreme, perfect enlightenment.

For this reason, *prajñāpāramitā* is the fourfold mantra. *Mahā* is the great divine mantra, referring to the indestructible four great elements of the body, whose spiritual powers are unfathomable. *Prajñā* is the great luminous mantra, referring to the all-pervading wisdom that is diligent, bright, and wondrous. *Pāramitā* is the unsurpassed mantra, referring to harmony with the original nature, the supreme vehicle. *Mita* is the unequaled mantra, referring to the ultimate perfection, beyond which there is nothing higher.

One who realizes these four mantras can then eliminate all suffering—this is true and not false. Thus the World-Honored One expounded this *prajñāpāramitā* mantra, which is the explanation of the meaning of the preceding four-line mantra. Thus it is said: *Gate* refers to the emptiness of persons; *gate* again refers to the emptiness of dharmas; *pāragate* refers to the emptiness of all mind-dharmas upon reaching the other shore; *pārasaṃgate* refers to reaching the shore without needing a boat. These four *gate* mantras correspond to the four great elements within the body. When the four great elements are all empty, the true and constant alone is revealed—thus it is said: *bodhi svāhā*. *Bodhi* is the beginning; *svāhā* is the end. When beginning and end are one, one embraces the original and returns to the void, surpassing buddhas and ancestors.

Though it be thus, those who transmit and receive this teaching must straighten their spines and focus their gaze, lest they miss the mark. If one can, in the midst of daily activities, stumble upon and recognize one’s own nature, one will realize that this sūtra is not obtained from without. Not only this *Heart Sūtra*, but all the vast teachings of Buddhism and Daoism, and the hundred schools of thought—one need only a single shout to penetrate them from beginning to end. If this is not yet so, then investigate this single point. Do not doubt further.

Drawing on the principles of Confucianism and Buddhism to illuminate the Dao, the learner will understand that the three teachings are fundamentally one, without dualistic views.

The *Yin Fu Jing* [*Direct Pointer to the Yin Fu Jing*]:
The *Yin Fu Jing* concerns the mechanism of yin-yang harmony, a principle universally practiced. Observing the Dao of heaven, heaven displays signs to indicate fortune and misfortune, which the sage emulates. Mastering the movements of heaven is perfection. The transformations of heaven and earth are mirrored by the sage. Heaven has five thieves: the five *qi* give birth to the myriad things, and the five *qi* steal from the myriad things. Those who see this prosper. Seeing the five aggregates as empty, one transcends all suffering and distress. The five thieves reside in the mind; the mechanism of theft is within. When applied to heaven, the heavenly principle is not violated.

The cosmos lies within the hand, grasping the movements of heaven. The myriad transformations arise within the body. Heaven and earth are none other than myself. Heavenly nature is human nature; what heaven bestows upon humanity is *xing* (nature). The human heart is the mechanism. What sets this mechanism in motion is the heart.

Establish the Dao of heaven to stabilize humanity. Heaven establishes its lineage and institutes teachings to transform people. When heaven unleashes its killing mechanism, the heavenly mechanism, though inherently without intent, reveals that within killing lies the intent for life. Dragons and serpents rise from the land; their coils, being utterly still and desireless, enable them to respond to opportunity and arise in accord with the times. When humans unleash their killing mechanism, the human heart, though originally without intent, can conceal and yet manifest.

Heaven and earth reverse themselves. The divine mechanism operates wondrously, thus their reversals are unfathomable. When heaven and humanity act in unison, the human mechanism aligns with the heavenly mechanism. The foundation of myriad changes is established. By establishing the foundation in the heart, all changes are stabilized.

Nature may be skillful or clumsy; things are not uniform and thus can be concealed. Skill and clumsiness are indistinguishable. The nine orifices are perverse; if one orifice is unsettled, all nine become perverse. It lies in the three essentials. When body, heart, and intent are settled, all nine orifices are unobstructed.

Fire is born from wood, just as the five thieves reside in the heart—when misfortune arises, it must overcome. The heart is harmed by the five thieves. Treachery arises within the state; the myriad transformations arise within the body—when the time moves, it must collapse. The body is the mechanism of myriad transformations.

Those who know this and cultivate refinement, skillfully governing the crown, carefully guard against fire and prevent treachery—these are called sages. Enriching the state and pacifying the people—this is what defines a sage.

Heaven gives life, heaven brings death; it animates the myriad things without sharing the sage’s concerns—this is the principle of the Dao. Generation and transformation are the constant principles of the Dao.

Heaven and earth are the thieves of the myriad things; heaven gives life to the myriad things and also kills them. The myriad things are the thieves of humanity; they nourish humanity and yet can also steal from them. Humanity is the thief of the myriad things; humans complete the myriad things and yet steal from them.

When the three thieves are fitting, humans can transform things, and the three thieves are all transmuted. When the three powers are at peace, humans follow the heavenly principle, and the three powers are all at peace.

Thus it is said: Eat in season, and the hundred bones are ordered. With regulated eating and drinking, the hundred bones are all in harmony. Move in accord with the mechanism, and the myriad transformations are at peace. In movement and stillness, responding to opportunity, the myriad transformations are all at peace.

Humans know the divine as divine, mistaking the thief for their child, unaware of the divine nature of the non-divine. This is not the mark of dharmas; this is called the mark of dharmas. The sun and moon have their cycles; their waxing and waning follow fixed patterns. Great and small have their determinations. Though great and small differ, each has its fixed form.

Sagehood arises therein; when great and small are undifferentiated, sagehood arises. Spirit and illumination emerge. When the sun and moon unite their virtues, spirit and illumination manifest.

The thief is the mechanism. It does not depart from the square inch. All under heaven see it—every thing is fully revealed—yet none know it, and even when face-to-face, they do not recognize it.

The noble person who attains it embodies it in their conduct; the noble person acts in accord with the times. The petty person who attains it treats life lightly; the petty person is without restraint.

The blind excel in hearing; sound and form are concentrated in the ear. The deaf excel in seeing; crimson hues are concentrated in the eye. Cutting off one source of desire, crimson hues lie hidden in the heart. Employing the teacher yields tenfold results. When the heart is concentrated on one, achievement is tenfold.

Reversing by day and night, one turns inward to see and listen, returning to the body to achieve sincerity. Employing the teacher yields ten-thousandfold results. Morning and evening, never forgetting—achievement is ten-thousandfold.

The heart arises from things, and with the heart arise all dharmas. It dies through things. When the heart perishes, all dharmas perish.

The mechanism lies in the eye. Without the eye-realm, even to the absence of the mind-consciousness realm.

Heaven’s lack of favor is Heaven’s release of the killing mechanism, yet great favor arises. All things fulfill their lives.

Swift thunder and fierce winds, repeated thunderclaps— the noble person cultivates and reflects in fear and trembling. None are not stirred into motion. Fear brings forth blessing.

Supreme joy abounds in nature; constant joy lies in my stillness. In utmost stillness, there is integrity. In extreme stillness, frugality in movement.

Heaven’s utmost partiality is to give life and take life. Employed with utmost impartiality, it is without faction or bias.

The regulation of birds lies in qi. The regulation of bird-thieves lies in governing qi.

Life is the root of death; when qi flourishes, spirit darkens. Death is the root of life; when qi dissipates, spirit quickens.

Favor arises from harm; halting the sun lengthens wisdom. Harm arises from favor. Capturing the thief secures achievement.

The foolish deem the patterns of heaven and earth sagely; the ignorant cannot follow heaven’s principle, yet take patterns as sagacity. I find wisdom in the patterns of seasonal things. The enlightened, possessing heaven and earth within themselves, thus find wisdom in the patterns of seasonal things.

○ Observing heaven’s Dao, grasping heaven’s actions—this is perfection. The three heavens complete the marrow’s transformation.
