**The Fifty-Fifth Scroll of the *Ten Books on Cultivating the True: Annotated *Huangting Neijing Yujing***
**Annotations and Preface to the *Huangting Neijing Yujing***
*By Liangqiuxi*

All things take man as their master; man takes the One Heart as his foundation. Without a master, the Dharma does not arise; without the heart, the body cannot stand. The methods of the heart are manifold, their wondrous applications not singular. They possess the two bodies of being and non-being, responding to affairs as the moment demands. Thus, there are distinctions of ordinary and sagely, shallow and profound, foolish and wise, true and false—none but are discerned by the heart, for it governs the workings of perception.

Yet the Dao of all under heaven, though its paths diverge, converges in one; though its considerations are a hundredfold, they unite in a single end. Entering the wondrous from the hall is but two stages—expediency and reality—while embracing the near and tallying with the true, right and wrong become one vision.

There is the *Huangting Jing*, a secret treasure of Donghua. Truly, it is the essential subtlety of learning immortality, the root of feathered transformation. Though my study remains incomplete and my visualization but roughly grasped, I have modeled the myriad spirits into a single form. Its meaning encompasses four schools, its illumination clarifies seven characters; its pointers and metaphors speak of inner and outer in twofold discourse. In the pauses between poring over ancient texts and the breaths of exhalation and swallowing, I licked my brush, ground my ink, and thus bequeathed this humble offering.

The Great Lord of Fusang, the Divine King of Yang Valley, transmitted the *Huangting Neijing* to the Lady Wei of Nanyue. *Huang* is the color of the center; *Ting* is the midst of the four directions. Externally, it refers to the center of heaven, the center of man, and the center of earth; internally, it refers to the center of the brain, the center of the heart, and the center of the spleen. Thus, it is called *Huangting*. *Nei* is the heart; *Jing* is the form and image. Externally, it compares to the colors of the sun, moon, stars, clouds, and rosy dawn; internally, it compares to the forms of sinews, bones, and the viscera. The heart dwells within the body, storing and observing the images and colors of the whole—thus, it is called *Neijing*.

Another name is *Qin Xin* ("Lute Heart"). *Qin* means harmony; reciting it harmonizes the six palaces and pacifies the heart-spirit, enabling one to attain immortality. Another name is *The Great Emperor’s Golden Book*. The Great Lord of Fusang recites this scripture in his palace, inscribing it on golden tablets—hence, it is called *Golden Book*. Another name is *The Jade Chapters of Donghua*. Donghua is the name of the palaces of the eastern direction. In the Eastern Sea dwells the Green Lad, where jade maidens and immortals all chant and recite it, inscribing it on jade tablets—thus, it is called *Jade Chapters*.

One should purify oneself for ninety days and recite it ten thousand times, thereby harmonizing the three *hun*, refining the seven *po*, expelling the Three Corpses, and pacifying the six palaces. The five viscera will flourish, one will return to the state of an infant, and the hundred illnesses cannot harm, nor can calamities injure. When the ten thousand recitations are complete, one will naturally perceive spirits and gods with penetrating vision and internally behold the intestines and stomach, seeing the five viscera. At that time, the Perfected of the Yellow Court and the Jade Maiden of Donghua will teach you the arts of immortality.

Those who constantly chant it will find their spirit-chamber bright and upright, their primordial embryo at peace, their numinous fluids flowing freely, their hundred passages harmonized and smooth, their blood and marrow abundant, their intestines and stomach empty yet full, their five viscera blossoming with radiance, their ears and eyes keen, their white hair returning to black, and their decayed teeth regrowing. As for repelling the tumult of demonic illnesses, it is because I have already obtained the names of the six wefts of the *hun*-essence.

The oral instructions of Qingxu Yuzhen state: The *Huangting Jing* is the secret teaching of the Great Lord of Fusang’s golden book for refining the true. Those who read and recite it must do so in a separate chamber, burning incense and maintaining purity before taking it up. This scripture repels the hundred demons. If one enters mountains and forests or dark, empty places and the heart trembles in fear, one should face north, recite the scripture once, and the spirit will settle, the mind will calm, as if traveling with a thousand companions. If one recites it ten thousand times, one’s eyes will see the five viscera and intestines, and the gods of all under heaven will be at one’s command. If afflicted by illness, one should visualize and recite it, and even those on the verge of death will recover.

In general, one must abstain from the six livestock, fishy and rank foods, the five pungent vegetables, and treading upon or covering filth. If one has trodden upon or covered filth, one should bathe, rinse the mouth, burn incense to the left and right, and recite the scripture once—then the hundred illnesses will be dispelled.

**First Chapter of the Shangqing Section**
Before the Purple Radiance of the Void Sovereign of Shangqing...

Within the Three Clarities’ realms lie the Grand Clarity, the Highest Clarity, and the Jade Clarity. These Three Clarities encompass the abodes of all great sages. According to the *Scripture of the Jade Terrace*, the Void Sovereign governs the domain of the Great Dao Lord—this is the realm of the Great Dao, which embraces the Three Clarities. The *Ten Titles of the Mystic Capital* further states: the Supreme Numinous Void Sovereign, the Heavenly Venerable, is the primordial title of the Originator. The Dao Lord, desiring to illuminate the origin of the seven-character verse within the Purple Radiance’s palace—also called the Palace of Purple Jade or the Crimson-White-Purple Imperial Palace—thus reveals the title of the Supreme Great Dao Jade Imperial Lord. "Supreme" denotes the highest reverence; as the *Scripture of Fundamental Conduct* records, this is the title of the Originator and the Five Elders. The Jade Dawn Lord is the title of the Yellow Lord.

When dwelling in the Palace of Elixir Pearls to compose seven-character verses, the *Scripture of Esoteric Essentials* describes the immortal palaces: the Hall of Liao-Yang, the Gate of Elixir Pearls, the Chambers of Emerald Clouds, where the Dao Lord expounds the scriptures. This mirrors the human body’s inherent structure.

Dispersing and transforming the five forms, transmuting into myriad spirits—this refers to the ability to transform, relinquishing cleverness and wisdom, shedding form and intellect, merging with the Great Dao. Preceding essence and following traces, one temporarily employs spirit as a vessel. Spirit responds to circumstances, dispersing into five forms and transmuting into myriad spirits. Thus, the *Inner Chapter* of the *Yellow Court* derives its name from this principle.

The zither-heart in triple layers dances with the embryonic immortal—"zither" signifies harmony, "layers" denote accumulation. By harmonizing and accumulating the Three Elixir Fields into unity, the embryonic immortal resembles one in fetal breathing, where breath exists yet remains unexhaled. The nine qi radiate brilliance between the heavens. Within the Three Fields dwell nine qi, resplendent and illuminating all without exception. The *Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: the Three Elixir Fields, Three Origins, and Three Cavern Chambers combine into nine palaces, wherein reside the Heavenly Sovereigns. The nine po transform into nine qi, which further manifest as nine spirits.

The spirit’s canopy—youthful lads—generates purple mist. Through contemplation and visualization, one employs the eyes as instruments.

The following text states: the brows are called the "flowering canopy" shading the luminous pearls. The "spirit’s canopy" refers to the brows; the "luminous pearls," to the pupils of the eyes. The purple mist is the essence of subtle qi. This is called the *Jade Scripture*, which may be studied with precision. When writing arises from traces, focus leads to comprehension. Chanting it ten thousand times ascends one to the Three Heavens—when essence is perfected and spirit is replete, one’s name is inscribed in the Three Clarities. A thousand disasters dissipate, and a hundred illnesses heal, for both essence and spirit are fully present. One need not fear the ferocity of tigers and wolves, for no harm remains. This also reverses aging and extends longevity. This single chapter entirely expounds the Dao of the Yellow Court.

**Chapter Two: Above the Yellow Court**
Above lies the ethereal soul, below the Pass of Origin. The "ethereal soul" pertains to heaven; the "Pass of Origin," to earth. The soul is formless, while the Pass of Origin has substance—man models himself upon heaven and earth. On the left is Lesser Yang, on the right Greater Yin: left is east, right is west; the east gives birth, the west brings death. Behind lies the Hidden Gate, before the Gate of Life. "Before" is south; "behind," north. The Hidden Gate refers to the two posterior orifices, signifying concealment. The Gate of Life refers to the seven anterior orifices, through which life is sustained. Together, they form the nine orifices. Exhale the sun, inhale the moon—store this in your breath. The sun and moon are the essence of yin and yang; exhale to the left, inhale to the right. The body possesses the qi of yin and yang, modeling itself upon the qi of heaven and earth. Exhalation is the issuing breath, inhalation the drawing breath; between them, the heart must store this awareness. The primordial qi unites with the constellations’ divisions. Primordial qi is one. Align the heart with the Dao, and visualize the luminous radiance of the sun, moon, and stars, arrayed and shining, so that the body’s divisions become distinct and merge with heaven. Purple mist rises and falls amid the Three Pure Clouds. The purple mist is the qi of the eyes’ essence. Visualize the Three Elixir Fields above and below, all suffused with white qi, flowing as one. It is also said: the eyes’ light possesses three colors—purple, azure, and green—forming the Three Pure Clouds. The *Scriptures of the Immortals* state: the incantation of Lady Cloud-Forest says, "Sun and moon youths, the essence of the Three Clouds and the Two Eyes’ True Lords." Irrigate the Five Flowers to plant the numinous root. The qi of the Pure Clouds becomes jade liquid in the mouth; swallowing it irrigates the Five Flowers—the finest essences of the five viscera. The "numinous root" is the root of life, from which growth is planted. The seven fluids flow unimpeded between the jaws. The fluids of the seven orifices flow freely up and down, surging upward and circling downward, between the jaws and within the Hall of Light. Purple encircles yellow to enter the Elixir Field. This is an internal metaphor. The spleen’s qi is yellow; the eyes’ qi is purple. The seven fluids circulate, embracing yellow and returning with purple, entering and exiting with each breath to merge in the Elixir Field. There are three Elixir Fields, the roots of the numinous and the vital. According to the *Scripture of the Great Cavern*: three *fen* within the space between the brows form the Twin Elixir Fields; three *fen* into the bone’s edge form the Terrace and Gate, with the Azure Chamber on the left and the Purple Portal on the right, where two spirits reside. One *cun* inward from between the brows lies the Hall of Light, where the Luminous Youth Lord resides on the left, the Luminous Maiden Lord on the right, and the Mirror Spirit Lord in the center. Two *cun* inward lies the Cavern Chamber, where the Peerless Lord resides on the left, the White Origin Lord on the right, and the Yellow Elder Lord in the center. Three *cun* inward lies the Elixir Field, also called the Muddy Pellet Palace, where the Upper Origin Crimson Youth Lord resides on the left, and the Imperial Minister Lord on the right. Four *cun* inward lies the Flowing Pearl Palace, where the Flowing Pearl True Lord resides. Five *cun* inward lies the Jade Emperor’s Palace, where the Jade Clarity True Mother resides. One *cun* above the Hall of Light lies the Heavenly Court Palace, where the Upper Clarity True Maiden resides. One *cun* directly above the Cavern Chamber lies the Ultimate Truth Palace, where the Supreme Ultimate Emperor Lord resides. One *cun* directly above the Elixir Field lies the Elixir Mystery Palace, where the Central Yellow Grand Unity Lord resides. Two *cun* directly above the Flowing Pearl Palace lies the Supreme Sovereign Palace, where the Supreme Lord resides—masculine as yang, feminine as yin. Both men and women may cultivate this. The secluded chamber’s inner light illuminates the Gate of Yang. Within the hidden chamber, inwardly contemplate and store the heart’s intent; the eyes’ clarity discerns all, as if the sun and moon shine. The spirit is said to be without direction. The heart-spirit is boundless; when stored, it exists; when forgotten, it vanishes.

**Chapter Three: The Mouth**
The mouth is the Jade Pool and the Palace of Grand Harmony. The liquid in the mouth is jade fluid, also called sweet spring or jade nectar, stored as water in the pool. The hundred joints are harmonized and supple, the five viscera balanced and at ease—all governed by the mouth as their palace lord. One version reads "Palace of Grand Harmony," though this disrupts the rhyme. The *Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: visualize within the stomach’s opening a girl in infant form, unclothed, standing upright in the stomach’s tube, her mouth open to receive the soul’s liquid. Inhale the five qi, then fill the mouth with them, along with the inner and outer fluids, and swallow, sending them straight into the Mysterious Maiden’s mouth. After five repetitions, knock the teeth together three times and softly recite: "Jade Clarity, exalted above the Nine Heavens and Nine Spirits, transform into a spirit maiden and descend into the stomach’s purity. Gold harmonizes with jade, the heart is at ease, the spirit bright. Feast upon the sun’s essence, and golden radiance fills the body." Rinse and swallow the numinous liquid, and no disaster shall approach. The true qi of the numinous liquid repels the perverse. The body generates radiant light, its qi fragrant as orchids. Without consuming the five grains, the body remains free of filth. A hundred evils are extinguished, and the countenance is refined as jade. Cultivate this diligently, and ascend to the Broad Cold Palace. The Broad Cold is the name of a celestial palace in the north. On the winter solstice, the moon retreats to the Broad Cold Palace, where it nurtures the moon’s soul in that land. Heavenly beings gather the essence of its splendor to distinguish the light of the sun and moon. Cultivate by day and night without sleep, and you shall become a true one. In movement, refine; in stillness, stabilize—thus one becomes a true person. Thunder roars and lightning flashes, yet the spirit remains undisturbed. Harmonize spirit and regulate qi; essence and soul are serene and joyful. Though thunder shakes, there is no fear. It is also said: thunder is lightning’s excitation, the result of knocking the teeth and storing thought—this is the spirit’s work, not to be called "undisturbed."

**Chapter Four: The Yellow Court**

The Yellow Court’s inner maiden wears brocade robes—
The Yellow Court’s inner maiden refers to the Dao Mother;
The Yellow Court’s perfected one refers to the Dao Father,
both embodied within the self.
The brocade robes bear the five colors,
signifying the true qi of the five viscera.
Within the Three Courts, they are fully present.

Purple auroras trail her skirts like drifting clouds—
The *Scripture of the Ten Directions* states:
The Most High Jade Emperor wears a robe of luminous, cloud-woven skirts,
the raiment of immortals.

Cinnabar and azure, green branches with jade-like boughs,
where the five-colored essences intertwine to form the immortal’s garb.
The seven-tiered jade lock seals the double doors—
an outer metaphor.
The seven apertures open and close like bolts,
used with the Dao, never sealed in vain.
The lock is adorned with its key.
To store the spirit, cross the hands and close the eyes—
thus sealing the two doors.

Double-shuttered, the golden gate guards the secret mechanism—
"Golden" denotes firmness and strength.
The *Scripture of Laozi* says:
"One skilled in closure needs no bolt yet cannot be opened,"
speaking of the adept who guards the spirit and never leaks it wantonly.

The dark spring flows deep within the towering, secluded gate—
The dark spring is the fluid within the mouth,
also called Jade Brew, Jade Liquid, or Jade Spring.
The space between the eyes is the Gate Court;
the space between the kidneys is the Secluded Gate,
like the twin pillars of a gate’s frame,
with the Dao at its center.
The kidneys lie within, hence called the Secluded Gate.
Though the kidneys rest below the five viscera,
when the form is subdued and the spirit stored,
they rise above the Cinnabar Field—
thus called "towering."

Within the Three Fields, the essence and qi are subtle—
an internal allusion.
In the Cinnabar Field, the spirit and qi transform,
responding to the heart’s intent,
neither existing nor non-existing,
beyond all doing.
Like a dragon entering mystery, its foundation is orderly,
so with qi, the heart governs.
Thus, the image is established—
utter stillness, utter subtlety,
beyond reckoning.
The *Scripture of the Dao’s Mechanism* states:
"Heaven has its Three Lights: sun, moon, and stars;
humans have their Three Treasures: the Three Cinnabar Fields."
In the Cinnabar Field’s qi,
left is blue, right is yellow,
above is white, below is black.

The graceful maiden, lithe and veiled in celestial radiance—
The *True Records* say:
The graceful maiden is the name of the ear’s spirit.
When the ear hears clearly, its brightness veils the dark glow.

The layered hall shines resplendent, displaying the Eight Might—
The layered hall is the name of the throat,
also called the layered tower or layered rings.
This scripture states:
"The Crimson Palace’s layered tower has twelve tiers."
The Crimson Palace is the heart.
The throat lies above the heart, hence called the layered hall.
The throat is the path of fluids,
flowing to nourish the whole body,
illuminating the eight directions.
The spirits of the eight directions are called the Eight Might.

The Heavenly Court and Earthly Gate stand newly arrayed like axes—
The space between the brows is the Heavenly Court.
The incantation of Lady Ziwei says:
"Open the Heavenly Court to grant me longevity."
"Newly arrayed like axes" speaks of vigor and strength.

The Spirit Terrace stands firm, never decaying—
The heart is the Spirit Terrace,
where the divine spirit resides.
In stillness, guard the One;
in movement, store the spirit.
When the spirit is complete and settled,
it never declines.

**Chapter Five: The Central Pool**

The Central Pool’s inner spirit wears crimson pearls—
The gallbladder is the Central Pool;
the tongue is the Flower Pool;
the lower abdomen is the Jade Pool—
all names for the Three Pools.
The *Chapter on the Gallbladder* states:
"The dragon banner spans the sky, casting fire bells."
The crimson pearls refer to the fire bells.

Cinnabar brocade and cloud-woven robes bear the tiger tally—
The cinnabar brocade and cloud-woven robes
are the colors of the heart and lungs,
situated above the gallbladder,
hence called cloud-woven robes and tiger tally.
The *Scripture of the Nine Perfected* says:
"The Yellow Elder Lord’s raiment bears
the dark dragon and divine tiger tally,
girded with flowing golden bells—
the attire of the Dao Lord."

The three-inch ford is where the numinous dwells—
an internal allusion.

The navel lies above the womb, hence called the "horizontal ford." Three inches below the navel is the Cinnabar Field, where the Perfected and the Red Child reside. Concealed within, misty and dense, they support one another—
This refers to the forms of man and woman. Their hidden union is the natural Dao.
According to the *Record of Inner and Outer Divine Mushrooms*:
"The fluids of the five viscera become mushrooms." This is the "hidden mushroom," also called the "inner mushroom."

**Heavenly Pillar Chapter VI**
Tend the essence of the Heavenly Pillar with care—
The Heavenly Pillar is the nose, also called the Heavenly Terrace. The *Scripture of Dissolution and Rubbing* states: "Frequently press the sides of the nose to balance the qi, which is called irrigating the Central Peak and inscribing the Emperor’s Register."
Once the numinous dwelling is purified, the Jade Emperor roams—
The face is the numinous dwelling, also called the Heavenly Abode. It is where the brows, eyes, and mouth reside, hence called the abode. Refine it to perfection, and the immortals will wander there. The *Great Cavern Scripture* says: "The face is the foot-square abode," or sometimes called the "crimson marsh."
Keep the pathways unobstructed without cease—
The *Scripture of Great Simplicity and Cinnabar Radiance* states: "On the face, constantly rub with both hands, following its contours without pause, to unblock the qi and vessels of the ears, eyes, and mouth."
The brows are named the Floral Canopy, shading the bright pearls—
The bright pearls are the eyes.
The Nine Darks and sun-moon illumine the hollow origin—
The *Five Spirits’ Conduct* states: "Above the brows, trace the purple palace of the Hall of Light, with the sun on the left and the moon on the right." The *Jade Calendar Scripture* also says: "Above the Great Clarity are nine-tiered canopies of five-colored blossoms; the human body has them too. One should visualize the pupils as bright as the sun and moon."
Within the abode dwells the Perfected, ever clad in cinnabar—
The True Dragon, spirit of the heart, is the Crimson-Walled Youth, also called the True One, the Red Child, the Child Cinnabar, or the Perfected. Visualizing him keeps him ever present, responding to the heart and reflecting its qi and color.
If one can truly see him, no illness will arise—
Master Primal Yang said: "Constantly visualize the heart’s spirit, and there will be no sickness."
Crimson pearls and numinous skirts, radiant and splendid—
The attire and colors of the heart’s spirit, an external metaphor.
Beneath the tongue, the Dark Gullet is the shore of life and death—
An internal allusion. The Dark Gullet is the shore where fluids and essence flow. The *Root Scripture* states: "The Dark Gullet is the qi vessel that receives the essence tally."
Exhaling clarity and inhaling mystery, the two qi shine—
This refers to the exhalation and inhalation of yin and yang qi, resplendent and luminous.
If you encounter this, you will ascend to the Celestial Han.

**Supreme Dao Chapter VII**
The Supreme Dao is not burdensome; concentrate to preserve the true—
Devotion brings attainment.
The Mud Pill and every joint have their spirits—
Spirits are the wonders of the myriad things, named according to their forms.
Hair and gray blossoms are called Great Primal—
White and black together are called gray, residing at the very top, hence the Great Primal.
The spirit of the brain’s essence-root is called Mud Pill—
The palace of the Cinnabar Field, the union of the Yellow Court, the master of the Grotto Chamber, the root of yin and yang—this is the image of the brain’s Mud Pill.
The spirit of the eyes’ clarity is called Radiant Mystery—
The eyes are likened to the sun and moon, atop the head, hence "clarity above." Radiant Mystery is the pure color of the youthful spirit. An internal allusion.
The spirit of the nose’s jade ridge is called Numinous Firmness—
The ridge’s bone resembles jade, and the spirit’s qi connects to heaven, entering and exiting without exhaustion, hence Numinous Firmness.
The spirit of the ears’ emptiness is called Secluded Field—
Emptiness and seclusion, where hearing is acute and the spirit resides, hence the Secluded Field.
The spirit of the tongue’s life-channel is called Proper Order—
Swallowing fluids with the tongue, life’s essence flows unimpeded. Regulating the five flavors, each has its proper principle.
The spirit of the teeth’s blade-peaks is called Net-Thousand—
The teeth are firm and sharp, like blades that cut and crush, netting all things for consumption.
The spirit of the face governs the Mud Pill—
The brain’s spirit is the master of the hundred spirits of the Cinnabar Field.
The Nine Perfected of the Mud Pill each have their chambers—
The *Great Cavern Scripture* states: "The Three Primes conceal transformations to form the Three Palaces; three times three makes nine, hence the Three Cinnabar Fields." There are also the Three Caverns and the Fish Union, totaling one or two Primes to make the Nine Palaces, where the Nine Perfected spirits reside. Three nines are twenty-seven spirits; when harmonized with a person, they should be visualized—these are also called the Nine August Ones. The Nine Souls transform into nine qi, becoming nine spirits, each dwelling in a grotto chamber.
The chambers are one inch square, situated within—
Each chamber is one inch, and the brain has nine lobes.
Together they wear purple robes and flying gauze skirts—
The attire of the Nine Perfected mirrors the colors of qi, light as flight.
Simply contemplate one division, and longevity will be endless—
Visualizing the Nine Perfected is the way to immortality.
They do not each reside separately within the brain—
The spirits gather in the Cinnabar Field, where the Spring Spirit dwells.
Their seats are arrayed facing outward—
The spirits govern the Cinnabar Field but face outward to ward off misfortune. The *Eight Simplicities Scripture* states: "The Perfected have nine ranks, facing outward in their positions: the Supreme Perfected face upward, the High Perfected south, the Great Perfected east, the Spirit Perfected west, the Mysterious Perfected north, the Immortal Perfected northeast, the Celestial Perfected southeast, the Void Perfected southwest, and the Utmost Perfected northwest." The Celestial Perfected see without looking, hear without listening, rectify without speaking, and follow without moving.
Their existence depends on the heart’s proper alignment—
When the heart contemplates the Mysterious Perfected, inner and outer respond.

**Heart Spirit Chapter VIII**
The spirit of the heart, Cinnabar Prime, is called Guarding Numinous—
An internal metaphor. The heart is the primal organ of the viscera, the color of southern fire, the abode of the spirit’s handle, hence Guarding Numinous.
The spirit of the lungs, Luminous Florescence, is called Empty Accomplishment—
The lungs are the heart’s floral canopy, luminous white, the color of western metal. The lungs’ color is white, their substance light and empty, hence Empty Accomplishment.
The spirit of the liver, Dragon Mist, is called Containing Clarity—
The liver’s position is the phase of wood, the color of the eastern Azure Dragon. Among the viscera, it governs the eyes. The sun rises in the east, hence Containing Clarity.

The misty canopy governs clarity and turbidity—
*Yiyu* is the image of wood; when it meets fire, smoke arises; when it meets yang, qi becomes clear. Clarity brings brightness to the eyes; turbidity brings dimness.

The spirit of the kidneys, Profound Darkness, is called Nurturing Infant—
The kidneys belong to water, hence *Profound Darkness*. Kidney essence generates the child, hence *Nurturing Infant*.

The spirit of the spleen, Ever-Present, is called Soul-Resting—
The spleen occupies the central earth phase, hence *Ever-Present*, the Yellow Court’s palace. The spleen’s grinding digests food, its spirit-power mirrors strength, hence *Soul-Resting*.

The spirit of the gallbladder, Dragon Radiance, is called Majestic Clarity—
The gallbladder’s color is azure light, hence *Dragon Radiance*; it governs courage and vigor, hence *Majestic Clarity*. Externally, it draws from the eastern Azure Dragon’s thunderous resonance.

The six bowels and five viscera embody the spirits’ essence—
They sustain the entire body; none may be discarded, hence *the spirits’ essence*. The heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys are the five viscera; the stomach, large intestine, small intestine, bladder, triple burner, and gallbladder are the six bowels. The term *bowel* resembles a prefecture’s storehouse, taking the meaning of receiving things, hence *bowel*. The *viscera* each possess a distinct substance yet are collectively stored within the body, hence *viscera*. Much has been said of the triple burner, yet its true nature remains obscure—it lies above the heart, liver, and lungs, within the connecting vessels. The *Central Yellow Scripture* states: “The heart, liver, and lungs are the triple burner,” pointing to its location.

Yet according to the five phases’ colors, the spleen governs the five viscera—why then is the heart considered their master?
The answer: The heart resides at the center of the five viscera; its substance is emptiness and receptivity, the body of spirit-awareness and the source of function. Thus, it governs the directions and manifests its power, moving and acting to attain its numinous nature. It cannot be spoken in terms of images or numbers, nor grasped through material analogy—all is the Dao of spontaneity.

All operate within the heart, circulating the celestial scriptures—
The five viscera and six bowels each have their offices, modeling heaven and earth, aligning with yin and yang, the natural Dao of resonance and governance, hence *circulating the celestial scriptures*.

Preserve them day and night to attain longevity—
By visualizing these five spirits with their corresponding colors, one holds fast to the undying Dao.

The *Scripture of Immortals* states: Envision the qi of the five viscera transforming into five-colored clouds, covering the body from above. The sun resides before you, the moon behind; the Azure Dragon to the left, the White Tiger to the right; the Vermilion Bird in front, the Dark Warrior behind—this is the Dao of dispelling evil and attaining longevity.

**Lung Section Chapter IX**
The lung’s palace resembles a floral canopy—
A golden palace, for the lungs stand above the five viscera, their lobes like a canopy.

Below sits a youth within the Jade Tower—
The youth is named *Luminous Florescence*; the lungs’ form is canopy-like, hence described as below. The *Jade Tower* refers to the white qi within the kidneys, connecting upward to the lungs.

The Seven Origins’ child governs qi-regulation—
Master Yuan Yang states: The Lords of the Seven Origins bear armor and hold talismans, repelling inauspicious evil and distributing qi to the seven orifices, governing the acuity of ears and eyes. The *Seven Origins* are the primordial qi beyond the seven orifices.

Externally corresponding to the Central Peak’s nose and navel—
The *Central Peak* is the nose. It is also the navel, the navel being Kunlun. The nose is the gateway of the seven orifices, its position like that of a master.

Adorned in silken robes with a yellow-cloud sash—
*Silken* is the color of the lung’s membrane. The yellow membrane spreads and entwines, resembling cloud-like patterns.

When breathing becomes labored and the body feels unwell—
This occurs at times.

Swiftly visualize White Prime harmonizing the six qi—
White Prime Lord governs the lung palace. The *Great Cavern Scripture* states: “White Prime Lord resides to the right of the Cavern Chamber.”

The divine immortals’ long vision knows no harm—
Evil does not invade the upright.

The practice unceasing—form does not stagnate.
Constantly abiding in this Dao, the body’s qi flourishes in splendor.
This is the attainment of sincere cultivation.

**Chapter Ten: The Heart Section**

The Heart Section’s palace holds a lotus in bud—
A fire palace, the heart’s essence resembles an unopened lotus flower.

Below dwells the youthful Dan Yuan’s household—
The heart spirit, Dan Yuan, guards the numinous spirit within the heart.
*Below* refers to its position beneath the canopy.

It governs the harmony of cold and heat, the flourishing of defense and nourishment—
Cold and heat signify the principles of yin-yang, stillness and dryness.
One constantly harmonizes them to nourish and defend the body.
The *Laozi Scripture* states: “Stillness prevails over cold, dryness overcomes heat; clarity and stillness are the true standards of the world.”

Crimson brocade robes draped in jade gauze—
The heart resembles *li*.
Crimson brocade represents the outer yang of the robes.
Jade gauze draped over signifies inner yin.

Golden bells and vermilion sashes seated in tranquil repose—
Golden bells symbolize the inner elixir.
Vermilion sashes represent the blood vessels.
*Seated in tranquil repose* describes the spirit’s serenity.
The *Nine Perfected Scripture* states: “The Yellow and Old Lords wear flowing-gold bells.”

Regulating blood and governing life, the body does not wither—
With the heart at peace and the body harmonized, illness does not arise.

Externally, it manifests in the mouth and tongue, exhaling the five blossoms—
The heart governs the mouth and tongue, exhaling and inhaling the essences of the five viscera, discerning the flavors of the five phases; thus it is said to externally correspond to the five tastes.
When on the verge of death, calling upon it brings revival—
When one is gravely ill, one should visualize the Cinnabar Prime Youth, clad in vermilion robes and crimson cap, to rescue and protect.
With long practice, one soars upon the great rosy clouds.

**Chapter Eleven: The Liver Section**

The liver’s palace is wrapped in layers of emerald—
A wooden abode, the liver’s hue is azure-green, an image of the great and small enfolded.
Below resides the Azure Youth, Divine Lord—
The liver holds the eastern position of wood, master of green; hence he is called the Azure Youth.
To the left is the Lord’s Son, also named Containing Brilliance, above whom hangs a floral canopy; thus he is said to dwell below.
He governs the gates and mirrors, the origin of clarity—
The liver presides over the three months of spring, the root and beginning of yang; its orifice governs the eyes, the gate and mirror of the five phases; thus it is the origin of clarity.
Clad in azure brocade robes, girded with jade bells—
Azure brocade is the liver’s color.
Jade bells symbolize the white vessels hanging in resemblance.
The *Scripture of Ascending Mystery* states: “The Three Heavens and Five Emperors all wear great jade pendants.”
The *Scripture of Plain Radiance* states: “The Lord of Numinous Brilliance wears azure brocade and cinnabar robes, the raiment of immortals.”

Harmonizing and restraining the hun and po, balancing the fluids—
This refers to internal matters.
When spring’s warmth is gentle, the myriad things are born.
Externally, it corresponds to the eyes, the essence of sun and moon—
The liver externally governs the eyes, the left like the sun, the right like the moon.
When afflicted by the hundred diseases, visualize the Peerless Hero—
When various illnesses assail, simply visualize the Peerless Hero, the Lord’s Son.
Practicing together for seven days restores fullness—
All five viscera are visualized together; thus it is said to practice in unison.
Seven days form one cycle, one journey.
When near death, contemplating the spirit revives the dying—
When on the brink of death, visualize the liver’s spirit, the azure-robed youth, and recovery follows.
Gathering the hun and returning the po ensures eternal stability—
The *Numinous Writ of the Great Tenuity* states: “On the third, thirteenth, and twenty-third evenings of each month, the three hun depart the body to wander outside. To gather them, one should lie supine without a pillow, stretch the feet, cross the hands over the heart, close the eyes, hold the breath for three cycles, and click the teeth three times. Upon completion, visualize a red qi the size of a chicken’s egg emerging from within the heart and passing through the throat. The red qi expands, enveloping the body and transforming into fire, burning the body all around until a slight warmth is felt. Then call the names of the three hun: *Shuangling*, *Taiguang*, and *Youjing*, and softly recite the incantation: *‘Within the Yellow Beginning of the Great Tenuity Palace, internally refine the three hun. May Taiguang be at peace, the numinous jade treasure, born with me, not acting recklessly. The overseer is the Great Void. If you wish to fly and wander, go only to the Upper Clarity. If hungry or thirsty, drink the mysterious water and jade essence.’*

Furthermore, on the new moon, full moon, and dark moon, when the luminous po are abundant and intermingling, practice the method of refining and returning the essence. Lie supine with feet stretched, cover the ears with the palms so the roots of the fingers encircle the nape, hold the breath seven times, and click the teeth seven times. Visualize a white qi the size of a small bean at the tip of the nose, gradually expanding until it crowns the body in nine layers. Suddenly, the qi transforms into two azure dragons within the eyes, white tigers in the nostrils, a vermilion phoenix above the heart, a dark turtle beneath the left foot, and a flying serpent beneath the right foot. Two jade maidens in brocade robes hold flames of fire at the gates of the ears. Upon completion, swallow the saliva seven times and call the names of the seven po: *Shigou*, *Fushi*, *Queyin*, *Tianzei*, *Duwei*, and *Choufei*. Then recite the incantation: *‘The plain qi returns ninefold, restraining the hun and dispelling wickedness. The Celestial Hound guards the gate, the Maiden of Jade holds the pass. Refine the po to harmony, abiding with me in peace, not acting recklessly. Observe and examine the source of form. If hungry or thirsty, you may drink the moon’s yellow and the sun’s cinnabar.’*

**Chapter Twelve: The Kidney Section**

The kidney’s palace is a circular gate of profound mystery—

The kidney’s palace is a water-official’s domain.
The "circular gate of profound mystery" describes the form of the two kidneys.
*Xuan* is the color of water, an inner image used in analogy.
Within resides the Youth of Darkest Mystery ascending to the Upper Mystery.
The kidneys govern the Lower Mystery, their spirit named *Xuanming*, styled *Yuying*.
The heart governs the Upper Mystery’s distant obscurity, its qi linked to the kidneys—thus called "ascending to the Upper Mystery."
It presides over the six bowels and the source of the nine fluids.
The nine fluids intertwine, the hundred vessels flow unimpeded; none may be forsaken.
The five viscera and six bowels are the fluids of the nine orifices.
Externally, it corresponds to the two ears and the hundred fluids’ essences.
The kidney’s palace governs the ears; when qi wanes, deafness ensues. When yin and yang harmonize, the hundred vessels’ fluids flow freely.

Azure brocade cloud-robes with dancing, coiling dragons—
Azure brocade mirrors the kidney’s color.
Cloud-robes symbolize the kidney’s membranes.
Coiling dragons represent the kidney’s vessels.
The *Scripture of the Nine Perfected* states: *"The Dao Lord ever wears robes of azure brocade and skirts of verdant splendor."*
Above, it summons luminous rosy clouds, sun, and moon’s mist—
When kidney qi flourishes, ears and eyes remain keen and unaging, an external analogy.
For a hundred ailments and a thousand calamities, hasten to visualize this.
Master Yuanyang says: *"Cold and heat give rise to one another, male and female complete each other. Within the kidneys dwell two spirits, clad in radiant, resplendent robes—left male bearing the sun, right female bearing the moon. Visualize and behold them, and you shall never know exhaustion."*

The two water-lords face the Gate of Life—
The kidneys store a pair, hence "two departments."
When the kidney’s palace rules as water-lord, it transforms into the Red Child, thus called the "Gate of Life facing birth."
It enables one to attain long life and ascend the Nine Heavens.
The Red Child transforms into a Perfected One, ascending the Nine Heavens—the Nine Heavens being the Azure Heavens of the nine qi, whose qi governs life.

**Chapter Thirteen: The Spleen Section**
The spleen’s palace belongs to *wu* and *ji*—
A domain of earth-officials. *Wu* and *ji* govern the central hour.

Within it dwells a luminous youth clad in yellow robes.
The luminous youth refers to the settled *hun*; yellow robes, the color of earth.
It disperses the qi of pure grains to secure the teeth—
For the spleen serves as the pivot of the five viscera.
When the spleen grinds and digests food, vital qi arrives;
The teeth form a lattice of a thousand gates, thus it secures them.
This is the Great Granary with its two luminous youths.
The Great Granary is the spleen’s mansion.
This luminous youth is the spleen’s spirit, named Hun Kang.
Seated within the ninefold Golden Terrace,
Focus your mind and visualize the spirit’s form as ever thus.
A square inch within the Gate of Life—
The very center of the Yellow Court, the dwelling of the Cinnabar Field.
It governs the harmonizing of the hundred grains and the fragrance of the five flavors,
The savors within the mouth, the spleen’s governance of digestion.
It wards off emaciation and illness.
This refers to inner matters.
Externally, it corresponds to the radiance of the face,
The face being the "foot-ruler’s abode."
Hunger and satiety, emaciation and fullness—all manifest in the complexion.
The light and splendor thus generated make it evident,
Revealing the state of deficiency or repletion.
Clad in yellow brocade and jade robes, girded with a tiger-tally—
The spleen governs the central yellow, hence the Yellow Court Perfected One wears brocade.
The *Hidden Writ of Jade Petitions* states: "The Supreme Dao Lord bears the Divine Tiger Jade Tally."
Focus your mind on the Three Elders to soar lightly.
The Three Elders refer to the Ageless, the Mysterious Aged, and the Lord.
Meditate on the Perfected One within the spleen, and transformation occurs naturally.
"Child" refers to one who receives the teachings of the Yellow Court.
Attain long life, ascend as a lofty immortal, and distance yourself from the calamity of death.
*Zhuangzi* says: "Just as life arises, so death arises; just as death arises, so life arises. Just as the permissible arises, so the impermissible arises; just as the impermissible arises, so the permissible arises." In this discourse, the principles are equal. Thus, those who attain long life do not die; those who attain quiescence do not live. Neither dying nor living—this is true long life; neither living nor dying—this is true quiescence. How then could the calamity of death reach you?

**Chapter Fourteen: The Gallbladder Section**
The gallbladder’s palace is the essence of the six bowels—
The six bowels were explained above.
The *Scripture of Great Peace* states: "Accumulated purity becomes essence," hence the gallbladder is the essence of the six bowels.
Within it dwells a youth whose radiance displays majestic brightness.
The scripture states: "The gallbladder spirit is Dragon Radiance, styled Majestic Brightness," signifying courage and vigor.
Thunder and lightning from the eight directions brandish a jade banner—
The eight directions’ thunder and lightning signify the gallbladder’s aspect of awe and wrath.
The jade banner is the appearance of its qi.
Dragon banners traverse the heavens, hurling fire-bells—
The gallbladder’s color is green; dragon banners are instruments of martial might.
Fire-bells resemble the inner pearl beside the gallbladder; when anger arises, they are flung forth.
It governs all strength and commands tiger-soldiers—
The gallbladder’s power lies in its capacity for fierce resistance, thus it commands tiger-soldiers.
Externally, it corresponds to the space between the brows and pupils,
This refers to inner matters.
The heart’s joy and anger manifest at the brows’ ends.
Brain and hair support each other, both ever resplendent—
When one is enraged, the hair bristles to the crown.
Clad in nine-colored brocade and a green-flowered skirt—
Green brocade is the color of the nine qi of the eastern direction.
The green-flowered skirt resembles the gallbladder’s membrane.
Adorned with a golden belt bearing dragon-tiger patterns—
The attire of the gallbladder spirit Majestic Brightness.
By preserving Majestic Brightness, you ride auspicious clouds—
An inner metaphor.
Diligently meditating on the gallbladder spirit leads to the Dao of immortality.
It commands the myriad spirits to pay homage to the Three Origins.
The Three Origins Dao Lords reside in the Three Clarities; all heavenly spirits and immortals pay them homage.

**Chapter Fifteen: The Spleen’s Vastness**
The spleen spans a foot, covering the Great Granary—
The Great Granary is the stomach.
The *Central Yellow Scripture* states: "The stomach is the Great Granary."
Master Yuan Yang says: "The spleen lies horizontally atop the stomach."
The Central Elder Lord governs the Hall of Light—
The spleen is the palace of the Yellow Court.
Yellow is the color the Elder Lord governs; above, it corresponds to the Hall of Light.
The Hall of Light is located an inch within the space between the brows.
Its name is Ling Yuan, styled Hun Kang—
The spleen grinds and digests food, harmonizing inner and outer.
The large intestine is the stomach’s child; Hun Yuan Yang receives and contains it, bringing peace and health.
It governs the cure of the hundred diseases and the digestion of grains.
When the stomach’s palace flourishes, there is no illness or harm.
Clad in yellow robes with a purple sash and dragon-tiger tally—
The spleen resides above the stomach, hence "yellow robes."
The purple sash and dragon tally resemble the stomach’s network of vessels.
It lengthens essence and extends life, relying on the Lord and King—
The Great Granary’s Hun Kang serves as lord and king.
Call its name thrice, and the spirit communicates of itself—
Meditate on the spirits of the spleen and stomach, and the heart’s numinous clarity becomes penetrating.
The Three Elders sit together, each with their companions—
The Upper Elder Lord resides in the Upper Yellow Court Palace, forming a fellowship with the Mud-Pellet Lord, Granary Flower Lord, Azure City Lord, and the lords and ministers of the Hall of Light, the parents of the Cavern Chamber, and the Perfected Ones of the Heavenly Court.
The Middle Elder Lord resides in the Middle Yellow Court Palace, forming a fellowship with the Crimson City Youth, Cinnabar Field Lord, Luminous Flower Lord, Containing Brightness Dark Mystery Lord, and Cinnabar Origin Perfected One.
The Lower Elder Lord resides in the Lower Yellow Court Palace, forming a fellowship with the Great One Lord, Settled *Hun* Lord, Numinous Origin Lord, Great Granary Lord, and Cinnabar Field Perfected One.
Constantly preserve the Three Elders to harmonize the hundred spirits,
Circulating through the bodily regions and nourishing defense, without error.
Some refine essence, some nurture the embryo, each holding to their method—
According to the *Jade Calendar Scripture*: "The Lower Cinnabar Field is the root of original life, the repository of spirit and essence, the origin of the five qi. Located three inches below the navel and attached to the spine, it is called the Mansion of the Red Child. In men, it stores essence; in women, it stores the embryo. It governs harmony and union. The Red Child is the gate of yin and yang. Within its Cinnabar Field qi, left is green, right is yellow, above is white, below is black."
The peach pit harmonizes and extends life’s flowering splendor—
The name of the Great One Lord.
Abiding within, it causes the spirit and qi to flourish.
For men and women, the Ninefold Return has Peach Kang—
The spirit below the Cinnabar Field is named Peach Kang, governing essence and embryo, able to circulate through the Three Fields and complete the qi of the nine spirits.
The Dao Father and Dao Mother face each other in mutual regard—
Yin and yang, two halves forming one, thus they face each other.

The Master and Mistress dwell in the Cinnabar Mystery Village.
Dao and the Patriarch are the lords of yin and yang.
The Cinnabar Mystery Village is the method for preserving the Cinnabar Field.
One may employ visualization to ascend the empty void,
the Dao of immortal cultivation.
Divergent paths converge in one essential end.
Uniting the three as one, dispersing the one into three—this is the essence of the Dao.
The *Inner Writ of the Mysterious and Wondrous* states: "If you desire long life, the Three Ones must be made clear."

Seal the Three Passes, clench firmly, and pause—
The scriptures say: "The mouth is Heaven’s gate, activating the spirit’s mechanism; the hands are Humanity’s pass, grasping prosperity and decline; the feet are Earth’s barrier, the portal of life."
Moreover, three inches below the navel lies the Pass of Origin, also called the Three Passes, governing the consolidation of essence and protection of qi, preventing reckless dissipation.

Hold the golden elixir in the mouth, swallow the jade blossom—
Golden elixir and jade blossom are the fluids within the mouth.
The *Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: "In the method of ingesting the mysterious root, visualize within the stomach’s opening a maiden, infant-shaped, unclothed, standing upright in the gastric tube. She opens her mouth to receive the infusion of soul-fluid, inhaling the five qi. Rinse and fill the mouth with internal and external fluids, then swallow them, sending them into the mouth of the Mysterious Maiden. After five repetitions, click the teeth five times and swallow the fluid seven times."

Thus one attains freedom from hunger, and the Three Worms perish.
The *Formula of the Cavern Spirit* says: "The upper worm is white and green, the middle worm white and yellow, the lower worm white and black. When a person dies, the Three Worms emerge as corpse-demons, each transforming into a creature that clings to the form, striking and shattering it."
All other worms perish with the person.
Therefore, those who cultivate immortality must first purify themselves, preparing the five pure qi, and only then ingest medicinal substances to expel the Three Worms.
It is also said: "The upper corpse is named Peng Shan, causing one to crave rich flavors and indulge in desires and delusions; the middle corpse is named Peng Zhi, causing one to covet treasures and delight in joy and anger; the lower corpse is Peng Jiao, causing one to love fine clothing and pursue lewdness and lust—these are the Three Worms."

When the heart and mind are constantly harmonious, joy and prosperity arise—
The Dao flows unimpeded.

The clouds and qi of the Five Peaks swell and flourish—
The qi of the five viscera become the clouds of the Five Peaks.
"Swelling and flourishing" denotes free and unobstructed flow.
Preserve and irrigate the Jade Chamber to replenish oneself—
The Jade Chamber is the abode of the nose.
Once the Three Worms are expelled, the true qi harmonizes and unites,
Issuing forth from the Mysterious Female, ceaseless and unbroken—
Thus it is called "self-replenishment."
The five forms remain whole and firm, free from calamity—
The five bodies and the forms of the five viscera.
Through the cultivation of the Dao, the empty chamber generates radiance,
The five viscera become firm and complete,
Naturally free from illness and misfortune,
With spirit and qi responding of their own accord.

*The Ten Books on Cultivating Perfection: Commentary on the Inner Radiance of the Jade Scripture, Scroll Fifty-Six*

**Chapter Sixteen: Gazing Above**

Above, the Three Origins gleam like linked pearls—
The Three Origins refer to the primordial essences of the Three Luminaries: sun, moon, and stars,
Not the Three Origins of the upper, middle, and lower epochs.
Brilliant and resplendent, their radiance illumines the nine corners—
The Three Luminaries shine from above, casting light upon the nine directions.
This speaks of constantly preserving the sun and moon, penetrating and illuminating the entire body.
The Five Spirits nightly kindle and illuminate the eight regions—
The Five Spirits refer to the five planets.
When their brilliance arrays itself throughout the body and one can constantly preserve them,
One attains the same longevity as heaven and earth.
Preserve the Inner Sovereign and wander with me—
The Great Dao is without intent, responding only when moved.
Clad in phoenix robes and bearing tiger tallies—
The vestments and regalia of the immortals.
Once attained, one swiftly ascends to the realm of Emptiness and Non-Being—
"One" denotes the absence of duality.
By transmitting the One in the study of the Dao and uniting with the numinous in body,
The attainment of divine transcendence becomes possible.
As the *Nanhua True Scripture* states: "One who can preserve the One brings all matters to completion."

Within the square inch, thoughts are deeply concealed—
The square inch refers to the Lower Pass,
A gate located three inches below the navel, one inch in circumference, for storing essence.
Neither square nor round, the windows and doors are sealed—
Square denotes stillness, round denotes movement;
Neither moving nor still, one must only block and seal, avoiding reckless dissipation.
The Three Spirits return essence, and the aged regain their vigor—
By returning essence to the Three Fields, longevity and extended years are achieved.
The hun and po guard within, free from contention—
The hun is yang, the po is yin, each attaining its unity.
As the *Book of Changes* states: "The Dao of one yin and one yang."
Spirit is born within the abdomen, bearing the Jade Stopper—
By guarding within without dissipation, spirit is born bearing the stopper,
The abdomen becomes inwardly luminous, the mouth emits pearls and jade.
According to the *Five Spirits’ Conduct Method*: "Three inches directly above the space between the eyebrows lies the Jade Stopper and Purple Pass."
The numinous infuses the Dark Gate—how could it be lost?
When spirit is born within the abdomen, the numinous qi flows unimpeded—thus it cannot perish.
Secure essence at the Gate of the Kidneys—
The kidneys govern water, their color is black, and their qi connects to the ears.
The "twin standing gates" symbolize their towering extremity.
Jade branches, ten thousand fathoms long, can serve as a canopy—
The body follows the multitude of spirits, resplendently interlaced,
Like a ten-thousand-fathom jade tree offering shade—
An external metaphor.
"Jade branches" refer to the branches of the jade tree;
"Ten thousand fathoms" denotes vast height, symbolizing the body’s form sheltered by the radiance of the perfected and the numinous.
The Three Hun rest in tranquility, and the Emperor’s decree is issued—
When the body’s spirits are at peace, the Emperor’s decree descends.
Once the true Dao is accomplished, one’s name is inscribed in the Emperor’s register,
Thus achieving enduring vision.

**Chapter Seventeen: The Numinous Terrace**

The Numinous Terrace is shrouded in mist, gazing toward the Yellow Wilds—
The heart is called the Numinous Terrace; the spleen, the Yellow Wilds.
One must focus and preserve the vision of the Yellow Court.
Three inches, distinct chambers, above and below—
The Three Elixir Fields—upper, middle, and lower—each distinct,
Every chamber one inch in circumference.
Even today, people refer to the heart as the "square inch," which is its meaning here.
Inquire of the Passes, the Guardians, and the Mysterious Receptacle—
Between the Three Fields lie the Passes and Guardians, each with its own division,
From the highest to the lowest, the heart must receive and preserve these with mindfulness.
The Grotto Chamber, the Purple Ultimate, the Numinous Gate—
The *Great Grotto Scripture* states:
Three fen between the eyebrows lies the Twin Elixir Fields;
Three fen into the bone lies the Astral Pass.
Precisely seven fen deep,
To the left is the Heart Chamber, to the right is the Purple Door.
One cun deeper lies the Hall of Brightness,
To the left dwells the Bright Lad True Lord, to the right the Bright Maiden True Lord.
Two cun deeper lies the Grotto Chamber,
To the left dwells the Peerless Lord, to the right the White Prime Lord,
At the center dwells the Yellow Elder Lord.
Three cun deeper lies the Elixir Field Chamber, also called the Muddy Pellet Palace,
Where the Upper Prime Red Child resides.
Four cun deeper lies the Flowing Pearl Palace,
Where the Flowing Pearl True Spirit dwells.
Five cun deeper lies the Jade Emperor’s Palace,
Where the Jade Clarity True Mother resides.
One cun above the Hall of Brightness lies the Heavenly Court Palace,
Where the Upper Clarity True Maiden dwells.
One cun above the Grotto Chamber lies the Ultimate Perfection Palace,
Where the Supreme Ultimate Empress dwells.
One cun above the Elixir Field lies the Mysterious Elixir Palace,
Where the Central August Grand Unity True Lord dwells.
One cun above the Flowing Pearl lies the Supreme August Palace,
Where the Supreme Lord dwells.
Thus, they are called the Numinous Gates.
These were once imparted to me by the Supreme—
"I" refers to Lord Fusang, the Great Emperor,
Who, having accomplished the Dao, received the transmission of the Yellow Court from the Dao Lord in former times.
This Dao is not distant—it resides in the Elixir Field—thus it is spoken of as "once."
The Divine Lord on the left utters divine speech—
According to the *Great Grotto Scripture*, to the left dwells the Peerless—here called the Divine Lord,
An interchangeable term.
"Utters divine speech" means that with focused intent, the spirit instructs one in the Dao.
To the right stands the White Prime—
Left and right serve as the supports for the cultivator of the Dao.
Between the Golden Coffer and the Jade Chamber—
All are palaces of the Upper Prime, explained as above.
The Upper Clarity Perfected stands before me—
The spirits of the Upper Prime all reside at the edge of the Heavenly Court.
The Yellow Garment Lad’s cinnabar qi frequently stirs—
Referring to the youth of the Middle Prime who dwells in the Crimson City.

"Frequently stirs" means the qi flourishes without exhaustion.
I ask: where lies the space between the brows?
It is the abode of the Hall of Light.
Within, the sun and moon and constellations array themselves—
The *Five Celestial Rites of the Sleeves* states: The Supreme Perfected summons the Five Celestial Palaces of the Grotto Chamber, transmitted by the South Pole Primordial Lord.
Each midnight, sit facing outward and visualize the Western White Star of Venus between the brows, directly entering one inch into the Jade Gate of the Golden Tower, with the sun to the left and the moon to the right.
Next, visualize the Northern Star of Mercury in the Mysterious Palace of the Emperor’s Realm—the Mysterious Palace lies five fen within the hairline, directly entering one inch.
Then, visualize the Eastern Star of Jupiter in the Vermilion Terrace of the Grotto Gate—the Vermilion Terrace lies one inch directly behind the eyes.
Next, visualize the Southern Star of Mars in the Flowery Chamber of the Jade Gate—five fen within the eye’s corner, directly entering five fen.
Finally, visualize the Central Star of Saturn in the Golden Chamber of the Long Valley—two fen directly within the philtrum.
Visualize them all as if suspended above, then knock the teeth three times, swallow saliva five times, and softly intone:
*"Lofty and purple the celestial towers,
Within dwell five spirits,
Treasure-bright, radiant beams,
Light surging through the gates.
Essence and qi swiftly arise,
Transforming into an elder,
Head wrapped in white,
Green mantle, crimson skirt,
Right side bearing flowing bells,
Left side wearing the tiger tally,
Hand grasping the Celestial Stem,
Scattering radiance, flying stars,
Feet treading the flowery canopy,
Exhaling rays to refine the body.
The Three Luminants guard and preserve,
Granting me attainment of the True,
Nurturing the hun, restraining the po,
Riding the whirlwind to ascend as an immortal."*
This practice is the inner visualization method.

Seven luminaries and nine origins crown the Gate of Life.
The seven luminaries are the seven stars, corresponding to the seven apertures of the human body.
The nine origins are the nine celestial bodies, corresponding to the nine apertures.
None may be neglected, hence they are said to crown the Gate of Life.

**Chapter Eighteen: The Three Passes**
Within the Three Passes, essence and qi run deep—
Referring to the Pass of Origin, where men store their essence.
Alternatively, as stated below, the mouth, hands, and feet are the Three Passes.
Or, as Master Yuanyang holds, the Hall of Light, Grotto Chamber, and Elixir Field are the Three Passes.
All may be taken according to the text’s meaning and preserved in practice.
Within the Nine Subtleties, it is dark and yin—
The *Great Grotto Scripture* states: The Three Primes conceal transformations to form the Three Palaces, named Great Clarity, Great Simplicity, and Great Harmony. Three times three makes nine, hence there are three Elixir Fields and three Grotto Chambers, combining with the Three Primes to form Nine Palaces. Each palace holds subtle essence, thus called the Nine Subtleties, meaning they are profound and unseen.
The mouth is the Heavenly Pass, the mechanism of spirit—
It expresses emotions like the pivot of a trigger.
The hands are the Human Pass, grasping prosperity or decline—
Whether to release or seize lies within oneself.
The feet are the Earthly Pass, the gateway of life—
They govern the movement of one’s body and thus one’s vitality.

**Chapter Nineteen: If Attained**
If one attains the Three Palaces and preserves the Mysterious Elixir—

I gaze upon the youth who sits in tranquil repose—
Visualizing the Cinnabar Perfected Youth of the Crimson City.
"Sits" denotes the spirit’s serenity.
I ask: whose child dwells within my body?
It is to say: he is one’s own.

Where has this person gone but into the Mud-Pill Palace?
In harmony with the Upper Prime’s host of spirits, above and below in accord.
The scripture states: the brain is the Mud-Pill Palace.
By thousands and hundreds they link themselves—
The spirit originally emerges from the One,
the One generates the Two,
the Two generates the Three,
the Three generates the myriad things,
all transformations never depart from body and heart.
Twenty upon twenty like layered mountains—
Visualizing the myriad things seated in layered repose.
Mountains resemble the form of sitting.

Cloud-ornaments and jade blossoms flank the ear-gate—
Cloud-ornaments and jade blossoms are names for the temples’ hair,
for the ears reside between them.
The *Great Cavern Scripture* says: the spirit of the hair is named Azure Blossom.
Whenever it speaks of “blossom,” it is like the blossom of grasses and trees.

The Crimson Thearch and Yellow Elder accompany my hun-soul—
The Crimson Thearch is the Lord of the Southern Quarter.
The Yellow Elder Lord is the Lord of the Central Quarter.
The hun is the yang spirit, the po the yin spirit;
yin and yang respond to each other, thus it speaks of accompanying the hun.
The *Luminous Writ of the Grand Tenuity* states:
humans possess three hun-souls—
the first is Fetal Radiance,
the second is Luminous Effulgence,
the third is Dark Essence.
Constantly invoking their names ensures the three hun-souls never leave the body.

Three Perfected Ones support the axle, sharing the ford and qi—
The hun, the Crimson Thearch, and the Yellow Elder are the Three Perfected Ones,
said to respond in mutual support, sharing the ford and qi.
The Five Ladles gleam bright as the Seven Primes—
The Five Ladles are the Five Stars of the Northern Dipper.
The *Ordinance of the Cavern Chamber* says:
to visualize the Seven Prime Celestials,
whether upon rising, at the first outing, or after meals,
recite the incantation:
“The Five Stars open the way,
the Six Harmonies are the Purple Chamber.
Return to the Hidden Dao,
the Seven Celestials shine resplendent.
The begetter of the hun-soul is the Dark Father,
transforming the One to become spirit.
The begetter of the po-soul is the Dark Mother,
transforming the Two to become the body.
The Master of my sinews and bones is the Noble Son,
the White Prime governs my essence and qi.
Long life and enduring vision,
ascend as an immortal to the Ten Heavens.”

The sun and moon fly coursing through the Six Harmonies—
Within Heaven and Earth is the Six Harmonies;
visualize the sun, moon, stars, and constellations within the body,
the myriad images all as clear as within a single day.
The Emperor’s homeland at the center of Heaven, the Earth’s gate at its end—
Five fen above the brows, one cun straight in is the Emperor’s homeland.
Moreover, one cun above the Hall of Light is the Heavenly Court,
that is, the center of Heaven.

they always reside at its end—
that is, above the nose and below the hairline.

The facial hun-spirits and gods all abide in mutual presence—
The inner and outer heart-spirits and eyes respond to each other.

**Breathing Chapter the Twentieth**

Inhaling and exhaling primordial qi to seek immortality—
Probing the flying root and mysterious radiance,
swallowing the Five Sprouts and embracing the Nine Clouds,
the method of fetal breathing,
referring to the qi of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, the four seasons, and the Five Phases.
The Immortal Duke and Noble Son seem to stand before one—
This is the *Ordinance of the Cavern Chamber*.
The left of the Cavern Chamber is the Peerless Flower, also named the Noble Son.
The Immortal Duke directly indicates the Yellow Court.
If the Yellow Court’s Immortal Duke can practice the Cavern Chamber’s ordinance
and visualize its Noble Son, thus they are said to stand before one.

The Vermilion Crow retracts and extends from the White Stone Source—
The Vermilion Crow is the image of the tongue.
The White Stone is the image of the teeth.
Retracting and extending guide the fluid essence,
regulating the qi of yin and yang,
flowing without cease—thus it is called the Source.

Congealing essence and nurturing the embryo to transform and generate the body—
The origin from which one’s self has come.
Preserving the embryo and halting essence can grant long life—
The *True Sayings* state:
the oral instructions of the Upper Clarity Perfected Ones—
those who study the Dao should pacify the heart and nurture the spirit,
ingesting and refining to cure illness,
ensuring the Mud-Pill Palace is filled and the mysterious essence does not spill,
only then can one preserve form and spirit,
ingesting cloud-souls and exhaling-inhaling the Two Luminaries.
If one frequently engages in intercourse and leaks essence,
the practitioner’s qi becomes foul, the spirit perishes,
essence and numen wither and deplete.
Even if one wears the Dark Stem and bears the Jade Register,
the Golden Writ of the Great Ultimate,
how can one resolve this to attain life?
In former times, my late teacher often cautioned against this matter, saying:
for those who study,
one act of intercourse spills the efficacy of one year’s medicinal practice,
two acts spill two years’ efficacy.
Beyond this, the unspilled medicine entirely vanishes from the body.
Thus, the true immortals are ever vigilant in this regard,
for it is the great taboo of life’s generation.

The Three Qi revolve to the right, the Nine Paths grow bright—
The Three Qi are the qi of the Three Cinnabar Fields.
“Revolve to the right” means circulating in orderly sequence,
harmonizing yin and yang so the Four Passes and Nine Orifices flow freely,
luminous and free of illness.
Uprightness and unity with the blossom bring fullness—
Embracing uprightness and guarding the One,
the spirit and qi flourish in blossom,
thus one can fill the Six Harmonies,
riding things and transforming them.
Gazing afar, the heart is like a net’s star—
Visualizing the Cinnabar Perfected Youth dwelling within the Crimson City,
like a star shining in the net’s valley.
Beneath the Golden Chamber it cannot topple—
The heart resides below the lungs,
governing metal, its color white—
thus the Golden Chamber should always be visualized,
granting long life without death.
Extending my white-haired years to return to infancy—
An internal matter.
It refers to an ageless childlike countenance.

**Jade Chamber Chapter the Twenty-First**

Within the Jade Chamber, enter the plain assembly—
Referring to the Upper Prime’s pure and true.
The Jade Chamber is the image of the body’s bones.
The Mud-Pill Lady stands at its center—
The scripture states: within the Cavern Chamber are father and mother;
the mother is the Lady, also named the Dao-Mother.
The Mud-Pill and Cavern Chamber have already been explained above.

The Long Valley and Dark Homeland encircle the outer suburbs—
The Long Valley is the nose.
The Dark Homeland is the kidneys.
The outer suburbs are the Five Viscera and Six Bowels.
It speaks of the nose’s qi issuing and entering below,
driving the kidneys’ movement,
circulating through the viscera and bowels,
dwelling in the Crimson City.
Visualizing the inner city walls and outer suburbs—
thus it serves as a metaphor.

The Six Dragons scatter and fly, difficult to distinguish—
It speaks of the qi of the Six Bowels,
subtle and mysteriously communicative,
difficult to distinguish—
yet one visualizes and preserves them.

Long life demands utmost caution in the chamber’s urgency—
Qi lost and fluids leaked,
marrow withered and essence exhausted.
Though one gains a trickle,
it leaks through the tail’s gate—
one cannot but be cautious.
Why act in death’s service, making the spirits weep?
Imprudence in the chamber harms essence and loses clarity,
thus the spirits weep.

Swift neglect invites calamity in the realm of ruin—
the realm of ruin is the land of death.
The Three Spirits—three hun souls—
are called Fetal Radiance, Luminous Clarity, and Mystic Essence,
now lost and submerged.
One must only inhale qi and gather the essence of the child.
Through breath regulation and restraint,
close the chamber and halt the leakage of essence.

The inch-field and foot-dwelling may govern life—
this speaks of the three cinnabar fields’ dwellings,
each a square inch in measure, hence called inch-fields.
One relies on the method of preserving the cinnabar fields to cultivate life.
The scripture states: “Inch-field, foot-dwelling”—
that foot-dwelling refers to the face.
If one indulges in the central sea with a hundred draughts—
this speaks of chamber excess and indiscriminate leakage,
heedless of restraint.
Leaves fall, the tree withers, losing its verdant hue—
a metaphor for the lifeless, breathless state.
Qi lost and fluids leaked are no longer one’s own form.
The immortal scriptures say: “Close the chamber to refine fluids,
refrain from spitting, and limit speech.”

Focused closure and mastery of the radiant scene bring enduring peace—
concentrate on restraining desire,
visualizing the light of sun and moon.
Laozi says: “One skilled in closure needs no bolt nor bar,
yet none can open it.”
The *Upper Clarity Plain Text Spirit Writ* contains the method of “probing the root of qi”:
At sunrise, face east and click the teeth nine times,
then silently recite the incantation:
*“Sun’s soul, pearl radiance,
illuminating the green canopy,
crimson youth of returning mist,
mysterious flame and whirling image.”*
After reciting these sixteen characters,
close the eyes, clench the fists,
and visualize five-colored streaming mists enveloping the body—
thus the sunlight and flowing mists enter the mouth together,
called “Flying Blossom Jade Womb,” the water’s mother.
Each day, swallow the mist forty-five times,
and nine times swallow the saliva.

Preserve my Mud-Pill Palace’s Three Wondrous Spirits—
the Mud-Pill Palace is the upper cinnabar field.
The *Great Cavern Scripture* states:
“When the Three Lights conceal their transformations,
they become the Three Offices:
first, the Three Lords within the Grand Clarity;
second, the spirits of the three cinnabar fields;
third, the spirits of the talismanic registers—
hence called the Three Wondrous Spirits.”

Serene and detached, inward vision brings clarity—
this speaks of the method of visualizing the cinnabar fields,
as described above.
What thing would disturb one’s tranquility and peace?
Walking the Dao with true integrity,
no demonic force can intrude.
Prosperous indeed, yet no longer serving age only to return to youth—
fierce beasts do not crouch,
hunting birds do not strike,
the old regain vigor,
the young grow strong—
abundant and flourishing.
Meditating on the jade scriptures, one enters the Upper Clarity.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: Constant Reflection**
Ever mindful, the three chambers interconnect...

The three chambers refer to the Hall of Light, the Grotto Chamber, and the Cinnabar Field. They interconnect with the Flowing Pearl, the Five Thearchs, the Celestial Court, the Ultimate Truth, the Mysterious Cinnabar, the Mud-Pill Palace, the Grand August, and all other palaces—left and right, above and below—forming a seamless whole. With penetrating vision, one sees without distinction of inner or outer. By visualizing three threes as nine, uniting nine into one, clarity pervades the heavens, dissolving all boundaries of within and without.

To ingest the Five Sprouts and banish hunger and thirst—
The *Lingbao Scriptures* prescribe the method of consuming the Five Sprouts. The Five Sprouts are the generative *qi* of the Five Phases, corresponding to the primordial essence of the five viscera. As the scripture states: On the day of the Beginning of Spring, at cock’s crow, enter the chamber, face east, and bow nine times. Sit upright, click the teeth nine times, and visualize the Nine Worthies of the Eastern Quarter—Anbao, Hualin, Qingling, and the Nine Thousand Lords of the Primordial Elder—descending into the chamber in a dense cloud. Their forms enter through the mouth and descend directly into the liver palace. Recite the incantation:

*"Ninefold *qi* of the Azure Heavens,
Primordial essence of the Supreme Origin,
Venerable Lords of the August Elder,
Clad in feathered azure,
Presiding over the Celestial Offices,
Radiant as Jupiter’s splendor,
Scattering brilliance and flowing fragrance,
They bathe my form.
I ingest the morning auroras,
I drink the essence of wood,
Nurturing the Azure Sprout,
Guarding it with care.
The liver palace overflows,
The royal mushroom flourishes,
Prolonging years and refining complexion,
Restoring the countenance of infancy.
The Five *qi* merge as one,
Heaven and Earth endure in union."*

Afterward, draw in the azure *qi* nine times and swallow, then ingest the twelve vermilion-script jade characters of the Eastern Quarter.

The Divine Splendor holds the towel as the Six Dings pay homage.
The Divine Splendor, as the *Jade Calendar Scripture* states, is the Five Maidens of the Mysterious Radiance of the Grand Yin, mothers of the Dao. Clad in five-colored crimson robes, they reside above the spleen palace, beneath the canopy of yellow clouds. The Six Dings are the six yin spirits of the jade maidens. The *Laozi’s Six Jia Talismanic Charts* state: Each Ding has its own spirit. The Ding-mao spirit is the Jade Maiden Sima Duyu, who governs the lunar months. The Ding-chou spirit is the Jade Maiden Zhao Ziwang, who harmonizes *qi*. The Ding-hai spirit is the Jade Maiden Zhang Wentong, who purifies all. The Ding-you spirit is the Jade Maiden Jiang Wengong, who brings joy. The Ding-wei spirit is the Jade Maiden Shi Shutong, who guards against harm. The Ding-si spirit is the Jade Maiden Cui Juqing, who hears the heart’s intent. To ingest the Flying Root is to practice the method of rinsing the Yellow Sprout; upon mastery, one commands the Six Ding spirits.

Guard the chamber of essence and do not recklessly discharge it.
The chamber of essence refers to the three cinnabar fields, interconnected and unbroken. Its regulation lies in the heart, which is the middle cinnabar field—the source of urgency and ease, the root of truth and delusion. Sealed and preserved, it ensures longevity. This is the result of accumulating essence.

Arising from within the form, never apart—
This speaks of the heart directing *qi*, subtle and formless.

The three palaces lie near, easily concealed and gathered.
The three cinnabar fields’ true lords reside within the body. Concealing and gathering essence, the heart must serve as their sovereign.

Void and still, the plainness within emptiness—
This refers to external affairs. "Plainness" has two interpretations: First, the body should be as light and serene as silk suspended in the void. Second, the body’s inner emptiness should be as weightless as a vessel. Plainness is the natural state of tranquility; "defilement" refers to external distractions.

The nine chambers stand upright and empty, abodes of the numinous.
The nine chambers are the nine palaces within the head and the nine orifices of the body. When the upper palaces flourish and the nine orifices are aligned, they become the dwelling places of all spirits. The *Cavern Spirit Scripture* states: Heaven has nine stars, hence the Nine Heavens. Earth has nine palaces, hence the Nine Lands. Humans have nine orifices, hence the Nine Lives—referring to the origins of human existence.

Visualize the hundred thoughts and observe the rhythm.
Visualize the hundred spirits within the body, their breath rising and falling in accordance with the prescribed method. It is also said: "Thousands upon thousands, hundreds upon hundreds, like layered mountains"—all are divine images.

Cultivate the six palaces and do not let them decay.
According to the *Cavern Spirit Scripture*, the six palaces are: the lungs as the Jade Hall Palace, the Office of the Chief Minister; the heart as the Crimson Palace, the Primordial Yang Office; the liver as the Clear and Cold Palace, the Orchid Terrace Office; the gallbladder as the Purple Tenuity Palace, the Boundless Office; the kidneys as the Pastoral Palace, the Supreme Harmony Office; and the spleen as the Central Yellow Palace, the Grand Simplicity Office. These differ from the ordinary six viscera.

Then, soaring freely, one enters the cloud paths.

The cultivation of ascending as an immortal and transforming the physical form.

**Chapter Twenty-Three: Nurturing Life**

The Dao of nurturing life is not burdensome,
Embracing non-action, purity, and simplicity,
Restraining oneself and upholding rectitude.
Simply cultivate the *Dongxuan* and the *Jade Canon*.
*Dongxuan* refers to the *Dongxuan Lingbao*;
The *Jade Canon’s* true script is the *Huangting*.

Additionally, activate the Eight Radiant Spirits within the body.
The *Jade Canon Scripture* states: The five viscera correspond to the eight trigrams, where celestial spirits guard and the Great One’s envoys—eight nodes forming nine palaces—reside. Beyond the eight trigrams lie the Twelve Towers, which are the throat’s passages. The navel is the Lord of the Great One, master of life. It is also called Taiyuan, Kunlun, and Taiji, governing the thirteen thousand luminous essences within the body. The Twenty-Four Perfected emerge naturally. Heaven possesses twenty-four true qi, and the human body mirrors this. Moreover, the three cinnabar fields each contain three times eight, totaling twenty-four Perfected Ones, all born of the Dao’s natural qi.

With lofty composure and non-action, the hun and po are at peace,
Moving without awareness, sitting in oblivion,
Detaching from form and relinquishing intellect.
In clarity and stillness, the spirit manifests and speaks to me.
Through purity and tranquility, the heart’s spirit reveals itself, its perception boundless. When it speaks to oneself, it is the Perfected One of the Yellow Court. Where does it reside? In the purple chamber’s veiled toad’s abode—
The purple chamber’s canopy, also called the Crimson Palace, is the dwelling of the Red City’s youth. Visualizing the heart’s spirit takes this form. Standing or sitting, beyond the chamber lie the three and five mysteries.
The Eight Radiant Spirits and the Twenty-Four Perfected Ones guard and nourish the body, harmonizing the three fields and five viscera’s true qi, warding off all afflictions. Burning incense and clasping hands before the Jade Flower—
The Jade Flower is before the canopy, referring to the space between the brows, the Heavenly Court. It is the ancestral origin of spirits and the cavernous abode of the Perfected. One must visualize it according to the text. Together, we enter the Great Chamber and wander the Gate of the Celestial Pivot.
According to the *Cavern Chamber Scripture*: Heaven possesses the Great Chamber, Jade Chamber, and Cloud Court. The Cloud Court is where the Central Yellow Elder Lord resides. The Jade Chamber is also called the Purple Chamber or Crimson Palace, collectively known as the Yellow Hall. The Flower Canopy spans the eastern and western chambers, connecting to the left and right Yellow Courts within. The human body mirrors this, as described above. The Celestial Pivot is the central axis. Delving deeply into tranquility, the Dao’s perfection—
Refining essence in serenity, true qi roams freely.
Inward vision and subtle gaze reveal all truths.
In stillness and contemplation, the hundred spirits stand in array. The Perfected One resides within—do not seek neighbors.
The *Jade Terrace Scripture* states: Laozi is the celestial hun, the Lord of Nature, ever attending the Dao Lord at his side. The human body contains this as well. Where else would one seek the cause of the Dao?
The scripture says: The Great Dao flows everywhere, left and right. It is not distant.

**Chapter Twenty-Four: Concealing Radiance**

Concealing radiance and hiding form, set apart from the world,
The adept of immortality conceals brilliance and veils splendor, erasing traces and obscuring origins. Nurturing qi and fostering essence, the mouth like cinnabar—
Skin as ice and snow, graceful as a maiden.
Grasping life’s nature and guarding emptiness,
In quiescence, stillness, and non-action.
One’s name enters the Upper Clarity’s register of the dead, expunged.
Attaining the rank of Perfected One, one’s name is inscribed in the mysterious ledger. The joy of the Three Spirits arises from reclusion—
Governing the body through non-action brings spiritual delight; governing the state without affairs brings peace to the people. The Three Spirits are the spirits of the three cinnabar fields. Swiftly soaring and roaming without lingering cares—
Swift and sudden, as in the phrase: "Driving swiftly to welcome life at Eastern Meng." Alternatively: "Swiftly riding the dragon, free from lingering cares," signifying liberation. Donning feathered robes, the Eight Winds propel one forward—
The Eight Winds are the winds of the eight directions.

Swiftly clearing the path ahead—
Feathered robes are the garb of immortals. According to the *Precious Writ of the Upper Clarity*, immortals wear five-colored feathered robes; the Perfected One of the Great Unity dons nine-hued cloud-soaring feathered vestments—all divine raiment of the transcendent, hence the name.

Guiding the reins of the Three Simplicities, riding the morning mist—
Outwardly pointing to matters. The Three Clouds and Nine Mists are the domains of the immortals.

Does the golden chariot ascend in proper rank, following the jade procession?
The *Scripture of the Primordial Register* states: The Eight Sages of the Mysterious Spirits of the Nine Heavens of the Upper Clarity harness nine phoenix-drawn dragon carriages. The Jade Procession of the Nine Heavens and the golden brush are all implements and attire of the immortals.

Why not ascend the mountain and recite my scripture?
The scripture refers to the *Huangting* text.

Lush and profound, the abode of the Perfected Ones—
The mountains’ depths are secluded.
Why hesitate to enter? Yet one lingers,
For the heart’s resolve is not aligned.
The world below teems with clamor, foul as a rotting stench—
Swiftly despise the polluted world of men, unworthy of longing.
*Foul* denotes the utmost stench.

**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Five Phases**
The Five Phases revolve and return to the One...

The Five Phases are Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Their mutual generation proceeds thus: Metal engenders Water, Water engenders Wood, Wood engenders Fire, Fire engenders Earth, Earth engenders Metal, cycling endlessly. Their mutual restraint follows this pattern: Fire restrains Metal, Metal restrains Wood, Wood restrains Earth, Earth restrains Water, Water restrains Fire, likewise cycling without cease. This mutual generation is the Dao.

Returning to the One—One is the number of Water, the root of the Five Phases’ Dao and the origin of the myriad things. As Laozi says: “The Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two gives birth to the Three, and the Three give birth to the myriad things.” The *Book of Changes* likewise states: “The Supreme Polarity gives rise to the Two Modes.” The Supreme Polarity is the One; the Two Modes are Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth give birth to the myriad things, and the myriad things in turn return to the One. The One is the designation of Non-Being, from which all things are accomplished—hence it is called “returning to the One.”

The Three and Five unite their qi in the nine-by-nine nodes. The *Scripture of Wondrous Perfection* states: “The Three are: in Heaven, the sun, moon, and stars; on Earth, pearls, jade, and gold—these are called the Three Treasures. In the human body, they are the ears, mouth, and nose—termed the Three Vitalities.” Heaven, Earth, and Humanity are the Three Powers, each containing them. The Five are the essence of the Sovereign; thus it is said “Three-Five unite.” Three times three makes nine.

The Three and Five that are contained regulate all categories, harmonize the myriad things, govern the transformation of yin and yang, cover and support Heaven and Earth, illuminate the Four Seas, and generate wind, rain, thunder, and lightning, the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, the alternations of cold, heat, warmth, and coolness, and the qi of purity and turbidity. None of the living things can arise without the union of Three and Five. Thus it is said: “The Dao of Heaven is not distant; the Three and Five return again.”

The Three and Five are the repository of Heaven and Earth, the essential convergence of the Six Directions, and the qi-nodes of the Nine Palaces. Nine times nine makes eighty-one, which forms a single chapter. One may employ the Eight Concealments to revolve through the Eight Guards. Within the Nine Palaces lie the arts of concealment and transformation—this is the *Hidden Writ of the Eight Qi Rushing to the Celestial Court*, called the Eight Evolutions. There are also the Eight Evolutions of the Supreme Polarity. Within the Supreme Polarity are the Three Lords: the first is the Supreme August Lord, the second is the Heavenly August Lord, and the third is the Yellow Elder Lord. The qi of the Three Origins and the essence of primordial chaos enter and exit the Palace of Grand Clarity in the Supreme Void, concealed and formless—thus is the Dao of long life attained.

The Crouching Ox guards the Dark Gate in ranked array. The Crouching Ox is an image of the kidneys; the kidneys are the Dark Gate. The *Central Yellow Scripture* states: “The left kidney is the Mysterious Wondrous Perfected One; the right kidney is the Mysterious Origin Lord.” When their ranks and positions are visualized, they become visible.

The Three Luminaries emerge at the boundary of life and death. Heaven’s Three Luminaries are the sun, moon, and stars; Earth’s Three Luminaries are the patterns of literature and brilliance; Humanity’s Three Luminaries are the ears, nose, and mouth—these mark the boundary of life and death.

The Cavern Chamber’s numinous image rivals the sun and moon. Visualize the Three Origins within the Cavern Chamber. The Cavern Chamber and Bright Hall have been explained above.

The father is the Muddy Pellet; the mother, the Feminine One. Within the Bright Hall are ruler and ministers; within the Cavern Chamber, husband and wife; within the Cinnabar Field, father and mother. The Muddy Pellet is the name of the brain spirit. The *Laozi* states: “Know the masculine, but keep to the feminine.” The Feminine is Non-Action—this is the One.

The Three Lights radiantly illumine the Chamber of the Child. Clarity extends in all four directions.

If one can preserve the Mysterious Perfected, all affairs are complete. As Zhuangzi says: “If one can guard the One, all affairs are complete.”

The spirit and essence of the body must not be lost. Constantly maintain this awareness, not neglecting it even for a moment.

*Annotations to the Jade Scripture of the Yellow Court’s Inner Radiance from the Fifty-Sixth Scroll of the Ten Books on Cultivating Perfection* concludes.

*Annotations to the Jade Scripture of the Yellow Court’s Inner Radiance from the Fifty-Seventh Scroll of the Ten Books on Cultivating Perfection*
*Commentary by Liangqiouzi*

**Chapter Twenty-Six: Soaring Aloft**

Soaring aloft with the sun and moon, I ascend the Dao—
I am the Lord of the Dao.

The *Purple Texts of Supreme Clarity’s* method of absorbing the qi of the sun and moon is also called *The Scripture of Cinnabar Gold Essence, Stone Radiance, and the Jade Womb of the Water Mother*. Its practice is as follows: at sunrise, face east and click the teeth nine times. Silently invoke the names of the Five Emperors within the sun’s soul, reciting:
*“Sun-soul, Vermilion Radiance,
Illumining the Green Sheath,
Crimson Lads of the Returning Clouds,
Mysterious Flames Displaying the Image.”*
After reciting these sixteen characters, close the eyes, clench the fists, and visualize the five-colored streaming clouds entering the mouth.

Furthermore, the *Divine Writ of Supreme Clarity* contains the method of absorbing the essence of the moon: at moonrise, face west and click the teeth ten times. Silently invoke the names of the Five Hun and Five Ladies within the moon, reciting:
*“Moon-spirit, Vast and Serene,
Fragrant and Lustrous, Veiled in Void,
Graceful and Empty, Numinous Orchid,
Lush Blossoms Forming Petals,
Pure Gold Essence Gleaming,
Vast Countenance, Terrace’s Mark.”*
After reciting these twenty-four characters, clench the fists, close the eyes, and visualize the five-colored essence-light of the moon entering the mouth. Moreover, the yellow qi within the moonlight is the essence of the Jade Womb’s moon-flower. Those who cultivate this Dao will soar into the sun and moon as immortals.

Yuyi and Jielin, the paired guardians—
Yuyi is the immortal who soars with the sun; Jielin, the immortal who soars with the moon. Like sounds resonate, like qi seeks its kind; thus do these two immortals come to safeguard one another.

Then one beholds the Ageless One of Jade Clarity’s Void,
Ascending above the Three Clarities to merge with the Dao.

This can reverse aging, replenish the brain and blood,
As the hun and po return to infancy, attaining the perfection of the True Person.

Mouth holding the magic mushroom, bearing the Five Stars,
Exhaling five-colored numinous qi, the radiant mushroom illumining the four directions, roaming the Six Directions with the Five Yellow Lords.

Waist girded with the Tiger Register, adorned with golden pendants—
Such is the raiment of the immortals. The *Scripture of the Nine Perfected* states: “The Yellow Lord of the Central Palace wears at his waist the talisman of the Dark Dragon and Divine Tiger, bears the chiming bells of flowing gold, and wields the purple banner’s staff.” The *Register* is the talisman.

Riding the carriage to welcome life, feasting in the Eastern Mists.

Swift as the wind’s sudden gust, one departs—
Thus "welcoming life" in the eastern mists.

The mountains of the Eastern Sea’s immortal realm,
The land where life is received, ever conjoined with vital qi,
Are where one roams in serene delight.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven of the Mysterious Origin**

The One refines the hun and po above,
The Treasure refines the spirit,
The spirit refines to merge with the One.
The One, as a thing, is scarcely glimpsed—
The One is nameless.
The heart, tranquil and detached, attains it,
Yet it remains unseen.
Only when utmost truth is reached does it deign to glance back.

Guard the true, fill the will,
And the One returns of itself.
Most abhorred are the dead qi and all foul impurities.
In flying elixirs, refining medicines, absorbing qi, or swallowing mist,
One must shun the sight of corpses, concealed filth—
These are the shared perils of the living realm.

Yet the Dao is empty and void,
Originally beyond purity or impurity.
When the household attains true correctness,
Purity and impurity diverge.
Divergent and unequal,
Right and wrong arise within,
Life and death manifest without.
Thus, the pure are the companions of life,
The turbid and foul, the companions of death—
Hence their avoidance in nurturing life.

The Six Spirits gather in the void’s feast.
The Six Jia, Six Ding, and spirits of the Six Palaces,
All dwelling within the body,
Find tranquil repose in emptiness.

Bind the pearls to secure essence and nourish the root of spirit.
"Binding the pearls" means swallowing saliva in sequence, like linked pearls.
"Securing essence" means not wasting it wantonly.
The "root of spirit" is the physical form.
The spirit’s relation to the body
Is as a lord to a state, a ruler to the people.
The people take the ruler as their life,
The ruler takes the people as their foundation.
Mutually sustaining, they nurture and harmonize life.

The jade bar and golden key remain ever whole.
Laozi said: "One who excels in closure needs no bolt, yet none can open it."
The *key* is the lock; *ba* may be read as *shi* (key).
Close the mouth, curl the tongue to drink the fetal fluid—
Curl the tongue to circulate the fluid, consume the fluid to become a fetal immortal,
Hence called "fetal fluid."
Thus I refine and attain flight as an immortal,
Through the devotion and sincerity of my practice.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Immortal**

The immortal and Daoist are not inherently divine—
They cultivate study to accumulate essence,
Refine qi to embody the true.
Essence accumulates, qi gathers to form the true.
Secure essence, guard qi, refine through accumulation to attain the true,
Cultivate study to achieve it.

The wondrous voice of the Yellow Youth is rarely heard—
The *Yellow Youth* refers to the Perfected of the Yellow Court,
Also called the *Crimson Walled Youth*.
The *wondrous voice* is the sublime teaching of the Yellow Court’s Dao.

The *Jade Writ* bears vermilion script on crimson bamboo slips—
The *August Court Classic*, also named *The Celestial Sovereign’s Golden Writ*,
Or *The Jade Chapters of the Gathered Flowers*.
Its characters proclaim: "The Perfected wears a golden kerchief"—
The *Perfected* is the Yellow Youth.
Gold is white, dwelling in the West, governing the lungs;
Its white hue resides in the heart, hence called a *kerchief*.
The *Nine Perfections Classic* states:
"The Azure Emperor of the East wears a robe of azure jade,
Adorned with a skirt of verdant splendor,
Bearing the vermilion talisman of the sacred fungus,
And a golden kerchief as his crown."

Master Primal Yang said:
"The Perfected sits facing south, legs crossed,
Feet aligned with the east and west."

The west (酉) is metal. Bearing armor and holding talismans, it opens the seven gates. The *Laozi’s Six Jia and Three Divisions Talismans* states: "The spirit of Jiazi is named Wang Wenqing; the spirit of Jiaxu is named Zhan Zijiang; the spirit of Jiashen is named Hu Wenchang; the spirit of Jiawu is named Wei Shangqing; the spirit of Jiachen is named Meng Feiqing; the spirit of Jiayin is named Ming Wenzhang." To visualize the names of these six spirits is to open and unblock the seven orifices, thus preventing illness and disease.

The *Fire-Soldier Talisman Charts* prepare the numinous passes. The *Red Youth’s Beheading Demons Record* enables the command of the Three-and-Five Fire Soldiers. The *Guardian Numinous Spirit Ruan* also states: "In the cinnabar heavens of the south, the three qi flow with radiance; the fire-star revolves like a torch, illuminating the Great Yang. Above dwells the Red Essence, the Luminous Numinous Youth, who commands the fire soldiers and serves the Three Officials." This refers to the affairs of the Three-and-Five Fire-Soldier households.

Talismans include those of the Eight Simplicities, Six Spirits, Yin-Yang, Jade Embryo, Immortal Refinement, Yin Essence, Flying Radiance, Yellow Florescence, Stone Radiance, Internal Transformation, Cavern Spirit, and Blue Heaven, among others. Charts include the *Six Jia Jade Maidens’ Spirit-Communication Chart*, the *Perfected Lord Taiyi’s Chart*, the *Eastern Well Bathing Chart*, the *Laozi’s Internal Vision Chart*, the *Western Ascent’s Eight Histories Chart*, and the *Nine Transformations’ Embracing Radiance Red Realm*, among others. These may be used to prepare and guard the empty passes.

The passes—such as the Three Passes and Four Passes—all exist within the human body. The front is elevated, the rear is low: such is the configuration of their positions.

Wielding a sword a hundred yards long while dancing amidst brocade feasts—such is the form of the divine soldiers and their swords. The Ten Absolutes span the void like fluttering fans, shaping qi in the emptiness with dazzling, sweeping radiance. Fire bells crown the heavens, plummeting like descending smoke: golden essence and fire bells pierce the celestial vault, their ranks and formations resembling clouds massing like drifting smoke. All this resides within the Yellow Gate between the brows. Visualize the fiery soldiers and their qi, all gathered at the Heavenly Court. The Heavenly Court, also called the Yellow Gate, is located between the brows. This is no mere branch or leaf—it is the very root of immortal cultivation.

**Purple Clarity, Chapter Twenty-Nine**
The Purple Clarity Supreme August Lord of the Great Dao,
Also named the Jade Celestial Palace.
Flanking the Great Mystery and Great Harmony in solemn attendance—
The Great Mystery and Great Harmony are the honorific titles of perfected immortals.
They transform and give life to the myriad things, making me immortal,
For such is the power of the Dao’s qi.
Ascending through the Ten Heavens in a jade chariot,
Riding reverently onward.
Meditate day and night for seven days without sleep,
With utmost sincerity and deepest resonance.
If you can cultivate this, you may endure forever,
The way of transcendent longevity.
Accumulating merit and refining the self is no natural occurrence,
But through study one governs the Dao.
This arises from unwavering sincerity and holding fast to the One,
Guarding the One as at first, with surplus to attain the Way.
Internally guard with steadfastness the true within the true,
Progressing step by step.
In emptiness and tranquility, the spirit comes of itself,
For the spirit receives through the void.

**The Hundred Grains, Chapter Thirty**
The essence of the hundred grains is the essence of the earth,
For grains are the fruit of the soil, belonging to the yin class.
Their five flavors, though outwardly fine, reek of demonic filth,
Not the true qi of pure emptiness.
They disturb the spirit and scatter the fetal qi,
Fetal qi refers to the flavorless flavor, the upright qi of spontaneity.
In the practice of qi absorption, there is a proper method for fetal breathing.
*Ling* means loss.
How then can one reverse aging and return to infancy?
Hair turns from white to black, fallen teeth regrow.
This line should follow "governing the spirit oneself," for here it seems out of place.
The three hun-souls drift aimlessly, the po-souls crumble and collapse—
*Aimlessly* means without tranquility.
*Crumble and collapse* means decay and ruin.
Why not consume the essence of the Great Harmony’s qi?
Advance in the way of refinement and absorption.
Thus one may enter the Yellow Tranquility without dying,
Yellow Tranquility is the accomplishment of the Yellow Court’s Way.

**Heart Canon, Chapter Thirty-One**
The Heart Canon is the sovereign of the five viscera,
For the spirit receives through the void, and the heart is the dwelling of the spirit, hence its kingship.
In movement and stillness, contemplate the conduct of the Dao and virtue.
*Contemplate* refers to meditating on the Cinnabar Origin Youth.
Thought is being, aspiration is non-being;
With thought, the heart is easily swayed before speech, but with non-being, the heart is ashen and the spirit whole—hence the conduct of the Dao and virtue.
Purity and good qi naturally radiate luminous clarity,
Through constant contemplation.
In sitting and rising, I together serve as the pillar and beam,
For the spirit takes the body as its dwelling, thus they share the pillar and beam.
*I* refers to the Cinnabar Origin Youth.
By day it shines with brilliance, by dusk it closes and conceals,
As Zhuangzi said: "When awake, the hun-souls open; when asleep, the hun-souls intermingle and close."
It unblocks and harmonizes the flowery essence to regulate yin and yang,
This refers to the heart spirit’s engagement and withdrawal, corresponding with the eyes.
*Flowery essence* is the essence of the eyes.
When the heart opens, the eyes open; by day it is yang, by night it is yin—hence the regulation of yin and yang.

**Passing Through, Chapter Thirty-Two**
Passing through the Six Harmonies, concealed at dawn and dusk—
This describes the heart’s function and the origin of yin and yang.
By day it passes through, by night it conceals.
The Six Harmonies are the four directions, above and below.
Dawn and dusk take the north as night, belonging to the hidden and obscure.
The spirits of the two kidneys govern longevity,
The kidney spirit is Dark Obscurity.
Nurturing the infant belongs to the north, governing the night; one who refines the heart may attain long life.
As the *Master by the River* said: "The kidneys store essence."
Descending in turn to lodge in the Dipper’s first nine,
Nine is the yang number.
The Dipper is the Northern Asterism, governing the descent of yang—yang qi descends to unite with yin.
The *Book of Changes* says: "Qian’s fortune lies in the primal head," where it is stored.
Knowing the masculine yet guarding the feminine, one may avoid aging,
Guarding the feminine is the text of "hiding the nine."
Knowing the white yet seeing the black, one sits in vigilant guard.
As the *Laozi* says: "Know the white, guard the black; know the masculine, guard the feminine"—this is the text of "hiding the nine."

**Liver Qi, Chapter Thirty-Three**

**Liver Qi, Chapter Thirty-Three**

The liver’s qi surges, clear and enduring;
The liver resides in the east, governing spring—root of the generative qi.
Clear and enduring describe the aspect of its qi and complexion.
Arrayed like the six palaces, it gives rise to the Three Luminaries.
By storing the thought of generative qi, it illumines the five viscera and six bowels,
As the sun, moon, and stars radiate their primal brilliance.
The heart’s essence and intent concentrate within, unwavering—
This is the knowledge of the One.
Like rain moistening the myriad things, the jade nectar nourishes the hundred limbs.
Mysterious fluid flows as clouds, banishing foulness and bearing fragrance—
When true qi circulates freely, no calamity or illness arises.
It purifies the teeth and hair, refining the Five Directions;
As clouds drift and rain descends, nothing remains obstructed—hence the Five Directions and Five Viscera.
Draw the fluid from the Mysterious Throat into the Bright Hall.
The way of swallowing saliva requires it to descend from the Mysterious Throat into the throat.
The throat, also called the Towering Pavilion, leads below to the Bright Hall,
And beneath the Bright Hall lies the Grotto Chamber, and below that, the Cinnabar Field—
This is the middle region.
Below, the throat’s spirit connects with the numinous;
Life and destiny depend upon the fluid and qi.
Sit in attendance beneath the Flowery Canopy, wandering the Noble Capital—
The Flowery Canopy is the lungs; the liver lies beneath them.
The Noble Capital is the Cinnabar Field.
Gently it courses through the Three Pures, resting upon the clear and cool—
The Three Emperors are the Lords of the Three Cinnabar Fields, also called Perfected Ones.
The liver’s qi, drifting and flowing, pervades the three Cinnabar Fields.
As the liver’s qi is the essence of the eyes, it rests upon the cool and clear.
Five-colored cloud-qi swirls in verdant profusion—
The liver’s qi, mingling with the five viscera, forms clouds.
Close the eyes and gaze inward to behold them,
Ever storing the thought, the five viscera appear of themselves.
Thus the heart’s spirits return to revere themselves—
The Crimson Youth is the Perfected One of the heart’s viscus,
Harmonizing and uniting with the same palace in mutual reverence.
The Seven Mysterious Flowers open the Gate of Destiny—
The seven orifices flow freely, without stagnation.
Unobstructed, the heavenly Dao abides in the Mysterious Root—
The body is the root.
One may yet return even at a hundred and twenty years;
Hasten to cultivate the practice, for time must not be lost.
Beyond this, guarding the Dao becomes truly difficult—
Death draws near.
Only the Ninefold Transmutation and Eightfold Jade Elixir remain—
The Ninefold Transmutation Divine Elixir grants ascent to heaven in broad daylight.
The *Baopuzi’s* "Discourse on the Nine Elixirs" states: "The Old Man perused the books of nurturing life and collected the methods for prolonging vision, having examined thousands of scrolls. None failed to regard the Returning Elixir and Golden Fluid as the great essentials."
The *Yellow Emperor’s Scripture of the Nine Cauldrons’ Divine Elixir* says: "The Emperor consumed it and ascended as an immortal, his destiny conjoined with heaven and earth, riding clouds and driving dragons, entering and exiting the Grand Purity."
The Eight Jades are cinnabar, realgar, azurite, sulfur, mica, halite, lodestone, and orpiment.
Yet one must also refine the thought and store the Seven Primes—
Though consuming the divine elixir, one must also practice the Way of the Yellow Court.
The Seven Primes refer to the true spirits of the seven stars and seven orifices.
Alternatively, the Five Emperor Lords and the White Prime and Radiant Prime Lords transform into the Seven Prime Lords.
The *Scripture of the Grotto Chamber* states: "To store the Seven Primes, recite the incantation: *Return the Prime to conceal the Dao, the Seven Stars shine resplendent.*"
The Seven Stars are the Seven Primes.
The effulgences of the sun and moon rescue the aged and infirm—
The left eye governs the sun, the right eye the moon; the eyes govern the liver.
Death belongs to the east, the phase of wood.
Wood’s position is spring, spring is the generative qi—hence it rescues the aged and infirm.
The liver’s qi circulates endlessly without cease.
As *Zhuangzi* says: "Fat is exhausted as kindling, yet fire is transmitted; life receives sustenance and destiny is stored therein."

**Lung Qi, Chapter Thirty-Four**

The lung’s qi arises from the Triple Burner—
The *Central Yellow Scripture* states: "The lung’s head is the Triple Burner."
The lung’s qi refers to the qi’s rinsing, which originates from the Triple Burner.
Those who speak of the Triple Burner often fail to grasp its true nature, mistakenly regarding it as the tubes above the three viscera.
"Burner" means heat, signifying the heat of the heart, liver, and lungs.
Watch and listen in darkness, awaiting the Youth—
The Youth is the heart’s spirit, the one within the Crimson City.

**Yuanyangzi says:** The Youth abides in the world through the eyes.
The Youth is the pupil of the eye.
To discern life and death, press the cheek with a finger—
if light appears, one lives; if not, one dies.
Observe the light in the eyes.

Regulate the fivefold radiance: hair flourishes, teeth strengthen.
The fivefold radiance is the qi of the five viscera.
The *Immortal Scripture* states: "Hair should be combed often, teeth should be clicked frequently."
Thirty-six swallows in the Jade Pool—
The mouth is the Jade Pool, also called the Flowery Pool.
Swallowing saliva enters the Cinnabar Field, which is called "irrigating the numinous root."
Opening the hundred vessels, the blood and fluids begin—
The blood and fluids within the body originate from the mouth.
The complexion glows with the luster of gold and jade,
the hundred vessels open wide.
Teeth grow firm, hair darkens, unaware of whiteness—
reverting to youth, returning to infancy.

Preserve this true spirit without negligence.
Focus the spirit without slackening.
Recall the seated mat in the Purple Palace—
The Purple Palace is the lung’s palace.
The seated mat is where the spirit finds repose.
The *Central Yellow Scripture* says: "The lung’s head is the Triple Burner, the abode of the Dark Dragon Lord."
When all spirits gather in assembly, they seek one another—
With the host of spirits united, how could perverse essences remain?

**Chapter Thirty-Five: Concealing the Feathered Canopy**

Conceal the feathered canopy to gaze upon the heavenly abode—
This speaks of the spleen’s palace.
The spleen’s palace is the Yellow Court of the Cinnabar Field, the central earth of *wu* and *ji*.
Looking upward, the liver and lungs become the canopy’s abode—
Thus is the spleen’s domain.

Pay homage to the Great Simplicity, joyfully calling one another.
The host of spirits gathers in the spleen’s palace, revering the Supreme Divine Immortals, delighting in mutual summoning—
This is the hun-soul uniting with the assembly of immortals.
The *Scripture of Numinous Simplicity* states: "The Supreme Divine Immortals include the Lord of Great Simplicity, the Lord of Great Void, and the Lord of Luminous Purity; the multitude of immortals follow the Dao, roaming in joy."

The radiant spirits of the Eight Might expel perversity with rectitude—
The Eight Numinous Spirits possess luminous virtue, upholding the true method to dispel evil and guard the spleen’s palace.
The Eight Might are the Eight Numinous Spirits.
The *True Records* say: "The incantation of the Northern Thearch for slaying ghosts states: 'The Seven Governors and Eight Numinous Ones, the Supreme White and Terrible, the long-skulled giant beasts, wielding the Thearch’s mallet, riding the three-tiered jade carriage, sternly driving the kui-dragons.'"
This is the method of guardianship, destroying evil and banishing misfortune—it is fitting to recite it.

The spleen spirit returns to the stomach’s household—
The spleen serves the stomach’s function, thus the spirit returns to it.
The spleen spirit’s name is *Changzai*, its cognomen *Hunting*.
The spleen grinds food and aids digestion—this is the stomach’s work.
The *Central Yellow Scripture* says: "The stomach is the Great Granary, the Great Granary is the spleen’s storehouse."

Nurturing the numinous root, it shall not wither—
Cultivating the Yellow Court’s spirit, cherishing and nourishing life, it shall not decay.
The spleen is the Yellow Court, the root of human life—
Focus the mind on its cultivation to prolong years and attain immortality.

Seal the Gate of Life to protect the Jade Capital—
The body is the Jade Capital; closing the Gate of Life in the Cinnabar Field preserves essence.
Master Primal Yang says: "The Gate of Life is the place where the essence-qi of the lower Cinnabar Field enters and exits, the spirit’s passage."
The body is the Jade Capital, where the spirit gathers—like a metropolis.

The myriad spirits then repay with abundant longevity—
The host of numina bestows blessings, extending one’s years.
*Repay* means recompense.
The myriad spirits reward nurturance, thus longevity overflows.

This is the spleen established in the Central Palace—
The spleen governs the Central Palace, the station of earth’s virtue.
The five viscera and six bowels are ruled by the Yellow Center—
The Yellow Center takes the spleen as its lord.

Ascend to unite with the Heavenly Gate and enter the Hall of Light—
Store the qi of the five viscera and six bowels to ascend and unite with the Heavenly Gate.
The Heavenly Gate lies between the brows—this is the Heavenly Court.
One *cun* inward from the brows is the Hall of Light.

Preserve the feminine and store the masculine, embracing the Three Lights—
The *Scripture of Laozi* states: "Know the masculine, preserve the feminine."
The feminine is the *yin* valley, yielding and weak.
The Three Lights are the sun, moon, and stars.

Externally square and internally round, the spirit abides within—
Externally square and internally round is the form of the Hall of Light; the spleen spirit and True Unity dwell at the center.

Harmonizing the blood and vessels, the five viscera flourish—
The spirit is tranquil, the mind is clear.
Bones turn green, sinews red, marrow like frost—
The hundred bones and nine orifices are all made true.

The spleen rescues the seven orifices, dispelling misfortune—
The spleen channels stomach-qi to respond to the external orifices, warding off evil and repelling malignity.
The spleen grinds food and aids digestion—ears hear clearly, eyes see brightly.

The sun and moon array themselves, setting forth *yin* and *yang*—
Qi spreads between the brows, left as *yang*, right as *yin*.
The sun governs *yang* and males, the moon governs *yin* and females.

When the two spirits meet, they transform into jade nectar—
*Yin* and *yang* harmonize to generate essence, transforming male and female.
*Yin* and *yang* are the body’s natural fluids.

Tasteless yet the sustenance of heaven and man—
When the spirit achieves harmony, it savors the flavorless.

The Child Cinnabar advances hunger with true yellow—
The youthful adept uses yellow qi as food to nourish it.
*Advances* means qi.
The Child Cinnabar is the true adept, the true qi of the Cinnabar Field.
The spleen is the Central Yellow, grinding food.

Thus it is called *langao* and jade frost—
The color and form of the fluids and essence-qi.

The Supreme Concealed Ring of the Eight Pure Jades—
The throat is called the Tower of Nine Stories, named the Supreme Concealed Ring, containing the Eight Pure Jade Fluids.
It holds the Eight Pure Jade Fluids; the Crimson Palace’s Tower of Nine Stories has twelve rings, within which the Eight Purities produce fluids.

Irrigating the Eight Fluids, the kidneys receive essence—
It nourishes the Eight Fluids, which enter the kidneys as jade essence; swallowing the fluids, they flow down into the kidneys’ palace, transforming into jade essence.

Concealed in the Great Yin, beholding my form—
The kidneys are the Great Yin; *yang* lies concealed within—this is the embryo’s form.
The Great Yin is the Grotto Chamber.
This speaks of observing the form of the jade fluids.

Raising the wind of the Three Mysteries, issuing forth the first green—
The kidneys belong to the Three Winters, their color is dark; when *yin* reaches its extreme, spring is born, emitting *yang* as green qi.
*Raising the wind* means transformation.
The *yin* and *yang* qi and the kidneys’ qi make three—three gives birth to the myriad things, subtle and wondrous, thus called the Three Mysteries.
*Issuing forth the first green* means the myriad things generate the color green.
The *Scripture of Great Peace* states: "Accumulating purity forms green."

In the realm of the indistinct and imperceptible, reaching utmost clarity—
The Three Mysteries’ nature arises; their qi is subtle and wondrous, not to be sought in form or substance—
Only in the realm of the indistinct and imperceptible can one attain the state of utmost clarity, where the *yin* and *yang* qi are most subtle.

Playing upon the Terrace of Whirling Winds, beholding the Red-Born—
Roaming atop the Terrace of Whirling Winds, one sees the True Person of the Red Child.
This speaks of harmonious qi transforming into the Red Child.
The Red Child is the True Person.
The Terrace of Whirling Winds is the gathering place of divine immortals.

In the carefree realm, nurturing the flourishing of the true—
Frolicking upon the Terrace of Whirling Winds is the carefree realm, gazing upon the true sages.
Delighting in the true qi beyond the material world is natural nurturance.

Inwardly gazing in silence, refining the five forms—
Rarely glimpsing the true sages, one turns the gaze inward to cultivate the body, preserving the spirit and qi for long life.

The Three Qi meander, attaining the numinous illumination—
Inwardly gazing to refine the form, the qi of the Three Fields circulates, achieving communion with the numinous spirits.
These are the qi of the Three Cinnabar Fields.

The Hidden Dragon conceals the zhi-clouds and jade blossoms—
The liver and gallbladder are the Hidden Dragon; the orifices and vessels are the inner zhi.
The spleen’s qi transforms the myriad fluids, all becoming jade blossoms.
The *Immortals’ Scripture* states: "The liver and gallbladder are the Green Dragon," thus *concealing the zhi-clouds and jade blossoms* refers to the spleen’s qi and fluids.

To sate hunger and command the myriad spirits—
Zhi-blossoms grant freedom from hunger, driving and dispatching all spirits.
When the Dao of imbibing qi is perfected, ghosts and gods are made to serve.

Above, the Darkest Mystery; below, the Tiger Seal—
When the Dao of refinement is achieved, the heavens bestow the divine tiger and jade seal,
the raiment of immortals and transcendents.
The *Yuanlu Scripture* states: "Transcendents possess the Dark Feather Canopy and the Divine Tiger Seal."

**Chapter Thirty-Six: The Ritual of Bathing**

Bathe in utmost purity, forsaking rich meats and pungent aromas—
This marks the method of entering stillness and upholding the scripture.
*Sheng* (盛) is the ancient form of *jing* (净, purity).
*Fei* (肥) refers to fish, meat, and the five pungent plants.

Enter the chamber facing east to recite the jade scripture—
Toward the Great Emperor, who resides in the east.
When the count of ten thousand recitations is fulfilled, meaning becomes radiantly clear,
emerging naturally from within the body.

Let the hair flow unbound, free of desire, to abide in longevity—
Unfettered and desireless, one attains long years.
The *Immortals’ Scripture* states: "To ingest the Nine Radiances, first loosen the hair."
The *Embryonic Breathing Method* says: "Lie supine with hair unbound."
Some say: First cast aside worldly desires, loosen the hair, and let the pillow rise one inch and two fen.
Clasp the thumbs, make fists, close the eyes, and extend the arms five inches from the body.
Gargle the mouth’s fluid, swallow it fully, then gently draw in breath through the nose,
taking five or six breaths before exhaling—one inhalation and one exhalation count as a single breath.
After ten exhalations, stretch the limbs; once stretched, repeat the practice.
Complete forty-nine cycles to finish one round.
Yet the meaning here suggests that loosening the hair is not solely for this method,
but rather an expression of unbounded ease and natural attainment.

The five flavors all return to the upright qi—
Spirit congeals, fluids flow, and the upright qi enters the viscera,
manifesting the five flavors in harmony.
Unite the five into one—this is the natural Dao.

Calm the heart, still the mind, and let no vexation arise—
With no heart to perceive, stillness comes naturally.
*Men* (闷) means quietude, a state of serene purity.
Laozi said: "Its governance is unhurried, its people are simple and sincere."

When the count is complete, body and spirit become refined—
Once the count is fulfilled, the body enters the wondrous void, a result of single-minded devotion.
The Jade Maiden of Yellow Blossom reveals her intent—
The spirit of the Cinnabar Field imparts the scripture’s meaning,
the yin spirit of the Cinnabar Field speaking to you.

The perfected one, now arrived, commands the Six Dings—
When the spirit of the Yellow Court arrives, the Six Dings are made to serve.
The *perfected one* refers to the Dao practitioner.
*Spirit’s arrival* means the essence has been attained.
The Six Dings were explained in earlier passages.

Ten recitations, four bows, to pay homage to the Most High—
Bowing to the Most High Lord Lao.
The *Jade Pure True Formula* states: "Those who recite the *Eastern Florescence Jade Scripture*
must perform ten recitations and four bows."
The *Jade Scripture* refers to this text.

First pay respects to the Great Emperor, then face north—
The Great Emperor resides in the east, the Seven Primes dwell in the north.
The *Inner Scripture of the Yellow Court* and the *Jade Book* flow unimpeded—
Through such cultivation and homage, the Dao of the Yellow Court is perfected,
and the principles of the jade scripture become clear.

The one who transmits is called the master; the one who receives takes an oath—
This speaks of the merit of upholding the scripture, which qualifies one to teach others.
This text is worthy of reverence.

Cloud brocade, phoenix gauze, and golden bindings—
These serve as tokens of the oath’s sincerity.
They replace the cutting of hair or flesh—
In ancient times, oaths were sealed by cutting hair and smearing blood,
but now cloud brocade is used to preserve the body whole.

Hand in hand, ascend the mountain to partake of the liquid elixir—
As when transmitting the cinnabar scripture, one swears an oath with blood.
Those who study the divine elixir and golden liquid must first take a solemn vow before receiving instruction.

Only when the golden script and jade luminaries are revealed may they be proclaimed—
Only after the oath is taken may the methods of transcendence be transmitted.
They are imparted to those who hold true faith.

If transmitted to one who receives them with care, like the Three Officials—
The Three Officials are Heaven, Earth, and Water.
Let not the seven ancestors suffer dark misfortune—
To teach the unworthy brings calamity upon the seven generations.
The Most High’s subtle and wondrous path leads to transcendence—
It is most venerable and precious.
This is the scripture of the deathless Dao—
This text holds the way to longevity; receive and practice it with utmost devotion.
