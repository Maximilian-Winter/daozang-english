*The Great Cavern Scripture of Golden Flower and Jade*

This scripture is titled *The Great Cavern Scripture of Golden Flower and Jade*. Its author is unknown, though it likely emerged during the Northern and Southern Dynasties, having been adapted from *The Feminine One Jade-Inscribed Precious Scripture of the Five Venerables*. It comprises one scroll. The base text is drawn from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, under the "Methods" category of the *Dongzhen* section.

To receive the esoteric transmission of the Great Cavern, wherein the Cavern-One and the Supreme Dao merge with the Feminine One in transformation, one must first recite the *Supreme Vows of the Celestial Lord* and the *Hidden Writ of the Golden Flower in Eight Stanzas by the Mysterious Mother*. These are the forbidden texts cherished within the embrace of the Nine Heavens’ Celestial Lord.

When transmitting this to a disciple, one must first announce a fast, observing purity for one day before and after, followed by a hundred-day purification. Only then may the scripture be conferred. For the intermediate fast, seventy days; for the lesser, thirty-nine—facing the fast with ascetic rigor to ensure proper transmission. If one carelessly transmits it to an unworthy recipient without the required fast, the master of the scripture shall perish, and the receiver shall lose both luminous visions. If the fast lacks sincerity, the master shall fall ill, and the receiver shall lose speech. The weight of responsibility rests upon the master, lest the scripture be treated lightly; calamity befalls the disciple, who must guard both mouth and eyes. Transgressions bring grave misfortune across seven generations, and suffering binds the soul in the unseen trials of the afterlife.

Upon receiving this scripture, one must immediately put it into practice, without negligence or violation of its covenants, adhering strictly to the prescribed methods. Serve the master of the scripture during the three fasts as one would serve a sovereign or father. Conduct the rituals in a secluded chamber within a tranquil grove, as if in perfect solitude. Cultivate the Five Spirits within the Purple Chamber as though the true numina were present.

This transmission is not to be given to those outside the bonds of sovereign and master, father and son, or elder and younger brother—thus demonstrating the true and subtle nature of its use and the difficulty of upholding its prohibitions. Do not enter a chamber that is not that of sovereign, master, father, son, or brother—thus showing restraint in one’s reach and the embrace of reclusion in unity. Do not don the robes of one who is not sovereign, master, father, son, or brother—thus limiting worldly attachments and exercising self-restraint in abundance.

Refine the wondrous awareness of celestial essence, severing all worldly attachments and fleeting thoughts. Let one’s conduct be marked by perseverance through hardship, leaving no trace like a shadow vanishing in light. Let three meals suffice from mountain streams, and let one’s hidden sincerity be revealed in secluded retreat. Then shall one’s voice resound in the chambers of the Five Venerables, and one’s virtue ascend above the Three Clarities. Preserve inner concentration within luminous jade, keeping garments and headcoverings fresh and unstained. Meditate upon the Three Origins within the Mud-Pill Palace, and guard the Nine Perfected within the dwelling of form. Exhale and inhale the Five Flowers, drawing in Jade Fluid. Morning and evening, seek transcendence in the Empty Union; in sleep and waking, awaken the spirit in the Great Vast. Be diligent without weariness, earnest without cessation. Only such a person may be deemed worthy to speak of the gateways of the Great Cavern and partake in the wondrous contemplations of the Dao.

Those who uphold this teaching shall ascend the Three Mornings and wander the Great Empyrean; those who violate it shall sink into the Three Springs and enter the Great Obscurity.

When transmitting this scripture, the master must ensure the esoteric instructions are conveyed in stages, not all at once. First, impart the method and instructions so that the disciple may practice visualization, refine the Five Forms, and focus the mind upon the Purple Chamber, purging defilements and purifying the emotions. By maintaining steadfast integrity and embracing unity day and night, one awaits the presence of the numinous.

Thus, the hidden mystery of the Great Elixir is called *The Scripture of the Golden Flower*, and the Jade Morning of the Three Origins is known as the essence of the Feminine One. After three years of cultivating the Feminine One, one may then recite *The Thirty-Nine Chapters of the True Scripture of the Great Cavern*. Yet even now, upon receiving these instructions, one may put them into practice. By practicing these methods, one is certain to attain immortality, without needing to recite *The True Scripture of the Great Cavern* in its entirety.

When sincerity in cultivation is profound, aligning with the true and facing the vision, the Three Origins shall manifest. From the moment one obtains this scripture, the Mysterious Void bestows its transmission, the Yellow and the Old reveal their talismans, the numinous is activated, and the Five Venerables scatter flowers. Receiving the text from the void, one ascends to the Great Non-Being.

The *Twelve Vows of the Celestial Lord* are as follows: Vow to Heaven, Vow to Earth, Vow to Wind, Vow to Cloud, Vow to Yin, Vow to Yang, Vow to the Great Void, Vow to the Great Non-Being, Vow to the Great Emptiness, Vow to the Great Possession, Vow to Self-Generation, and Vow to the Generation of Spirits.

The *Eight Gates of the Mysterious Mother in the Stanzas of Practice* are as follows: May the Mysterious Mother be born with me in the space of generative qi; may she abide with me between the sun and moon; may she protect me within the Nine Heavens; may she nourish me with the food of spontaneity; may she drink with me from the Gourd River; may she rest with me in the Jade Perfection; may she sleep with me in the Immortal Hall; may she wander with me among the Three Mysteries.

When in a separate chamber, one must constantly recite this scripture, not forgetting it even for a moment—this is the inner vow to the Celestial Lord, opening the Eight Gates of Goodness.

Even now, the immortals of the Five Peaks and the transcendents of the divine lands still partake of nectar and savor rare fruits, reciting the Great Vows, expounding the Eight Gates, aspiring to the Primal Simplicity, honoring the Three Origins, setting their minds upon the Empyrean Morning, becoming Jade Perfected, liberating seven generations, and entering the Broad Cold. How much more should this be so for the mediocre and base of the world, the lowly among the Five Defilements? Should one abandon such practice upon hearing of it?

Though one may refine form and spirit through arduous effort in the cycle of rebirth, if the sins of seven generations remain unresolved, one shall have no hope of immortality. Therefore, one must invoke the Great Vows and expound the Eight Gates to dissolve these accumulated knots. Once the trials of the seven examinations are blessed, one may attain deathlessness. Deathlessness is the fundamental principle of attaining the Dao and the root origin of becoming an immortal. Those who dedicate themselves to this endeavor—how can they not strive for eternal existence?

The *Twelve Supreme Vows of the Nine Heavens’ Celestial Lord* and the *Eight Divine Gates of the Nine Numinous Mysterious Mother* enable the return to the Five Penetrations, dispel worldly calamities, bestow blessings upon the seven ancestors, and allow the practitioner to attain immortality.

In the stillness of a secluded chamber, with incense lit and smoke rising straight, recite *The Great Cavern Scripture of Golden Flower and Jade*, saying:

Northern Culmen Heavenly Sovereign,
Supreme One Celestial Lord,
Jade Clarity and Purple Void,
Dual Radiance of Bright Perfection,
Unsurpassed Great Dao,
Three Origins of Primal Simplicity,
Four Directions and Five Venerables,
Six Canopies and Seven Mornings,
Eight Ascents and Nine Numinous,
Hidden Dao and Returning Origin,
Mysterious Mother and Five Penetrations,
Golden Flower and Lofty Immortals,
Life-Commanding Celestial Master,
Great Spirit of Generation,
Qi of the Supreme Tenuity,
I offer this libation for the sake of the cause.

May the Nine Mysteries of the Upper Vow guard the po and support the hun, illuminating the true primal qi to converge within this body. Looking upward, I summon the supreme Five Penetrations Great Immortals; gazing downward, I invoke the Hidden Dao and Returning Origin. The accumulated sins of seven generations are now dissolved and dispersed. Receiving blessings in the Southern Palace, I sprinkle fragrant offerings at the Eight Gates.

May the Vow of Heaven, the Vow of Earth, the Vow of Wind, and the Vow of Clouds—four vows united as one—settle the register of longevity. The heavenly canopy nurtures the root of the embryo; the earth assists the radiance of the luminaries. The divine wind fans with eightfold wings; the effulgent clouds flow and fill. With the Celestial Lord, I soar together to the Upper Clarity, gazing upon the Northern Mystery, loosening my sash in the Jade Court. Blessings extend to the seven ancestors; the mysterious examination confirms the true register. The Upper Vow reaches in four directions, and longevity rivals the sun’s span.

The Middle Vow, also fourfold, governs the Celestial Lord’s scriptures. May the Vow of Yin, the Vow of Yang, the Vow of the Great Void, and the Vow of the Great Nothingness—along with the Three-Five Luminous Spirits and the dwellers of the Seven-Nine—be fulfilled. The Celestial Lord’s Primal Father, at the inception of destined life, the Jade Emperor’s congealed chariot, ever abides within my dwelling.

I visualize the Purple Chamber, the Mud-Pill Palace of Peach Vigor, consolidating yin to secure the blood, while the hun is born in the Great Yang. The numinous void shines with radiance; the Great Nothingness treads the eternal. The Nine Qi of the Empty Void become my yellow robes. After seven examinations, I receive blessings and ascend as an immortal in the Southern Palace.

The Lower Vow, also fourfold, seeks the immortal courts of longevity. Thus, I vow to the Great Void, and further vow to the Great Possession. The spirit abides in the Nine Heavens; the form roams the true realms. The Celestial Lord merges and harmonizes, wandering through the Seven-Nine. Calamities depart from my chamber; blessings come to be claimed. Malicious words vanish; compliant speech flourishes.

Again, I vow for self-generation: Heaven and Earth as father. Again, I vow for spirit-generation: harmonious qi as mother. The Five Penetrations of the Returning Origin eradicate transgressions and filth. Blessings crown seven generations; transcendence endures everlastingly.

May my words ascend to the August Emperor, the Celestial Lord in harmonious chant. The chant’s melody soars beyond the clouds; eight echoes resound ten thousandfold. The numinous brush reverses its ascent; a thousand truths converge in recompense. From kalpa to kalpa, we shall forever convene in the Twelve Celebrations.

Great is the Celestial Lord’s grace—ten thousand blessings return to the Origin.

Further, I vow to the Eight Gates Mysterious Mother, who crafts the divine chant of the Eight Gates, her gaze profound in the Nine Numinous Cavern. In the Upper Vow to the Mysterious Mother, may she be born with me amid the qi of generation, enabling the Purple Effulgence to merge with the void, uniting heaven and humanity in accord. Soaring as an immortal on feathered wings, may I join her in flight. Heavenly music delights the heart; a hundred sorrows are cast aside. The Seven Mysteries rejoice; the Upper Numinous lends its support.

In the Second Vow to the Mysterious Mother, may she abide with me amid the sun and moon, at the juncture of the Three Lights. The Great Emperor’s paired chariots, azure banners and emerald canopies, flowered chariots and embroidered robes, brocade garments and jade belts—together we escort the Five Venerables, joining the four great assemblies. Entering the feast of the Flowery Cold, we gaze beyond the Eight Extremities.

In the Third Vow to the Mysterious Mother, may she safeguard me amid the Nine Heavens, where true radiance congeals in perfection. With a heart made level through inner refinement, qi overflows the numinous hall, summoning myriad spirits. My body ascends to the Nine Firmaments; the examination of blessings delves into the profound mystery. Loosening my sash in the Empty Sameness, I grasp the wheel and ascend the layered heavens. Blessings extend through seven generations; I am reborn as a human. I safeguard the Great Perfected, sharing the sun’s lifespan.

In the Fourth Vow to the Mysterious Mother, may she dine with me amid the spontaneity of nature, forever departing the Three Paths to eternally join the natural order. Seven-jeweled jade grains, golden elixirs with purple auras, hidden mushrooms plucked from the right, luminous night-pearls gathered from the left—phoenix embryos and tiger froth, cloud jades and jasper frosts. With a single taste of these wondrous flavors, my body brushes the Great Void.

In the Fifth Vow to the Mysterious Mother, may she drink with me amid the Gourd River’s currents, where the flowing springs of ten thousand cliffs are both clear and sweet. The returning waters of jade essence, numinous moisture of azure indigo, ascend to the remotest heavens, streaming into the divine hall. Waves surge and swell, stirring the Great Void. Floating and roaming in the vast clarity, drinking and rinsing at the Eastern Mound, I bow to the rosy dawn. Wondrous joy in the azure waves—after seven examinations, I attain immortality. Blessings overflow; my body pledges the Nine Rivers, and wherever I turn, all becomes well.

In the Sixth Vow to the Mysterious Mother, may she rest with me amid the Jade Perfected’s precincts. Vast is the upper seat; the ravines stretch into the limpid heavens. The Five Venerables array their chambers; the Jade Effulgence announces its numinosity. The Queen Mother of the West’s flying chariot, feathered banners streaming, arrives with me to repose in the Nine Mysteries’ court. Blessings accumulate for seven examinations; I receive the embryo and am reborn. My body coils within the jeweled palace; my spirit nests in the perfect clarity.

In the Seventh Vow to the Mysterious Mother, may she sleep with me amid the immortal halls. In the secluded and wondrous numinous chamber, the mysterious effulgence is arrayed on all sides. Vermilion structures with phoenix frameworks, radiance reflecting the eaves, golden beds and jade couches, purple curtains and dragon gates—above sits the Mysterious Emperor; in the center, the Heavenly Perfected. I occupy the right, adorned with sashes and brocade. Great blessings extend through seven examinations; I receive the scripture and am reborn.

In the Eighth Vow to the Mysterious Mother, may she wander with me amid the Three Mysteries. Thus, I rein in the vast desert; my chariot turns through the Three Mysteries. The Five Venerables lend their support; the Queen Mother stands shoulder to shoulder. Dancing wheels on the divine mounds, halting the chariot in the Nine Heavens, I settle the scripture of the Supreme and receive the rank of Perfected. The feminine and masculine unite in the Ninefold Harmony, from billions to thousands. The Eight Echoes of the Cavern Scripture resound; seven ancestors attain immortality. From kalpa to kalpa, we shall forever convene in the Eight Gates.

Where do the Eight Gates abide? Forever within my cause. The Five Venerables descend blessings; the Dao and virtue flourish abundantly. Ten thousand qi ascend and generate; the Mud-Pill Palace is firmly secured.

When the vows are complete, may my years equal the sun and moon. Great is the emptiness of life; the Mysterious Mother moves and rests within the Eight Gates’ progression.

The Way of the Great Unity in the Cyclical Fusion of the Emperor—cultivate the Nine Diagrams. After reciting this scripture and visualizing the invocation of the capital’s names, close both eyes and visualize the hundred spirits transforming into white qi, resembling the smoke of burning incense, emerging from the mysterious void to enter the mouth. Dense and billowing for a long while, the white qi descends, exiting through the lower orifices and the Jade Stem aperture. Then, the white qi emerges from the soles of the feet and the palms, enveloping the entire body—head, limbs, hands, and feet—merging into one. Together with the white qi, like smoke ascending and descending, they become indistinguishable.

After a long while, the white qi suddenly changes color, transforming into a dense purple cloud. It re-enters through the mouth into the head, filling the Five Viscera and permeating the abdomen.

After a long while, the purple cloud again emerges from the soles of the feet, the palms, the major apertures, and the Jade Stem aperture, encircling and enveloping the entire body. For a long while, it billows and rises, merging with the purple cloud in form, becoming indistinguishable.

In an instant, visualize the qi of the purple cloud filling the left and right sides and the entire chamber. Then, visualize a fan of wind and qi emerging from the mouth, causing the smoke of the purple cloud to swirl and intertwine, coiling and binding together. Suddenly, it transforms into a perfected person, male in form, appearing as a newborn, four *fen* in height, named the Venerable Lord of the Great Cavern, Imperial Unity. His name is Father Ningzai, his style is Union of Mother’s Essence. He is the host of the multitude of spirits guarding the Gate of Death, the convergence of the revolving wind, together forming the Venerable Lord of Imperial Unity.

Next, visualize this Venerable Lord entering through your mouth beneath the tongue, then ascending directly to the Purple Chamber of the Six Harmonies Palace, where he sits facing outward. In his left hand, he holds your Five Registers; in his right, your Five Talismans. To the left of the Venerable Lord’s mouth shines the light of the sun, nine *fen* in diameter; to the right, the light of the moon, one *cun* in diameter. From the Venerable Lord’s mouth and tongue issues the qi of the revolving wind, blowing upon the lights of the sun and moon, causing them to billow—now white, now red. Their radiant qi descends into your Five Viscera, Six Bowels, hundred joints, and the entirety of your body, illuminating it so that inside and out, it becomes as bright as daylight. After a long while, you forget your own form, and suddenly, the practice is complete.

This diagram sketches the image between the brows; visualize it as in the eighth diagram, with the great presence in the Purple Chamber of the Six Harmonies Palace—this is the Mud Pill Palace of the Six Harmonies. Then, recite the prayer:

*"Great Cavern Imperial Unity, venerable spirit of the Grand Simplicity,
Father Ning and Mother Essence, dual union in perfect pair,
Hundred perfected in grand convergence, revolving wind’s first birth,
Body woven of eightfold mist, transforming the primordial womb’s infant,
Jewels of sun and moon’s light, illuminating my form,
Grand Unity above, merging with the Imperial One,
Mud Pill preserves jade, Five Viscera bloom in splendor,
Eternally conjoined with sun and moon, holding the Cavern Scripture,
Ascending as an immortal elder, spirit rising to the Upper Clarity,
Thirty-nine chapters, golden talismans of the Feathered Court."*

This is the Dao of the revolving wind’s grand convergence with Imperial Unity, complete in itself. Myriad transformations and hundredfold changes, the methods of the Cavern Perfected and Grand Unity, reach their utmost here.

At night, constantly visualize the Venerable Lord of the Great Cavern, Imperial Unity, at the center of your philtrum beneath the nose. By day, constantly visualize him outside the upper teeth within the mouth, inside the upper lip above the philtrum. The Venerable Lord’s form should always face outward, whether sitting, standing, or moving—hold him in mind. Visualize the Venerable Lord’s mouth holding the light of the sun, nine *fen* in diameter, shining with boundless brilliance, equally illuminating your body.

The One is the true unity of the Imperial Lord. The transformations of the One return to the One. When reciting the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*, also visualize the Venerable Lord Imperial Unity before you, with the divine lord’s mouth facing your own, listening to the sound of your recitation of the Cavern Scripture, thereby dissolving the knots of seven generations.

The Venerable Lord Imperial Unity, whose taboo name is Father Ningzai and style is Union of Mother’s Essence, must be constantly remembered day and night without forgetfulness. He averts ten thousand trials, extinguishes a thousand afflictions, dispels evil demons, and brings about immortality. If there is any pain or discomfort in your body, swiftly visualize the Venerable Lord Imperial Unity, commanding him to exhale the white qi of the sun’s light to fumigate the afflicted area—the pain will immediately be cured.

The Venerable Lord Imperial Unity appears as a newborn male, unclothed, four *fen* in body length. This is the true form of the grand convergence returning to the womb, the primal shape of inception.

**Thirteen Diagrams of the Inner Methods of the Great Cavern for Cultivating Yin-Yang Perfected Unity**
Arranged according to the Nine Palaces, front and back, facing and turned away, shadows overlapping, they cannot be seen directly, making it difficult to depict them in frontal diagrams. Now, following the sequence, they are placed to the right, drawn in frontal view to avoid obscurity. If drawn in profile, the visualization would be incorrect. Please visualize the true spirits of each palace all facing forward in proper seated posture. Among them, the Three Perfected should face one another, as if in secluded retreat. The first *cun* with the Hall of Light together make one *cun*; though drawn correctly, they are still positioned to the right.

Refine the visualization with precision, and after nine years of practice, you will ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

**The Scripture of the Golden Flower and Jade Cavern concludes.**
