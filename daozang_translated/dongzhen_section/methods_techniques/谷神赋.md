The Dao resides solely in the Valley Spirit,
Whose numinous essence blends with the primordial;
Nestled within the womb, its nature remains whole.
When the image and method first arise, they begin as one—
The valley’s echo responds from the Three Fields,
Dwelling at the Gate of the Mysterious Female.

When the Mysterious True first stirs, the Female Gate opens,
Its nature uniting with the Central Palace, called the Nurtured Child.
Qi follows qi, departing through the constructive and defensive,
While spirit drives spirit, returning to the orifices.
By containing it, the Three Passes remain undying.

To contain the Mysterious Nurturance is to seal the Celestial Pass,
Unfettering the numinous root to follow nature’s law.
When breath cycles divide, know the latter breath;
The source returns whence it arose, back to its origin.
Through skillful nurturance, the singular qi endures forever.

This enduring singular qi is named the Spirit Metropolis,
Modeling the Three Powers to issue wondrous talismans.
The Mysterious Method but adheres to the Three Sages’ principles—
How could the Cavern Heavens possess divergent paths?

Within qi lies essence:
Within qi lies treasure—true essence,
Which may be sealed and stored, free from craving.
As water is in fish and fish in water,
So essence is in man, and man attains life.
One must guard the black to know the white.

Knowing the white, guard the black—black becomes the minister;
Knowing the black, guard the white—white is the sovereign.
When sovereign and minister harmonize,
The hun and po remain in the body for a thousand years.

Turning outward, there is nothing—
Within purity, the external becomes spiritually permeable.
Truly, one who upholds this refuses to comply.
Awakening to the dream-body as but a dream,
Do not let true qi mingle with perverse winds.
Simply secure the stem to deepen the root.

The deep root and firm stem originate from the womb,
Endowed by heaven and earth at birth.
When the two qi do not intermingle yet resonate,
Within the Three Fields dwells a single mediator.

Now consider:
The myriad things, teeming, each return to their source—
Truly, this is the Cavern Heaven.
Should one mistake the Maiden for true defense,
The years of cultivation are squandered in vain.

Emerging from the Rare and Subtle,
Within the subtle lies treasure, though the rare is formless.
Through inhalation and swallowing, the clam yields a pearl.
When yin reverts to yang, the spirit-fetus coalesces;
In the profound obscurity, the method is complete.
This resides in the essential and wondrous.

To preserve it, first purify the hundred spirits,
Abiding in emptiness until phenomena take shape.
The essential and wondrous ever pervade exhalation and inhalation—
Beware lest the mechanism leak the Mysterious Essence.

The valley, self-nurturing:
Within the valley’s echo, the spirit is most numinous,
The Cavern Heaven’s nurturance follows the method of Mysterious Jade.
If, after breath unites, one engages with external things,
From this regulation, life is then beheld anew.

When spirit stirs, the hundred joints align with principle;
When the orifices open, true qi’s method endures.
Let the Triple Burner not move ceaselessly,
And the Five Viscera must guard against cold and heat’s harm.

Knowing softness, conceal the shadow within the central void—
Knowing softness, the sagely canon’s principles align.
The subtle and wondrous spirit communicates through qi.
In the Mysterious Discourse, within emptiness, grasp the image;
The immortal scriptures repeatedly record the Dharma-gate’s emptiness.

Skillfully sealing and containing light, inwardly radiant and unified—
Skillfully sealing and containing light, a single path opens.
The numinous gate and womb coalesce, fourfold in material.
Though inwardly luminous, with an aspiration for emptiness,
One must comprehend the self-arising of things within the womb.

Life may be prolonged forever:
From the original source of life, life arises anew;
The withered stem revives from the old stem’s glory.
Reverting to essence, it naturally penetrates transformation—
What fear is there that the perfected infant will not be resplendent?

Death may be remedied:
When the Six Qi give rise to illness, whence comes the affliction?
Calming the spirit, the spirit stills, and qi returns to clarity.
Diligently, in the tranquil night, commune with the numinous body—
How could the Three Worms ever assail the Five Phases?

Though spoken of as spontaneous,
Spontaneity is liberation, self-sustained.
Only then does the numinous root harmonize with the Dao’s subtlety.
The Four Images are well observed—like the toad’s principle,
Beyond the third autumn’s curtain, the moonlight grows full.

In stillness and focus:
With sincere intent and a heart devoted to the Dao’s verdancy,
Emptiness is wholly qi’s precedence.
When the Mysterious Spirit attains the pursuit of true refinement,
One fathoms the most supreme Mystery within the Mystery.

Without great neglect, outwardly flourishing—
Diligently practice, never abandoning the Mysterious Work.
In daily use, know that external things are permeable.
A single treasury of dragon radiance returns to the pure chamber—
In the world, nothing remains, yet it may still be vast.

Simply accumulate much to inwardly strengthen:
Accumulating resolve, the inner is fortified.
A single piece of true heart is the oceanic Dharma-source.
Naturally attaining, one knows the child’s nature;
Without contrived wisdom, wisdom becomes complete.

If one can comprehend its containment of the true,
Then life rests in oneself:
Simply understanding the root’s Dao-nature as pure,
Uniting with the true, silently shadowing the body.
Qi augments qi, as it pertains to me;
Life supplements life, yet no one is other than oneself.

If one does not know to guard the One,
Then it is the Mystery within the Mystery.
From ancient times, attaining the One is the Dao’s beginning.
Within the Mystery, the Three Powers mirror the Five Diagrams.
The adept must know spirit’s egress and ingress—
The method resembles the Mysterious Pearl, yet again mysterious.

Thus, contain it subtly, subtly—
The subtle Dao is truly subtle.
One qi calls, one qi returns.
Like wind arising, clouds and mist respond,
Even heaven cannot contravene this image.

Abide in it silently, silently—
Dwelling in the Mystery, dwelling in the Dao’s time,
Silent without speech, silent in upholding.
From ancient times, those who attained it spoke of no attainment;
To expound or elaborate is not the person’s way—crossing into calamity.

Qi employed in myriad ways seeks dissolution—
Qi used in myriad forms begets toil.
Originally pure and quiescent, free from grease and fat.
The spirit’s visage, ancient in countenance, preserves the True One;
When the primordial chaos opened, it was once refined.

Severing profit, unifying the source to take as principle—
Preserving the primordial chaos’s embryonic moisture, deepening the root,
When the clear opens, the method naturally rounds.
Let the will’s path adhere to the Three Sages’ principles;
The immortal scriptures guard the secret—a single subtle word.

The heart is the pivot, the eyes are thieves:
The pivot desires to generate myriad things,
The heart admits perverse winds, the eyes rely on their brightness.
Scenery and colors cannot admonish themselves—
In a fleeting instant, another floating life slips away.

Indulging in desires without seeking—
When desire opens perverse intent, the heart’s gate stirs.
The original spirit scatters and disorders—how can nature be at peace?
All creatures, wriggling, become objects of delight;
To seek such delight is indeed difficult.

Thus, the cultivation of the true is unattainable:
The hun wanders nightly, the po returns to the body,
Lifetime after lifetime, teeming, desiring to learn the true.
How could the supreme Dao instruct one to be ensnared by form?
In the dusty world, true persons are everywhere.

Observe how all things bear yin and embrace yang—
Only after traversing the Three Purities does one enter the Emperor’s Realm.
If purity and stillness know the divine’s later use,
Those who attain it will surely freeze the heart’s motion.
Heaven endures, earth abides.

Yin and yang contain qi in perfect balance,
Only then does one realize heaven’s eternity and earth’s constancy.
Deep in the grotto, luminous clarity shines bright,
Emerald light in autumn’s hue, the moon vast and pale.
Those lost in the grotto may seek it by a path—
To lose the grotto, follow the Jasper Jade Stream,
Where immortals transform gold from clay.
To know where sacred traces transmit the truth,
A single tree where twin wild cranes alight.

Those blocked have no way to depart—
Without root, wisdom lacks acuity;
The ear must listen much, lest wisdom grow deaf.
Hemp grows straight when bound to flax,
Yet flax within hemp shares its nature.

Behold the hidden sprouting of the crimson child—
The crimson child’s sprouting nature resembles infancy,
As sprouts follow the advent of true yang.
In the third spring, the hidden dragon stirs;
When the Four Symbols converge, the White Tiger urges.

Roaring yet not hoarse—
Male and female roar, suppressing hoarse cries,
Desire conjoins, yet first they swallow, restraining force.
The two qi do not bind to the womb’s fate,
Only then does one know the profound mystery of the True One.

Know the numinous tortoise to attain self-mastery—
The tortoise’s form aligns with heaven’s timing,
The dragon’s canopy, earth’s spirit, the foundation of ten thousand years.
If one knows the secret passage between above and below,
The crescent moon’s high and low are rare in the world.

Abandon it, and it conceals itself—
Grasp it, yet no form or substance can be sought;
Seize it, and clouds and thunder stir without cease.
Approach smoke and fire, dryness turns to damp;
Moisture flows where it will, ever replenishing.

Contemplate the divine coagulation of the yellow orange—
The yellow coagulation is truly the Emperor’s head,
Spirit resides in emptiness, qi gathers above.
The great Dao requires no labor to seek beyond,
When principle penetrates the utmost extreme, what more is there to seek?

Exhort the dark pearl to grow everlasting—
The dark pearl and jade tree have roots,
Able to be brittle or supple, their aspiration called rare.
Those who awaken should hasten to retreat and hide,
Yet still harbor the urge to push others aside or prop them up.

Focused use and nurturing containment—
Divine use demands unwavering resolve,
Nurturing containment knows the gate of mysterious qi.
The dharma’s firmness and softness emerge and vanish together,
Only when the moment arrives can affairs be truly weighed.

Never departing from resonance and shadow—
Like echo to sound, like shadow to form,
Shadow and form are silent, echo alone gives voice.
When the mechanism of the Dao is employed, not a single thing remains;
Yet when the image unfolds, the dharma’s essence naturally overflows.

Return to the jade essence within—
Qi’s jade essence wears snow as its robe,
Scholars may know it, yet not in fine detail.
Ask the aspirant—does he lack profound aspiration?
Scant in the profound principle, how can he grasp its subtleties?

How could one born of doubt ever arise?
Failing to comprehend pure discourse, the truth remains obscure,
Misinterpreting the intent, all become lost wayfarers.
Without tranquility, how can one nurture virtuous resolve?
How could one forget intention and model the primordial spirit?

Expounding beyond the dust—how could it be confused with stored thought?
Where no dust arises, no external filth exists,
How dare one mix purity and serenity with it?
When storing and applying, attune to the seasons’ rhythms,
Yin and yang clash, striking forth as thunder.

Seeing yet unseen, attaining it as if startled—
Within the image of the mysterious, no thing has form,
Yet the Dao and virtue naturally resound like an echo.
From ancient times, the immortals’ intent remains unfathomable,
Creation’s generation emerges from the boundless void.

Laozi transmitted it to Yin Xi—
Descending to the world, transmitting truth, styled the Great Immortal,
At the Pass of Han, stone walls held his bequeathed words.
How many have come and gone, attaining it?
West beyond the shifting sands, the dharma is natural.

Huizi received it from Zhuangzi—
Huizi’s learning was then not yet refined,
Only after awakening did he surpass Zhuangzi.
In a single leap, he entered the land of the mysterious origin,
For ten thousand ages, discoursing on the Dao’s nature.

Ah, the supreme Dao!
Nurturing spirit lies in the heart,
Immortality rests with me.
To esteem it is not enough—again, one sighs—
The way of nurturing spirit is truly subtle.

If stillness and faith allow the exchange of precious qi,
Others may not know, but I know myself.
Born, one follows water; sprouting, one turns to fire.
The two sources of immortal water are hard to fathom,
Tidal waves of true flow are not easily traversed.
Once, at Black Horse Mountain, he met the Primordial Mother,
What need has the Great Yin for the moon as its officer?

If one knows that movement leads to the realm of death,
Then there is nothing that cannot be turned to what cannot be.
Fear the cultivation of the realm of death, be wary of indulging passion,
Cultivating fortune depends on this life.
The great Dao’s mysterious compassion knows no impossibility,
Returning the hun-soul to preserve life, one attains longevity.

The *Ode to the Valley Spirit* concludes.
