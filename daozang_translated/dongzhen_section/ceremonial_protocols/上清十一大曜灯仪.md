**The Ritual of the Supreme Clarity Eleven Great Luminaries’ Lamps**

The ritual proceeds according to form. The officiant [Name], with reverence and awe, prostrates, bows twice, burns incense, and respectfully memorializes:

To the Three Clarities and Supreme Saints, the Ten Poles’ Lofty Perfected, the Central Heaven’s Star Lord, the Purple Tenuity Great Emperor, the Sun Palace and Moon Mansion Star Lords, the Five Planets and Four Luminaries Star Lords, the Southern Dipper’s Six Offices Star Lords, the Northern Dipper’s Nine August Star Lords, the Circumpolar Twenty-Eight Constellations Star Lords, the Star Lords of One’s Original Destiny, the Three Officials Great Emperors, the Four Palaces’ Perfected Lords, the Five Masters and Three Ministries’ Perfected Lords, the Three Realms and Four Palaces, and the boundless host of sages—

May the sagely compassion wholly illumine and reflect [our devotion].

Your servant has heard: one brilliance by day, one brilliance by night, the Three Luminaries alternate their illumination without end. Whether descending as auspice or calamity, the myriad phenomena all submit to regulation. Their revolutions divide the seasons, their closure completes the year, and they govern floods, droughts, famine, and abundance to admonish the times. Though the cinnabar cassia and white elm are separated by clouds and heavens, the stringing of pearls and union of jades never err by the slightest measure. Thus, the jade armillary sphere and balance were devised in the reigns of Yao and Shun, while bronze instruments and wooden apparatus were perfected in the eras of Han and Tang.

The great virtue of the luminous spirits and nocturnal radiance is stored in five-colored halos of felicity; the majesty of the Yang’s winding celestial assistance is manifested in their adherence to orbits and lodges, displaying their distinction. Their celestial paths are thus revealed, and their astrological correspondences perfectly aligned. The altar’s directional banners establish the proper orientation for offerings, ever marking the luminaries’ bright positions. With horizontal vision, one may observe the warp and weft [of fate]; by introspection, one examines one’s conduct and concealment. Circling through the twelve palaces, the eleven luminaries are arrayed. Who would claim the Dao is distant or near, entirely unrelated? Yet virtue summons fortune and misfortune, and no movement goes unanswered. Moreover, the unerring cycles of rise and fall, prosperity and decline, all depend on the gains, losses, rebellions, and submissions [of celestial influence]. Since all rely on their generation and completion, how dare we forget our service?

Now, the sponsor [Name], having long frequented the oratory and greatly expounded the immortal teachings, looks up in hope of the spirits’ descent, brushing the dust of the mundane to descend. Respectfully presenting pure offerings, he displays his sincerity to receive their favor. Prostrating in reverence, he devoutly chants praises.

We, your servants, wholeheartedly take refuge in the Sun Palace’s Great Yang Emperor Lord and the Sun Palace’s divine immortals and spirit officials.

Your servants have heard: the Great Brilliance is the ancestor of all Yang, long illuminating and activating the use of all eyes. Tracing its origin in the qi and forms, it inwardly embraces the crow and outwardly rides the dragon. Distinguishing dawn and dusk, it emerges from Fusang and enters Xiliu. Ten thousand miles share its shadow; five colors unfold its auspices. Ever mindful of the sagely and divine, we should always revere it as elder brother; alas, the common people should serve it as their sovereign.

Now, the ritual master [Name], solemnly arousing his sincere heart, ventures to present these humble offerings. Reverently reciting the sacred scriptures, may they ascend to the cloudy heavens. Prostrating in reverence, he devoutly chants praises:

Gazing eastward to Fusang Palace,
I prostrate and pay homage to Yu Yi.
The Great Yang’s penetrating brilliance—
how vast, what thoughts arise?
I bow before the golden radiance,
awaiting the celestial majesty’s appearance.
The Yellow Flower and Jade Maiden
descend to the hall at this hour.

We, your servants, wholeheartedly take refuge in the Moon Palace’s Great Yin August Lord and the Moon Palace’s divine immortals and spirit officials.

Your servants have heard: the round orb adorns the heavens, its pure light tracing back to the sun. Sometimes white, sometimes black, it constantly observes the reins of the golden pivot; now waning, now waxing, how could it require the repair of the jade axe? The Pale Consort drifts ethereally, deeply hidden in her palace; the cinnabar cassia sways, jointly shading the hare and toad. Its qi is fundamentally the essence of Yin, perfectly manifesting the meaning of bright majesty; its image matches the virtue of the empress, all relying on its reflected illumination.

Now, the ritual sponsor [Name], solemnly purifying the altar, gazes up at the celestial heights. Selecting companions of the Orthodox Unity, he reverently intones the esoteric hymns. Prostrating in reverence, he devoutly chants praises:

Looking up to survey the eight directions,
only the moon nurtures Yin essence.
Within is the Great Plain August One,
her lady riding a green carriage.
Radiant splendor illumines the two poles,
its blended brightness shining on the Three Clarities.
Diligently seeking the supreme Dao,
the five colors descend to welcome.

We, your servants, wholeheartedly take refuge in the Eastern Wood Virtue’s Year Star, the Resplendent Star Lord, and the various spirit officials.

Your servants have heard: ever mindful of the Wood Virtue, all look up to the Year Star. It orders the four seasons and initiates spring, arraying the five affairs to form appearances. When its advance and retreat accord with measure, treachery and deceit cease; when it is red-yellow and sinks, the year’s grains will be abundant. The lands it visits prosper and can thus be at peace. When the four borders share its color, weapons are stilled—this is truly the first of the Five Phases. The fruit resembles coiled peaches; the beast crouches with bristling mane.

Now, the ritual practitioner [Name], gazing upon the tiger-belt’s image, exhausts reverence and solemnity. Chanting the hymn of the golden cord, he hopes to entreat their luminous response. Prostrating in reverence, he devoutly chants praises:

The Year Star rides the Wood Virtue,
revolving to shine in the eastern quarter.
Ascending the heavens, it moistens and nourishes,
its true color gleaming with august brightness.
Seeking blossoms, singing of vast expanse,
casting waters, chanting of the mushroom chambers.
Through the seasons, frequently praying,
one naturally obtains long-lasting blessings.

We, your servants, wholeheartedly take refuge in the Southern Fire Virtue’s Sparkling Deluder, the Enforcer Star Lord, and the various spirit officials.

Your servants have heard: occupying the stern position of the Enforcer, its name records the weight of the Sparkling Deluder. Entering the Supreme Subtlety, it receives restraint; accompanying the Flame Emperor, it partakes of separation. Examining the Six Ministers, it governs the Minister of Works and concurrently the Minister of War; assisting in myriad affairs, it inwardly administers governance and outwardly commands troops. Forests of swords and halberds are jointly grasped; bows and arrows are solemnly at the ready. Horses gallop past the dew; pennants chase the flying wind.

Now, the ritual practitioner [Name], reciting the true scriptures of the Three Caverns without the slightest negligence, gazing up at the hidden radiance of the Nine Heavens, dares not be irreverent. Prostrating in reverence, he devoutly chants praises:

Its points sharp as dragons and phoenixes,
its majestic light rebukes the ten directions.

Crimson *Gang* illumines the midnight,
Vermilion flames blaze along the three borders.
Crystal clarity seals the upright *qi*,
Swords and halberds radiate martial authority.
The *Chanqiang* responds to vanquish the frontier,
Comets and broom stars dare to advance first.

With devoted hearts, we take refuge and submit,
To the Western Metal Virtue, the Great White Star of Heavenly Brightness, and all spirit officials.
We have heard: measuring the golden balance to gaze upon the Great White, it presides over great ministers and is styled the Supreme Duke.
In righteousness, it knows no flaw;
in speech, it suffers no error.
It stores auspiciousness to bestow blessings—
the state, by its illumination, gradually prospers.
It suppresses violence and pacifies ferocity—
the army, only by emulating its pattern, attains felicity.
Ever attended by the music of the four strings,
it observes the five-virtue birds from the side.
Concentrating the pure essence of the vast *qi*,
its true visage stands resplendent in luminous majesty.

Now, the ritual practitioner [Name], driving his sincerity to the skies and the Milky Way, directs his thoughts to the void.
Daring to unfold the essential and wondrous scriptures,
he gazes up to the clear and bright mirror.
Prostrating in reverence, he devoutly chants praises:

The Great White ascends the limpid Han,
soaring frost gleams on pristine blossoms.
Lofty, it floats with auspicious radiance,
brilliant, it magnifies the Long-Lived Star.
Its blade, high, can repel invaders;
its hue, lustrous, often brings down armies.
Exhaustively it accords with the celestial reckoning,
uniting with the Dao and long life.

With devoted hearts, we take refuge and submit,
To the Northern Water Virtue, the Morning-Attending Star and the Dawn Star, and all spirit officials.
We have heard: humbly called the "Morning Star,"
its flourishing virtue is wisdom.
In small matters, it verifies punishments and laws;
in great matters, it examines yin and yang.
Distantly, it governs the barbarians,
often divining omens north of the Celestial Street.
Nearly, it equals the prime minister,
fittingly aiding the sovereign in the temple of state.
Its sequence belongs to severe congealment,
its *qi* clarifies the execution of punishments.
Standing as a wooden monkey holding an inkstone,
it wields a white scroll to draw forth the brush.

Now, the ritual practitioner [Name], stretching afar toward the pearl-strewn celestial path,
imagines the whirlwind chariot racing the simurgh.
Unfolding the jade tablets,
he declares the subtle mysteries of the cloud-script.
Prostrating in reverence, he devoutly chants praises:

Wondrous! It accords with the five *qi*,
faintly visible is the true gate.
Towering in the *Chou* position,
the *Ren* and *Gui* spirits of the profound.
Its divided radiance congeals in purity,
[...] hastens to thought and recollection.
With immortal songs and dances,
for a long while, it descends from the golden heavens.

With devoted hearts, we take refuge and submit,
To the Central Earth Virtue, the Earth-Guarding and Saturn Star, and all spirit officials.
We have heard: its position is centered in the middle,
its season corresponds to long summer.
Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are governed by trust—
only thus may success be hoped for.
Sight, hearing, speech, and appearance are rectified in the heart—
only thus may one avoid straying onto other paths.
Flourishing is the virtue of the Yellow Emperor—
it is the star of the Son of Heaven.
Girded with a sword and riding an ox,
staff and seal in hand,
wherever it resides, it brings down good fortune.

Now, the ritual practitioner [Name], reciting the azure talismanic scriptures,
far-flung on the cloud paths,
prays for the descent of the verdant tassels of authority,
to alight upon the dusty world.
Prostrating in reverence, he devoutly chants praises:

The high vault accords with *Wu* and *Ji*,
the hidden land rises through layered skies.
The Five Phases honor its obscure brilliance,
the Nine Lands behold its luminous dawn.
Gan and Shi discern its stations and retrogressions,
Taoist and shaman calculate its profound depths.
The perfected immortals bestow rain and dew—
prostrate on the earth, we reverently worship from afar.

With devoted hearts, we take refuge and submit,
To the Intercalary Beginning Star, the Net-Hidden Brilliance Star, and all spirit officials.
We have heard: truly, the star of the divine head,
it scatters the odes of "Yun Si."
Styled as noble authority and wielding power,
it follows the dark path to conceal its light.
Crowned with the majesty of the morning asterisms,
none dare insult it;
charged with the eclipses of the sun and moon,
who could say it is not so?
Its body rides a flying dragon,
its hand holds a precious sword.
Ever divining the new and dark moons,
it may dispel calamities and misfortunes.

Now, the ritual practitioner [Name], reverently upholding its majestic countenance,
dares to present humble offerings;
devoutly declaring the hidden verses,
may they ascend to be heard.
Prostrating in reverence, he devoutly chants praises:

The divine head follows the dark path,
mysteriously transcending to supreme numen.
Dark and bright, it awaits the new and full moons,
the yang power obscures the yin essence.
Loftily it guards the Yellow Banner Gate,
its spear and halberd gleam with frost and bells.
With devoted heart, we await abundant blessings—
prostrating, we recite the true scriptures.

With devoted hearts, we take refuge and submit,
To the Intercalary End, the Divine Tail, the Falling Star, and the *Jidu* Star, and all spirit officials.
We have heard: reckoning the intercalary end in the jade calendar,
imagining the hidden brilliance along the pearl-strewn path.
When its awe is unavailing,
it glares and wields the three-foot blade;
martial and mighty,
it rides the *neng* and stands above the nine heavens.
Truly, the authority of the divine head and divine tail,
jointly governs the transformations of cultivating virtue and executing punishments.
In anger, it shatters mountains and peaks,
monstrous dragons and serpents emerge.
If its thoughts are moved by sincerity,
it must turn misfortune into fortune.

Now, the ritual practitioner [Name], unfurling the cloud-phoenix’s brocade,
solemnly chants the numinous scriptures;
praying for the descent of the luminous celestial wheel,
to alight upon the ritual mat.
Prostrating in reverence, he devoutly chants praises:

Dwelling in darkness, it manifests yin virtue,
the leopard tail guards the star palace.
In wrath, it points to shatter mountains and peaks,
its authority, fierce, darkens the vast sky.
Dragons and serpents assume monstrous forms,
ominous changes suddenly obscure the gloom.
The master enjoys long life and joy—
the exorcism responds to reverent devotion.

With devoted hearts, we take refuge and submit,
To the Celestial One, the Purple *Qi* Dao Brilliance Star, and all spirit officials.
We have heard: the star of the Celestial One’s Dao,
it receives the surplus *qi* of the Wood Virtue.
Its crown rises in carved jade,
gazing up, its countenance is solemn and majestic;
its robes trail in flying rosy clouds,
from afar, one imagines the tinkling of its pendants.
Serene and detached,
it stands aloof and solitary.
At ease, it is composed and expansive—
it ensures the fulfillment of many leisurely pursuits;
auspicious and tranquil,
in facing peril, it naturally escapes from distress and danger.

Now, the ritual practitioner [Name], offering fragrant incense with reverence,
humbly exhausts his earnest sincerity.
Unfolding and declaring the flowery scriptures,
may they ascend to the layered skies.
Prostrating in reverence, he devoutly chants praises:

Bestowed authority by the Primordial Sovereign,
it contains essence and shines in the Purple Tenuity.
Alternating yin and yang at the extremity of their course,
the subtle mechanisms of the hidden and manifest are concealed.
Its jade chariot ascends the vast Han,
its golden bells pace the Dipper’s flight.
The four asterisms follow the celestial cycles,
the nine lands honor the heavenly might.

With devoted hearts, we take refuge and submit,
To the Great One, the Moon Comet, and the Broom Star, and all spirit officials.
We have heard: tracing the origin of the Great One’s star,
it is endowed with the *qi* of the night’s brilliance.

Though it traverses the dark paths yet remains measurable,
it dwells among the yin luminaries yet knows no fullness.
Solemn in cap and robes adorning the body,
awaiting the dawn’s audience in proper attire;
awe-inspiring with axes and halberds in hand,
as though wielding the authority of a great general.
When it transgresses, calamity arises,
yet when it moves with singular purpose, blessings descend.
Thus it is fitting to offer expiation and gratitude—
how could reverence ever be exhausted?

Now the officiant, so-and-so, presents these humble offerings,
his sincerity utterly poured forth,
as he looks up to entreat the swift chariot,
and devoutly recites the sacred verses.
Prostrating in reverence, he devoutly chants praises:

The Great Yin’s radiance weaves jade,
its essence and spirit nurtures all living beings.
Green osmanthus and yellow blossoms attend,
lush and misty, they guard the pure spirits.
Its comet head divides into wondrous forms,
its tail may secretly traverse the heavens.
From its station it dispenses fortune and misfortune—
through purification rites, it penetrates the profound and obscure.
