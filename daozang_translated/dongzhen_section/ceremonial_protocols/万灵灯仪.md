**Rite of the Myriad Spirits Lamp**
*Proceedings Conducted According to Ritual Form*

We humbly declare: Between Heaven and Earth, none is more numinous than humanity.
The Way of uprightness—none is more sagely than the spirits.
Able to be numinous, able to be sagely, they are worthy of reverence and veneration.
Some emerge from darkness into obscurity; some ascend on high or descend below.
All receive the virtue of molding and transformation—who knows the source of their workings?
Those who bestow blessings upon the people establish illustrious names and receive sacrifices;
Those who render service to the state are granted honorific titles and temples are erected.
Manifestly, this principle is no falsehood;
Profoundly, its words are difficult to recount.

We reverently recall [Name of Spirit], whose majestic form is resplendent, whose numinous power blazes forth.
Guardian of the state, savior of the people, benefactor of all beings.
Responsive to all prayers, unobstructed in every supplication.
Revered across the Four Seas, worshipped by all living things.
Everywhere, temples are built and shrines established; in every household, images are painted and forms depicted.
With devotion, we take refuge; with sincerity, we make offerings.

Today, [Name of Person] respectfully follows the ritual regulations, establishing the altar.
Purifying and preparing incense and lamps, we invite the divine chariot to descend.
We humbly pray that the great creation may bestow its radiance, and vast grace may descend in response.
Accept this earnest offering, and witness these auspicious signs of virtuous action.
We bow our heads in reverence, chanting with devotion:

*"We, your servants, with wholehearted devotion, take refuge in [Name of Spirit]."*

We humbly consider: The Way of the divine spirits is approachable only through virtue.
Fortune and misfortune arise from the people’s own deeds.
Though boundless compassion is responsive, the workings of creation are impartial.
Yet rewards and punishments are ever just, and transformation is never withheld.
If one awakens to faults and errors, may grace and protection be restored.

Today, [Name of Person] purifies heart and mind, turning toward the Dao and returning to the True.
Preparing the lamp rite with devotion, we take refuge in [Name of Spirit].
We humbly pray for compassion, kindness, and harmonious virtue.
Through scorching summers and freezing winters, may afflictions of harm and oppression be dispelled;
May we dwell in peace and joy, and receive the utmost blessings of good fortune.
We bow our heads in reverence, chanting with devotion:

*"The Way of the divine spirits, revered through the ages.
Majestic and awe-inspiring, no wish goes unfulfilled.
Assisting Heaven and Earth, transforming and soaring through the skies.
With wholehearted devotion, all prayers are answered.
Dispelling disaster, bestowing fortune, bringing peace to people and homes.
With one heart, we take refuge, wishing for eternal life."*

*"We, your servants, with wholehearted devotion, take refuge in [Name of Spirit]."*

We humbly consider: Assisting the numinous and upholding harmony, they receive sacrifices from all directions;
Establishing virtue and merit, they are enfeoffed as lords across ten thousand leagues.
Ever upholding loyalty to protect the state, ever executing punishments to instruct the people.
Majestically enthroned in the temple, solemnly revered in the ancestral hall.
May manifold blessings return, and their merits flourish.
Today, [Name of Person], indebted to your sheltering grace, looks up to your profound favor.
Purifying the dwelling, preparing incense and lamps with devotion, we take refuge in [Name of Spirit].
We humbly pray that your fame resound throughout the cosmos, spreading the benevolence of life and nurture;
That your might guard the state, expanding the radiant virtue of illumination.
Ever benevolently saving people without abandon, extending perfect kindness to all things without exception.
Protecting the state and family with prosperity, bringing supreme fortune to homes and courtyards.
We bow our heads in reverence, chanting with devotion:

*"Spreading merit and virtue, establishing transformations for the benefit of people.
In manifold expedient ways, majestically enthroned in the temple.
Guarding the people with the Dao, manifesting numinous power in governing the world.
Dispelling disaster, bestowing fortune, bringing peace to households and families."*

*"We, your servants, with wholehearted devotion, take refuge in [Name of Spirit]."*

We humbly consider: Dwelling in the Yellow Path, we turn our hearts in sincerity to take refuge;
The divine perceives our crimson devotion, radiating numinous light to illuminate.
Perfect kindness delights in life, extending life and delivering from distress;
Great compassion pities suffering, dispersing calamity and dissolving disaster.
Today, [Name of Person] reverently follows the Daoist canon, respectfully adhering to the immortal’s regulations.
Preparing the rite of incense and lamp offerings, displaying the majestic image of the divine sage, we take refuge in [Name of Spirit].
We humbly pray that the divine spirits universally bestow salvation, and Heaven’s virtue be evenly distributed.
Manifesting a heart of compassion and beneficence, granting the blessings of longevity and well-being.
We bow our heads in reverence, chanting with devotion:

*"Divine and sagely, martial and civil.
Merits resplendent, governing fate and truth.
Bringing fortune to the people, delivering from distress and misfortune.
Grace pervading homes and courtyards, virtue universally bestowed.
Solemnly reverent, like an echo responding to a valley.
Dispelling disaster, bestowing fortune, extending goodness to households."*

*"We, your servants, with wholehearted devotion, take refuge in [Name of Spirit]."*

We humbly consider: Enthroned on high in Heaven’s position, the divine heart responds with kindness.
Entrusted with authority over the earth below, commanded by Heaven above.
All prayers and supplications are surely granted response.
Looking up to the benevolence of sheltering and sustaining, we receive the vast gift of boundless grace.
Today, [Name of Person] prostrates with utmost reverence, taking refuge with wholehearted devotion.
Preparing pure offerings, arranging incense and lamps, we take refuge in [Name of Spirit].
We humbly pray that virtue pervade without limit, and grace extend without end.
Protecting and preserving great abundance, sheltering all living beings.
Securing blessings and longevity in flourishing prosperity, perpetuating the foundation of fortune.
We bow our heads in reverence, chanting with devotion:

*"Wise and upright, divine and sagely in majesty.
Assisting Heaven’s mandate above, vanquishing demons below.
Sheltering all beings, magnifying meritorious deeds.
All prayers answered, boundless virtue.
Dispelling disaster, bestowing fortune, grace extending to the people."*

*"We, your servants, with wholehearted devotion, take refuge in [Name of Spirit]."*

We humbly consider: Heaven gives birth to the myriad things, accomplishing the work of nurturing and growth;
The hundred affairs of human life all rely on the protection of the divine.
Every attainment of warmth and sustenance for the body arises from the molding of the many sages.
Deeply moved by profound grace, we should receive abundant blessings.
Thus, with reverent devotion, we invoke the august majesty of the sagely.
Humbly revealing our sincere hearts, we repay our long-held gratitude.
Today, [Name of Person] respectfully follows the ritual form, preparing incense and lamps, taking refuge in the host of spirits.
We humbly pray that divine power silently assist, and sagely grace widely bestow.
Through the four seasons, protect the household with purity and fortune;
Each year, bring peace and well-being to the old and young.

May official rank and longevity ever ascend, may the sprouts of goodness grow ever lush.
With bowed heads we take refuge, in reverent devotion we chant praises:
Most divine, most sagely, of virtue alone, of fragrance alone.
Above, you receive the Mandate of the Emperor; below, you guard and protect the myriad people.
Repelling evil and establishing right, you deliver and succor all living beings.
Through the four seasons, you follow the proper measures, thus ensuring timely abundance.
Dispelling calamities and bestowing blessings, within and without are made equal.
