The Tusi Lantern Rites proceed according to ritual form.

We have heard that when the Primordial Unity first divided and the Two Qi were apportioned, the Four Seasons were set in motion to achieve completion, and the Eight Directions were established to fix their positions. Above, the celestial mansions were arrayed in their courses; below, the terrestrial divisions were evenly distributed. All living beings depend upon the Great Potter’s Wheel, and no creature fails to draw upon the bounty of the Great Creation. Of all beings, humans are the most noble, for they occupy the central position. In all their dwellings and movements, they receive the gifts of Heaven and Earth.

Yet how grievous is our ignorance, for we constantly accumulate transgressions! Since abandoning cave-dwelling for nest-like abodes, constructing upper beams and lower eaves, we have dug wells and moved earth, recklessly violating the boundaries of the cardinal directions. We have raised brackets and soaring beams, repeatedly trespassing against taboos—sometimes choosing inauspicious days or months, or acting when the year is unpropitious. Our plans are not guided by tortoise-shell divination or milfoil, nor do we employ the words of shamans or mediums. Whether in the hidden or manifest realms, all such acts are fraught with error.

How much more so when it comes to the august deities of the Great Year and the Tusi prohibitions! They govern fortune and misfortune, regulate the boundaries of the directions, shift with the Six Jia cycles, and are governed by the revolutions of the Seven Stars. For all construction and dwelling, if one violates the boundaries of the directions, one relies upon the golden statutes of their teachings and the jade scrolls of their scriptures. Those who disregard them invite disaster and scatter blessings; those who observe them dissolve calamity and engender fortune.

Now, so-and-so, in constructing a dwelling, has acted untimely. In breaking ground and mobilizing labor, they have surely transgressed against the prohibitions; in raising foundations and clearing sites, they have surely offended the celestial stars. We have therefore chosen an auspicious day and reverently prepared pure offerings. The scriptures are unsealed, their cloud-seal characters recited to silently dissolve accumulated offenses; the ritual codes are chanted from their jade cases to summon the host of perfected beings. We humbly pray that they bring auspicious omens and assemble a hundred blessings at the gate; that they avert harm and disaster, eradicating a thousand misfortunes from the household. May bandits and thieves be dispelled, and all fire calamities extinguished.

With bowed heads, we take refuge and reverently offer praise.

We, your servants, wholeheartedly take refuge and submit to the Great Sage of the Eastern Zhen Palace and the Three Green Star Lords.

We have heard that Zhen is the chief of the Three Yangs, occupying the first position among the Four Seasons. In the Eight Trigrams, it takes precedence; among the Six Jia, it is the eldest.

Capable of initiating and unfolding, it commands the flourishing freshness of all things; through awe and vigilance, it urges the myriad people to cultivate introspection. It aids the workings of creation, manifesting the signs of generation. In all undertakings of construction or renovation, one must fear transgression.

Today, so-and-so, having prepared the solemn offerings of the jiao ritual, first offers gratitude to the perfected spirits. Carefully following the ritual codes, a star altar is established, complete with the rites of incense and floral offerings. With utmost sincerity, we take refuge and submit to the Great Sage of the Eastern Zhen Palace and the Three Green Star Lords.

We humbly pray that the perfected immortals descend with their blessings, and the host of sages extend their compassion, absolving and dissolving the faults of our transgressions, and graciously bestowing the blessings of auspicious omens. May the household be solemn and harmonious, with elders and youth in accord; may we pray for longevity to flourish ever more, and the foundation of fortune to be eternally secure.

With bowed heads, we take refuge and reverently offer praise:

The Great Dao shines brightly, profound and silent in its mysterious perfection.
The Five Dipper governs the central motion, the Five Phases give rise to all things.
The Northern Capital of myriad ghosts curtails human lifespan.
Yet we possess divine scriptures to transcend the world and endure forever.
We offer reverent worship, and the master’s spirit is invigorated.
Mysterious beyond mystery, towering is the Jade Capital.
Disasters and obstacles are dispelled, and the Dao’s qi endures forever.

We, your servants, wholeheartedly take refuge and submit to the Great Sage of the Southeastern Xun Palace and the Four Green Star Lords.

We have heard that Xun governs the issuing of commands, with Taiyi presiding over the spirits. Its position lies in the southeast, its palace in the fourth green. It oversees the seasonal order of all sprouting life, bringing purity and order to the myriad things. In all undertakings of construction or renovation, how could one avoid offense?

Now, so-and-so prepares the solemn jiao rites, first offering gratitude to the true spirits. Diligently following the liturgical forms, we establish the star altar and arrange the rites of incense, flowers, and offerings.

With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge and submit to the Southeastern Xun Palace and the Four Green Star Lords. We humbly pray that the divine radiance may illumine the obscure, and the torch of grace extend its brightness, beholding the sincerity of this day’s supplication and cleansing the transgressions of past constructions. May the harms of banditry and plunder forever cease within the household; may the anxieties of fire and conflagration never arise at door or window. May all kin within the gates universally receive pure blessings. In all undertakings, may there be unbroken auspiciousness.

We bow our heads in reverence and offer devout praise:
Great Sage of the Xun Palace, true sovereign of all offices,
Celestial Pivot and Taiyi, thunder and lightning spirits,
Who blow away calamities and suppress demonic forces,
Who enact the transformations of creation and nourish all living things.
May boundless blessings be bestowed, ever drawing near.
Without limit or peer, in the Golden Towers and Jade Capital,
May all disasters and obstacles be dispelled, and long life be attained.

We, your servants, wholeheartedly take refuge and submit to the Southern Li Palace and the Nine Purple Star Lords.

We humbly consider that in the transformation and completion of the world, there is no achievement unowed to the power of central rectitude. Raising its luminous beacon to illumine all directions, it fittingly inherits the image of enduring brightness. Enabling the mutual perception of the myriad things, it takes its position in the south. Corresponding to the center of the Two Modes, all are encompassed by its illuminating virtue. For all who dwell in houses, transgressions are manifold.

This day’s lamp-offering rite, disciple so-and-so, having prepared the solemn jiao sacrifice, first gives thanks to the Perfected Spirits. Reverently following the liturgical forms, we establish the altar precinct and prepare the incense, flowers, and offerings.

With wholehearted devotion we take refuge and submit to the Southern Li Palace and the Nine Purple Star Lords. We humbly pray that You deign to regard our sincere devotion, specially descend with Your numinous presence, dispel unforeseen calamities, and bestow boundless blessings. May the Nine Transverse Misfortunes never befall our kin, and may a thousand auspicious signs flourish at our gates. Fire and theft shall vanish in secret, while wealth and property increase. Bowing in reverence, we take refuge and devoutly intone:

O Radiant Brilliance, Great Sage, Nine Purple Star Lords,
Whose fiery light scatters through the world, whose talismanic spells universally arrive.
The Willow Star governs, the Wings and Chariot constellations preside.
The bing-ding registers pivot, the Fire virtue courses in secret.
Bestow grace, descend with fortune—may good blessings converge.
Supreme beyond all, in the Mystic Capital and Jade Metropolis,
May all disasters and obstacles be dispelled, and long life be attained.

We, your servants, wholeheartedly take refuge and submit to the Southwest Kun Palace and the Two Qi Star Lords. We humbly consider that in revolving the Kun Palace, the Earth’s Dao is magnified. Bearing Heaven’s model, it embraces all things and transforms them with light. Holding the Empress’s virtue, it bears all beings without limit; embodying the four seasons, it ceaselessly engenders life. Its palace corresponds to the Two Black Stars, its position lies in the southwest. In all construction and dwelling, how could there be no offenses?

We humbly pray that Your vast kindness and compassion universally extend as hidden virtue. May transgressions be erased from the Black Register, and blessings and longevity inscribed in the Vermilion Record. May all rough misfortunes be forever dispelled, and constant peace and prosperity be our lot. May a thousand Perfected Ones protect us, and ten thousand Sages sustain us.

Bowing in reverence, we take refuge and devoutly intone:
O Kun’s Primal Empress Virtue, whose vast descent knows no bounds,
Bearing Heaven’s Dao, manifesting virtue to transform and engender.
Naturally bestowing kindness, nurturing and sustaining the people,
Nothing is left undone, nothing is lost—thus is it beneficial and upright.
Driving away demonic spirits, granting fortune and peace.
Supreme beyond all, in the Great Lofty Jade Metropolis,
May all disasters and obstacles be dispelled, and long life be attained.

We, your servants, wholeheartedly take refuge and submit to the Western Dui Palace, Great Sage, and the Seven Red Star Lords. We humbly consider that the Seven Qi White Palace occupies the Metal Heaven’s Dui position. Solemnly governing the myriad things, it benefits the people and responds to the seasons; compassionately pitying all beings, it manifests its virtue and aids their transformation. Yet deluded mortals err in many ways, their offenses and faults abound. They rashly offend the numinous powers, unaware of how to repent and give thanks.

Pitying beings and cherishing life, may all sins and faults be forever erased; receiving blessings and receiving kindness, may abundant good fortune be conferred. May our kin be wholly at peace, and our gates know celebration.

Bowing in reverence, we take refuge and devoutly intone:
O Void and Luminous Tranquility, whose root is the Dao,
Supreme beyond all, Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord.
Within the true resides the numinous, the Mystic Canon’s Orthodox Spirits.
The vast net of the cosmos, each has its allotted part.

Great names from beginning to end, Supreme August Perfected Ones.

We, your servants, wholeheartedly take refuge and submit to the Northwest Qian Palace, Great Sage, and the Six White Star Lords. We humbly consider that Your merit pervades the Four Seas, Your righteousness presides over the Three Bonds. You emerge from the myriad things as their lord, appear among the host of dragons as their chief. It is precisely because You are firm, strong, centered, and upright that You can preserve and harmonize the Great Peace. Enabling all things to fulfill their lives, not a single person fails to receive Your transformation. Yet in dwelling beneath roofs, we fear offending the divine overseers. Without repenting our faults and confessing our transgressions, how could calamities be transformed into blessings?

We, your servants, wholeheartedly take refuge and submit to the Northern Kan Palace, Great Sage, and the One White Star Lord. We humbly consider that Your virtue moistens most broadly, all rivers take You as their source. Your nature contains the Three Powers, Your merit encompasses the Seven Virtues. As a hexagram, You are the destination of the myriad things; as the Dipper, You are the center around which all stars gather. Melting, You become water; congealing, You become ice. You wash away the darkness of the myriad things, cleansing the dust and filth of all beings. Yet in building and dwelling, we offend this direction. Repenting our faults with reverence, we transform calamities into blessings.

With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge and submit to the Northeastern Gen Palace Great Sage and the Eight White Star Lord. Humbly we consider: completing the end and beginning, You subtly enact the work of creation; now halting, now proceeding, You secretly manifest the functions of return and concealment. Governing the alternation of closure and openness, presiding over rise and decline, Your position follows the Three Yangs, and Your palace resides in the Eight White. As construction commences with earth and wood, we fear transgressing this direction. Truly we dread our faults and seek to pray for expiation.
