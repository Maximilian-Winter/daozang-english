**The Ritual of the Mysterious Emperor’s Lamps**
*Proceed according to the prescribed form.*

Your servant has heard: Responding to transformations without end, You ever dwell in the Golden Towers of the Mysterious Capital; Your original form remains unmoved, yet You were born in the royal palace of Pure Joy. Gathering the myriad things into One Body, dispersing the One Spirit into ten thousand realms. Your numinous power reaches the supremely subtle, Your Dao is complete and resplendent. Above, You open the Mystery of primordial chaos; below, You govern the constellations of Void and Danger. You uphold the earth’s foundations, truly nurturing the origin of heaven. Holding the workings of creation within the four seasons, unifying the web of power in a single qi. You purify the cosmos, pacify heaven and earth. Your virtue equals that of all heavens, Your merit matches the vast kalpas. The ten poles all depend on Your divine transformation; the nine empyreans all rely on Your true majesty. Your beneficence in aiding the multitudes is beyond words; Your merit pervades the ten thousand existences, yet You claim no achievement. Vast is Your sagely virtue, boundless is Your true wind. Having exhausted my mortal talents, I cannot adequately record Your power.

Now, I, [Name], have long revered Your sagely transformation and for ages been enveloped in Your true grace. I array incense and lamps, present wine and fruit, to convey radiance to the ever-luminous realm above the Forbidden Precincts, to extend brightness to the Palace of Heavenly Unity and True Felicity. I offer these precious lamps, beseeching Your great creation. For a moment, descend in Your chariot of flying clouds, and accept this humble libation. Secretly awaiting Your true light, I humbly pray for [missing character] and the southern barbarians. Overwhelmed with awe, I respectfully submit this memorial. Bowing my head in reverence, I sincerely praise and chant.

**Invocation of the Sacred Name**
We, Your servants and assembly, with wholehearted devotion, take refuge in the Perfected Warrior of the Northern Culmen, True Martial Sovereign of the Mysterious Heaven, August Emperor, and all divine immortals and spirit officials.

Your servant has heard: When the reckoning of fate is exhausted and the cycle of kalpas begins anew, lingering calamities remain unquelled; the old defilements still persist. Yet men cling to frivolity and fail to return to simplicity. The Six Heavens lie in wait for opportunities, the Nine Fiends seize their chances. First, they seek to harm the wicked; then, they strike the good. Resentment accumulates below, poison ascends above. Were it not for the compassion of the Great Dao, how could the Perfected of the Highest Realms bring deliverance? Moved by the suffering of the multitudes, grieved by the afflictions of all, the Primordial Beginning issued decrees, and the True Honored One received the mandate. This was no matter of a single morning or evening, but required seven days and seven nights of toil. Thus, humans and ghosts were separated, and Chong and Li established the cosmic order. Only Your virtue, O Spirit, endures through eternal kalpas.

Now, I, [Name], extol Your primordial merit and respectfully present pure offerings. I lift my gaze to Your lofty hearing and humbly express my reverent sincerity. With wholehearted devotion, I take refuge in the Perfected Warrior of the Northern Culmen, True Martial Sovereign of the Mysterious Heaven.

May it please You that the precious torches blaze with radiance, illuminating the region of the Mysterious Void above; may the orchid-oil flames continue, spreading to the Palace of Heavenly Unity. I pray that the immortal retinue will descend from afar, that the cloud chariots will journey below. Grant the petition for a hundred blessings, eradicate a thousand disasters. Inscribe life in the Southern Palace’s register, erase transgressions from the Northern Bureau’s ledger. Those who study the Dao shall awaken to the subtleties of the formless; those who cultivate the Real shall obtain the method of hidden radiance. May calamities not intrude, perverse spirits be scattered. May a hundred spirits guard and protect, ten thousand affairs be foreknown.

Bowing my head in reverence, I sincerely praise and chant:
Only You, Mysterious Origin, are honored among the multitudes of wonders.
Teaching without words, none know Your divinity.
Vast through countless kalpas, continuous as if ever-present.
Empty the heart, fill the belly; harmonize light and merge with dust.
You carved open creation, dispersed the simplicity of the primal chaos.
Six million years, eighty-two bodies.
Bending to preserve the crooked, straightening the wronged; filling the hollow, covering the new.
Supporting the declining, delivering from peril, reviving the dead, perfecting the living.
Your merit is unclaimed, Your virtue is steadfast.
May Your commands be manifest again, eternally guarding the northern heavens.
Above, punish the rebellious; below, extinguish demonic vapors.
Flying talismans, traveling registers, roaming through heaven and earth.
The generals of Jia and Geng assist and protect Your body.
Encompassing the six directions, universally shielding the myriad people.
May demonic ghosts be forever destroyed, the Dao-qi eternally endure.

We, Your servants and assembly, with wholehearted devotion, take refuge in the Perfected Warrior of the Northern Culmen, True Martial Sovereign of the Mysterious Heaven, August Emperor, and all divine immortals and spirit officials.

Your servant has heard: All stars encircle the North, revealing the supremacy of the Northern Culmen; all numbers begin with one, showing that the One is foremost. Without complete merit and perfect virtue, how could one be supreme and honored? Reverently regarding the Most True of the Mysterious Warrior, eternally enthroned in the great position of the North, You manifest ten titles. The Venerable Lord originally named You thus; dwelling among the heavens, True Martial subdued the sun in response to transformation. Your divine merit blazes, Your sagely majesty overflows. Desiring to praise the True Honored One, I have exhausted my sincerity.

Now, I, [Name], purify the courtyard and hall, fast and bathe body and mind. Reverently invoking the Mysterious Heaven, I humbly express my cinnabar sincerity. With wholehearted devotion, I take refuge in the Numinously Responsive, Blessing and Sagely True Lord.

May it please You that flowers bloom with auspicious omens, lamp wicks shed floating calamities. May the winding springs share their light, ending the karmic retributions of the Nine Dark Realms; may the Fengdu caverns be illuminated, absolving the transgressions of seven generations. May the recently departed and ancestors ascend to the Real and escape suffering. May households abound in filial piety and fraternal love, the world be filled with loyalty and goodness. May a thousand disasters disperse, ten thousand blessings converge.

Bowing my head in reverence, I sincerely praise and chant:
Northern Culmen, Mysterious Heaven, profound and distant Divine Lord.
Myriad thousands of transformations, Mysterious Warrior, Numinous Perfected.
Soaring through heaven, overturning earth, driving thunder, chasing clouds.
A retinue of millions, sweeping away demonic vapors.
Thunder Lords, Lightning Mothers, Jade Maidens, Generals.
Ghosts and spirits submit, dragons and tigers flee in hiding.
Your majesty guards the Five Peaks, all spirits obey.
Striking bells, beating drums, roaming through heaven and earth.
Seizing rebellious ghosts, crushing demonic hordes.
Expelling the perverse, aiding the upright, may the Dao-qi eternally endure.

We, Your servants and assembly, with wholehearted devotion, take refuge in the Perfected Warrior of the Northern Culmen, True Martial Sovereign of the Mysterious Heaven, August Emperor, and all divine immortals and spirit officials.

Your servant has heard: Minister of the Jade Void, incarnation of the Golden Towers, You abide in the realm of non-being, roam freely between the sagely and the mundane. Sometimes departing to rule the Ten Heavens, sometimes descending to guide a hundred kings.

Thus, eighty times You manifested as the Venerable Lord, and eighty-two titles You bore as the Dark Warrior. Though Your manifestations differ, Your fundamental essence remains unchanged. Embracing yin and nurturing yang, treading upon the tortoise and serpent to perfect wondrous function; presiding over the south while dwelling in the north, revealing the union of *li* and *kan* to manifest the celestial *qi* of *qian*. Your Dao and virtue defy comprehension, Your meritorious deeds elude record. Thus, on earth You govern the realm of Supreme Harmony, where none but the martial may prevail; in heaven You hold dominion over the *ren* and *gui* directions, where none but the Mysterious may be entrusted. Boundless are Your merits and virtues—impossible to extol in full.

Now, this humble one has swept the dusty abode and grandly arrayed the ritual mat, gazing reverently toward the void of *Xu* and *Wei*, and directing sincerity toward the Northern Culmen’s heavens. Humbly beseeching the descent of Your rainbow banner, may Your whirlwind chariot tarry but a moment to receive this offering of orchids and ferns, and witness this devotion of autumn sacrifices. Look down in mercy upon this crimson heart, and extend understanding to this plain petition. With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge in the Numinous and Responsive Protector, the True Lord.

May auspicious flames ignite the Golden Ram, and propitious radiance illumine the Bronze Duck. Below, may layered darkness be shattered; above, may the boundless be reached. Let the living and the dead alike receive grace, and the young and old be enveloped in favor. May homes shine with brilliance, and gates overflow with joy. Let calamities never arise nor misfortunes take form; may households grow ever richer and enterprises ever more prosperous. Bestow the Five Fortunes upon this body, and dispel the Six Adversities from this family. Such grace flows from the Supreme Sage—all depends on Your true blessing.

With bowed heads, we take refuge and reverently intone:
Transformed from the Great Yin, essence of water and fire,
Aligning with *Xu* and *Wei* above, the tortoise and serpent conjoined in form.
Encompassing the Six Directions, Your might subdues the ten thousand spirits.
No hidden realm escapes Your gaze, no wish remains unfulfilled.
From kalpa’s end to kalpa’s dawn, You sever and vanquish demonic forces.
Safeguarding all beings, bringing peace to households and nations.
When the cycle nears its end and the *jia* of decay is spent, perverse *qi* spreads abroad.
By the Emperor’s decree, the Sage firmly descends.
Proclaiming the true teaching, sweeping away evil and averting war.
Transforming and harmonizing the multitudes, aiding the restoration of the center.
Should any petty demon dare disturb the living,
All shall be annihilated, never to linger.
Banishing defilement and filth, may the Dao-*qi* endure forever.

Recite the scriptures, transform the offerings, and dedicate the merit.
The Lamp Rite of the Dark Emperor is now complete.
