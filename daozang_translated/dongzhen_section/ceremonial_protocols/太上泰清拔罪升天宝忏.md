# 太上泰清拔罪升天宝忏

*The Supreme Taiqing Precious Repentance for Expiating Sins and Ascending to Heaven*

At that time, the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning was seated upon a terrace of jade and precious lotus, towering myriad fathoms high within the Azure Heaven of the Beginning. Surrounded by an immeasurable assembly of sagely beings, he expounded the wondrous and subtle Dharma of Serene Quiescence and Primordial Embrace, radiating great luminosity that universally illumined the ten directions. In boundless worlds, boundless beings—whether with karmic affinity or none—all attained deliverance.

Then, the radiance beheld the great hells of Mount Fengdu in the northern darkness, where all multitudes of beings endured the sufferings of their sins. First, he saw the Hell of Boiling Cauldrons, where ox-headed jailers drove countless sinners into the seething vats. As they entered, their bodies dissolved into pulp. After an eon had passed, their names were called—whether man or woman—and they emerged at the sound, their limbs restored, their forms as before. Yet again, the jailers drove them into another hell, called the Iron Bed. Above, iron spikes pressed down; below, great fires raged. All the sinners were forced upon it, and in an instant, their flesh and bones were scorched to ashes. After another eon, the hell wardens called their names, and they arose once more, their bodies whole, their forms as before.

Again, the jailers drove them into another hell, called the City of Fire. Surrounding it were iron walls, and above, iron nets. Fierce smoke and poisonous flames blazed within, while bronze dogs and iron serpents spewed forth great fires. Suddenly, the gates opened, and flames surged forth. The sinners entered, and the gates closed behind them. Their flesh and bones were scorched to ashes as they were tossed about by the flames, leaping and striking the nets. Their cries shook heaven and earth, louder than thunder. After another eon, the hell gates opened again, and the wardens called their names, and they emerged whole once more.

Again, the jailers drove them into another hell, called the Hell of Sawing. The sinners were clamped between iron plates and sawed apart, blood flowing like rivers. From head to foot, they were split in two. After another eon, the wardens called their names, and they were rejoined as one.

Again, the jailers drove them beneath the pestles, where they were pounded into ten thousand pieces, or impaled on iron forks and ground into bloody pulp. After another eon, the wardens called their names, and they were restored as before.

Again, the jailers drove them into another hell, called the Hell of Knife Mountains and Sword Trees. There stood a great mountain, jagged and towering, its peaks all blades. Above grew a great tree, its branches, leaves, roots, and trunk all sword edges. When the sinners entered, the blade-tips pierced their feet, and the sword-edges sliced their bodies, their skin torn from their flesh, blood flowing like rivers. After enduring such torment for another eon, the wardens called their names, and they were restored whole once more.

As the jailers drove them onward, among the multitude there was one sinner who, in his past life, had studied the Daoist scriptures and thus knew something of past lives, karmic conditions, and retribution. Beholding this radiance, he silently thought: *Our suffering here is all due to the evil karma we created in former lives, which has brought this retribution. In the hells, through countless eons, we have languished in endless darkness. This light must be the great luminosity of the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning, come to deliver us.* Thereupon, he said to the others: "You all, in your past lives, accumulated heavy evil karma, ignorant of the scriptures, unaware of the true and real, believing in perverse and inverted views, deceiving both the seen and unseen. Thus, you suffer these torments with no means of escape. But now, by good fortune, you have beheld this light. Follow me in invoking the sacred name of the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning with utmost sincerity, and pray to escape this suffering."

All the sinners, hearing these words, gazed reverently upon the light and, as one, began to chant the name. The dark officials and hell wardens could not restrain them, and the ox-headed jailers transformed into benevolent beings. In an instant, the countless sinners’ shackles fell away of themselves. Riding the radiance, they departed and were reborn into the human realm.

The Most High said: "When living beings commit sins and die, they enter the northern Fengdu, where ghostly wardens examine their sinful souls, and their karmic adversaries are inescapable. The fierce flames of the Iron City, the dismemberment of the cauldrons, the roasting and burning, the Knife Mountains, the poisonous serpents, the grinding pestles, the freezing ice, the towering Sword Trees—even to hear of these torments is heartrending; how much worse to endure them oneself! In the endless darkness, like ants in a cycle, they dwell perpetually in hell. If they do not awaken to the causes of their suffering and repent in advance, their sins will deepen day by day, and they will surely fall into these torments. Through ten thousand eons and a thousand lives, how will they ever attain liberation? You must wholeheartedly pray and take refuge in the Perfected Ones above, vowing that in future lives you will not fall into these hells, that you may always hear the Daoist scriptures, awaken to the Daoist Dharma, behold the compassionate light, and suddenly attain deliverance."

With bowed heads and utmost sincerity, they paid homage and took refuge, invoking the sacred names of the Venerable Ones of the Taiqing, the Universal Compassion, and the Protectors of the World:

This disciple, so-and-so, relying on the true scriptures, reverently pays homage to the Supreme Perfected, earnestly praying with utmost sincerity, repenting wholeheartedly.

Consider the profound and singular truth: though mountains and valleys shift, it remains unchanged. Behold the vast sun and moon: though kalpas crumble, they scarcely pause. Yet within the illusory shadows of human life, who can escape the suffering of sinking and drowning?

Alas, worldly people, pursuing the trivial while forgetting the fundamental, chasing things and indulging emotions. Like ants clinging to a cauldron, they greedily cling to life; like moths fluttering into flame, they heedlessly rush to death. Thus, suffering arises from desire—without desire, there is no wheel of suffering. Sins are committed, and with sins come hells. All who create karmic offenses do so through the three actions and six senses, turning from truth to delusion, their deluded minds inverted, ever foolish and confused. Adrift in the cycle of birth and death, they sink into the realms of suffering.

Thus, the eyes gaze upon alluring beauty, the ears listen to frivolous laughter, the mouth recites unorthodox texts, the body dwells near wicked companions, and one indulges in the pleasures of hunting. They offend the Supreme Perfected, disparage sacred scriptures, disrespect rulers and teachers, neglect reverence for elders and parents, covet others’ wealth without satiety, kill sentient beings without pity. Their actions lack foundation, their minds are obscured, they consider only themselves and ignore others’ suffering, seize others’ possessions without thought of their hardship. In movement and stillness, they violate proper conduct, indulging the three actions—killing, stealing, and licentiousness—along with perverse desires, greed, anger, ignorance, cruelty, jealousy, deceitful speech, frivolous words, divisive talk, and vicious curses. For such sins, they shall fall into hell.

Now, before the sacred presence, I sincerely confess: the sins already committed, I dare not conceal; the evil deeds yet to come, I vow never to commit again.

Homage and refuge to the sacred titles of the universally compassionate protectors of the world:
Homage and refuge to the Heavenly Worthy Who Reveres Truth and Universally Shelters,
Homage and refuge to the Heavenly Worthy of Far-Reaching Wondrous Virtue,
Homage and refuge to the Heavenly Worthy Whose Meritorious Works Grace the World,
Homage and refuge to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Virtue,
Homage and refuge to the Heavenly Worthy Who Transforms and Guides with Goodness,
Homage and refuge to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Illumination,
Homage and refuge to the Heavenly Worthy Who Delivers the World from Suffering,
Homage and refuge to the Heavenly Worthy Who Dissolves Karmic Obstructions,
Homage and refuge to the Heavenly Worthy Who Perfects Blessings and Salvation,
Homage and refuge to the Heavenly Worthy Whose Light Embraces All Existence,
Homage and refuge to the Heavenly Worthy Who Cherishes All Beings,
Homage and refuge to the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves the World,
Homage and refuge to the Heavenly Worthy Who Embodies All Forms,
Homage and refuge to the Heavenly Worthy Who Encompasses and Sustains All,
Homage and refuge to the Heavenly Worthy Who Illuminates and Ends Suffering,
Homage and refuge to the Heavenly Worthy Who Unfolds Light and Rescues from Distress,
Homage and refuge to the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Emptiness and Limitlessness,
Homage and refuge to the Heavenly Worthy Who Nurtures the Origin and Nourishes Purity,
Homage and refuge to the Heavenly Worthy Who Eliminates Disasters and Dispels Wrath,
Homage and refuge to the Heavenly Worthy Who Responds to Cries and Bestows Blessings,
Homage and refuge to the Heavenly Worthy Who Bestows Boundless Grace and Kindness,
Homage and refuge to the Heavenly Worthy Whose Merits Naturally Transform,
Homage and refuge to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Great Kindness,
Homage and refuge to the Perfected One Who Delivers from Suffering and Saves from Calamity.

This disciple, so-and-so, relying on the true scriptures, reverently pays homage to the Supreme Perfected, earnestly praying with utmost sincerity, repenting wholeheartedly.

Consider the tiny flame that, if unchecked, can burn a great forest; the trickling stream that, if dammed, can float a mighty vessel. The sins of ordinary beings arise from the mind—if the source is not cut off, they can never be restrained. Habits formed through proximity become ingrained; a few daily transgressions accumulate into thousands. Beginning with a moment’s confusion in the heart, they grow into towering karmic offenses. They deceive heaven, cheat others, dismiss the consequences of good and evil as mere fables. Day by day, month by month, the ghostly ledgers secretly record their deeds. When sins overflow and resentment mounts, heaven’s courts erase their names, and hell’s registers add to their tally. For sins committed in the human realm, the unseen world does not forgive. Across ten thousand kalpas and a thousand lives, the debt remains to be repaid. Some fall as hungry ghosts, others become beasts, tormented by hunger, thirst, exhaustion, whips, and lashes. Without the saving power of the Supreme Perfected, they remain forever mired in suffering, with no hope of liberation. Even if blessed with fortunate causes, how can they repent?

This disciple, so-and-so, fortunate to be born in the human realm, has encountered this sacred cause, dwelling securely between heaven and earth, nurtured by their benevolent care. Yet, though I strive diligently and remain vigilant, I fear dwelling near evil neighbors, adopting wicked ways, hearing and seeing corrupt things, harboring impure thoughts, and acting without self-awareness—unwittingly accumulating sins. Ignorant of how to purge them, I cannot escape the calamity of falling. Thus, I now prostrate before the Dao, offering this repentance.

I humbly pray that past transgressions and deep-seated impurities may be washed away with a single bow; that reciting the sacred names and jade scriptures may instantly dispel worldly toils. May blessings descend from heaven, and good fortune be cultivated through human effort. May my body abide in purity and emptiness, my gates and thresholds filled with joy and peace.

For the living: may their years be long and flourishing, their blessings and fortune ever-increasing.
For the departed: may their spirits not wander, but roam freely on the clouded paths.
May the names of sins be erased from the black ledgers, and virtuous deeds inscribed on the cinnabar tablets.
For every prayer offered, may the ten thousand spirits grant their protection.

This disciple, so-and-so, bows with utmost sincerity and earnest supplication.

Thus concludes *The Precious Repentance of the Supreme Clarity for Deliverance from Sin and Ascension to Heaven*.
