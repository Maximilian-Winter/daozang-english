**The Rite of the Seven Luminaries of the Northern Dipper**
The ritual proceeds according to form.

We have heard that the Three Radiant Heavens, with the Nine Mornings as the origin of sacred *qi*, and the revolving governance of the Five Constants, with the Seven Governors as the primal axis, establish the pivot of the Supreme Ultimate and preside over the throat and tongue of the celestial vault. When they emit their splendor, the four seasons are harmonized; when they contain their luminance, the ten thousand norms are expanded. The thirty-six seasonal nodes gather at the Celestial Pass through kalpas unseen; the twelve hours distinguish the directions and earthly boundaries. Above the Purple Tenuity, they encircle the imperial throne in ever-heightening majesty; within the Yellow Path, they array the stellar courses without error. At times, they traverse obliquely beyond their stations, rectifying the epochs of yin-yang eclipses; at others, they summon the turning of the cosmic wheel, responding to the reckonings of the sun and moon’s shifts. Their numinous scrutiny reveals even the slightest detail; their profound penetration equalizes all categories. Thus, they enable the descent from death and ascent to life, illuminating the cinnabar script at the Southern Culmen; they prolong lifespan and augment destiny, inscribing the purple brush upon the Eastern Florescence. They illumine the households of accumulated goodness, perfectly aligning with the blessings of descending auspices.

Now, so-and-so, having long inherited wondrous karmic affinity and been born in an age of prosperity, bears the Emperor’s profound regard and, moved by the dust-bound heart, knows no recourse. Thus, they invite true companions to reverently initiate the immortal rites, kindling and illuminating the lamps of the Northern Dipper of the Most High for the prolongation of life. They unfurl the ritual jade at the pole-star altar and array the silver vessels to establish the Dipper. Purple mists waft ethereally, concealing the body beneath the canopied splendor; cinnabar flames blaze resplendently, welcoming the hidden radiance of the Curved Array. We humbly pray that blossoms of good fortune may unfold and the ashes of floating calamities fall away. May fortune and emolument increase in grandeur, emitting numinous light within the realm of longevity; may auspiciousness arrive and settle, suffusing the lofty vastness with ascending *qi*.

Bowing in reverence, we take refuge and sincerely intone:
*Numinous Lord Who Protects Life and Safeguards the Body.*

We, the assembled, with devoted hearts take refuge and commit our lives to the Great Sage of the Pivot Palace, the True August Sovereign of Greedy Wolf and Yang Brightness, and all the divine officials among the Dipper’s spirits.

We have heard that the flying mornings merge with the radiant heavens, and the Pivot Star holds authority over the kalpas’ gatherings; governing administration and correcting transgressions, Yang Brightness presides over the turning of the Jade Armillary. Above, they govern the transformations of the Nine Heavens; in the center, they oversee the numina of the Five Peaks; below, they regulate human relations and, peripherally, distinguish the ranks of all beings. They determine the mandate of life and death and scrutinize good and evil without partiality.

Now, so-and-so, reverently offering the sincerity of their heart, devoutly follows the wondrous model, arranging the stellar forms of the Dipper’s pole and preparing the ritual of incense, flowers, and lamps. With devoted hearts, we take refuge and commit our lives to the Great Sage of the Pivot Palace, the True August Sovereign of Greedy Wolf and Yang Brightness.

We humbly pray that their radiance may turn and illuminate, opening the precious mirror upon the numinous chart; that they may inscribe emolument and add years, engraving living names upon the jade tablets. May past sins be erased from former kalpas, and blessings shade future descendants.

Bowing in reverence, we take refuge and sincerely intone:
*Greedy Wolf prolongs life, the Four Numinous Ones return to the true.*
*Flowing light descends in reflection, penetratingly illumining the mysterious darkness.*
*The Seven Origins record destinies, firmly attending the numinous body.*
*The numinous and true record the registers, the Upper Origin guards the form.*
*May the hun and po be ever-preserved, ears and eyes undisturbed.*
*Drawing in protection to sustain life, the primordial true flows and circulates.*
*Preserving the true and natural, ascending to the Jade Capital.*

We, the assembled, with devoted hearts take refuge and commit our lives to the Great Sage of the Armillary Palace, the True August Sovereign of Giant Gate and Yin Essence, and all the divine officials among the Dipper’s spirits.

We have heard that the stars possess five gates, harmonizing with the Three Luminaries in distant radiance; the gates open in fourfold illumination, merging with the ten thousand *qi* to soar in splendor. They assess the promotions of the Celestial Treasury and govern the emolument and longevity of the myriad people. Escaping their profound scrutiny is impossible; truly, one relies upon their bright bridge.

Now, so-and-so, having prepared the jade altar and hastened their sincerity to the Golden Portal, arranges the stellar forms of the Dipper’s pole and prepares the ritual of incense, flowers, and lamps. With devoted hearts, we take refuge and commit our lives to the Great Sage of the Armillary Palace, the True August Sovereign of Giant Gate and Yin Essence.

We humbly pray that the body may pass through a thousand calamities and life be extended with a hundred blessings; that the heavens open the divine precincts and *qi* gather in the true origin. May names be inscribed upon the azure tablets, firmly securing long years upon the kalpa-stone; may goodness be recorded upon the cinnabar terrace, augmenting lifespan with the divine camphor.

Bowing in reverence, we take refuge and sincerely intone:
*Giant Gate averts calamity, the lofty and true numinous immortals.*
*Flowing light shines in radiance, protecting life and prolonging years.*
*The Seven Origins govern the registers, naturally attaining longevity.*
*Eradicating hardships and dangers, disasters and difficulties shift away.*
*The viscera and bowels become luminous, within and without free from transgression.*
*Light and motion merge with the radiant heavens, conjoining with the spirits.*
*Refining and transforming naturally, ascending to the Jade Capital.*

We, the assembled, with devoted hearts take refuge and commit our lives to the Great Sage of the Jade Armillary Palace, the True Person and August Sovereign of Emolument Existence, and all the divine officials among the Dipper’s spirits.

We have heard that resting beneath the canopied splendor, one merely knows the brightness of empty steps; abiding in the profound void, the marvels of the flying spirits remain unfathomable. Above the Eight Radiant Heavens and Nine Celestial Realms, the Dao accords with the pure registers to commune with the true; upon the heights of the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, the immortals are enrolled in the Yellow Terrace to receive their duties. How much more so for this lower realm, which truly looks up to their residual light.

Now, so-and-so, having purified themselves in fasting and covenant, establishes the ritual altar, arranging the stellar forms of the Dipper’s pole and preparing the ritual of incense, flowers, and lamps. With devoted hearts, we take refuge and commit our lives to the Great Sage of the Jade Armillary Palace, the True Person and August Sovereign of Emolument Existence.

We humbly pray that blessings may accord with distant years and fortune be bestowed through vast kalpas.

Three myriad myriad cycles of *jiazi*, earth enduring and heaven eternal; the twelve numinous gates, yang opening and yin closing. Serene in the white sun, savoring the harmony of the Unwrought. With bowed heads we take refuge and devoutly intone:

*Luxun* preserves life, exalted perfected ones disperse the spirits.
The upright *qi* gathers and subdues, attending and guarding with reverent hospitality.
The Seven Primes are enrolled above, conveying the primordial true.
Flowing forth in numinous clarity, they join the body with the cavernous ford.
Ever warding off inauspiciousness, inwardly guarding the form.
Erasing death to ascend life, unfolding with the spirits.
Preserving and advancing naturally, ascending to the Jade Dawn.

We, the assembled, with devoted hearts take refuge and commit our lives to the August Sovereign of the Power Palace, the True Person of Wenchu-Xuanming, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Dipper.

We have heard that the Star Lord dwells in profound obscurity, his position governing swift movement. Concealed and subtly radiant, he presides over the Three Palaces of the Northern Emperor; rewarding good and punishing excess, he commands the five *qi* of the Black Spirits. At times he annihilates sudden calamities, launching fiery armor across the Six Heavens; at others he severs the disloyal, illuminating crimson troops at the four borders. All that moves or grows owes its birth and completion to him.

Now, so-and-so, having purified the ritual altar and cleansed away dust and filth, arranges the stellar forms of the Dipper’s pole and prepares the ritual of incense, flowers, and lamps. With devoted hearts, we take refuge and commit our lives to the August Sovereign of the Power Palace, the True Person of Wenchu-Xuanming.

We humbly pray that sins be erased and transgressions removed, expunging names from the ghostly registers of the Nine Yin; that souls be bound and spirits restrained, obtaining the immortal formula of the Seven Returns. In action or stillness, may there be no fear of misfortune; in breath and sight, may there be the blessing of Great Harmony. Inheriting this supreme good, may wondrous fortune forever abound.

With bowed heads we take refuge and devoutly intone:
*Wenchu* augments destiny, flowing truth disperses support.
Light illumines the lower guard, unfolding with the form.
The Seven Primes cross the register, cavernously resplendent in the Mysterious Void.
They pacify and protect the spirit, safeguarding the body.
Awesome in their numinous power, the true spirits ride the floating.
Clear vision within and without, they unite with the spirits.
Preserving and refining naturally, ascending to the Jade Void.

We, the assembled, with devoted hearts take refuge and commit our lives to the August Sovereign of the Balance Palace, the True Person of Lianzhen-Danyuan, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Dipper.

We have heard that upon the misty heights of Kun Terrace, the seven gates intermingle their radiance; the concealed brilliance of the Golden Canopy subtly connects the Two Effulgences. The crimson tree bears fruits of white essence, while jade nectar congeals into the elixir of refinement. They review the records of the exalted perfected, governing the ledgers of ghosts and spirits; they oversee the rudiments of lesser learning, holding the key to life and death.

Now, so-and-so, having cleansed the spirit and adhered to the ritual canons, arranges the stellar forms of the Dipper’s pole and prepares the ritual of incense, flowers, and lamps. With devoted hearts, we take refuge and commit our lives to the August Sovereign of the Balance Palace, the True Person of Lianzhen-Danyuan.

We humbly pray that good fortune tread the Three Primes, erasing the three disasters in fleeting shadows; that the Five Movements be harmoniously met, planting the five blessings in deep roots. Whether in office or honor, may one fully inherit the pure and lofty lineage; whether traveling as a merchant or sitting as a trader, may all become prosperous and flourishing families.

With bowed heads we take refuge and devoutly intone:
*Lianzhen* dispels calamity, the Four Brightnesses open yang.
The exalted spirits disperse radiance, cavernously illuminating divine light.
The Seven Primes guard the register, the Controller of Destiny extends longevity.
The names are inscribed above, granting us enduring length.
Preserving and fortifying life, removing misfortune and banishing ill fortune.
The divine perfected manifest their power, flowing forth into the cavernous realm.
Achieving natural ascent, ascending to the Jade Hall.

We, the assembled, with devoted hearts take refuge and commit our lives to the August Sovereign of the Open Yang Palace, the True Person of Wuqu-Beiji, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Dipper.

We have heard that the Jade Tower gleams with splendor, concealing the flying radiance of the Celestial Pole’s star; the jade tablets shimmer with script, recording the revolving paths of the eternal Dao. They establish the steps of the Dharma Wheel, examining the diligence of supreme learning. Their flying brilliance illuminates the eight gates, leaving no darkness unlit; their cast radiance spans ten thousand miles, dissolving all barriers.

Now, so-and-so, having entrusted their traces to the dusty world while dwelling in the realm of the Dao, arranges the stellar forms of the Dipper’s pole and prepares the ritual of incense, flowers, and lamps. With devoted hearts, we take refuge and commit our lives to the August Sovereign of the Open Yang Palace, the True Person of Wuqu-Beiji.

We humbly pray that a single thought may unlock ascent, with the myriad spirits in harmonious attendance. Pouring the Silver River across the azure vastness, may distant years be inscribed; towering the Ministerial Peaks in the jade heavens, may one forever ascend to long life. May kinship be harmonious, descendants joyful.

With bowed heads we take refuge and devoutly intone:
*Wuqu* disperses misfortune, the mysterious radiance removes calamity.
The Three Lights shine brilliantly, the myriad *qi* flow unimpeded.
The Seven Primes inscribe the register, arrayed in the Dipper’s midst.
Examining the body and protecting life, may misfortune never befall.
The Supreme Sovereign preserves the true, destiny and emolument without end.
The upright Dao endures forever, uniting with the spirits without limit.
Preserving life naturally, ascending to the Jade Palace.

We, the assembled, with devoted hearts take refuge and commit our lives to the August Sovereign of the Jade Light Palace, the True Person of Pojun-Tianguan, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Dipper.

We have heard that as heaven revolves and earth turns, the Jade Light propels the cavernous wheel; as the Dipper establishes the stellar paths, the August Sovereign records the degrees of movement. His position is exalted among the Celestial Emperors, his might subdues the hordes of demons. Where the upright *qi* descends, the myriad things fulfill their nature of birth and completion; where his flying command points, the hundred evils have no form of escape.

Now, so-and-so, having cleansed the altar and spread sincerity, arranges the stellar forms of the Dipper’s pole and prepares the ritual of incense, flowers, and lamps. With devoted hearts, we take refuge and commit our lives to the August Sovereign of the Jade Light Palace, the True Person of Pojun-Tianguan.

We humbly pray that the Dao accords with the Cinnabar Terrace, the Southern Dipper inscribing the characters of long life; that sins vanish from the Dark Bureau, the Northern Capital proclaiming the names of the deathless. May the four seasons be well-ordered, fully partaking in the blessings of radiant splendor; may the entire household, in their conduct, all be touched by the winds of purity.

With bowed heads we take refuge and devoutly intone:
The Seven Primes shelter and protect, Heavenly Worthies.
*Pojun* aids the declining, conveying the mysterious true.
The Southern Controller preserves life, extending years and calming the body.
The Seven Primes govern the register, the numinous perfected honor names.
Arrayed among the exalted immortals, their blessings join and merge.
The cinnabar spirits disperse light, cavernously entering the Mysterious Obscurity.
Soaring through the heavens, they share the same age with the spirits.

The life-preserving power flows naturally, ascending to the Jade Court.
The Rite of the Seven Stars’ Lamps of the Northern Dipper is now complete.
