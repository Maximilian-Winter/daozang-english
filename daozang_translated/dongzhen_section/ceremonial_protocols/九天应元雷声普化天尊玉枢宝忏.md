*The Jade Pivot Precious Repentance of the Nine Heavens Responsive Primordial Thunder-Sound Universal Transformation Heavenly Worthy*

The ritual proceeds according to protocol.

Your servant, [Name] of such-and-such office, with reverence and awe, bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and again bows to address the assembly:

The Three Clarities Supreme Lords,
The Ten Poles Lofty Perfected,
The Most High Divine Empyrean,
The Eight Chambers August Lords,
The Nine Heavens Responsive Primordial Thunder-Sound Universal Transformation Heavenly Worthy,
The Ministers, Masters, Envoys, and Attendants of the Nine Heavens Responsive Primordial Palace,
All the Sagely Perfected of the Jade Empyrean’s Inner Courts,
The Eastern and Western Hua Terraces,
The Mysterious Halls and Wondrous Pavilions,
The Four Palaces and Six Courts,
The Bureaus and Offices in their array,
The Sagely Perfected and Immortals who assist in transformation and govern affairs,
The Envoys of the Nine Heavens Thunder Gate,
The Registrars of Correction and Record,
The Inspectors of Integrity,
The Directors of the Bureau of Excess Punishment,
The Directors of the Bureau of Accumulated Detention,
The Directors of the Bureau of Hidden Grievances,
The Directors of the Bureau of Karmic Retribution,
The Thunder Master, Radiant Barge True Lord,
The Unerring Judge and Registrars,
The Officials of the Thunder Department,
The True Spirits of the Three Realms—

May Your vast compassion turn and gaze upon us with luminous discernment.

Your devoted servant [Name] humbly presents this offering.

Hear now the Crimson Writs of Jade Characters—of old, the Primordial Beginning opened the Azure Vault to deliver humankind. The Phoenix Script and Dragon Charts—our Patriarch Master unfolded transformation from the Divine Empyrean. With reverence we recall the Great Sage of the Nine Heavens’ Pure Radiance, the incarnate transformation of the Jade Pure True King, whose forms pervade the Ten Directions and whose mind spans the Three Realms, who rescues sentient beings from suffering and lifts the submerged lands from their depths. Across the Thirty-Six Heavens, each heaven yields to His sovereign authority; through the Fifteen Hundred Kalpas, each kalpa unfolds His compassionate transformation. Should one but summon the slightest sincerity in invocation, all ten thousand vows shall accord with the heart.

We reflect anew upon ourselves—through kalpas uncounted, we have borne the dust of toil; through lives manifold, we have accumulated the filth of karma. Greed, wrath, delusion, and desire sprout in the space between standing and acting; killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, and deceit take shape in the instant of thought’s arising. Three transgressions of the body, four of the mouth—each fault of others becomes a hundred of our own, each fault of self a thousand. This leaky, illusory form harbors boundless offenses; the sea of right and wrong stretches wide, the mountain of self and others looms high. Without recourse to repentance and exaltation, how may we presume upon mercy and pardon?

With reverence we recall the Nine Heavens’ Responsive Primordial Thunder-Voice Universal Transformation Heavenly Worthy, Father of all beings, Master of the ten thousand spirits. Moved by those lost upon the path, He gazes with discernment upon those who turn toward Him, never forgetting the vows sworn in the Great Canopy, and graciously assents to the humble exaltation of this petty servant. From afar He halts His floating chariot in the empty sky, deigning to review our records. We, Your servants, presumptuously brave Your celestial majesty; our lowly hearts can scarcely contain their fervent longing. In utmost sincerity and deepest devotion, we direct our single-minded intent to prostrate in homage.

The Heavenly Worthy of Golden Countenance and Jade Form—
With devoted heart we take refuge and bow in homage.

Within the Sacred Precincts of Jade Purity, in the Celestial Palace of the Clear Subtlety Heaven, amid the Verdant Canopy and Misty Terrace, above the Forest of Purity and Clouds of Radiance, He manifests the semblance of conditioned existence, wielding the divine powers of the Unbounded. He expounds the true and mysterious, shattering the barriers of being and non-being, form and emptiness. He delivers and uplifts all classes of beings, erasing distinctions of wisdom and folly, high and low. His wondrous functioning eludes scrutiny; His numinous mechanism defies measure. Vast compassion, vast vows, Great Sage, Great Compassion, immeasurable deliverer of humankind—Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin.
With devoted heart we take refuge and bow in homage.

Within the True Precincts of Supreme Purity, in the Celestial Palace of the Yu-Yu Heaven, amid the Purple Tenuity Jade Terrace, above the Dark Capital and Jade Metropolis, He inherits the lineage of the Primordial Sovereign of Emptiness, surpassing the root and stock of the Western Na玉国. Within the grain of millet, the pearl, He draws forth the essence of the true and mysterious; in the Fragrant Grove Garden, He repeatedly discourses upon the secret essentials of the guideposts. His wondrous virtue defies thought; His divine powers elude discourse.

Great Compassion, Great Vows, Great Sage, Great Mercy, immeasurable deliverer of humankind—Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy.
With devoted heart we take refuge and bow in homage.

Within the Transcendent Precincts of Supreme Purity, in the Celestial Palace of the Great Crimson Heaven, high above the towering Golden Portals, far beyond the boundless layers of cloud and sky.
Born across measureless kalpas, He expounds the Dharma amid twelve thousand heavens. Five thousand secret words fuse the wondrous Dao of the Three Powers; eighty and more salvations gather the multitudes of the Six Destinies. His sagely virtue lofty and exalted, His mysterious efficacy vast and profound.

Great Compassion, Great Vows, Great Sage, Great Mercy, immeasurable deliverer of humankind—Incarnate Heavenly Worthy.
Let each devotee reverently believe and
with devoted heart take refuge in the Dao-Treasures of the Ten Directions, vowing that all beings may turn their minds toward them and offer sincere homage;
with devoted heart take refuge in the Sutra-Treasures of the Ten Directions, vowing that all beings may awaken understanding and receive, uphold, recite, and chant;
with devoted heart take refuge in the Master-Treasures of the Ten Directions, vowing that all beings may universally ascend the Dharma-bridge, free from all obstacles.

Let all within the ritual precinct each direct their minds and perform repentance according to the Dharma.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Transformation through the Thunderous Voice of the Nine Heavens was in the Jade Purity Heaven, together with the Celestial Sovereigns of the Ten Directions, assembled upon the seven-jeweled layered terrace of Jade Brahma. Then the Thunder Master, Elder Hao, stepped forth from the ranks and addressed Him, requesting the proclamation of the essentials of the Dao.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy sat upon the Nine-Phoenix Cinnabar Cloud Throne, raised the Golden Radiance Ruyi in His hand, and expounded the *Jade Pivot Precious Sutra*. At the hour of *si*, the Heavenly Worthy declared: "In future ages, should any among the multitude of beings hear My name and silently contemplate it in their minds, uttering the invocation 'Heavenly Worthy of Universal Transformation through the Thunderous Voice of the Nine Heavens'—whether once, thirty-five times, or a thousand or ten thousand times—I shall manifest My form. Throughout the Ten Directions and the Three Realms, I shall direct My mind, ensuring that all who invoke My name attain their desires. Across the Ten Directions and Three Realms, in all heavens and earths, the sun, moon, and stars, mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees, creatures that fly, crawl, or move, whether sentient or insentient, devas, dragons, ghosts, and spirits—should any hear the names of these beings and any fail to comply, I shall sever their heads, carve out their hearts, and reduce them to fine dust."

"Now, Your disciples, so-and-so and others, having received boundless grace across kalpas and been transformed across lifetimes, regret that our foolish and deluded natures have accumulated deep and weighty transgressions. How dare we not confess and repent? Seeking original forgiveness, we follow the sacred teachings, exerting ourselves in remorseful reflection, praying to extinguish sins and dispel transgressions, hoping to avert calamities and accumulate blessings. As the mind responds to thoughts, may we realize sageliness and attain perfection."

"We reverently beseech the Heavenly Worthy’s great compassion, the Heavenly Worthy’s great sagacity, Parent of all beings, Master of the myriad spirits, to bestow the radiance of Your grace. Witness our repentance, that our prayers may be answered and our communion realized."

"We, Your humble servants, reverently and devotedly prostrate in homage."

With devoted heart we take refuge and bow in homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Nine Heavens’ Responsive Origin Prefecture, Supreme Jade Purity King, who manifests His form to fill the Ten Directions and discourses upon the Dao seated upon the Nine Phoenixes. Above the thirty-six heavens, He peruses the precious scriptures and examines the jade texts. Fifteen hundred kalpas ago, He held the rank of Supreme Perfected and wielded the authority of Great Transformation. Raising the Golden Radiance Ruyi, He proclaims the *Jade Pivot Precious Sutra*. Those who defy Him are reduced to fine dust; His commands are swift as wind and fire. With a pure and tranquil mind, He fulfills His great vows; with the power of wisdom, He subdues all demons. He governs the Five Thunders and directs His mind across the Three Realms. Parent of all beings, Master of the myriad spirits, Great Sage, Great Mercy, Supreme Sovereign, Supreme Dao—Heavenly Worthy of Universal Transformation through the Thunderous Voice of the Nine Heavens.

Each bows once.

"We, the Dharma assembly, with devoted hearts take refuge in body, spirit, and life to the Divine Empyrean, offering sincerity to the Jade Prefecture. Again, we recall that Your disciples, so-and-so and others, of impure mortal substance, mere walking corpses of flesh, have accumulated sins as vast as mountains and seas across kalpas to this day. In mind, the three evil deeds: greed, hatred, and delusion. In body, the three evil deeds: killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct. In speech, the four evil deeds: frivolous speech, falsehood, divisive words, and harsh language. Whether arising in thought or moving in mind, we have indulged in unwholesome actions, offending Heaven and Earth, defiling the sun and moon, reviling wind and rain, exposing ourselves to the stars, betraying rulers and teachers, dishonoring parents, deceiving friends and acquaintances, scorning neighbors, harming living beings, wasting grain, using false weights and measures, deceiving sages, enforcing cruel laws, injuring birds and beasts, engaging in clandestine lust and theft, aiding the wicked, coveting honor, oppressing the weak, incurring the wrath of Heaven and Earth, provoking the jealousy of ghosts and the hatred of spirits."

"From this day forward, we repent and vow to take refuge forever. We humbly pray for the universal bestowal of compassion, the gracious granting of forgiveness, shelter and protection, and the gift of life and wholeness."

"We, Your humble servants, with devoted hearts prostrate and bow in gratitude to the Supreme Orthodox Three Treasures."

Each recites the *Nine Heavens’ Decree* and bows once.

With devoted heart we take refuge and bow in homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Transformation through the Thunderous Voice of the Nine Heavens—nine invocations, nine bows.

"We, the Dharma assembly, with devoted hearts take refuge in body, spirit, and life to the Divine Empyrean, offering sincerity to the Jade Prefecture. Again, we recall that Your disciples, so-and-so and others, of impure mortal substance, mere walking corpses of flesh, have accumulated sins as vast as mountains and seas across kalpas to this day. Perhaps we suffer from the inauspiciousness of the Five Phases, the malevolence of the Nine Luminaries, encountering years of punishment and conflict, fated clashes, or adversity in our undertakings, peril in our actions. Perhaps we are bedridden with chronic illness or oppressed by persistent afflictions. Perhaps we are afflicted by curses, oaths, or the consequences of unpaid debts. Transgressions from three lifetimes, enmities from different kalpas. Perhaps in our own cultivation, others have altered the site, offending the Nine Mounds’ Earth Sovereigns. Yellowing of the body, life-threatening perils, official talismans, malicious speech, the Sword Peak, Flying廉, the twenty-four positions, the twelve hundred spirits—any movement may provoke disputes and lawsuits."

"From this day forward, we repent and vow to take refuge forever. We humbly pray for the universal bestowal of compassion, the gracious granting of forgiveness, shelter and protection, and the gift of life and wholeness."

"We, Your humble servants, with devoted hearts prostrate and bow in gratitude to the Supreme Orthodox Three Treasures."

Having completed the recitation of the *Nine Heavens’ Edicts*, all bow once.

With devoted hearts, we take refuge and pay homage:
To the *Celestial Worthy of Universal Transformation Through the Thunder’s Resonance of the Nine Heavens’ Response to the Primordial*, nine prostrations with nine invocations.

We, the ritual assembly, with devoted hearts take refuge in body, refuge in spirit, refuge in life.
To the *Divine Empyrean*, we offer sincerity at the *Jade Treasury*.

We earnestly reflect upon us, Your disciples—beings of impure flesh, mere walking corpses—who, across kalpas until now, have amassed sins as vast as mountains and seas.
Perhaps we have provoked the wrath of celestial demons, earthly sprites, mountain spirits, or stone specters; the malevolent qi of the Five Phases; the demonic forces of the Three Realms; or the vengeful grudges of temple and shrine spirits.
Perhaps we have been afflicted by omens sent by crows or rats, curses passed by serpents or insects, or malicious acts like hurling bricks or tiles, casting shadows, or transmitting slanderous whispers.
Perhaps we have suffered from plagues and contagions, lingering consumptive ailments, vengeful qi of the dead, or ancestral tomb disputes.
Perhaps our marriages have been inauspicious, our descendants difficult to conceive, our water-and-land rites obstructed, or our karmic retribution inescapable.
Perhaps we have endured warfare and slaughter, floods and fires, banditry and pillage, or famine and displacement.

From this day forward, we repent and vow to take refuge forever.
We humbly pray for the universal bestowal of compassion, the gracious granting of forgiveness, shelter and protection, and the gift of life and wholeness.
We, Your humble servants, with devoted hearts prostrate and bow in gratitude to the *Supreme Orthodox Three Treasures*.

Having completed the recitation of the *Nine Heavens’ Edicts*, all bow once.

With devoted hearts, we take refuge and pay homage:
To the *Celestial Worthy of Universal Transformation Through the Thunder’s Resonance of the Nine Heavens’ Response to the Primordial*, nine prostrations with nine invocations.

We, the ritual assembly, with devoted hearts take refuge in body, refuge in spirit, refuge in life to the *Divine Empyrean*, offering sincerity at the *Jade Treasury*.

We earnestly reflect upon us, Your disciples—beings of impure flesh, mere walking corpses—who, across kalpas until now, have amassed sins as vast as mountains and seas.
Fortune and misfortune, longevity and premature death, honor and disgrace, prosperity and decay, wealth and emolument, fame and gain, right and wrong, self and others—
whether we seek immortality and the Dao, or strive to benefit beings and aid the people, each of our aspirations may be fulfilled, without thwarting our vows.
Yet we fear that in our transgressions, we have committed a thousand faults and ten thousand errors, their depth growing with each passing day, never once confessed.
Perhaps we have harmed sentient beings or injured living creatures.
Perhaps we have strayed from the Dao, violated precepts, or transgressed against the teachings.
Having been inscribed in the ledgers of life and death, our deeds are recorded in the annals of judgment.

From this day forward, we repent and vow to take refuge forever.
We humbly pray for the universal bestowal of compassion, the gracious granting of forgiveness, shelter and protection, and the gift of life and wholeness.
We, Your humble servants, with devoted hearts prostrate and bow in gratitude to the *Supreme Orthodox Three Treasures*.

*Step into the Void*—with each prostration, one bow.

With devoted hearts, we take refuge and pay homage:
To the *Celestial Worthy of Primordial Unity and Longevity of the Southern Culmen, Sovereign of the Celestial Mandate*;
To the *Celestial Worthy of Great Unity and Salvation from Suffering of the Azure Culmen of the Eastern Summit*;
To the *Celestial Worthy of the Nine Heavens’ Measureless Master, Deliverer of Lives from the Vermilion Mound*;
To the *Celestial Worthy of the Nine Heavens’ Thunder Ancestor, Remover of Disasters and Benefactor of Beings*;
To the *Celestial Worthy of the Great Heavenly Emperor of the Jade Green Palace, Guardian Against Kalpic Catastrophes*;
To the *Celestial Worthy of the Supreme Great Unity of the Six Heavens’ Abyssal Cavern, Subduer of Demons*;
To the *Celestial Worthy of the Heavenly Lord of the Six Waves, Bestower of Dharma and Nourisher of All*;
To the *Celestial Worthy of the Marvelous Transformation of the Nine Heavens’ Response, Inspector of Realized Beings and Protector of the Dao*;
To the *Celestial Worthy of the Divine Empyrean’s Jade Treasury, Judge of the Palace*;
To the *Celestial Worthy of the Jade Treasury’s Attendant, Prime Minister, and Right Minister*;
To the *True Lords of the Five Thunder Envoys’ Court*;
To the *Heavenly Lord Thunder Master, the Radiant Elder*;
To the *Heavenly Lord Thunder Count, the Azure Emperor*;
To the *Immortal Assembly of the Jade Pivot Chancery*;
To all the *Perfected and Immortals of the Nine Heavens’ Response to the Primordial Palace*;
To the *Generals of the Nine Heavens’ Thunder*;
To the *Generals of the Five Directions’ Thunder*;
To the *Generals of the Eight Directions’ Cloud and Thunder*;
To the *Envoys of the Nine Heavens’ Thunder Gate*;
To the *Envoys of the Five Directions’ Barbarian Thunder*;
To the *Marshal of the Thunder Department’s General Staff*;
To the *Officials of the Investigation and Auditing Bureau*;
To the *Ministers of the Detention and Arrest Bureau*;
To the *Ministers of the Dark Grievances and Retribution Bureau*;
To the *Judges of the Deception-Prevention Bureau and the Thunder Department’s Assembly of Officials*;
To all the *Perfected, Immortals, and Officials of the Thunder Department’s Various Bureaus*.

Having completed the rites, all kneel in long prostration to take refuge and repent.

We, the ritual assembly, with devoted hearts take refuge in body, refuge in spirit, refuge in life to the *Divine Empyrean*, offering sincerity at the *Jade Treasury*.
We reverently recall that the Nine Celestial Thrones govern the cosmos, and the various bureaus assist the transformations of the Primordial; the Three Realms drift and wander, while the ranked departments aid the sagely and luminous.
This is the pivot of thunder and lightning, the balance of power over beings and things.
We earnestly reflect upon ourselves—foolish beings dwelling in this fleeting world—
whether our greed, anger, and ignorance remain unsevered, or our thoughts, words, and deeds contradict one another, acting wantonly without shame or remorse.
Whether we commit transgressions through sight or hearing, or teach others through imagination and thought, we repent for each and every root of sin.

We humbly pray that the Nine Heavens’ penetrating gaze and the compassion of the assembled sages may bestow the boundless grace of the primordial net, the vast blessings of the Dharma rain.
May all sins, great or small, be washed away.
May the three karmic actions be purified, the six senses cleansed, blessings extended to all existence, and grace pervade the ten directions.

We, Your humble servants, with devoted hearts prostrate and bow in gratitude to the *Supreme Orthodox Three Treasures*.

*Ode to the Unsurpassed Jade Clarity King*—Upon Hearing the Sutra:
Having heard the sutra, may all beings deeply enter the Dharma gate and take refuge with faith and reverence.
Having heard the sutra, may all beings have their myriad sins eradicated and their virtuous sprouts grow.
Having heard the sutra, may all beings forever sever delusion and constantly return to the true Dao.

We have heard that the Dao encompasses heaven and earth, and humanity receives the yin and yang.
Our existence and sustenance depend upon compassion, and our transgressions may be absolved through reflection.
We, Your servants, have come to venerate the *Celestial Worthies*, extolling their sacred names.
With a single thought, we beseech the heavens and invoke their mandate; with our entire being, we prostrate in refuge.
We reverently hope that the *Celestial Worthies*, in their great sagacity and great compassion, will pardon the faults of a thousand lives and ten thousand kalpas, and bestow the true qi of the Five Thunders.
May our heartfelt prayers be answered, our aspirations fulfilled, our desires granted, and our exorcisms effective.
In this life and the next, may we always encounter the true cause.
May the sentient and insentient alike ascend to the shore of the Dao.

We prostrate and take refuge in the boundless Great Dao.

Thus concludes the *Jade Pivot Precious Repentance to the Celestial Worthy of Universal Transformation Through the Thunder’s Resonance of the Nine Heavens’ Response to the Primordial*.
