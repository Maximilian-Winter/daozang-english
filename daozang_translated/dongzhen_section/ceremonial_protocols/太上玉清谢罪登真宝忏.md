The Most High Jade Pure Repentance for Ascending to Perfection and Atoning for Sins

The Most High said: Should there be male or female officials of the Dharma-body, devoted to the Dao with sincerity, diligently cultivating and advancing in practice, and widely performing virtuous deeds in this present life—if they do not repent and eliminate past karmic transgressions, they shall never be ranked in the Jade Court nor have their names inscribed in the Golden Register. Though they may wish to deliver the deceased and save the living, how could this be possible?

Devout men and devout women, who follow and uphold my teachings, should diligently engage in repentance. Thus, they may deliver their nine generations of ancestors, bless their descendants, and through unwavering cultivation, attain the perfection of transcendence. Before my image, they should arrange offerings of incense, flowers, seasonal fruits, banners, and lamps, perform the rite of repentance, and reverently declare:

*"The repentant disciple [Name] takes refuge in the Three Pure Ones and the Ten Loftiest Perfected. From beginningless time until now, this disciple, ignorant of the true Dharma, believed in perverse views, indulged in desires, and committed manifold transgressions: failing to honor parents, disrespecting the Three Treasures, lacking reverence toward superiors, and lacking kindness toward subordinates; relying on the powerful to bully the weak, aiding the unworthy and suppressing the loyal and good; envying the worthy and resenting the capable, concealing virtue and spreading evil; manipulating weights and measures to alter fairness; misapplying medical treatments to harm lives; seeking bribes to cause miscarriages; worshipping heterodox spirits; hosting lavish feasts; slaughtering living beings and butchering swine and sheep. Acting solely for self-gratification, devoid of compassion, slandering the worthy and the sagely—now, this disciple openly confesses these sins without concealment. Humbly before the sacred presence, with sincere heart, this disciple repents, takes refuge, and pays homage to the sacred titles of the Jade Pure, the Universally Compassionate, and the Guardians of the World:"*

*I take refuge and pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Pure Sacred Realm,*

*"Disciple [Name], relying on the true teachings, reverently pays homage to the Most High Perfected, earnestly praying with utmost sincerity, and wholeheartedly repents. From beginningless time until now, through the three karmic actions, this disciple has committed the ten unwholesome deeds:"*

**The Karma of Killing:**
In this present life, men and women suffer shortened lifespans and live in solitude. Upon death, they fall into hell, enduring suffering for long kalpas. When their suffering ends, they are reborn only to be killed by others, trapped in an endless cycle of vengeance like ants in a wheel. Now, before the sacred presence, this disciple fully repents.

**The Karma of Theft:**
In this present life, one constantly suffers under legal punishments—torture, beatings, and lashings—living in poverty and destitution. Upon death, one falls into hell, enduring suffering for long kalpas. When the suffering ends, one is reborn as an animal, burdened with labor and towing loads to repay past debts. Only when the debt is repaid can one return, yet there is no escape from this cycle. Now, before the sacred presence, this disciple fully repents.

**The Karma of Lust:**
In this present life, one is despised and suffers frequent illnesses. Upon death, one falls into hell, enduring suffering for long kalpas. When the suffering ends, one is reborn as a sparrow, wagtail, pig, or dog. When the retribution is exhausted, one reenters the cycle without escape. Now, before the sacred presence, this disciple fully repents.

**The Karma of False Speech:**
In this present life, one is suspected and distrusted by others, suffers from lip sores and foul breath that repels people. Upon death, one falls into hell, enduring suffering for long kalpas. When the suffering ends, one is reborn as an ugly, poor, and lowly person, enduring cold, hunger, and thirst, or as a hungry ghost or animal. When the retribution is exhausted, one returns to hell, with no escape. Now, before the sacred presence, this disciple fully repents.

**The Karma of Frivolous Speech:**
In this present life, one is belittled by others, fails in endeavors, and lives in constant distress. Upon death, one enters hell, enduring suffering for long kalpas. When the suffering ends, one is reborn as a poor and lowly person, despised by many, or as an animal—mangy, scabrous, or a wild boar—hated by other beasts, bitten on sight, with no refuge. When the retribution is exhausted, one returns to hell, with no escape. Now, before the sacred presence, this disciple fully repents.

**The Karma of Divisive Speech:**
In this present life, one becomes a servant or slave, driven by others, and suffers misfortune that turns blessings into calamities. Upon death, one enters hell, enduring suffering for long kalpas. When the suffering ends, one is reborn as a two-headed snake or an earthworm. When the retribution is exhausted, one returns to hell, with no escape. Now, before the sacred presence, this disciple fully repents.

**The Karma of Harsh Speech:**
In this present life, one is insulted and humiliated by others, constantly suffering legal punishments.

Upon death, one enters hell, enduring suffering for long kalpas. When the suffering ends, one is reborn as a person of hideous appearance—with a bird’s beak and a dog’s face, saliva and breath both foul—so that others refuse to heed one’s words. When the retribution is exhausted, one returns to hell, with no escape. Now, before the sacred presence, this disciple fully repents.

**The Karma of Greed and Attachment:**
In this present life, one’s heart is filled with anguish and distress. Upon death, one falls into hell, enduring suffering for long kalpas. When the suffering ends, one is reborn as a hungry ghost, parched with hunger and thirst, never hearing the name of water or broth for endless kalpas. When the retribution is exhausted, one returns to hell, with no escape. Now, before the sacred presence, this disciple fully repents.

**The Karma of Anger and Resentment:**
In this present life, one is constantly filled with hatred, cruel and merciless. Upon death, one falls into hell, enduring suffering for long kalpas. When the suffering ends, one is reborn as a scorpion or snake, bearing venom and claws, hated by others, beaten on sight, with no place to hide. When the retribution is exhausted, one returns to hell, with no escape. Now, before the sacred presence, this disciple fully repents.

**The Karma of Ignorance and Delusion:**
In this present life, one is dull-witted, unable to discern good from evil, and scorned by others. Upon death, one falls into hell, enduring suffering for long kalpas. When the suffering ends, one is reborn as a beast of burden, pulling plows and bearing heavy loads, suffering hunger and thirst with no one to appeal to, growing old, emaciated, and weak, sold to the butcher’s block, meeting no good end. When the retribution is exhausted, one returns to hell, with no escape. Now, before the sacred presence, this disciple fully repents.

Now, with devotion and reverence, I bow in homage and invoke the sacred names of the universally compassionate and world-protecting honored ones:

This disciple, relying on the true scriptures, reverently worships the Most High Perfected Ones, earnestly praying with utmost sincerity, wholeheartedly repenting.

Of old, the wondrous workings defy description, embracing the Three Realms and called great;
The utmost spirit is unfathomable, discerning the hundred virtues and bestowing auspiciousness.
Moreover, when the crimson sincerity unfolds,
It meets the flourishing era and harmonizes with all.
Forever shall I serve with clarity,
Gathering abundant pure blessings.
Gazing upon the mushroom canopy as it arrives in ranks,
I open the sacred precinct and fill it with harmony.
May I, through purity and devotion,
Reverently uphold the subtle and profound.
I humbly implore that your precious gaze graciously descend,
And this sincerity be truly fulfilled.
Protect my household and bring forth good fortune,
Preserve my blessings and longevity in peace.
Basking in this propitious time,
I cherish the true shelter of your grace.
This disciple, with utmost sincerity, earnestly prays thus.

The *Precious Repentance for Atonement and Ascension to Perfection of the Most High Jade Purity* is now complete.
