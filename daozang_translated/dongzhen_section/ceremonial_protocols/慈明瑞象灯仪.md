*(Brief statement of intent follows.)*

---

Of old, the vast expanse flows and circulates—great skill remains impartial in the molding of clay;
All that is born, nurtured, and grown, every formed thing, belongs to the radiant Li.
Roots and fibers rely entirely upon lush growth; all species receive the nurturing warmth of the Dao.
The sage rides the wind to grasp its patterns; the noble one issues commands to govern the people.
In times of peace, they stand firm without shifting direction; in times of abundance, they reflect upon their faults and amend them.
Dare we lay bare our sincere devotion, humbly beseeching the imperial grace.
Following the rites, we kindle lamps, resplendent in the heavens, shining brightly.

On this day, as we establish the jiao rite for peace, we, the faithful, certain ones among us, having witnessed the warning of fiery destruction, turn in reverence to the office that metes out punishment.
We invite the stellar companions to the jade altar, gazing in hope toward the azure vault.
Reverently beneath the gleaming rays, we humbly present our petty concerns, praying that your essence may be moved, and that all may equally receive your vast blessings.
The assembly of the dharma raises its sincerity, extolling the sacred titles.

**Invoke the Southern Crimson Longevity Heavenly Worthy**
We, your servants, with devoted hearts, take refuge in the Southern Supreme Perfected and Most Sacred Fire Star Lord, Enforcer of the Law; the divine immortals of the Li Palace and all the spirit officials.
We have heard: The wondrous Dao stores its essence, concentrating the true qi of the Southern Crimson; the radiant Li nurtures all things, embodying the majestic power of the Flame Emperor.
We look up to the Southern Fire Virtue Fire Star Lord, Enforcer of the Law—your virtue aligns with the true Yang, your position surpasses all celestial bodies, you assist the boundless heavens, and your hidden merit nurtures living beings.
You secretly hold the power of creation and transformation, silently enacting the most impartial of transformations.
You circulate and reveal your signs, manifesting and withdrawing in due time.
All within your illumination dare not forget reverence and devotion.
On this day, as we establish the jiao rite and kindle lamps, we, the faithful, certain ones among us, dwell in the imperial domain, our lives bound to the celestial paths.
In our conduct, we fear negligence of heavenly constancy; in our movements, we stray from daily propriety.
Ever mindful of self-cultivation, we are truly filled with awe and vigilance.
Relying on the Daoist priest to convey our sincerity, we hope for the divine light to grant us respite.
To retreat and yield, we have heard the words of ancient precedent; to pardon faults and dissolve transgressions, deign to regard the prayers of this present time.
The multitudes of the people, sheltered by your protection, avert evil and dispel calamity; the myriad households, bathed in your illumination, receive your grace and bestow blessings.
From the noble to the young, all dwell in peace and harmony.
We bow our heads in reverence, offering sincere praise.

**Invoke the Fire Virtue Star Lord**
The radiant Li fosters virtue; the Fire Lodge stores its spirit.
Your divine majesty shines with serene splendor, and all species flourish.
A hundred spans of fiery lightning scorch and annihilate evil spirits.
You bind the Nine Fiends and crush demonic hordes.
Upholding your mighty commands, you steadfastly guard the celestial scriptures.
All living beings look up to you, forever preserving peace and tranquility.
We, your servants, with devoted hearts, take refuge in the Southern Crimson Heavenly True Sovereign of the Dao; the Great Fire Star-Splitting Wood Spirit Lord; the divine immortals of the Li Palace and all the spirit officials.
We have heard: In shaping form and spirit, the Fire Star governs the palace of radiant Li; in the intermingling warmth of all species, the Vermilion Brightness presides over the palace of jade pupils.
You dispense fortune and misfortune, discerning good and evil, with nothing left unilluminated by your light, and all sentient beings entrusted to your radiance.
To all who make entreaties, you equally grant response.
On this day, as we establish the jiao rite and offer lamps, we, the faithful, certain ones among us, reflect that, though sated with warmth and comfort, our transgressions are many.
We fear that as our fortune wanes, calamity will arise and misfortune befall.
Thus, we cry out to heaven to plead for life, seeking to atone for our faults and pray for grace.
Dispel and avert the disasters of Huilu; drive away and annihilate the malevolence of Bifang.
Together in the dust and sharing wells, may we forever escape the dread of scorched brows; beneath joined roofs and connected eaves, may we not suffer the disaster of raging wildfires.
May all people dwell in safety, and all things flourish in spring.
We bow our heads in reverence, offering sincere praise.

**Invoke the Crimson Sovereign True Lord of the Dao**
The Crimson Sovereign responds to the celestial signs, his virtue rooted in the Crimson Heaven.
He wields the law of heaven, exercising this authority.
He determines the seasons of withdrawal and manifestation, his flowing bells ever present.
His banners sweep across ten thousand li, exposing treachery and transgressions.
His oaths are firm, his reverence profound; the divine and true show compassion.
Ever mindful of our devotion, he bestows blessings without end.
We, your servants, with devoted hearts, take refuge in the Southern Enforcer of the Law, Longevity and Emolument Bestowing True Lord; the Six Celestial Officials of the Left; the divine immortals of the Fire Department and all the spirit officials.
We have heard: The Crimson Emperor holds the tally, riding the flourishing fortune of the Fire Balance; the August Heaven cherishes all things, coinciding with the universal prosperity of summer.
He rectifies the imperial mandate with resplendent glory, responding to the three qi of radiant Li.
All things appear before him, entering their season of lush fruition; the hundred flourishing lives thrive in the domain of Bing and Ding.
Looking up, we rely on your clarity; looking down, you regard our crimson devotion.
We offer these humble offerings, briefly halting the wind-borne steeds.
On this day, as we establish the jiao rite and offer lamps, we, the faithful, certain ones among us, reflect that, though we share in the blessings of the blue-green multitudes, we are pressed by the urgency of our endeavors.
How could we be without accumulated transgressions?
Knowing the peril of dryness, we dare cry out to heaven with our pleas.
We present this jiao rite, reverently welcoming your swift chariot, hoping for your gracious regard and the bestowal of peace and blessings.
Fire, ever rising, may it never bring the dread of sudden conflagration; humanity, dwelling within, may it forever harmonize with the great advent of fortune.
Nesting swallows rest securely; calamity is annihilated, and pond fish spared.
We bow our heads in reverence, offering sincere praise.

**Invoke the Enforcer of the Law, Longevity Bestowing True Lord**
The true qi of radiant Li, the Enforcer of the Law holds exclusive office.
You manifest warnings and admonitions, your daily scrutiny ever present.
Your divine majesty blazes fiercely, upright and impartial.
You bring misfortune to the excessive and fortune to the good; prosperity and adversity arise from you.
Our crimson sincerity ascends; we hope your compassion may be moved.
The efficacy of the Dao forever delivers from peril.
We, your servants, with devoted hearts, take refuge in the Fire Ancestor, Suiren the Emperor Lord; the Fire Minister, the Great Spirit Yanbo; the Six Celestial Officials of the Right; the divine immortals of the Li Palace and all the spirit officials.
We have heard: Fire, ever rising, spreads disaster when its nature is lost.
Yet the lofty heavens, moved by sincerity, must respond.
We sorrow for the multitudes of living beings, whose movements become entangled in the transgressions of attachment.
Thus, the ignorant among the lower ranks incur the punishments of the true office.
Vast conflagrations and raging flames melt jade and stone alike;
Scorched brows and charred heads move neighbors to mutual rescue.

By silent reliance on the divine protection, we have fortunately escaped the peril of smoldering furnaces. Thus, we reverently serve the true standards, humbly offering our gratitude. Today, as we establish this offering of lamps, we, the faithful devotees led by so-and-so, gather the multitude of those who have purified themselves in fasting and solemnity, turning our hearts to the origin of creation. Following the customary sincerity, we together seek blessings and grace. May the heat and affliction we pray for be cooled, dispelling the scorching and aridity. May our daily lives and generations to come find joy in coolness and purity. May the four borders know no fear of barking dogs, and the ten thousand households share the joy of crowing roosters. May all things be free from blight and pestilence, and disasters of wildfire and conflagration be averted. With bowed heads, we take refuge and reverently offer our praises.

We invoke the Fire Ancestor, Suiren the Emperor Lord:
His crimson *gang* manifests in symbol, the Fire Ancestor responds in truth.
He holds the mandate of heaven, and the people revere him with awe.
In the south is the *Ji* constellation, and all things flourish.
He seizes and drives away evil, his subtlety too profound to fathom.
Encompassing the myriad transformations, he wields the balance of mechanism.
The household and the state depend on him, forever securing peace and tranquility.

We, your servants, with devoted hearts, take refuge in the Blazing Minister, the True Fire Official Zhurong; the Fire Spirit Jun Hui Lu; the Generals of *Bing* and *Ding*; the Fire Bell Envoys; the divine immortals of the Li Palace and all the spirit officials.

We have heard: When the fire phase governs the heavens, the myriad things rely on its nurturing growth. When the yang spirit ascends the throne, the hundred flourishing beings are all shaped by its molding. Looking up, we observe the waxing and waning of the celestial patterns; looking down, we examine the prosperity and adversity of the earth. Its movements follow no constant measure, and none can perceive the signs of its expansion or contraction. Its numbers differ in celestial paths, and who can fathom the omens of its mechanisms? As we dwell within its illumination, how dare we forget our reverent devotion?

Today, as we establish this offering of lamps, we, the faithful devotees led by so-and-so, gathered before the altar, reflect: Our endowment of life is meager, and our nature is foolish and dull. We know only to pursue profit for our livelihood, unaware of examining ourselves to distance our sins. Thus, in this humble corner of the universe, we reveal our sincere hearts, looking up to implore your benevolent forgiveness, to redeem the faults of many lifetimes.

May households and dwellings harmonize, flourishing in utmost peace and harmony; may neighborhoods and neighbors be spared from unforeseen calamities that spread and endure. From morning’s cooking to evening’s hearth, may we forever heed the warning to "move the firewood" and avoid disaster; from night’s rest to dawn’s rise, may we ever abide in the steadfastness of bedrock. All look up to the impartial illumination, all equally receive the perfect governance of benevolence. With bowed heads, we take refuge and reverently offer praise.

We invoke the aid of the Fire Spirit, assistant to the True Lord of Flame, and look up in veneration to the Flame Emperor, whose mighty power shines resplendent. As the ancestral master of fire-making, he bestows blessings upon this people. His oversight is never distant, his warnings ever clear. He rewards only goodness and punishes only evil. With purified hearts, we offer sacrifice, that all may be granted peace and prosperity. Wherever his majestic power holds sway, none dare disobey. With devoted hearts, we take refuge in his command, praying to preserve health and tranquility.

**Chant of the Divine Incantation**
In the Vermilion Heaven of the South, the Red Spirit reigns supreme.
His mighty radiance and blazing flames transform all without partiality.
When the Fire Dragon takes flight, its brilliance shines boundless.
When the Fire Steed leaps forth, it spirals across ten thousand leagues.
When the Fire Hawk darts swift, its wings beat without hindrance.
When the Fire Bell resounds, its mighty sound echoes afar.
When the Fire Ladle is cast, smoke arises wherever it lands.
When the Fire Sword descends, all demons submit in reverence.
When the Fire Rope is raised, a hundred evils entangle themselves.
When the Fire Banner unfurls, commands are obeyed with solemnity.
When the Fire Staff points from afar, who dares seize authority?
His great virtue extends to all things, nurturing and preserving life.
Those who defy his decrees are corrected; scorching disasters blaze across the heavens.
He perceives goodness without fail, erasing transgressions and removing faults.

**Prayer of the Lamp Offering**
Once, by the Celestial Worthy’s decree, we received the command to guard the Southern Flame.
Now, by the Celestial Worthy’s salvation, we hear that goodness brings forth auspiciousness.
Where the Celestial Worthy’s incantation resides, the Fire Department brings no calamity.
Where the Celestial Worthy’s incantation resides, the fire’s might and radiance are stilled.
Where the Celestial Worthy’s incantation resides, fire spirits conceal themselves.
Where the Celestial Worthy’s incantation resides, all demons perish.
Where the Celestial Worthy’s incantation resides, disasters and misfortunes dissolve.
Where the Celestial Worthy’s incantation resides, wealth and possessions flourish.
Where the Celestial Worthy’s incantation resides, households abide in safety and well-being.

**Recitation of Scriptures and Proclamation of Petitions**
Humbly we consider: though we bend the chimney and move the firewood, how dare we neglect the teachings of admonition...

Bearing punishment and pleading for absolution, one must proceed with utmost sincerity in prayer.
As the beacon’s flames withdraw and smoke recedes, the people dwell in peace.
The lamp-offerings made heretofore bestow boundless merit and virtue.
Through reverent devotion, we now redirect these blessings upward in offering:
To the Fire Virtue of the South, the True Lord Mars Who Upholds the Law,
To the Cinnabar Heaven Fire Department and all divine immortals,
To the host of numinous officials—
By the power of this lamp-offering, we universally extend our reverence.

May they bestow upon us pure blessings, received in accord with our sincerity.
May the Fire God avert calamity, forever sparing us scorched heads and blistered brows;
May the Pyre Spirit dissolve karmic hindrances, ever granting each household secure repose.
May the scourge of conflagration never encroach, and the blessings of well-being fully arrive.
May the four classes of people delight in their livelihoods, and all things partake in felicity.
For this supreme cause, with wholehearted devotion we intone:
*Nan Dan Ji Shou Heavenly Worthy, Dispeller of Disasters and Dissolver of Misfortunes,*
*Whose merit and virtue are boundless and inconceivable.*

The Rite of the Lamp of Radiant Clarity concludes.
