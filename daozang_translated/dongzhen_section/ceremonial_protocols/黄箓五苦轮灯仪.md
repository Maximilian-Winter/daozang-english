**The Ritual According to Prescribed Form**
*Opening Invocation*

We humbly acknowledge the wondrous primordial Dao/Way, perfect in its circularity and fixed in its position.
From the gathering of light and clarity does the Heavenly Canopy (*Buying* 乾盖) arise,
While the congealing of heavy and turbid forms the Earthly Realm (*Kunyu* 坤舆).

Great is the Kunlun’s expanse, its summit as the hub of the Earthly Wheel.
All the celestial hosts converge like spokes upon it,
Circumnavigating the seas and flowing around.
It manifests the profound merit of bearing the heavy,
And establishes the vast virtue of nurturing life.

Further, there are the thirty-six lands of the earth,
And the nine layers of dense darkness.
The boundless void of the stubborn and empty,
Where wind-wheels and waters meet.
This is the realm of eternal night’s dim thoroughfare,
The shadowy domain of the dark.

It imprisons the moon’s essence in the abyss,
And seals the departed spirits in the black prison.
Layer upon layer of trials and torments,
Day after day without respite.
The sufferings of the Five Torments are complete—
How can one transcend them?

Sins accumulate, binding the soul to the Five Paths of Rebirth,
And transgressions deepen, condemning it to the Three Realms of Punishment.
Were it not for the boundless compassion of the Great Dao/Way,
It would be impossible to escape the torments of the dark.

Thus, the Primordial Sovereign established the teaching,
And the Most High descended the method.
He opened the Field of the Dao/Way’s Wheel for offering blessings,
And performed the Ritual of the Illuminating Lamp to dispel darkness.
He transferred the spirits across the Five Paths,
And lit the Nine Abysses.
He dispelled the obscuring gloom of the dark,
And scattered the auspicious light into the world of the living.
All departed souls were universally granted passage,
Swiftly ascending to the Pure Land,
Directly reaching the Realm of Non-Doing.

Now, the officiant [name] in accordance with the *Yunzhen Zhenyuan* (True Essentials of the Mysterious Treasure),
Lights the Radiant Wheel Lamp,
To supercede and liberate the departed spirit and form of [name],
And all tormented souls.

By this benevolent light, they escape the Five Paths of suffering,
Their six senses purified, all sins eradicated.
Together with the Nine Ancestors and Seven Mysteries,
The Four Generations and Six Paths,
All are liberated from darkness,
And enter the realm of radiant clarity.
The assembly of the Dao/Way returns to reliance,
On the boundless, supreme Dao/Way.

**First Invocation: The Path of Color-Binding Torment (Sèlèi Kǔxīn Mén)**
*To the Venerable Sound-Seeking Savior of the Five Paths, First Torment: The Gate of Torment Bound by Color*

Unrestrained by emotion and desire,
The heart is drowned by lascivious colors.
After death, one suffers the torments of the Knife Mountain Hell.

Now, the officiant [name] lights this divine lamp,
In memorial for the departed [name],
To benefit the Six Paths,
And attain rebirth in the living realm.

We humbly pray that the Nine Purity’s (*Jiǔqīng* 九清) compassionate gaze,
And the Three Luminaries’ (*Sānjǐng* 三景) returning light,
May descend with boundless mercy,
And alleviate the sufferings of the Knife Mountain Hell.

Alas, the torments of the Knife Mountain Hell!
Towering blades of snow rise cold in the void.
The Ox-Headed demons drive the condemned to climb,
Their flesh and bones scattered as they fall to the knives.

This is the torment of the heart bound by color,
Where every step on the Knife Mountain brings wounds.
We rely on the Venerable Savior of the Five Paths,
May the Great and Mighty Spirit shatter the blades.

*With the inconceivable merit and power.*

**Second Invocation: The Path of Love-Binding Torment (Àilèi Kǔshén Mén)**

May Your mighty light universally illuminate the Swords Forest,
And shatter the blades and frost of its torment.
The bitter pains of suffering now cease,
And the injured flesh and bones are fully restored.
The Wheel Lamp’s radiance guides them out of the dark prison,
Swiftly ascending to the realm of supreme bliss.

May You descend Your vast creation,
And rescue those lost in the dark paths.
Your flowing grace washes away the suffering of the Copper Pillar’s flames,
And extinguishes all its scorching torment.
All who suffer are liberated,
And past grievances are forever at rest.
The Wheel Lamp’s light guides them out of the dark prison,
And grants them liberation to be reborn in the Heavenly Realm.

And benefit the Six Paths,
Attaining rebirth in the living realm.

We humbly pray to the Venerable Lord of Non-Doing,
And the Natural Supreme Sage,
To rescue those lost in the dark paths,
And descend Your light to illuminate.

We sincerely repent the torments of the Boiling Cauldron Hell.
We pity the suffering of the dark realms,
Where boiling cauldrons surge like waves.
The tormented souls are seared and dissolved,
Their flesh and bones reduced to molten ruin.

We pray to the Supreme Sage of Non-Doing,
To widely open the Great Pardon,
And forgive all transgressions.
The Wheel Lamp’s radiance returns to illuminate the Nine Abysses,
And grants them swift passage to the realm of joyous ease.

And liberate the tormented souls from the Three Realms and Five Torments.

All cold waves of filth and turbid surges
Transform into pure, sweet dew.

This night, through Dao’s power, we earnestly cultivate—
The lamp’s light universally illuminates, breaking the depths below.

With immeasurable, inconceivable virtue/power,
The Wheel-Turning Holy Sovereign, Heavenly Venerable One,
Recites the sutra,
Expounds the teachings,
Chants the merits and dedicates them.

We humbly hear the Heavenly Venerable’s sacred power,
Rescuing and liberating all beings;
The Original Beginning’s sacred scriptures,
Able to dissolve all sins.

Previously, we lit the Five Torments and Three Realms Wheel of Light,
Recited true scriptures,
Offered horses and money in devotion—
Endless virtuous causes.

Presented by the officiant [name] to honor the Netherworld authorities,
We pray for their grace and command,
To elevate the departed spirit and form of [name],
To ascend to the Heavenly Realm above,
To benefit the lonely and bereaved below,
And together attain the realm of birth.

We humbly pray that lamp may illuminate lamp,
That prison may cease its torment,
To swiftly ascend to the Heaven above the heavens,
And not fall into the earth below the earth,
Relying on Dao’s power,
As the supreme auspicious connection.
Recite:

*"The Great Unity Savior of Suffering, Heavenly Venerable One,
With boundless, inconceivable virtue/power."*
