*One scroll.* Source text: *Zhengtong Daozang* (Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity), *Tongzhen* (Penetrating the True) Section, *Rites of Majesty* Category.

**Ritual Procedure as Prescribed**
*Humbly invoking the Most High Supreme Person of the Great Extremity and Great Void:*

The forms of yin and yang are complete,
The shapes of heaven and earth are divided,
Day and night differ in their nature,
And twilight and dawn are distinct in their brilliance.

Thus, the pure and refined *qi* ascends,
The Nine Heavens become the abode of the Immortal Ancestors;
The turbid and dense *qi* descends,
The Nine Earths become the domain of the spirits and ghosts.

Above the Nine Heavens, the yin *qi* dissolves entirely;
Below the Nine Earths, the yang light is forever severed.
Hence, the realm of darkness is without illumination.
At the time of daylight, it is still like dense fog;
When twilight falls, the gloom is even more profound.

In endless night, there is no way to dispel the murk,
And thus one may sink into the Northern Prison,
Suffer retribution in the *Tangdu* (Domain of the Dark),
Never behold the light,
And endure torment for countless *kalpas* (eons).

Therefore, the Celestial Sovereign, through the Dao’s boundless power,
Emits vast compassion,
Kindles the Nine Prison Lamps,
And rescues the suffering souls of the deep waters.

The radiant light descends to illuminate,
Dispelling the dim and murky paths of the Northern Prison;
The harmonious *qi* subtly penetrates,
Melting the frozen rivers of the cold hills.

The Three Officials and the Nine Departments of the Hundred and Twenty Tribunals,
The Five Emperors, the Examiners of Retribution, and the Great Heavenly Warrior-Messengers,
All together receive the sacred teachings and precepts,
And liberate the departed souls.

None fail to bow in reverence and take refuge,
Respectfully accepting the benevolent instruction.

Thus, the winds and thunders cease,
The *tongzhu* (copper pillars) of torment stand idle.
The flames of wind and sword,
Surrounding the lotus flower, bestow sweet *ganlu* (dew of grace);
The spears of ice and blades of frost,
Transform into *qi shu* (wondrous trees), becoming fragrant *jiǎnlín* (bamboo groves).

All follow the fruit of their deeds to be reborn,
And return to the Dao with enlightened hearts.
The Nine Earths and the dark prisons are emptied,
No wrongs remain unresolved;
Together ascending to the Celestial Path and the Immortal Way,
All attain the fruit of liberation.

Blessings extend to both the hidden and the manifest,
Joy reaches future generations.
The virtues and merits are immense and boundless,
Unsurpassed in measure.

Dare we rely on the assembly,
To jointly extol their glory.
