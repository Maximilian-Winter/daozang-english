### *The Plain Writ of the Golden Radiance*

The *Plain Writ of the Golden Radiance* states: Those who desire long life and transcendence as divine immortals should master the Dao of embryonic breathing, for it is the treasure of seeking life. It restores youth, reverses white hair, and extends life without aging. Regularly, after midnight when the generative *qi* arises, sit upright facing east, close the eyes, and hold the breath until it reaches its limit. By practicing this consistently, the hundred illnesses and myriad harms will not afflict you, and no malevolent spirits or demons will dare to test you.

At dawn, when the sun first rises, face it directly and gently inhale its essence through the nose, ceasing after a short while. This bestows the complexion of a youth, a radiant countenance, and forever banishes wrinkles and blemishes. Ingesting *qi* eliminates hunger; ingesting the sun’s essence prevents aging. Embryonic breathing through held breath grants boundless longevity. Constantly visualize the twenty-four spirits within yourself to remain free of illness. If afflicted by sickness, silently invoke their names and pray—the ailment will vanish in an instant.

The *Writ of the Golden Radiance* states: Always visualize a crimson *qi* emanating from your heart, ascending through your throat. With intention, guide it to the Mud Pill Palace (the upper *dantian*). Persist in this practice without cease, and the Three Corpses will depart, granting long life and enduring vision. The Director of Destinies will inscribe your name in the Purple Register of the Undying.

If you wish to ascend the Dragon and enter the Dipper, regularly ingest the Nine Terraces Talisman. Then you will meet the Great One. Without ingesting the Nine Terraces Talisman, the gates of heaven will remain closed. Upon ingesting it, the myriad spirits and celestial immortals will descend to your chamber. In broad daylight, you will ascend to the Palace of the Supreme Pervasive, where you may command all immortal officials.

The Heavenly Thearch of the Supreme Pervasive declares: The eighteen talismans of the Stone Scenery of the Upper Clarity, along with the *Summons of the Soul* by the Heavenly Thearch, are secret texts of the Upper Clarity. They originally emerged from the Jade Pavilion of the Upper Clarity, later sealed within the Golden Hall and Jade Gates of Kunlun Mountain, opened but once in ten thousand years. Formerly, the Heavenly Thearch of the Supreme Pervasive received them from the Immortal Elder of the Dark Garden, thereby attaining flight to the Upper Clarity and being granted the rank of Heavenly Thearch. With free will, he pays homage at the Golden Gates and rides cloud-dragons at his pleasure.

Those who seek the Dao without obtaining these talismans will never succeed. They will labor in vain among mountains and marshes, inevitably failing the demonic trials. To ingest them, inscribe the talismans with orpiment ink—never with cinnabar. Write them on paper and burn to ingest, or carve them on a one-foot-two-inch paulownia wood tablet, with characters both inside and out. This ensures swift ascent to heaven. Do not recklessly divulge them; transmit only to the worthy.

By reverently practicing these methods, you may command all spirits, summon yin and call forth yang, and achieve whatever you desire instantly. Those who leak these secrets or violate the covenants will bring calamity upon seven generations. How can one not be cautious? How can one not be cautious?

Ingest the talisman of the Eastern Marchmount, and the divine writ will unfold, revealing the Upper Clarity. Cloud chariots will welcome you, and you will foreknow all matters. The method is the same for the Five Marchmounts, beginning with the Eastern Marchmount and proceeding in order. Also, inscribe the eighteen *Yejie* talisman seals on purple silk. First, store them in a bamboo tube, then present them at a famous mountain during the first month. After the presentation, conceal them among large rocks where no one may find them. Seal the tube with seven *sheng* of yellow earth mixed into mud.

Upon completion, pray thus:
*"I wear and bear the Yellow Writ of the Stone Scenery of the Supreme Pervasive. Now, I reverently transcribe one copy to return to the Immortal Lord, that I may ascend the void, ride clouds without reins, and be attended by divine immortals, joining the company of the perfected."*
Conclude the prayer.

Follow this method for all Five Marchmounts, and the divine writs of the immortal stone chambers on the sacred mountains will be revealed to you. Divine mushrooms and rare herbs will appear of their own accord.

If you wish to create the seal of the Golden Radiance, inscribe its complete text. Ingest both the seal and its inscription by burning and swallowing them, and you will suddenly commune with the spirits. To ingest the seal, write it in ink and swallow one impression at a time, following a set progression. Use the seal to stamp talismans, and they will be efficacious. Ingest the talismans regularly before meals. Upon their entry, you may experience cold and heat, but your vision will grow sharper. Soon, a white-robed jade youth or a scholar in proper attire may appear before you—do not startle, for they will vanish of their own accord.

After thirty days of visualization, your body will naturally become light. Superior practitioners may ascend into the pure void, roaming and feasting in the Upper Clarity. Middling practitioners may lift their forms a hundred *zhang*, and lesser practitioners ten *zhang*. Upon ingesting all eighteen talismans, you will see the attendants in seal-embroidered robes—proof of your sincerity. The jade youths and jade maidens guarding the talismans will reveal their true forms to you.

Before ingesting the talismans, first abstain from the five pungent plants, meat, blood, and sexual activity. Avoid defilement and impurity. After a hundred days, seclude yourself in a quiet chamber, avoiding contact with worldly people or noisy gatherings. Only then will the Dao be accomplished.

Those who ingest the Stone Scenery and Golden Radiance talismans must especially refrain from defilement, sloth, and evil conduct. Cultivate the body, focus the mind on the Dao, and prioritize purification and concentration. By practicing this Dao, you may ascend as an immortal, befriend celestial perfected beings, and commune with the host of immortals. You will be able to summon spirits, attract divine elixirs and magic mushrooms, and conjure traveling kitchens, dragon chariots, feathered canopies, jade youths, jade maidens, and all spirits under heaven to serve you. There will be nothing you do not know and nothing you cannot obtain.

The Heaven-Earth Separation Talisman can repel armies for a thousand miles. Those who plot against you will suffer misfortune, and any who raise weapons against you will turn them upon themselves. The talisman may be sealed, burned and ingested, or placed within a bamboo staff. Use a one-foot-two-inch tube, inscribe the talisman on silk nine *cun* long and four *cun* wide, place it in the tube, and bind it to your arm—left for men, right for women.

Guard this well, guard this well—none but those whose names are inscribed upon the Jade Tablet of the Great Ultimate may encounter it. Those who bear it shall wander freely through the four directions, suppressing all calamities. Mortals who wear it shall enjoy blessings and long life, their descendants flourishing in abundance. Daoists who obtain it shall ascend to the Upper Clarity. Those who possess it shall receive fortune; those who cultivate it shall rise into the void.

If you wish to ascend and enter the Great Subtlety, consume the Supreme Numinous Talisman, and you shall enter the midst of the Primordial Sovereign of the Great One. If you wish to pay homage to the Heavenly Thearch and ascend to the Purple Palace, consume the Supreme Lord’s Numinous Talisman. If you wish to behold the Supreme Lord of the Dao, consume the Hall of Light Talisman. If you wish to enter the Five Marchmounts, causing their mountain spirits and all immortals to come and attend you, consume each marchmount’s respective talisman. If you wish to enter the Primordial Pass, consume the Primordial Forerunner Talisman, and you shall behold the Lord of the Primordial Forerunner. If you wish to follow the immortal officials and behold the one hundred twenty spirits, consume the Talisman of the Myriad Spirits, and you shall behold the lords of all immortals. If you wish to descend and behold the Nine Divine Persons of the Great Clarity, consume the Talisman of the Heavenly Gate, and you shall behold the Lord of the Great Clarity. If you wish to ascend to heaven or enter the abyss, to soar through the Eight Simplicities, to roam and conceal yourself at will, consume the Separate Talisman of the Heavenly Thearch of the Great Subtlety and the Stone Radiance—then the spirits of heaven and earth shall not detain you.

The Heavenly Thearch of the Great Subtlety states: The Talisman of the Heavenly Gate is the fourth among those transmitted above. If you cultivate and consume it, first burn incense to your left and right. Jade lads and jade maidens, forty each, shall attend you. Those who possess the scripture must revere and honor it, wrapping it in a case of yellow brocade. Do not allow the jade lads and maidens to reproach your transgressions—how could you not be diligent?

Those who receive this text shall use forty feet of yellow-ground brocade and seven taels of gold. At the time of transmission, master and disciple shall fast together for seven days—or four days—before performing the covenant and declaration. If you bear this text or meditate upon consuming it, it shall be the great invocation of the Golden Radiance and Stone Radiance.

The *Scripture of Golden Radiance* states: Each time you meditate upon consuming or bearing the talisman, knock your teeth thirty-six times, swallow saliva thirty-six times, and with eyes closed, softly invoke:
*"Heavenly Thearch of the Great Subtlety, numinous honor of the Purple Palace, mysterious emptiness and great perfection, forerunners of the Thearch, whose Dao is vast and great, whose transformations are spontaneous, whose true principles flow unseen, spreading without interruption—essence enters the Hall of Light, protecting the embryo and augmenting the hun-soul. The Crimson Mountain opens again, welcoming the numinous origin. To the left, I gather the radiance of the sun; to the right, I pluck the root of the moon. A thousand fathoms of flowing fire, golden gauze and azure skirts, a sash bearing the records of heaven, a headscarf and flowered crown. Grant that I ascend the void, soaring to the Upper Clarity. I beseech ascension as an immortal, to command the myriad spirits. The numina of heaven and earth shall dare not disobey; all directions shall converge, and fortune and virtue shall be as mountains. The resonance of jade shall echo afar, and evil demons shall vanish like smoke."*

The Talisman of the Heavenly Thearch for Summoning the Hun-Soul: At the hour of the cock’s crow, face north, burn incense, and swallow it to gather the hun-soul. After consuming the talisman, softly invoke:
*"Radiant brilliance of the Great Thearch, harmonizing and gathering the court of the hun-soul. The three hun and seven po shall guard and stabilize this original form. Spirit at peace, body whole, I attain long life. A hundred illnesses disperse, the five viscera find peace. Let me ascend as a flying immortal, driving a cloud chariot. The Red Child shall support me, and I shall obtain the essence of qi. A purple canopy shall cover me, and spirit attendants shall follow."*

Conclude by knocking your teeth three times and swallowing saliva three times. After consuming the talisman, always meditate upon and invoke this method to assemble the hundred spirits—this is the secret for never losing them. Guard and practice it well.

The Perfected Consort of the Nine Flowers states: The *Yellow Writ of the Great Subtlety* originally comprised eight scrolls. In former times, a true person on Red City Mountain transmitted the *True Writ of the Eight Registers Worn at the Girdle* to Xu Yuanyou. What Your Excellency now possesses is that very text. The reason you have not yet soared to the Upper Clarity, riding a cloud-dragon chariot, is precisely because you have not beheld the *Stone Radiance and Eight Simplicities* in their entirety. Now I transmit them to you, comprising eighteen talismans and their scriptural prefaces. Cultivate them accordingly, and you shall stride the dragon’s steps and ascend the mysterious stages. Treasure and guard them well—the *Yellow Writ of the Stone Radiance of the Great Subtlety* is no trifling technique of yellow and red. Repeated warnings have been given.

Before it has cleansed your heart and mind, your inherent conduct has already become manifest, and your jade body has been marked by exalted destiny. Savor the mysterious and chew the real; summon and draw in radiant splendor. Calm the six spirits, discern the eight luminances. Submit to the numinous root, refine the three passes, nourish the fluids and harmonize the hun-soul. Even if violent winds rage, they shall not assail your true nature.

Let not the clamor of the vulgar and the murk of the worldly turn back your pure and unsullied nature. Then shall you chant in the void, empty your heart to await the spirits, tend to the hundred absolutes, and dwell in the clarity of the utmost real. Thus shall no cares or burdens disturb your mysterious abode, nor sorrowful thoughts trouble the crimson ford.

In serene detachment and distant contemplation, gazing upon the light with shared joy, the supreme bliss shall resound like chimes in both ears, and the cloud-borne zither and tiger’s strum shall echo through the empty pavilion. Your mouth shall sip fragrant winds, your eyes behold the threefold clouds, your waist bear the golden yang, and your command subdue all malevolence. Moving with the four seasons, you shall naturally attain perfection, and all that your distant gaze washes over shall merge with the divine.

The perfected attain perfection precisely through this, while those who feign perfection without truth shall stumble and fall thereby. Yet if transgressions and ailments fill the ledgers, if sorrow and grief choke the heart, if constant striving wearies the spirit, if petty ways are clung to in secret, if harmony is sought only to please the crowd, if the mind yearns for ease in old age—suddenly, mournful cries shall arise. Through endless nights, long lamenting the dead, grieving with a heart that mourns the departed, essence and spirit shall part, the three *hun*-souls scatter their *qi*, and in the void of inauspicious fate, the *po*-soul shall summon *wangliang* spirits. Abandoning my empty hall, they shall bring forth a hundred afflictions. How can one grasp the Way of life only to rush into the chambers of death? Having once refined the numinous wind, you now tread the halls of death, casting aside your auspicious signs and hurling yourself into foul defilement.

Though your name resounds in lofty triumph, you still hesitate; though you have repeatedly beheld the luminous precepts, you have not dispelled your doubts. Thus you entangle yourself in defiled petitions, causing the stench of dawn to obscure the hidden writs. The four poles beat their drums, the Three Officials brandish their spears, and you swear oaths—how could you forget the Great Beginning?

Then shall the divine tiger unsheathe its claws, the venomous dragon bare its fangs, and the eight directions stretch boundless—where could you flee? Only after such warnings shall you realize the longing for purity’s distant expanse, and that the words spoken were not empty. Yet how lamentable that wailing voices disrupt the true and disturb the upright *qi*! Why does the enlightened sovereign not dwell always in the land of fortune, shaking his robes and returning to his chamber?

Now I entrust to you the *Stone Radiance Golden Yang Writ*, bidding you fully behold the first of the eight scrolls. Here ends the *Supreme Mystery Yellow Writ of the Heavenly Thearch of the Great Subtlety: The Stone Radiance Golden Yang Plain Scripture*.
