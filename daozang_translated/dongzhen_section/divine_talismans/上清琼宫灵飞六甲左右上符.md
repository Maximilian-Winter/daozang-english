**The Upper Clarity Jade Palace Numinous Flight Six Jia Left and Right Superior Talismans**

The Upper Clarity Jade Palace Numinous Flight Six Jia Jade Maidens, numbering sixty, bear names, designations, and the left and right superior talismans. The Supreme Ultimate Ninefold Upper August Supreme Ultimate Perfected received these from the Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord.

The left and right Numinous Flight Six Jia Talismans are also called *The Jade Essence True Formula*, *The Way Within the Radiance*, *The Hidden Travels of the White-Feathered Black-Winged Upper Scripture*, and *The Divine Way of Numinous Flight Six Jia*.

The deities of the Six Jia ride six dragons at times, feasting upon auspicious clouds, gazing upon the six directions, and descending to the bedchamber of those who ingest their talismans. On appointed days, they ride chariots drawn by white simurghs and black-winged phoenixes, feasting in the inverted radiance of Eternal Yang, surveying the divine peaks of the eight directions.

When one ingests their talismans, body and self harmonize, hun and po unite, spirit and form commune. The Three Qi blend as incense, the Five Viscera bloom with splendor. One may sit in death or stand in life, command the myriad demons, tread upon blades and traverse peril. Ten thousand blessings converge in harmony. One may cross mountains and enter waters, traverse seas and ford rivers, unbound by bridges or fords, unafraid of perilous heights. One may transform and conceal, summon wind and call forth thunder, instantly raise clouds and rain, conjure traveling kitchens at will. Entering battle, one remains unharmed; entering water, one stays dry. Mountain spirits offer protection, Jade Maidens come to greet.

After six years of ingestion, the Six Jia manifest in bodily form, speaking with the practitioner, bestowing true scriptures. One attains longevity coeval with Heaven and Earth, in harmony with the Two Images.

One must dwell apart, avoiding defilement and reckless desire. Still the heart, mirror the form—only then may one seek this attainment.

The Four Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declare: The Six Qi circulate through the Ten Heavens; the Six Jia cycle through the hidden and dark. With these talismans, one may conceal and transform without limit. Hearing their names, one supplements the Heavenly Perfected. Practicing their Way, one soars through emptiness and rides the radiance. Wearing their script, Jade Maidens hold towels.

After six years of use, the Azure Palace inscribes merit upon jade tablets, recording one’s name and designation. Myriad spirits offer protection; Perfected Ones visit one’s chamber.

After fourteen years of practice, the Three Primordials of Grand Simplicity welcome one with feathered tablets of the Three Dawns, clothing one in a cloud cloak of purple auroras. One roams the Eight Effulgences by night and ascends the Tiger Chariot by day. Phoenix pipes sing, and the Dark Chime plays. Myriad spirits support one’s carriage, summoning wind and calling forth clouds. The Great One shares the reins; one ascends the Dawn in broad daylight.

The Numinous Flight Six Jia Left and Right Jade Maidens, numbering sixty in name and designation, appear thus: On each Jia day at dawn, face the kingly direction, close the eyes, and inwardly visualize the Jade Maidens of the Six Jia fortnight, all arrayed before you. Their attire and appearance are as described above. After a long while, knock the teeth six times, swallow saliva sixty times, then softly recite the incantation:

*Left flight, right numen,*
*Eight Effulgences’ radiant essence,*
*Above, planted in the forest of jade,*
*Below, blossoming with cinnabar and jasper.*
*In harmony with the Eight Regulations,*
*Governing the myriad sprouts.*
*Through divine communion and accumulated resonance,*
*The Six Qi refine and purify.*
*Cloud officials and jade splendor,*
*Riding emptiness, following life.*
*Brocade cloaks and flying skirts,*
*Auroras reflecting the purple chamber.*
*Tiger-script waist sashes,*
*Feathered tablets and azure banners.*
*Hand-holding divine talismans,*
*Flowing gold and fire bells.*
*Dispelling evil, repelling demons,*
*Preserving my integrity and fortune.*
*Severing and restraining the myriad fiends,*
*Ten thousand evils dissolved in peace.*
*Roaming together in the Three Luminaries,*
*Reversing age to return to infancy.*
*Sitting in death, standing in life,*
*Attending me, the Six Ding.*
*Fierce beasts guard my body,*
*Heavenly soldiers follow.*
*Inhaling rivers, exhaling seas,*
*Mountains and peaks flow and topple.*
*Instantly conjuring traveling kitchens,*
*Golden liquors and jade blossoms.*
*Binding tigers and leopards,*
*Roaring at the dark and hidden.*
*Commanding ghosts and spirits,*
*Subduing a thousand numina.*
*All wishes follow the heart,*
*Ten thousand affairs achieve success.*
*Dispersing the Way, scattering the body,*
*Transforming at will.*
*Supplementing the Perfected Ones,*
*Coeval with Heaven and Earth.*
*Ears sharp, eyes bright,*
*Penetrating vision of the Yellow Court.*
*Six Jia Jade Maidens,*
*Serve as my messengers.*

When the incantation is complete, close the eyes. At the start of visualization, sit upright, place the hands upon the knees, and let no one see. If seen, the true radiance will not unify; thoughts will scatter and dissipate. Focus the mind unwaveringly, allowing no other thoughts. One must be cautious.

Before ingesting the talisman, first call the name of the Jade Maiden of the current day, then softly recite the incantation:

*Heaven’s mystery, Earth’s yellow,*
*Great Void’s Six Qi,*
*At dawn, ingesting numinous essence,*
*Divine gold and tiger script.*
*May my Perfected self be thus,*
*May my spirit be thus.*
*Dispersing form and shadow,*
*Sealing mountains, summoning spirits.*
*Commanding the myriad gods,*
*Sitting in death, standing in life.*
*Soaring high in Upper Clarity,*
*Northward audience with the Jade Dawn.*

When the incantation is complete, ingest the talisman.

**Upper Talisman of the Supreme Ultimate Jade Essence True Formula**
This talisman is first ingested on the *jiazi* day, then again on the second day. One is taken at dawn by men, and another at midday on the eight seasonal nodes.

**Upper Talisman of the Supreme Ultimate Jade Essence True Formula**
This talisman is first ingested on the *yichou* day, then again on the second day. One is taken at dawn by women, and another at midnight on the eight seasonal nodes.

The above two talismans are the ancestral talismans of the Numinous Flight Six *Jia* system. To ingest them, first observe a six-day purification, then proceed. After sixty days of ingestion, one may then ingest the sixty Jade Maiden talismans. These two talismans govern the summoning of spirits and deities, the communication with the myriad essences. With continuous ingestion and no neglect, one attains flying transcendence and everlasting life. Having ingested the sixty Jade Maiden talismans, one must therefore cultivate these talismans in tandem.

Men and women officials should use them according to their respective names. Avoid impurity, passing through homes of the dead, sharing beds with others, lending clothing, consuming the five pungent foods and the meat of the six livestock, and especially approaching women—these defilements cause the spirit to perish and the soul to scatter, giving rise to deviance and loss of nature, inviting calamity upon the three *qi*, and resulting in death as a lowly ghost. Always burn incense at the head of one’s sleeping quarters.

The *Jiazi* Jade Maidens of the Supreme Ultimate Palace all wear upper dark brocade capes and lower azure silk flying splendor skirts. The *Jiaxu* Jade Maidens of the Yellow Simplicity Palace all wear yellow brocade capes and purple silk flying feather skirts. The *Jiashen* Jade Maidens of the Supreme Simplicity Palace all wear white brocade capes and red silk flying splendor skirts.

The Left and Right Numinous Flight Jade Maidens’ attire and accoutrements: all hold jade-essence spirit-tiger talismans in hand, and wear their hair in three-cornered cloud buns with the rest left loose to the waist.

The Crimson Palace *Jiawu* Jade Maidens, one cohort, all wear cinnabar brocade capes and azure silk flying skirts. The Purple Essence Palace *Jiachen* Jade Maidens, one cohort, all wear purple brocade capes and jade-green silk flying skirts. The Azure Pivot Palace *Jiayin* Jade Maidens, one cohort, all wear purple brocade capes and cinnabar-azure flying feather skirts. The Right and Left Numinous Flight Jade Maidens’ attire: all hold jade-essence golden-tiger talismans in hand, and wear their hair in three-cornered cloud buns with the rest left loose to the waist.

These sixty-two talismans were received by the Four Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate Upper Palace from the Most High Lord of the Dao. Those who receive them must maintain strict precepts and purify the heart, washing away the five defilements and impure thoughts, severing the faults of worldly filth and lustful desires. With upright gaze, they visualize the six essences; with concentrated thought, they perceive the fragrant smoke of jade perfected ones filling the chamber. Secluded in a solitary room, they accumulate virtue and merit, harmonize the *po* and preserve the center, faintly emulating the five spirits as they wander through the Three Palaces. Cutting off competition with the common crowd, they guard stillness and silence to achieve resonance. Thus, the spirits of the Six *Jia* will descend to them within a year.

If one can cultivate this Dao with utmost dedication, one will surely ascend as an immortal. Those who believe and uphold it become numinous beings; those who disbelieve will sink into the Nine Springs. The Dao of the Six *Jia*’s Numinous Radiance must be transmitted only to those of utmost purity and perfection, for only then will resonance and descent occur.

The Perfected of Nine Peaks, Xu Weiyuan, once received this method from Song Dexuan of Mount Song. Dexuan, a man of the reign of King Xuan of Zhou, practiced the Numinous Flight Six *Jia* Talismans, attained the Dao, and could travel three thousand *li* in a day. He could transform his shape into birds and beasts, mastering the Dao of the true and numinous. He now resides on Mount Song. Weiyuan followed him for a long time and thus received this method. After achieving the Dao through its practice, he now dwells on Mount Jiuyi.

Women such as Guo Shaoyao, Zhao Aier, and Wang Lulian also received this method and attained the Dao. Several dozen others did likewise, some wandering the Dark Continent, others residing on the Eastern Florescence Terrace of Square Cauldron Mountain, where they now dwell. The Lady Wei of Mount Nanyue said: This Guo Shaoyao was the daughter of Guo Qian, the Han Dynasty General Who Pacified the Liao. From youth, she was devoted to the Dao with utmost sincerity, and the Perfected One thus transmitted the Six *Jia* arts to her. Zhao Aier was the wife of Liu Yu, Prefect of Youzhou, and the elder sister of Zhao Gai, Vice Prefect. Fond of the Dao, she attained liberation from the corpse and later received these talismans. Wang Lulian was the daughter of Wang Bozhou, City Gate Commandant of Wei Emperor Wen, and a princess of Fanling. She too studied the Dao. One day, she suddenly departed, leaving her husband, Li Ziqī, to enter Mount Luhun. The Perfected One then transmitted this method to Ziqī, who was the tutor of the Prince of Qinghe under the Sima Wei regime. He often spoke of this woman’s erratic behavior, saying she vanished one day without a trace.

The Hidden Retreat of the Numinous Flight of the Six *Jia* of the Upper Clarity Jade Palace: those who ingest these true talismans may wander the eight directions. Those who practice this true scripture must find the right person. According to the *Bright Statutes of the Four Poles*, those who transmit the inner scriptures of Upper Clarity must first take oaths and make pledges before revealing them. Every seven hundred years, they may be passed to six individuals. Once the time limit is reached, they may no longer be disseminated.

Those who receive the transmission must fast for seven days, offering incense and pledges to a master who possesses the scriptures. They must present six *liang* of gold, sixty feet of white silk, six pairs of gold rings, six *liang* of green silk thread, and twenty-two feet each of five-colored silks. These serve as substitutes for the rites of cutting hair, ascending the altar, blood-oaths, and breaking contracts, sealing the vow to uphold the numinous talismans and the pledge to keep the jade names secret. Should one violate the oath and betray the pledge, one’s seven generations of ancestors and oneself will suffer the trials of the Wind Blade, be consigned to the River of Accumulated Nights, and bear the stones of Mount Meng to fill the Meng Ford.

Masters who possess the scriptures and receive the ritual offerings must distribute them to the cold, destitute, poor, orphaned, sick, elderly, weak, and infirm. They may not use them for themselves alone. Should they violate these statutes, the Three Officials will record and examine their transgressions, and they will die as lowly ghosts. One must revere and be cautious of this.
