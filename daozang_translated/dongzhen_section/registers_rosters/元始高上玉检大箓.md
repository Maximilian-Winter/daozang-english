**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Jade Register of the Primordial Beginning*
Author unknown, approximately composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. One scroll.
Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Pulu* Category.

In the first year of *Qingxu*, the year *gengyin*, on the ninth day of the ninth month, at the hour of *shangjia*, the Primordial Heavenly King observed a prolonged fast at the *Shangqing* Palace. He swore an oath to the Most High, the Boundless, the Formless, the Nameless, the Unoriginated, the Limitless, and the luminous clarity of the supreme natural state spanning countless kalpas.

The Dao transmitted *The Three Primordials’ Jade Register* to the Jade Lads of the Three Heavens, entrusting it to later disciples whose mystic names destined them to become *Shangqing* Perfected Ones. Their names were inscribed upon the cinnabar terrace of the Golden Treasury and the jade tablets, written in purple script upon jasper slips. They were to welcome the Sage Lords, soaring to the *Shangqing* Palace, gazing upon the celestial and terrestrial offices of the *Dongqing*’s natural hierarchy. There, they would serve the Supreme Perfected, inspecting Heaven, Earth, and humanity, summoning immortals, subduing demons, commanding spirits, and descending in cloud chariots to receive the bodies of those who would inherit the Dharma, in accordance with the covenant of the *Nine Perfected* and the *Mystic Statutes*.
