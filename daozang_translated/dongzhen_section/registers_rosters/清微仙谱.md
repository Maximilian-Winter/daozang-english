**The Immortal Register of Qingwei**

**Scripture Title:** *The Immortal Register of Qingwei*. Transmitted by Huang Shunshen of the Yuan, compiled by Chen Cai. One fascicle. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, section *Dongzhen*, category *Xielu*.

**Preface to The Immortal Register of Qingwei**

The Dao exists prior to the Great Ultimate—what does this mean? Before Heaven and Earth arose, the Great Ultimate already was. Could anything precede it? As the scriptures say: "The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth." If this is the origin, then does it not exist before Heaven and Earth?

Now, Heaven’s movements—sun and moon in their courses, wind and rain in their dispersal and nourishment, thunder and lightning in their stirring—are known as Heaven’s transformations, yet none recognize them as the workings of the Dao. Alas! Were the Dao’s workings to cease for even a single breath, Heaven’s transformations would halt.

Does not the *Book of Changes* say: "Great indeed is the Qian’s primordial power! All things owe their beginning to it, and it governs Heaven." It also states: "That which precedes Heaven—Heaven does not oppose it." If even Heaven does not oppose it, how much less would humans, how much less spirits and gods?

Thus, the Dao’s mysteries, from the outset, could not remain untransmitted. Its transmission began with the Primordial Beginning, then divided into the Jade Dawn and the Lord Lao. Through further divisions, it branched into the four lineages of Zhenyuan, Taihua, Guanling, and Zhengyi. After ten transmissions, it reached the Ancestral Perfected Sovereign Zhao Ning, where it once more unified.

Eight transmissions later, it came to the Perfected of Hidden Chaos, Master Nan. Master Nan’s learning encompassed Heaven and humanity; he served the Song as a high official. Encountering the Perfected of Preserving Unity, he received the Supreme Dao, thereafter commanding spirits and gods, summoning thunder and rain, moving celestial envoys, and ascending to the Immortal Bureaus.

In his later years, he met Master Huang of Thunder’s Tribulation, marveled at him, and transmitted all his writings. Master Huang pondered deeply, composed works, and expounded the lineage’s principles, thereby completing the corpus.

In all prayers and invocations, he could, as if holding a sure pledge, achieve results without effort or display, exacting recompense from the vast and empty void with unerring precision—how divine! At that time, princes and nobles vied to enlist him, and disciples from all directions numbered in the thousands.

Some glimpsed a fragment, others plagiarized half a method; when hastily tested, none failed to yield results.

Yet Master Huang treasured his writings, disdaining to impart them to others, so though scholars thronged in great numbers, few beheld the full arcana. Recently, summoned by imperial decree to court, he received leave to return to the mountains, and only then did I gain admittance to his gate. In moments of leisure, we would converse at ease, and whenever we discussed the subtleties of the Dao, he would press the matter again and again. Though I was the last to encounter the Master, I received his teachings most profoundly. One day, he said to me: “I am old now, and have seen many people, yet none has grasped the essence in silence, heart communicating with heart, steadfast in faith and resolute in practice, as you have. This must be heaven’s gift, not man’s doing.” Thereupon, he brought forth all the writings he had received from Master Nan and bestowed them upon me.

On the day I bowed to receive them, I secretly vowed: “Though I entered the Master’s gate late, I have been able to refine myself through his teachings, and now I have also obtained his writings. How dare I not spread their transmission, that in a thousand kalpas hence, all who have eyes may vie to be the first to behold them anew? No longer shall I sigh for Penglai, cut off by weak waters.” With reverence, I engraved them in sturdy catalpa wood, to share with all under heaven who are of like aspiration.

Thus I offer this account: This Dao, in its origin, existed before heaven and earth; in its culmination, it will endure beyond heaven and earth. Alas! Its practice shall be transmitted without end.

Written on the *chunyin* day of the *chunyang* month in the *gui-si* year of the Zhiyuan era, by Chen Cai of Jian’an, disciple of later days, who bows with burning incense.

**Register of the Luminous Dao of the Pristine Mystery**

The Primordial Lord of the Dao, the Utmost True and Great Dao, formless and nameless, empty and spontaneous, origin of the ten thousand transformations—who can speak of it? In the distant kalpas of old, *qi* congealed into images, revealing the most profound and wondrous mysteries, which were bestowed upon the Jade Sovereign of the Dao. Later, it was named the *Wondrous Mystery Scripture* and the *Responsive Jade Canon*, secreted within the Hall of Pristine Mystery and Jade Radiance.

The Sovereign of the Dao was the manifestation of the primordial *qi* of the Great Simplicity, abiding in lofty repose in the Upper Clarity, unfolding and propagating the supreme Dao. Embodied in the utmost extremity and utmost spirit, he fashioned the Jade Formula Talisman and transmitted it to the Emperor of the Pristine Mystery’s Wondrous Transformation of the True Origin of the Luminous Dao, named *Erping*, who responded to the unfolding of the celestial mandate. Assisting the Pole Star, he dwelled in the Great Vastness, penetrating the wondrous and spontaneous, expanding the myriad norms, and enduring with the Dao.

During the Qin dynasty, he descended to the Palace of Pristine Mystery’s Wondrous Transformation in the capital of the Zhu state, also called the Palace of the Myriad Transformations of the Primordial Beginning. The Emperor’s form: clad in azure robes.

The Perfected Lord was the transformed body of the Primordial Beginning’s singular *qi*, with a blue-green countenance and unbound hair, a dragon’s form, riding flowing fire to enter and exit the Three Realms, known as the deity who governs the pivot of thunder and lightning. During the Qin, he descended to the Palace of the Nine Heavens’ Long Plain in Hezhong Prefecture. Later, he propagated the great Dao, circulated the *Mysterious Wondrous Scripture*, and transmitted it to the Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Luminous Mystery, Xu Lingqing.

The Perfected Lord descended during the Qin to Jianzhou. With phoenix eyes and crescent-moon brows, her hair coiled in a topknot, she appeared as a woman of twenty or thirty, clad in green robes, ever holding a jade tablet. Merging with the Dao, her divine transformations were unfathomable. She dwelled in the Palace of Pristine Clarity and Mysterious Nurturance in the Nine Heavens. From the jade scriptures of the Mysterious Capital, she composed chapters and transmitted them to the Perfected of the Celestial Mountain of the Jade Hall, Zhu Xuan.

The Perfected was a native of the Eastern Capital of the Qin. With a fine beard and fair complexion, his brows were broad and long. As the Zhou dynasty declined and the world fell into chaos, he entered Langzhou to pay homage to Perfected Xu, attained the Dao, and ascended to Perfection. He dwelled in the Palace of the Mysterious Numinosity of the Phoenix Pavilion in the Grand Clarity of Mount Jinhua. Later, he transmitted the *Thunder’s Primordial Vibrant Radiance* chapters to the Perfected Lord of the Great Mystery’s Azure Wisdom and Transformative Fusang, Bu Ji.

The Perfected Lord descended during the Qin in Fengzhou. Amid the chaos of the age, he entered the Western Capital, where he obtained the wonders of the Jade Talisman. When the Dao congealed in mystery, and after Emperor Gao of Han pacified the realm, he ascended to Perfection in Henan Prefecture, dwelling in the Palace of Divine Radiance on the Divine Continent of the Eastern Sea. With the *Jade Radiance Precious Chapters*, he transmitted them to the Perfected Lord of Illustrious Clarity and Dao’s Florescence, Qiu Mu.

The Perfected Lord was a native of Shouzhou in the early Han. Having grasped the purport of the Precious Chapters, he gathered the myriad *qi* to meet the flourishing of heaven. He dwelled in the Left Palace of the Grand Supreme, in the Capital of Vast Clarity, and later transmitted the Pivot of the Dao to the Perfected of Illustrious Clarity and Pristine Wisdom of the Qin, Shi Fu.

The Perfected was a man of the Han dynasty, the transformed body of the Great Emperor of the Eastern Florescence. With a spirit resolute and outstanding, he embodied the Dao’s celestial workings. He dwelled in the Grotto of Luminous Communication on Dragon Mound Mountain. The Perfected Lord of the Pristine Mystery’s Luminous Treasure Balance and Purple Florescence’s Primordial Harmony and Illustrious Dao, the Supreme Unity’s Divine Effulgence, Wang Hong. Also named Zheng Hong.

The Perfected Lord had a full-moon visage, a single-stroke brow, phoenix eyes, unbound hair, and wielded a sword, his feet clad in vermilion shoes. A transformed body of the Supreme Unity and the Moon’s Comet, he governed the pivot of the mysterious. He dwelled in the Palace of Purple Radiance to the right of the Great Vastness Tower in the Mysterious Capital.

The Perfected Lord of the Supreme Unity’s Thoroughly Wondrous and Transformative Primordial Harmony, Xie Jingang. The Perfected Lord was the congealed perfection of the Great Ultimate, a distinct body of the Primordial Beginning. His divine transformations were hidden and unfathomable, their beginning and end unknowable. Often manifesting in subtle and elusive forms, none could recognize him. Silently wielding the pivot, he commanded the myriad spirits, without relying on talismans, charts, vermilion ink, or any tangible object. Wherever he lodged, he took form, unfolding the wonders of the Dao. He transmitted secret oral instructions, passed down from mouth to mouth, and dwelled in the Palace of Primordial Harmony to the left of the Altar of the Sunlit Valley.

Thus the precept states: "The Golden Script and Jade Registers are transmitted through the world—neither to be lightly disclosed nor concealed in secrecy."

Descending in the Tang dynasty, she oversaw the teachings and doctrines, mastered the profound mysteries of the Pristine Mystery, and resided in the Palace of Luminous Purity in the Eastern Sea. Later, she transformed into the Primordial Lady of the Pristine Mystery’s Primordial Mechanism and Primordial Numinosity, Lóng Jí. With twin topknots and the countenance of a jade maiden, her face slightly flushed, she wore purple robes and a green skirt, wielded a sword, and rode a white dragon. She dwelled in the Palace of Cavernous Mystery, where the revolving currents of the Pristine Mystery’s teachings flowed.

She further transformed into the Primordial Lady of the Pristine Mystery’s Numinous Harmony, Guǎn Jìngqīng.

His deeds are recorded in the *Immortals’ Biographies*. A native of the Zhāohào era, he received the wondrous Dao from Master Xú, traversed famous mountains, and was moved by the Grand Ultimate’s Three Perfected Ones, who descended to transmit the Three Caverns’ precious scriptures.

Later, he transmitted the Dao to the Grand Purity’s Supreme Mystery Primordial Lady Wén Yōng, and the Primordial Lady succeeded her.

**Orthodox Lineage of the Dao and Virtue**
The Golden Gate’s Primordial Elder Lord, the Heavenly Worthy of Dao and Virtue. The Primordial Elder responded to transformation, revealing scriptures in the Middle Antiquity. From the Sovereign Lord above to the blazing Hàn below, he adapted to the times, styled by era, serving as the imperial teacher. Effortless and natural, compassionate and frugal, he restored inherent nature. On the day he passed the pass, he transmitted the Dao to the Gatekeeper Perfected One Yǐn Xǐ, styled Wénshǐ. The Perfected One was a grandee of King Kāng of Zhōu. Gazing upward and downward, he observed the purple qi advancing westward. By the time of King Zhāo, he had become the gatekeeper. He admonished the officials to await and inquire, knowing and welcoming him. Having attained the essence of the Dao and Virtue, he ascended into the formless.

The Grand Mystery Perfected One Zhào Lóng, large-eyed, bearing the countenance of a Perfected One, clad in crimson. The Heavenly Mountain Perfected One Hóng Bīn, with fine whiskers, bearing the countenance of a Perfected One, clad in crimson. The Primordial Upper Perfected One Lǔ Huì, pale-complexioned, clad in blue. From Zhōu to Táng, over a thousand years had passed. The three Perfected Ones, master and disciple, followed in succession, attaining the principle of prolonged vision. Whether hidden or manifest, responding to titles, the Dao is never far from humanity. Thus, the Grand Purity’s Supreme Mystery Primordial Lady Wén Yōng carried on the lineage afterward, and the Primordial Lady emerged to continue the thread.

**Orthodox Origin**
The Supreme Primordial Elder Lord—the essence of the Orthodox Unity—revealed scriptures, styled by era, yet the Dao’s myriad names are united as one. What division could there be? By the end of the Hàn, human hearts had grown shallow and insubstantial, none more so than then. The Supreme One pitied the multitudes, though it was not by choice. If people could understand the principle of neither inclining nor wavering, what need would there be for the Heavenly Worthy’s establishment of teachings? As for instructions to reform and distance oneself from transgressions, or the forms of transmitting scriptures and registers, these merely teach people to do good. Transmitting them to the utmost person renews their virtue.

**The Three Heavenly Sage Masters**
The Supreme Mystery’s Grand Attendant, Orthodox Unity Perfected Lord Zhāng Dàolíng—his deeds are recorded in the *Immortals’ Biographies*. A descendant of Hàn’s Master of the Chamber, a native of Pèi, he was spiritually efficacious from birth, broadly mastering literature. Moved by the Supreme One, he personally received the Dao of Alliance and Might. The Hàn emperor summoned him, but he did not rise. In the second year of Yǒngshòu, he ascended in broad daylight, governing the Supreme Mystery Ministry, presiding over the Primordial Radiance Prefecture, and residing in the Jade Simplicity Primordial Capital Palace.

His successor, the Grand Purity Perfected One, Attendant-in-Ordinary Zhāng Héng, was the Perfected Lord’s eldest son—his deeds are recorded in the *Immortals’ Biographies*. His successor, the Grand Purity Perfected One, Marquis of Làngzhōng Zhāng Lǔ, was the Perfected Lord’s second son—his deeds are recorded in the *Immortals’ Biographies*.

The female master, the Perfected Lord’s eldest daughter, Lady Wénjī, was the Princess of Líng. The next, the Three Worthies of Wénguāng, was the Princess of Yān. The Four Mushrooms and Four Masters all ascended and concealed themselves, later generations emerging from nonbeing into being.

He transmitted the Dao to the Grand Purity’s Supreme Mystery Primordial Lady Wén Yōng, and the Primordial Lady was thus able to inherit the blessings.

**Convergence of the Dao**
The Pure Tenuity’s Attendant Primordial, Supreme Capital’s Grand Perfected of the Nine Qi, Primordial Numinous Lady—the Grand August Radiant Cavern Yang Golden Gate’s Illustrious Congealed Wondrous Dao Preserving Immortal Primordial Lady Zǔshū, also named Suìdào, styled Fǎngzhòng. A transformation of the Moon’s Comet, she descended in the time of Táng’s Emperor Zhāozōng, a native of Línglíng Prefecture in Guǎngxī. Her face was the color of a jujube, her eyes large, and her stature seven feet tall. From childhood, she maintained integrity, born with spiritual efficacy. Her parents could not restrain her, so she entered the Dao. Traversing famous mountains, she arrived at the river islet’s stone in Guìyáng Commandery, where she encountered the Protective Radiance Primordial Consort, who transformed into a numinous light. The Sagely Mother transmitted to her the mysteries of the Pure Tenuity’s natural and prior-heavenly essence. Sometimes bare-armed with a bamboo hairpin, wielding a sword and sitting on stone, she whistled to command wind and thunder, flying through the mortal world. Later, she arrived near the Western Capital’s mountains, where the caverns were pure and numinous, and the Divine Transformation Stream flowed. Moved by the Grand Purity’s Supreme Mystery Primordial Lady Wén, who transformed into a beautiful woman and bathed by the stream’s bank, the master held her towel and attended her, welcoming her to the shore. For several nights, she manifested as male and female fierce beasts and strange forms, testing her through myriad trials, yet she showed no weariness. Knowing her sincerity was unshakable, she summoned her to ride a wooden raft and drift with the current. Returning to the former place, she transmitted to her all the essences of the Supreme Purity, Numinous Treasure, Dao and Virtue, and Orthodox Unity, then vanished from sight. The master synthesized the mysteries of the five lineages, commanding thunder and lightning, her transformations manifold.

At times she rode a dragon, wielded a sword, and commanded the myriad spirits. At others, crowned in gold and clad in white, she presided in her grotto-palace, her nature fierce and commands stern—even the Thunder Gods deferred to her severity. Now she governs the Luminous Grotto of Pure Tenuity, upholding the teachings, and those who inherit her lineage must offer utmost loyalty. Should they stray even slightly, her wrath descends without delay.

She is also known as the Radiant Sovereign of Universal Transformation. Later, she transformed into the Illustrious Sovereign of Pure Tenuity’s Inspection and Manifest Virtue, Xiūduān: her hair bound in a high topknot, her face fair, her brows like willow leaves, her eyes almond-shaped. Clad in azure robes and golden armor, she wields an axe, rides a black dragon, and dwells in the Palace of Sunlit Splendor. From there, the transmission of the Pure Tenuity’s Dao unfolds.

Within the Jade Chamber, the Cavern-Luminous Sovereign Guō Yùlóng, also called the Supreme Effulgent Sovereign, was a disciple of the Primordial Sovereign’s lineage. A native of the capital, her demeanor was solemn and majestic. She inherited her master’s source, holding the rank of Attendant to the Azure Radiance in the Palace of Purple Vacuity.

The Purple-Light Illuminating Perfected Sovereign of Blessed Harmony, Fù Yāngqíng, styled Zǐfāng, was a disciple of Sovereign Guō. A native of Fēng Prefecture, she upheld the integrity of purity and inherited the pivotal mechanisms of former ages. Her rank ascended to Upper Assistant of the Three Heavens, and she resided in the Palace of Flourishing Brilliance on Mount Tàihuá in the Western Sea.

The Dragon-Light Dao-Illuminating Sovereign Yáo Zhuāng, styled Shūqí, also known as the Sovereign of Vast Prosperity, was a disciple of Sovereign Fù. A native of the Western Capital, she commanded thunder and lightning, mastering the essentials of the Dao. Her rank was Attendant of the Scriptures in the Second Heaven, and she dwelt in the Palace of Majestic Wisdom, also called the Palace of Vast Forehead and Harmonious Emptiness.

The Auspicious Source Purple-Florescence Jade-Blessed Sovereign Gāo Shìyī, also known as the Purple-Pure Wondrous-Transforming Jade-Florescence Numinous-Blessed Sovereign, was a disciple of Sovereign Yáo. Born in the azure ravines of Wèi Mountain in the land of Yān, her chamber was filled with divine radiance. She inherited her master’s source and held the rank of Attendant to the Three Heavens. She is also known as the Purple-Florescence Sovereign of Lofty Destiny, residing in the Palace of Abundant Luminous Splendor.

Next, she transmitted the teachings to the Western Florescence Pure Vacuity Perfected, Huá Yīng. A native of Fèngxiáng, his eyes were round and his beard fine. He abandoned his official cap to study the Dao, attaining the exalted rank of Left Minister of Luminous Primordial Clarity in the Azure Tenuity, Supreme Steward of the Grotto-Yang.

Later, she transmitted to the Green City Penetrating-Blessing Perfected, Zhū Dòngyuán. A native of Chéngdū, his eyes were round and his beard fine. He dwelled in reclusion on Mount Qīngchéng, expounding the mysteries of thunder. His rank was Upper Minister of Grotto Guardianship in the Azure Tenuity, Jade Pivot Envoy of the Divine Empyrean.

Next, she transmitted to the Cloud Mountain Preserving Unity Perfected, Lǐ Shǎowēi. A native of Bǎofēng by the waters of Fáng Prefecture, the site of his former dwelling still remains, known to people as the Residence of Lord Thunder Lǐ. Born into an official family of Fánglíng, he abandoned worldly life to awaken to the real. Moved by his master’s transmission of the Dao, he held the rank of Right Minister of the Azure Tenuity’s Capital. Later, celestial officials descended, conveying the imperial decree to appoint him as Envoy of the Five Thunder Courts. Thereafter, he ascended to traverse the Three Realms, his appearances and vanishings beyond reckoning.

The Eyebrow Mountain Concealing Obscurity Perfected, Nán Bìdào. Originally surnamed Dōngnán, his given name was Guī. Born in Méishān on the third day of the eleventh month of the year *bǐngchén* at the hour of *yín*, he distinguished himself in Confucian studies as a youth and entered officialdom. Once, while serving as an assistant in the eastern lakes, he dreamed at night of a divine being who told him his master had arrived. At dawn, he went to the outskirts to welcome him and found the visitor’s appearance matched his dream. Upon inquiry, he learned it was the Preserving Unity Perfected. He welcomed him home and treated him with the rites due a master. Several times he tested him with difficult matters, yet his resolve remained firm as metal and stone. Thus, he entrusted him with all the profound mysteries. After the transmission was complete, the master vanished in a radiance of golden light.

Later, while overseeing the Grand Canal, at noon he saw a celestial official in crimson robes descend from the heavens, announcing: "By the August Emperor’s decree, you are to be invested as the Sixfold Mastery Water Controller of the Dipper." He was further appointed as the Preserving Harmony Immortal Minister of the Qingwei tradition. Later, he served as an advisor to Emperor Lizong of the Song, repeatedly offering remonstrances that went unheeded, and so he retired into reclusion. His whereabouts became unknown, and people believed he had ascended as an immortal.

The Azure Waters Thunder Abyss Perfected, Huang Shunshen. The master hailed from an eminent family of Min, known as the Flame of the Cinnabar Mountain Recluse, in what is now Jianning Prefecture. Born on the fifth day of the intercalary eighth month of the year *jiǎshēn* at the hour of *wèi*, he inherited his grandfather’s official rank yet was extraordinary from birth—his countenance ancient and surpassingly refined, his nature keenly perceptive. The classics, histories, and the hundred schools of thought he mastered without exception. At sixteen, while attending his father, who served as an instructor in the Grand Canal administration, he fell ill. The Southern Perfected healed him with talismans, and thunder resounded in the courtyard, instantly curing his ailment. Observing his bone structure befitted one destined for immortality, the Perfected transmitted all his teachings to him.

During the *Baoyou* era, he emerged to serve as an inspector, and the Song imperial brother Zhao Mengduan, the Prince’s Envoy, became his disciple. Emperor Lizong summoned him for an audience and bestowed upon him the imperial calligraphy "Thunder Abyss Perfected" in four characters. In the year *bǐngxū* of the *Zhiyuan* era, he was summoned to court, where his responses were lucid and astute, earning the emperor’s reverence. Shortly after, he petitioned to return to the mountains, and the emperor granted his request, further bestowing a light carriage for his journey home.

The master’s disciples numbered in the hundreds. Today, the Qingwei Daoist methods flourish in the world, and though many have grasped their essential mysteries and demonstrated their numinous efficacy, such individuals remain few. The master once prefaced *The Thunder Canon* with these words: "When the signs of the Five Mounds are manifest, a perfected one shall emerge, and those who follow shall be as reeds bound together—how could this not be so?"
