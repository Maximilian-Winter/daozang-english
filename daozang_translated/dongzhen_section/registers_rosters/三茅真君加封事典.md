**Preface to *The Ritual of Ennobling the Three Mao Perfected Lords***

The Dao has its origin and its lineage—its origin precedes heaven and earth, unfathomable in its beginning; its lineage follows heaven and earth, boundless in its end. Yet the world claims our Dao waxes and wanes. Alas! How could this be so?

In daily life and common practice, from hunger’s meal to thirst’s drink, where is the Dao not present? Its single thread of transmission endures unbroken to this day, never once having faded. The only peril lies in the world’s lack of those who transmit the Dao. Thus it is said: *Humans can magnify the Dao; the Dao does not magnify humans.*

The immortal traces of the Mao Lords have long been manifest, recorded in ancient histories since the pre-Qin era, with later transmissions detailing their legacy. Their exalted rank among the immortals is beyond the reckoning of mortal minds. As for their merits in aiding the Nine Realms, their grace flowing through ten thousand generations, their support of the altars of state, and their provision for the ancestral sacrifices—from the reign of Emperor Sizong to that of Emperor Gulong, they were honored with ever more resplendent titles. At that time, Liu Jingyi traced their source and amplified their influence.

By the reign of Emperor Lizong, the eminent Daoist Master Situ of Xubai, serving as State Preceptor and Registrar of the Dao, petitioned for the nation and the people, and his prayers were answered. He was specially entrusted with the mandate of the Left Bureau of the Cavernous Mystery. The Master declared: "Ah! All this is the numinous power of the Three Lords. How dare I claim what is rightfully theirs? I humbly return this honor and glory to the Three Lords, to fulfill the principle of repaying the root."

Emperor Lizong assented. The vermilion seals gleamed, illuminating the forests and springs.

At that time, among the disciples of the Great Purity era who stood in attendance, I witnessed these events with my own eyes. Master Situ had repeatedly pledged to inscribe the rites of enfeoffment upon metal and stone, yet before he could fulfill this, he had already ascended as an immortal. When I, Great Purity, assumed the humble post at the lower abode, I long contemplated carrying on his unfulfilled intent, but pressing affairs left no leisure for the task.

In the spring of the dingmao year, the *Inner Transmission* and its *Continuation* were fortunately completed. My fellow disciples of the same rank once again expressed concern that the rites of enfeoffment remained unrecorded, saying: "Without their inscription, not only will the numinous marvels of the Three Lords and the august reverence of the sacred court fail to be proclaimed, but neither will it be seen how we of Kongshan have magnified the pulse of this Dao and expounded its transmission." Thereupon, I received this charge with the utmost reverence and now dutifully inscribe this to mark the time.

On the full moon of the third month in the dingmao year,
The Specially Bestowed Master of Pure Tranquility, Illuminating Perfection, and Subtle Wonder;
Specially Appointed Daoist Rectifier of the Maoshan Mountain Gate;
Provisional Supervisor of the Chongxi Abbey before the Throne and Overseer of All Abbeys on This Mountain;

**Petition to Decline the Appointment as Registrar**

Your servant, Situ Shitan, humbly states:
I have reverently received the imperial decree, which, in recognition of my three years of prayerful service, specially promotes me to Left Bureau Registrar and Director of Daoist Affairs.

I have heard that commands from heaven leave me no ground to stand upon. Truly, "to know contentment is to avoid disgrace"—this is the luminous teaching of the Most High. "To receive favor with alarm" is the clear warning of the Daoist tradition. My honor exceeds all bounds, and I tremble as if standing on thin ice.

I prostrate myself in gratitude.

Reflecting upon my own inadequacies, I find my talents far from sufficient and my learning shamefully deficient in the Dao. How could one as lowly as I, dwelling in mountain seclusion, have been so mistakenly favored with the sagely discernment of Your Majesty? Twice I journeyed to the capital to behold its splendor, and for long have I soiled the purity of the Void-White Studio. Yet by some dreamlike fortune, I was granted an audience in the celestial court; like a boat turning toward Penglai, I was entrusted with the sacred precincts of blessed lands. Racing between altars, I exhausted my meager wisdom in prayers for auspiciousness; from dawn to dusk, I vowed to repay Your Majesty with my very life. Though my contributions were negligible, I was repeatedly burdened with rewards. But blessings overabundant breed misfortune, and men lament my frail fate. My body is worn to the bone, like a withered tree; my spirit is broken, my will extinguished, like ashes that no longer flame. My plea for retirement arises from the depths of my heart, and Your Majesty’s gracious assent has already been bestowed.

I had sworn before heaven and earth to repay my sovereign, and pledged before streams and stones to wander the world in seclusion, roaming freely in the vast wilderness, lingering beyond the dust and filth of the world. Who could have foreseen that the imperial favor would again take pity on my three years of toil, bestowing undeserved grace to swiftly elevate me to the Left Bureau Registrar? Such extraordinary honor, a radiance at the end of my path, is more than I can bear. For when embroidered robes are draped upon a monkey, it will surely tear them to shreds with its teeth; when the music of *Xianchi* and *Shaohao* is played for an owl, it only bewilders and saddens the listener. Looking back, I fear my good fortune is excessive, and that such rapid advancement will hasten my downfall.

I humbly beseech Your Imperial Majesty, whose virtue encompasses heaven and earth, whose brilliance rivals the sun and moon, to consider the sincerity of my past and present intentions, and to preserve my resolve to know my limits from beginning to end. I implore You to revoke this decree, lest You be constrained by the appearance of retracting a promise, and to allow me to spend my remaining years in service, offering what little strength I have left. I dare not accept this honor, for to do so would be to risk offending Your celestial majesty.

With the utmost reverence and urgency, I submit this petition for Your Majesty’s consideration.

Respectfully submitted.

In the second month of the ninth year of the Chunyou reign, on a designated day, the Master of the Cavernous Subtlety, High Scholar of the Empty White Studio, Minister Sidu Shitan, Supervisor of the Teaching and Affairs of the Dao on the Right Avenue, was specially bestowed the title of *Jianyi*. He submitted a memorial to decline and was denied further refusals.

**Internal Provincial Document**
On the seventh day of the intercalary second month, an imperial decree was received: the High Scholar was specially promoted to *Daolu* of the Left Avenue, with an exhortation and a *huang* decree issued for his compliance. A memorial of gratitude was to be prepared.
Upon resubmission, further refusals were again denied.
On the seventh day, the bestowed *huang* and exhortation decrees arrived and were deposited in Jurong County.

On the fifteenth day of the same month, he submitted another memorial, beseeching the revocation of the imperial favor and the conferral of a sacred title upon the Three Mao Lords of the Office of Destiny.

**Memorial Requesting the Conferral of a Sacred Title**
This minister, undeterred by the severity of punishment, dares to lay bare his sincerity, risking offense to the celestial scrutiny.

On the first day of the first month, this minister reverently received the imperial grace, being appointed *Daolu* of the Left Avenue and Supervisor of the Teaching and Affairs of the Dao. Though I previously submitted a memorial to decline, it was not granted. Now, I have again been honored with the bestowal of a *huang* decree, commanding me to accept the aforementioned office, with no further refusals permitted. Overwhelmed by the imperial command, I am filled with shame and trepidation.

I have striven to cultivate myself and early aspired to purity and truth, yet never did I imagine that in my declining years I would be favored with such imperial grace. Reflecting inwardly, I recognize my origins: humanity is rooted in heaven, and all things are rooted in their ancestors. Without rooting humanity in heaven, one cannot know the beginning of the mandate received; without rooting things in their ancestors, one cannot fathom the ultimate source of their return.

This minister has long dwelled on Mount Mao, the place where the Three Mao Perfected Lords attained the Dao. It is the first earthly lung and blessed land, the eighth Cavern Heaven of Huayang, where palaces, monasteries, and hermitages resound with morning bells and evening chimes, tending the incense fires of the Three Lords, offering prayers for the state, and extending the sacred longevity of the emperor. Among the famous mountains of the realm, none surpass this in grandeur.

From the Han dynasty to our present Song, whether revealing the hidden radiance of the Three Lords or exalting their illustrious names, their incense fires have burned continuously, unbroken as a bridge. This is the very place where the perfected immortals fulfill their administrative duties, and where the state plants the seeds of boundless prosperity.

In my reckless folly, I dare to beseech that the titles previously bestowed upon me—High Scholar and *Jianyi*—along with the present appointment as *Daolu* and the exhortation decree, be revoked as imperial grace and, following the recent precedent of the Celestial Master and the Perfected Lord Who Assists the Sacred, that a sacred title be conferred upon the ancestral masters of this mountain, the Three Mao Perfected Lords. Let a decree be specially issued, bestowing honor upon the three peaks, thereby embodying the principle that humanity is rooted in heaven and all things in their ancestors.

This minister respectfully presents the deeds of the Three Lords for Your Majesty’s august perusal.

I humbly observe that the ancestral lineage of the Mao clan traces back to a distant wellspring of immortality. The eldest, Mao Ying; the second, Mao Gu; and the third, Mao Zhong—three brothers who dwelled in mountain caves and secluded valleys, refining their Dao and truth through diligent practice. After attaining the Dao, they were entrusted with the governance of early immortals, received their charge from the Supreme Ultimate, and presided over the Office of Destiny in the sacred peaks. They examined and assessed the realms of Wu and Yue, and established their abode upon the Red City Mountain. Their virtue was recorded in the purple books, their merits inscribed in the jade registers. Their crane tents and dragon pools repeatedly manifested divine marvels; the celestial lamps and cinnabar lights remain visible to this day. In matters of drought, rain, or snow, their responses to prayers are immediate; in fortunes and misfortunes, their verifications are as swift as an echo. The beacon fires of war have been stilled by their vigilance, and the auspicious omens of fish and dreams have been confirmed by their signs.

Since my arrival at this mountain, I have witnessed these details firsthand in the prayers offered by prefectures and counties. Moreover, the veneration accorded them through the ages has been abundant and flourishing. During the Xiangfu and Jingde eras, the mountain was strictly protected, lands were bestowed, and tax exemptions were granted. The sacrifices offered were solemn, and the prayers for high harvests were answered. Thus, during the reign of Emperor Renzu, the auspicious sign of a rainbow and lightning heralded the imperial heir; subsequently, imperial incense was sent, and the Golden Register was established. Emperor Gaozong repeatedly dispatched envoys to convey his earnest exhortations and ordered local officials to protect the site. From the Qiandao and Chunxi eras onward, the veneration has been even more devout.

The臣, having recently received the imperial decree, was charged with conducting prayers and exorcisms. Whenever grand rituals were held, he would reverently transcribe the sacred edict, personally knock at the grotto-heaven, supplicating above to the celestial poles and below to the mountains and rivers. All matters pertaining to the sacrificial canon were duly reported, and through the constant favor and protection of the perfected immortals, manifold blessings have accrued. This is none other than because Your Imperial Majesty, embracing the spirit in quiescence, unites with the Dao in truth; your virtue is cultivated amidst the humblest creatures, and your transformative influence extends beyond the vastness of Kunlun. Thus, birds, beasts, fish, and turtles all submit, while mountains, rivers, ghosts, and spirits all attain peace. Wherever manifest responses appear, they are witnessed, and petitions are met with ennobling honors. Yet the Three Perfected Ones of this mountain alone remain without special distinction.

The臣 notes that the Three Mao Lords initially received their celestial titles and were charged with overseeing the grotto-heaven. In former reigns, their numinous precincts were honored with elevated ranks, which the臣 has meticulously recorded below. He humbly beseeches Your Majesty to heed his earnest plea, to bestow the grace of the imperial mandate upon him, and to specially confer honorific titles upon the ancestral masters, thereby manifesting the Three Lords’ protective and propitious efficacy for the state, and illuminating the august dynasty’s grand tradition of requiting merit. This would also fulfill the臣’s duty to return to the source and repay his origins.

The臣 grieves that among those reclusive scholars who have encountered sagely enlightenment, many seek only personal glory, unaware of the need to repay their roots. The radiance of the perfected immortals remains buried to this day. Moreover, the臣 reflects that his years and fate both wane, his heart like withered wood or cold ashes, having achieved not even an inch of merit yet presumptuously enjoying imperial favor. To further trespass upon this grace would truly incur the reproach of unseen retribution. He humbly implores Your Sagely Compassion to pity his declining years, to perceive his lack of avarice for honor, and to bestow special grace by enhancing the renown of this sacred mountain, thereby glorifying the ancestral grounds of reverence and prayer, and perpetuating the nation’s boundless prosperity for myriad generations. This would be an incomparable fortune.

The臣 has carefully transcribed the three original imperial decrees of ennoblement for the Three Mao Perfected Lords and presents them herewith. As for the imperial edicts of exhortation bestowed upon the臣, he dares not presume to receive them at the capital but has already filed them in the public records of Jurong County, awaiting further instructions. He will then submit a memorial presenting the three imperial edicts of exhortation received previously and presently.

The臣, daring to offend celestial majesty, prostrates himself to await your decree.

Presented on the ____ day of the second month by the Specially Bestowed Master of Cavernous Subtlety, Right Street Supervisor of Daoist Teachings, and Vacuous Luminance Retreat Scholar, the臣 Situ Shitan.

**Imperial Decree of Ennoblement**

*Memorandum from the Ministry of Rites:*
In accordance with the edict issued on the twenty-seventh day of this month, the Chancellery proclaims: Within the Grotto-Heaven of Juqu, there reside perfected ones whose transformations are boundless and whose numinous efficacy is unfathomable. From the Qin and Han dynasties to the present, spanning over a thousand years, their blessings have flowed forth, benefiting the people. Yet their exalted names and honorific titles remain incomplete, which does not suffice to express the utmost sincerity of veneration.

The Lord of Great Mao of Mount Mao, currently titled *Taiyuan Perfected Person, Eastern Marchmount Supreme Minister, Director of Destinies*, shall be advanced to the title *Taiyuan Wondrous Dao Perfected Person, Eastern Marchmount Supreme Minister, Director of Destinies*. May this serve to guide harmonious qi, elicit auspicious responses, and assist in securing the nation’s boundless peace and prosperity.

Let this decree be made known as appropriate. The memorandum is issued in accordance with the imperial edict as above.

Upon receipt of the memorandum, in accordance with the imperial edict, this document is hereby issued.

In the fourth month of the first year of the Chongning reign, the memorandum was sealed by:
*Wen, Grand Master for Court Service and concurrently Right Vice Director, Guardian of the Right*
*Lu, Grand Master for Court Service and concurrently Left Vice Director, Guardian of the Left*
*Right Grand Master of the Silver and Blue Embroidered Silk, Guardian of the Right and concurrently Grand Councilor*
*Left Grand Master of the Illustrious Embroidered Silk, Left Grand Councilor*

The Central Mao Lord, currently titled *Perfected Person of Destined Records*, shall be advanced to the title *Perfected Person of Destined Records and Serene Emptiness*. The Lesser Mao Lord, currently titled *Perfected Person of the Three Offices, Preserver of Destiny*, shall be advanced to the title *Perfected Person of the Three Offices, Preserver of Destiny and Subtle Wisdom*.

On the first day of the third month, a second memorandum was received. The Ministry of Rites’ official document stated: "The imperial decree has been proclaimed to the eminent Daoist. It is commanded that he first accept the reduction of the *Yellow Register* rites, with no further refusal permitted. He shall promptly submit a memorial of gratitude in return. The bestowal of honorific titles upon the Perfected Lords has already been decreed and shall be implemented accordingly."

In the intercalary second month, *Yanqing* respectfully submitted the third memorial of refusal and decline:

*Your servant, Shi Tan, humbly states:*
On the first day of this month, I reverently received the sacred decree, commanding that I first accept the reduction of the *Yellow Register* rites, and that the bestowal of honorific titles upon the Perfected Lords has already been decreed and shall be implemented.

I, your servant, reflect that to decline honor and renounce glory is to await the grace of imperial favor, while for a Daoist master to request a title is to receive the benevolent bestowal of the throne. How dare I persist in my entreaties, hoping to move the imperial ear?

I prostrate myself in gratitude.

I humbly consider that the three peaks stand majestically verdant, each governed by one of the Three Perfected Lords, while the nine virtues flourish abundantly, and the nine bestowals manifest the divine singularity of the spirits. Their blessings extend to a hundred towns, and their beneficence permeates all living things. Moreover, the ancient altars of their legacy, adjacent to the Yangtze and Huai rivers, bear the weight of profound reverence. When the winds cleanse the frontier passes, is there not an opportunity to assist in the harmonious order? When rains nourish the rice fields, do we not rely upon their timely aid? These deeds are recorded in history and celebrated in song. To ascend to the heavens upon receiving such a mandate—how could I harbor any desire for worldly rank? To inscribe their merits in the imperial annals is to express the utmost reverence for the sacred court, to extend boundless blessings for ten thousand generations, and to mark an occasion rare in a thousand years.

This is all due to the grace of Your Imperial Majesty, who embodies the perfection of the Three Powers and governs the Eight Directions, whose moral authority is profound, and whose creation of heaven and earth is vast. You delight in the supreme teachings, following the Yellow Emperor’s practice of fasting in devotion; you revere the renowned mountains, emulating the sage-kings’ responsiveness to destiny. Thus, you have examined the legacy of the Great Mao Lords and wished to enhance their honorific titles to honor their spirits.

I, your servant, have guarded my precepts and shunned fame, yet my heart remains devoted to repaying my origins. I have poured forth my loyal devotion in this plea, not seeking false glory. Now that I have received the benevolence of your assent, and the ritual bestowal is to be enacted, if I were to persist in further entreaties, I fear I would incur heavenly censure.

How dare I not await your sagely decree, making it known to the jade halls of the immortals? I shall reverently proclaim the imperial will and pray for the augmentation of your august foundation. When all things come to fruition, the five grains shall ripen; when martial valor is harnessed, the four seas shall be pacified.

All the *Yellow Registers* and *Daoist Records* previously bestowed upon me—three in total—are hereby respectfully returned with this memorial.

I, your servant, have rashly trespassed against your celestial majesty and humbly await your decree.

On this day of the third month, *Shi Tan, Master of the Subtle Dao, Right Street Supervisor of Daoist Teachings, and Keeper of the Vacant Luminance Studio, Eminent Daoist of the Highest Rank*, respectfully submits this memorial.

The imperial decree was issued: "Not permitted. No further refusal shall be allowed."

Memorial submitted to the Ministry of Rites for return of documents:

*Shi Tan, in my humble position, states:*
On the first day of this month, I reverently received the transmitted imperial decree, commanding that I first accept the reduction of the *Yellow Register* rites, and that the bestowal of honorific titles upon the Perfected Lords has already been decreed and shall be implemented.

I, Shi Tan, have previously submitted a memorial, beseeching Your Sacred Majesty to revoke the gracious command and the bestowal of honorific titles upon the Perfected Lords. I reverently await the imperial decree and hereby return the *Yellow Register* documents.

Having received the sagely decree, I humbly comply with your humble servant’s request.

I, Shi Tan, deeply reflect that the divine traces of the Mao Lords and their profound vows have endured from the Han and Jin dynasties to the present, spanning over a thousand years. The common people have received their beneficence, and neither war nor plague has arisen. When drought or excessive rain disrupts the seasons, the prefectures and counties make their pleas, and their prayers are answered as swiftly as an echo. Their altars stand like tripods in the temple courtyards, truly serving as the foundation of governance.

In recent days, however, the altars have fallen into neglect, their incense and offerings grown sparse. This ancient and renowned mountain is cause for sighing. Moreover, of late, fierce winds and torrential rains have afflicted the land, and the frontier beacons remain unsettled. Though I, Shi Tan, dwell in humble obscurity, I am filled with trepidation day and night. My love for the sovereign and concern for the nation leave me with no means of effectual service—only the ability to concentrate my singular devotion and secretly implore the Three Perfected Lords. In all my waking and resting moments, I have never ceased.

I rely upon the divine power of the immortals to assist in harmonious order, present auspicious omens, and protect the grand enterprise, securing the enduring fortune of the imperial house.

I, Shi Tan, am but a feeble and declining old man, unworthily dwelling in this blessed land. Repeatedly, I have received your abundant grace, yet my repayment is but a drop in the ocean. How could I presume to accept such extraordinary favor?

Fortunately, Your Sacred Majesty has already revoked the gracious command and bestowed honor upon the immortal lords. If I do not humbly comply with this decree, I fear I shall incur the reproach of deceiving the throne. It is my duty to persist in refusal, even at the cost of my life.

I respectfully return the three *Daoist Records* and *Yellow Registers* previously bestowed upon me, along with this memorial. I beseech Your Majesty to graciously consider my plea, discerning that my loyalty is not a pretense for seeking undeserved honor, and to revoke the decree of bestowal. May a luminous edict be issued, conferring the title of *Perfected Lord* upon them. Let this be proclaimed to all relevant offices and announced throughout the realm, thereby manifesting the sagely ruler’s intent to honor the Dao for the people, revealing the Three Mao Lords’ responsiveness to the world and their protective power over the nation, and securing the imperial house’s boundless prosperity for a myriad of years. This is my utmost wish.

Respectfully submitted to the *Du Zhi Ti Ju Tai Wei* for memorialization. I humbly await your decree for implementation.

Respectfully submitted.

Two copies of the ministry’s document are enclosed: one for the Jiangning Prefecture, and one for the mountain itself.

On the twenty-eighth day of the intercalary second month, the imperial decree was issued, and the bestowal of titles upon the Three Mao Perfected Lords was decreed:

*Taiyuan Wondrous Dao Perfected Person of Serene Emptiness, Eastern Marchmount Supreme Minister, Director of Destinies*, shall be further honored with the title *Sacred Protector*.

The *Dinglu Right Prohibitions Supreme Dao Serene Emptiness Perfected Person* shall be further honored with the title *Virtue-Protector*. The *Three Officials Life-Securing Subtle Emptiness Perfected Person* shall be further honored with the title *Benevolence-Protector*.

The above is issued to Jiangning Prefecture for implementation accordingly. One copy is to be delivered to Chongxi Abbey.

On a day in the third month of the ninth year of Chunyou, the provincial document is returned to Jiangning Prefecture for memorialization.

**Memorial from Maoshan Chongxi Abbey:**
On the fifteenth day of this month, we received two documents from the Privy Council and the Ministry, one for this abbey and one for the prefectural authorities, concerning the imperial decree issued on the twenty-eighth day of the intercalary second month, which bestowed additional honorific titles upon the Three Mao Perfected Lords of Destiny of this mountain. This matter requires submission and compliance.

One provincial document is hereby enclosed and returned to Jiangning Prefecture. We humbly request that it be forwarded to the local Daoist Rectification Bureau, with instructions to notify all official abbeys, temples, and hermitages under its jurisdiction, ensuring universal awareness. We dare not act without authorization and await your esteemed command.

On a day in the third month of the ninth year of Chunyou,
*Master of the Numinous Treasure* (Lingbao Dashi), appointed *Chief Daoist Rectifier of Maoshan and Supervisor of Chongxi Abbey and all abbeys of this mountain*, Ye Xipeng, respectfully submits.

**Further Memorial:**
Upon receipt of the Inner Ministry’s proclamation, we received the imperial decree announcing the bestowal of additional titles upon the Three Mao Perfected Lords. Two provincial documents were issued, with instructions to first deliver them for custody, and to report their receipt upon completion.

On a day in the third month, we reverently complied.

**Memorial on the Receipt of the Bestowed Provincial Documents for the Additional Titles:**

Your servant, Shi Tan, respectfully declares:
On the twentieth day of this month, by command of the *Director of Destinies and Chief Commander* (Du Zhi Ti Ju Tai Wei), we received the imperial proclamation. By the grace of His Majesty, the Three Mao Perfected Lords of Destiny have been further honored with the six-character sacred titles: *Sacred Protector*, *Virtue-Protector*, and *Benevolence-Protector*. Two provincial documents were issued, with instructions for your servant to take custody of them first. I have reverently received one copy and delivered it to Chongxi Abbey, to be announced to all abbeys of this mountain for universal awareness. The other copy has been submitted to the prefectural authorities.

Your servant is profoundly grateful for the imperial favor, profoundly grateful for the imperial favor.

Upon the arrival of the sacred command at this mountain, I shall personally lead the entire mountain’s Daoist community in offering incense, holding purification rites, and ascending the peak to perform the jiao offering, reverently praying for the eternal longevity of His Majesty and the everlasting prosperity of the imperial realm.

Your servant is overwhelmed with awe and gratitude, prostrate in reverence.

With utmost trepidation, I humbly submit this memorial for your august consideration.

Respectfully submitted.

On a day in the third month of the ninth year of Chunyou.

Memorial of Gratitude for Promotion to Left-Street Daolu

Your servant Shi Tan respectfully states: By the sacred grace of His Majesty, an edict of exhortation on yellow paper has been bestowed, specially promoting your servant to the office of Left-Street Daolu, charged with oversight of the Three Administrations of the Teachings. Though I have repeatedly submitted memorials to decline, the imperial command has twice forbidden my refusal. I have already reverently received the favor from afar, gazing toward the imperial court in gratitude.

I humbly reflect: The Great Dao is nameless, yet how dare I covet the seclusion of mountain forests? Even small virtues are recorded, and I have been specially elevated to the ranks of the Left Street—an honor most esteemed by the scholarly world, yet never within the hopes of my humble life. Though I sought to decline, I could not, and upon hearing the command, I was struck with awe.

With profound gratitude, I bow in reverence.

I recall that my knowledge is neither comprehensive nor enlightened, my talents neither vast nor far-reaching. By nature, I have been content with the simplicity of caves and grottoes, my learning insufficient to bridge the wisdom of past and present. Yet my aspirations have ever been to aid the times, my loyalty to repay the realm. In this late age of sagely brilliance, I have basked in the radiance of sun and moon. Though I possess no merit or ability, I have been undeservedly favored with the heavy trust of imperial office. Even as I feared the lightness of my own wings, the yellow-paper edict arrived, further increasing the weight of my title. I now follow the pure fragrance of emptiness and tranquility, treading in the footsteps of those who preserved authenticity. The news, spreading through the wilds, seemed like the tale of Huayang of old; the cap of office and the sighs of refinement spoke of a new splendor in the titles of immortals. Though duty compels me to decline no further, I fear the punishment that may come from such high rank. Reluctantly, I gaze toward the court and receive the command with solemnity, yet like one seated upon a mat of thorns, I find no ease.

This is all due to the virtue of Your Imperial Majesty, which suffuses harmony and balance, while your transformative influence flows in purity and stillness. You eternally uphold the wondrous mysteries of the Three Absences, fulfilling reverent devotion; you justly order the flourishing of all affairs, leaving not even the smallest detail unattended. Thus, even one as decrepit as I am bathed in the light of imperial grace.

How dare I not redouble my efforts to emulate the ancients and preserve what little remains of my integrity? Though I have not yet cast aside my official’s cap, I shall add incense to the censer of ten thousand years. Though this old horse is weary, how could I dare betray the favor of the Ninefold Throne?

Your servant is overwhelmed with awe and gratitude, prostrate in reverence.

With utmost trepidation, I humbly submit this memorial of gratitude for your august consideration.

Respectfully submitted.

On a day in the third month of the ninth year of Chunyou.

Newly promoted Left-Street Daolu, Master of the Cavernous Subtleties, Master of the Vacant Luminosity Studio, Eminent Scholar charged with oversight of the Teachings, your servant Situ Shi Tan respectfully memorializes.

The Ministry of Rites has transmitted three edicts conferring the title of Perfected Lord, along with official documents bestowing ceremonial gifts. By imperial decree, the Eminent Scholar Situ is to be informed, and the edicts of investiture, along with the items for the jiao offering—incense, tea, and other bestowed articles—are to be delivered as listed. Please acknowledge receipt and memorialize in reply.

On a day in the third month, with reverent compliance by Yanqing. Three edicts enclosed.

Decree:
We have heard that the Perfected Ones ride the wind and mount the dark, their spirits roaming beyond the Eight Extremities, yet with a single thought for the living, they remain ever present. The Supreme Prime Mysterious Dao, Tranquil Emptiness Perfected Lord, Eastern Marchmount Upper Minister, Director of Destinies Divine Lord attained the Dao at Mount Mao, was registered in the Immortal Bureau, and stands foremost among the Three Lords. His wondrous efficacy has been manifest through successive dynasties, and near and far he is revered as the Director of Destinies.

Out of Our ceaseless admiration for the common people, We specially command the relevant offices to bestow upon him an exalted title, thereby manifesting Our reverence. Let him be specially enfeoffed as the Supreme Prime Mysterious Dao, Tranquil Emptiness, Sagely Protection Perfected Lord, Eastern Marchmount Upper Minister, Director of Destinies Divine Lord.

Decree:
We have heard that the Divine Lords of the Three Peaks of Jurong are most illustrious, and for this reason, the Golden Altar Grotto-Heaven bears its name—an object of admiration through the ages, not merely in Our time. The Register-Fixed, Right-Forbidden, Supreme Dao, Tranquil Stillness Perfected Lord cultivated the Dao and attained realization, known as the Central Mao. His responses to prayers for rain and sunshine have been efficacious, and near and far he is held in virtue.

We urgently command the bestowal of an exalted title to reciprocate these great blessings. Let him embody Our intent and further conceal his hidden efficacy among the people. Let him be specially enfeoffed as the Register-Fixed, Right-Forbidden, Supreme Dao, Tranquil Stillness, Virtue-Protection Perfected Lord.

Decree:
We have heard that Emperor Wu of Han sacrificed to the Divine Lord in the forbidden precincts, his invocations most secret, for the purpose of seeking blessings. We do not act thus. The Three Officials, Life-Preserving, Subtle and Wondrous, Balanced Wisdom Perfected Lord, whose true wind and Dao are profound, is styled the Lesser Mao Lord.

On the twenty-third day of the fourth month, the *jiazi* day of the sexagenary cycle, Daoist masters and townsfolk from the various mountains gathered to reverently welcome the imperial proclamation. The ritual was to be announced at the Three Peaks, but continuous wind and rain had persisted. On the twenty-second day, the *gaoshi* ascended the altar and urgently submitted a memorial to borrow fair weather. By the fifth watch the next morning, drums were sounded to assemble the crowd, and the overnight rain ceased. The sky cleared, revealing bright daylight. The *gaoshi* personally led the abbots and senior Daoists from the mountain’s temples and hermitages, along with the elders and common folk of the town, to the Welcoming Pavilion outside the mountain. There, they set up incense burners, floral canopies, banners, flags, gongs, drums, cymbals, and ceremonial music. The procession included the ritual regalia and attendants, as well as officials from Changning Town of the mountain, who led soldiers with banners, drums, and an escort of over a thousand men. Spectators from near and far gathered like a wall. That day, the weather was clear and mild, auspicious mist swirled like a painting, cranes cried in the clear sky, and a white hare appeared atop the peak.

The proclamation was first welcomed to the gate of Chongxi Abbey. The *gaoshi*, leading the abbots and senior Daoists from the various mountains, along with the laity, faced the imperial palace to express gratitude. Cheers of "Long live the Emperor!" resounded. They then ascended Great Mao Peak to perform the rites, proclaiming the imperial mandate and presenting the sacred vessels. They proceeded to Middle Mao Peak and Small Mao Peak, where the rituals were conducted as before.

**Prayer for Great Peak**

In the ninth year of the *Chunyou* reign of the Great Song, the *jiyou* year of the sexagenary cycle, on the twenty-third day of the fourth month—the *jiazi* day of the *renyin* new moon—the newly appointed *Zuojie Daolu* of the Left Street, Master of the Cave Mystery, *Xubai Zhai Gaoshi*, Administrator of Daoist Affairs, Minister Situ Shitan, respectfully bows his head, prostrates, and speaks:

I have heard that the wondrous Dao is concealed in namelessness, yet by force of will it is called great. True immortals treasure obscurity; why should they seek to display their radiance? Yet to turn the heart toward the vast emptiness, one must for a time stir the senses with brilliance.

May you worthily receive the luminous decree, be specially promoted with illustrious titles, and uphold the grand rites of rare splendor—truly a great ceremony of radiant continuity.

We reverently invoke the **Supreme Primordial Dao, Profoundly Empty and Sagely Protector True Lord**, **Eastern Peak Supreme Minister and Controller of Destiny Divine Lord**: your office governs the vast heavens, your teachings unify mountains and rivers. At the summit of Mount Juqu, you establish your administrative seat for celestial record-keeping. Your blessings extend to all things, your virtue reaches the multitudes. You engrave purple jade, inscribe golden tablets, your brilliance outshines the Nine Bestowals. Your green banners flutter, your embroidered plumes gather, summoning and commanding the ten thousand spirits. Though your immortal titles are already exalted, we fear the court’s honors may yet fall short. Now His Majesty, treasuring thoughts of the wondrous Dao and surpassing the virtue of former emperors, reverently inherits the will of the sagely ancestors and dares to offer sacrifices upon perilous, famed mountains. Having prayed for blessings on behalf of the people, he now performs these rites to manifest your merit—resplendent eulogies, grandly proclaimed. Thus the sagely one reveals the fullness of the Nine Virtues, and the daily protector displays mercy to all living beings. Rainbow phoenixes bear invitations in their beaks, white cranes soar through the sky to witness below. Heaven and humanity rejoice in your grace; mountains and peaks glow with honor.

We reverently ascend the sacred peak to proclaim the imperial mandate. The blessings we seek are humbly offered for the radiant court.

We pray that His Majesty’s precious reign may extend in grandeur, that the sacred succession may be crowned with felicity, that weapons of war be forever sheathed, and that the winds of transformation may prevail in due season. May the harvests be ever abundant, and the people enjoy the joys of *Huaxu*. Thereafter, may those who cultivate truth and the loftiest Daoist adepts all ascend to the causes of supreme goodness and together partake in the blessings of long life.

This minister, overwhelmed with deepest reverence, respectfully bows his head, prostrates, and speaks.

**Prayer for the Second Peak**

[Text identical to the preceding until:]
We reverently invoke the **Recorder of Destinies, Right Custodian of the Forbidden, Profoundly Serene and Virtue-Protector True Lord**: born of the primordial void, endowed with divine virtue, you received your mandate in the script of purple and white, and govern from the Palace of Pure Emptiness. The strains of lutes and pipes flow forth, your person delights in the feasts of the Jasper Terrace. Wind and rain arrive in their seasons; your blessings already suffuse the people and all things. Charged with overseeing the tasks of the upper immortals and the achievements of the Right Forbiddance, though your celestial titles are already exalted, we fear the court’s honors may yet fall short. Now the Emperor, treasuring thoughts of the wondrous Dao and surpassing the virtue of former emperors, reverently inherits the will of the sagely ancestors and dares to offer sacrifices upon perilous, famed mountains. Having prayed for blessings on behalf of the people, he now performs these rites to manifest your merit—resplendent eulogies, grandly proclaimed. Your illustrious virtue overflows in all directions; your divine protection is manifest beyond measure. Rainbow phoenixes bear invitations in their beaks, white cranes soar through the sky to witness below. Heaven and humanity rejoice in your grace; mountains and peaks glow with honor.

We reverently ascend the sacred peak to proclaim the imperial mandate. [Remainder identical to the preceding.]

**Prayer for the Third Peak**

[Text identical to the preceding until:]
We reverently invoke the **Three Officials, Life-Preserving, Subtly Wondrous, Profoundly Wise and Benevolence-Protector True Lord**: marked by brilliant talent and outstanding purity, your deeds encompass all that is pure. You oversee the records in the Jade Nectar archives and received your investiture at the Golden Portal. The Dao flourishes in all things; the benevolent embrace culture. Your domain extends across the Six Heavens; your position is exalted as the Preserver of Life. Your decrees are jointly received in the script of purple and white; your governance extends to the Eternal Realm. Though your immortal titles are already exalted, we fear the court’s honors may yet fall short. Now the Emperor, treasuring thoughts of the wondrous Dao and surpassing the virtue of former emperors, reverently inherits the will of the sagely ancestors and dares to offer sacrifices upon perilous, famed mountains. Having prayed for blessings on behalf of the people, he now performs these rites to manifest your merit—resplendent eulogies, grandly proclaimed. The rites of venerating the true are fully observed, perfectly revealing the numinous blessings of protection. The inner teachings are harmonized; the outer doctrines are pacified. Such is the perfection of benevolence—violence and harm do not arise. The black-haired people receive your moisture; what is this if not protection? White cranes soar through the sky nearby, receiving the rainbow phoenixes’ offered invitations. Heaven and humanity rejoice in your grace... [Remainder identical to the preceding.]

**Concluding the First Scroll of the Rites for the Ennoblement of the Three Mao Lords**
**Beginning the Second Scroll of the Rites for the Ennoblement of the Three Mao Lords**

**Rites for the Celebratory Offering of the Ennobled Sacred Titles of the Three Mao Lords**

The ritual proceeds as customary until the Invocation of the Sages:

We have heard that Heaven blesses the imperial house, safeguarding the myriad states’ black-haired people, and that the state exalts its rites, honoring the mountains and rivers of the four directions. No spirit is left unvenerated; all blessings arrive in full.

Rolling up the abode of the perfected immortals, the famed peaks of Mount Juqu rise in majesty. The halls of medicine and courtyards of lingzhi are ever solemn in their sacrifices; the wheels of the august chariot and the revered carriage arrive in timely response to the numinous end. Now, in this enlightened and sagely reign, we perform the rites of luminous harmony in full. Edicts are issued in abundance; illustrious titles are bestowed. The Grand Diviner is charged to select an auspicious day; the officials are commanded to prepare the rites. Jade orchids glisten with purity, awaiting the ascent of sheng pipes and cranes; the radiant grasses of the grottoes gleam, as flutes and phoenixes gather in formation.

We, your servants, reverently receive the imperial mandate and humbly address the true numina. With minds purified and blue petitions prepared, we now solemnly proclaim the invocation.

**Invocation**

The intent of these words is set forth in full, revealing our utmost devotion. May your profound hearing and supreme wisdom deign to heed and reflect upon them.

We have heard that the hidden virtue of the ten thousand beings warms, stills, and tranquilizes the spirits within the jade chambers; that the Nine Virtues are embodied in full, their radiance inscribed upon cinnabar and quartz. Brocade-feathered palanquins float through the void, treading upon the light; green banners and purple standards seal the mountains and summon the clouds. Descending to sport upon the Red City, they now alight upon the Jade Grotto.

The sagely sovereign, gazing upon Heaven’s loving heart, privately unfurls the map of Earth’s depths. Thus, illustrious titles are bestowed, and wondrous traces are exalted. The rites of luminous harmony are perfected; fragrant offerings are presented in abundance. Illustrious virtue is ever fragrant; utmost sincerity knows no end. Today, on this [day] of the [month], as the Dao is practiced, we, the assembled ritualists, now offer the first pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend to serve the **Primordial Mystery Dao, Tranquil and Vacuous, Sagely Protector, True and Responsive Perfected Lord; Supreme Minister of the Eastern Marchmount, Controller of Destinies; High Perfected of the Primordial Mansion**. Through the power of this Dao, we pray for the emperor’s sacred longevity without end.

We humbly beseech that the true end may descend in response, manifesting its luminous regard. May auspicious radiance flow forth, truly fulfilling the favor of the Nine Heavens. May vast blessings be bestowed, and the era of ten thousand years of life be eternally proclaimed. May joy and tranquility extend to the four quarters, and may all things rejoice in harmony.

We have heard that golden light conceals the luminous, journeying together through the vast caverns of Heaven; that purple silk unfurls its patterns to display the virtue of the divine and bright. Now, the manifest register is proclaimed anew, further exalting the honored titles. Clothed in the numinous precincts with reverence, may the assembled immortals rejoice together.

Today, on this [day] of the [month], as the Dao is practiced, we, the assembled ritualists, now offer the second pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend to serve the **Recorder of Destinies, Rightward Guardian of the Most Perfect Dao, Tranquil and Virtuous, Wondrously Responsive Perfected Lord; High Immortal of the Mansion of Destinies**. Through the power of this Dao, we pray for the empress. May her achievements be inscribed upon tripods and bells, her virtue surpassing the sands of the rivers. May her great and unshakable foundation be ever exalted; may her boundless and grand reign be eternally preserved. May the spirits and ancestral forebears come to feast and bring peace; may the altars of soil and grain and the ancestral shrines be secure and enduring. May the palace of pepper blossoms be blessed with felicity, its demeanor a model for the myriad states. May the jade branches flourish; may the root and branches endure for a hundred generations.

We have heard that the Lord of Mount Tai encompasses all, presiding over the profound depths of the divine palaces of the Upper Mansion; that he holds the golden register of seals and plants the precious dragon lingzhi and grotto grasses. His civil virtue is imbued with benevolence; his martial prowess is awe-inspiring. The Nine Steps are adorned with rites of exaltation; the hearts of the people cherish the sincerity of repentance and rejoicing. With reverence, we purify the orchid precincts and humbly present the aquatic offerings.

Today, on this [day] of the [month], as the Dao is practiced, we, the assembled ritualists, now offer the third pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend to serve the **Three Officials, Protectors of Life, Subtly Wondrous, Tranquilly Wise, Benevolently Protective, Spiritually Responsive Perfected Lords; True Immortals of the Mansion of Life Protection**. Through the power of this Dao, may they guide and welcome the luminous sun, bestowing blessings upon the common people. May weapons and illness not arise; may rain and sunshine arrive in due season. May the Three Luminaries remain whole, and cold and heat be regulated; may the Five Grains ripen, and grasses and trees flourish. May the ten thousand things be nurtured and all prosper; may not a single person be left without shelter. May all be auspicious and without misfortune; may every action be accomplished.

**Great Thanksgiving**

We, your servants, dwell in blessed lands and receive the teachings of the true immortals. We have glimpsed the secret texts of the towering peaks and been entrusted with the supreme Dao of the Jade Youths. Humbly charged with prayers and supplications, we rely upon the power of spiritual resonance.

Unworthy though we are to receive the bestowal of worldly rank, how dare we betray the weight of our masters’ grace? Reverently receiving the enlightened edict, we hasten to present the register of exaltation. With hearts full of celebratory reverence, we greatly expound the meaning of the numinous response, striving to express our sincerest devotion and repay the abundant blessings.

Now, the emperor deigns to regard the famed mountains and reverently honor the true protectors. The edict, warm with six characters, gloriously enhances the illustrious titles; the three peaks, adorned with imperial splendor, are suffused with the pure fragrance of the imperial censer. The rites are solemnly prepared; the grand names are reverently offered. Our sentiments are expressed in words; our reverence is manifest in the ritual objects.

We, your servants, have received and proclaimed the secret decree, extending our welcome to the exalted perfected. We earnestly hope that you will deign to regard our intent and fulfill our wishes. May the emperor’s life span equal that of the Eastern Dipper and Weaver Maid; may his blessings extend to the Chinese and the barbarians alike. May the six palaces dream of propitious omens; may the four frontiers be pacified of serpents and boars. May the Xiongnu submit at the frontier passes, sparing the need for Han envoys; may the many officials fill the courts, restoring the grandeur of the Zhou dynasty. May the altars of soil and grain enjoy enduring blessings; may the spring and autumn records proclaim years of great abundance.

May all beings, even those in flight or afloat, preserve their lives in full.

Above, may this manifest the compassion of the Three Perfected; below, may it accord with the emperor’s utmost sincerity.

We humbly submit this memorial for Your attention.

**Twelve Vows:**
May the incense burner be restored as in the usual rite.
May the celebration liturgy and jiao offering be conducted.
May the *Weiling Chi* be recited, and the burner kindled as in the established form.
May the officials be dispatched.

We reverently issue forth from our bodies as in the usual form, and with one heart ascend to address the sacred thrones of the Three Lords:

By karmic affinity of former lives, we have presumptuously followed the teachings and the Dharma. On the day of our covenant, we pledged to uphold our practice, vowing to propagate the true wind of the Dao, to invigorate and spread its great transformation, to eternally support the imperial destiny, and to universally benefit all living beings. Whatever we pray for, we duly report and memorialize.

We now reverently proclaim the emperor’s secret decree, declaring his illustrious investiture. We humbly present the rites of celebration and repentance, that the great blessings of response may be gathered.

Herewith, we prostrate and offer one document of blue-green prayer-text, beseeching the *Gongcao* messengers to specially transmit and swiftly convey it upward.

Each states his dharma-rank:

Your subjects, the variously ranked ministers, ascend to address the Three Lords and the Perfected Saints of the Grotto-Heavens:

We have heard that the Nine Virtues’ merits are lofty, and the Supreme Thearch bestows upon them the Nine Gifts; the Three Officials bear heavy responsibilities, and the Perfected Sovereign receives the scriptures of the Three Origins. The Dao’s beginning is taught by the Lord of Total Perfection; the Registers’ completion is transmitted by the Queen Mother of the West. By relinquishing all attachment to human rank, one attains the position of the Immortal Capital. Jade chambers and coral halls govern the lineage of the Crimson City and the Jade Grotto; phoenix marrow and cinnabar elixirs gather in feasts at the Golden Altar of Mount Goulou. Adorned with the insignia of *Yuyi* and *Jielin*, one obtains the protection of the sun’s radiance and the moon’s splendor, transforming the lands south of the Yangtze and bestowing blessings upon the august realm. The winds of the Celestial Market are pure, and celestial music is played in the empty sky; the waves of Dongting Lake are vast, and the paths connect to the Yin Palaces within the earth. The Blue Lad leaves traces of his whirlwind chariot; the White Crane manifests its soaring form. By talismanic methods, the qi of a thousand demons is expelled; by divine transformation, the hearts of the hundred clans are harmonized. Though we have heard that their traces appear among humans, they never depart from the divine realm above. Where there is sincerity, there is response; no wish goes unfulfilled.

Now the emperor, with a single mind in profound resonance, gazes afar at the Three Radiant Ones. As he encounters this era of flourishing brightness, he recalls the immortals of virtue and the Dao. He initiates grand rites and presents a resplendent memorial, embodying the beauty of emptiness, tranquility, and wisdom, advancing the title of sagely virtue, benevolence, and protection. The imperial mandate descends from Heaven; the jade tablets illuminate the peaks of Long. They enhance the brilliance of the myriad summits and renew the gaze of ten thousand eyes. Having purified the sacred precinct, we respond to the imperial command. We humbly extend our rites of celebration and repentance, reverently offering fragrant incense. The incense curls upward from the renowned peaks, joining the music of the simurgh pipes; the prayer-texts chant in the empty void, summoning the crane-drawn chariots to descend.

Overwhelmed with utmost fervor and urgency, we bow twice and submit this petition.

**First Offering**

We have heard that Heaven and humanity dwell in separate realms, divided by the Two Modes and Four Images, yet brothers may ascend together as immortals, a rare convergence once in a thousand years. Their fraternal love is recorded in the *Yao Ji*, and their divine traces remain unvanished in Huayang. Through generations, they have been revered; in this imperial dynasty, they are honored with rites.

We humbly recall the Ancestral Master, the Three Mao Lords of Life and Destiny, the Sagely Virtue and Benevolent Protector Perfected Lords. Born of the primordial void, their aspirations soared to pure emptiness. In ancient times, their praises were foretold in the songs of Jiaping; later, they ascended in succession from the peaks of Juqu. Immortal guests and fellow adepts pledged their visits, while the people of Wu and Yue were all brought under their scrutiny. Each year, in the radiant spring month, they ride the boundless winds, jade pendants to the left, golden bells to the right, leading eight simurghs through the celestial vastness. To the west, they visit Mount Emei; to the east, they bind Linwu, manifesting three cranes upon the peaks. Not only do they wield authority over fortune and misfortune, but they also govern the mechanisms of good and ill, bringing peace to the people, benefit to all things, safeguarding the state, and securing the household. The transformative power of the Dao flows unseen; their merit is accomplished without dominion.

Now, the Emperor stores the essence of the wondrous Dao, surpassing the virtue of former sovereigns. Ever mindful of the challenges of pacification, he reverently serves the true numina. Having secretly received their protection, he fittingly fulfills his devotion. From the nine-tiered palace, grace is bestowed; upon the three peaks, jubilation resounds. Thus, we repay the virtue of aiding the times and pray for the blessings of national protection. With solemnity, we purify the altar and reverently present the ritual mat.

We, who equally partake in the imperial transformation and are fortunate to dwell upon these renowned mountains, look up to the true spirits of the grotto-heavens, responding to the Emperor’s gracious mandate. May you deign to regard us with favor and graciously accept our earnest prayers. The blue-green memorial is prepared; we shall now proclaim its words.

**Proclamation of the Memorial**

As the text fully states, our sincere devotion is set forth in vermilion earnestness. May it ascend to the profound and tranquil, assuredly receiving your luminous regard.

We have heard that the sagely leave no traces, yet some descend into the dusty world; the great Dao is beyond naming, yet how could it seek renown in an age of sagacity? Now, the Emperor personally practices compassion and frugality, his wisdom and insight far-reaching. He revives the winds of purity and stillness, exalting a culture grown thin and shallow. Revering the footsteps of the immortal perfected, he enacts the grand rites of rare splendor. Thus, he honors the Three Lords, revealing their numinous power through the ages. Auspicious responses have graced four emperors of this dynasty, and their blessings have nourished the grasses and roots of Jiangzuo. Therefore, he bestows illustrious titles and elevates their sacred designations.

We further pray that, without forgetting their origins, they will regard the imperial heart, dispatching commands to the Kunlun terraces and summoning the divine peaks to descend. May they aid in the manifold mysteries, drawing forth abundant blessings, ensuring the flourishing of the jade lineage and the enduring prosperity of the imperial enterprise. May we forever rely upon the great Dao and bring to fruition its grand designs.

Overwhelmed with utmost fervor and urgency, we bow twice and submit this petition.

**Second Offering**

We have heard that immortality may be learned, with predestined names inscribed in the mysterious charts, and that brothers may ascend together, their steadfast resolve often rewarded by virtuous deeds. Beholding the beauty of Heaven and humanity, they attain the true realm of the imperial abode. Since records began, their renown has been especially resplendent.

We now reflect upon the virtue of the Three Lords, whose fragrance endures through ten thousand generations. Their Dao sustains the state and household, their kindness flows to the people and all things. By night, their cinnabar radiance shines unbroken; in spring, their crane-drawn chariots return in procession. They serve their masters and roam together; those who love the Dao are entrusted with its stewardship. Mountains and rivers remain unchanged; Heaven and Earth are without end.

Now, the Emperor, deeply moved by true blessings, diligently performs rites of gratitude. Twin simurghs bear the auspicious writs upon jade steps; crane attendants soar through the void, conveying imperial decrees to the jade grottoes. Daoists and laity alike fill the roads with joyous cries; the ritual observances are reverently offered upon the sacred mats. May the profound regard of the immortals descend, bestowing ever-increasing blessings.

We, entrusted with proclaiming the sagely mandate, look up to aid the immortal enterprise. The cavern bells and jade chimes echo with numinous clarity; mountain herbs and stream offerings present their fragrant sincerity. We humbly hope for the elixir’s grace; the embroidered feathers ascend to the celestial chariots. Auspicious wonders are offered upon the earth; sacred longevity is bestowed to equal Heaven. May the vast beneficence nurture all life; may the imperial enterprise endure for a hundred million years. Five winds and ten rains do not shatter the clods with their sighs; the four seas and nine provinces are all thatched with tribute. The palace halls rejoice in the birth of sons; the frontier defenses proclaim the merit of subduing the barbarians. The harvests are abundant; the black-haired people are at peace.

We further pray that the sacred mountains remain serene, the true teachings spread far, transforming the demonic and the vulgar to reform their hearts, guiding disciples to advance in the Dao. May all creatures, flying and hidden, fulfill their natures; may plants and trees revive. May all sentient beings together ride the wondrous shade.

Overwhelmed with utmost fervor and earnest prayer, we bow twice and submit this petition.

**Final Offering**

We, who reverently attend the imperial decrees and grandly proclaim the illustrious titles, have set forth the ritual observances and extended our hospitality to the immortal perfected. We have received the favor of the successive sages and fulfilled the joyous aspirations of all.

Now, the lamp flames fade like orchid embers, and the fragrant incense disperses like clouds. The immortal retinue departs in the distance; we gaze after their numinous radiance and bow in reverence. With deepest respect, we receive the grand favor and look up longingly to the simurgh chariots.

Overwhelmed with utmost yearning and gratitude, we bow twice and humbly take our leave.

**Sending Forth the Immortals**
The inner officials restore the incense burners as customary. The rites of celebration and the jiao offering conclude.

**The Emperor’s Blue-Green Memorial for the Jiao Offering**

We humbly consider that the sagely are boundless, roaming the emptiness of the eight directions, and the great Dao is beyond naming, yet we earnestly yearn for it with devoted hearts. Rightly relying upon the protection of the divine spirits, we fittingly present this luminous memorial. Thus, we enact illustrious titles and reverently offer the ritual mat, solemnly extending our rites of celebration and repentance, praying for enduring blessings.

Where goodness and benefit are bestowed, the blessings of the black-haired people are secured; where pure felicity descends, the prosperity of the imperial line is further prolonged.

The Director of the Inner Court, Zhang, presents the memorial for the jiao offering.

**From the *Ji Feng Shan Ji*:**

It is recorded that the mountain’s form resembles the character *ji*, hence its name, Juqu. Arrayed in solemn ranks, it embodies the true wind of immortals and sages. Though its three titles differ, they together illumine the splendor of this grand rite. Now that the ceremonial offerings are complete, we dare to present these wondrous oblations. Reverently receiving the enlightened decree of the august court, we respectfully proclaim the conferral of titles.

We humbly pray that the exalted immortals, in their radiant presence, may peer into the unseen and lend their hidden support. May the imperial reign endure without end, and the greatness of the imperial enterprise expand boundlessly. May the three seasons bring no harm, and the people and all beings forever enjoy abundance and peace.

**Memorial for the Jiao Offering at Chongxi Abbey**

We humbly consider that the imperial edict descends like jade tones, bestowing three titles to honor the true ones, while the golden registers of Chongxi Abbey preside over the peaks to invoke blessings upon the sage. Reverently receiving the gracious mandate, we aspire to aid the immortal’s work. Your humble servant, fortunate to serve in this enlightened age and entrusted with the keys of the teaching, witnesses this momentous rite, which illumines the sacred traces of a thousand ages. Thus, the divine and the numinous alike receive the protection of virtue and benevolence. In divining the years and generations, may the auspicious continuity of the imperial line forever endure.

With utmost sincerity, we pour forth our joyful praises and offer these refined oblations. May the incense of the grotto-heavens waft afar, amplifying the chorus of "ten thousand years," and may the winds of the Dao-realm blow pure, spreading blessings as grass grows in spring.

**Memorial of Gratitude for the Conferral of Titles upon the Patriarchal Perfected Lords**

Your servant, Master Tan, respectfully states: By the sagely grace of the throne, the three Mao Perfected Lords have been honored with august titles, and three proclamations have been issued. Bestowed are a *ruyi*, a jade scepter, regalia, brocade, *chenxiang* wood, *naozi* incense, fresh tea, and silver taels, commanding your servant to conduct a jiao offering in celebration.

Your servant has reverently obeyed the sagely instructions, leading the ritual currents to announce the rites upon the three peaks, proclaiming the imperial mandate and praying for the flourishing of all life.

We humbly reflect that this sacred land, steeped in solemnity, unites the felicitations of the four seas, while the imperial favor, flowing from the throne, extends the exalted titles of the three lords. Daoists and laity rejoice together, and gods and humans alike are moved by this grace.

Your servant offers profound thanks, for this mountain cradles the Jade Grotto’s governance and harbors the Golden Altar’s empty terrace. Crane-drawn chariots visit in turn, their years recorded in the registers of Huayang. The Heavenly Sovereign bestowed his mandate, overseeing the lands of Wu and Yue. The Dao aligns with the immortal lineage, its fragrance flowing through a thousand ages; the numinous source of the true lineage has been favored across successive dynasties.

Now, bearing this extraordinary grace, we exalt the ritual offerings. Thus, the virtues of profound emptiness and tranquil wisdom advance to the title of "Sagely Virtue and Benevolent Protection." The resplendent proclamations descend upon the peaks, and the night rain clears the valleys; the imperial procession halts upon the Daoist path, and the morning sun gleams upon the banners. Auspicious mists and propitious vapors hover around the cranes’ sleeves, while the jade scepter and *ruyi* unfold the grandest of rites.

The rites conclude with harmonious success, the imperial incense wafting its pure fragrance. The feathered ones exchange felicitations, bathed in the glory of the imperial gifts. All appears renewed, and near and far alike rejoice.

This is all due to Your Majesty’s luminous virtue, which venerates the perilous and sacrifices to transform the people through the Dao. Thus, you extend the bestowal of honors to amplify reverence. When the people are joyful, the gods are never unyielding; when all things are prepared, the rites are fulfilled. Your profound favor brings fortune to the mountains and forests, while your boundless grace nourishes even the grasses and trees. The conferral is already vast, and perfect blessings naturally follow.

Your servant, bearing the imperial mandate, ascends the immortal’s court to pray for the sage’s boundless longevity, celebrating the spread of blessings throughout the realm. Moved by the perfected ones’ response to these prayers, may the radiance of the celestial luminaries shine ever brighter.

Your servant, overwhelmed by gratitude for the celestial and imperial favor, is filled with awe and trepidation. With utmost reverence, I kowtow repeatedly and present this memorial in gratitude.

**Submitted by your servant, Sima Shitan, newly promoted Left Street Daoist Registrar, Master of the Cavernous Subtlety, Vacuous White Scholar, and Director of the Teaching Office.**

**Submission Document**

On the twenty-first day of the fourth month, I duly received the official document bearing the sacred edict, which bestowed upon me three decrees of enfeoffment for the Perfected Lords, along with imperial gifts of *ruyi* scepters, jade tablets, brocade robes, ceremonial regalia, agarwood, borneol, choice tea, and silver ingots. The edict commanded me to select an auspicious day to hold a jiao offering and make solemn announcement thereof.

Accordingly, I, your servant, have reverently complied with the imperial instruction, receiving in full the aforementioned decrees, imperial gifts, and precious objects. I then convened the Daoist clergy and laity of Mount Gui to descend the mountain and receive them, facing the imperial palace to express gratitude for the celestial favor. Proceeding to the Three Peaks, I proclaimed the imperial mandate, and in due course selected a day to hold the jiao offering, thereby completing the rites of announcement to Heaven, Earth, and the Immortal Perfected.

I have duly compiled a ritual register, recording in detail the ceremonial procedures and sequence of events. The decrees of enfeoffment were distributed among the Three Peaks, the imperial gifts were displayed, and all were entrusted to the Chongxi Abbey’s Daoist Registrar for permanent enshrinement in this sacred mountain, that the sagely longevity may be eternally extended.

Herewith, I present the inventory ledger from Chongxi Abbey detailing the received items, along with three receipts from the Three Peaks acknowledging the decrees and gifts. I humbly submit this memorial for Your Majesty’s gracious consideration and await your further instruction.

**Memorial on the Erection of the Stele for the Enfeoffment Decrees**

Your servant, Sima Shitan, respectfully states: The triple enfeoffment bestows radiant splendor upon the mountains of Juqu, its glory imperishable as the jade of Kun’gang. Perched upon the sacred tortoise and guarded by feathered cranes, its inscriptions command reverence, while from afar the imperial grace is acknowledged by all under Heaven.

Though the marvels of the Perfected Immortals need no illumination by steles, their merits toward humanity must not be left in obscurity. The five-colored clouds of Han still bear witness to imperial decrees, and the Nine Bestowments of Jin remain engraved in stone. Through successive dynasties, they have been graced with imperial favor. Now, a thousand years later, we are fortunate to live in this sagely era, where their exalted titles are further ennobled, magnifying the recompense to the numinous spirits and redoubling the glory of the supreme teaching.

Thus, I have selected the finest stone, seeking to ensure its endurance coeval with this mountain. This is all due to Your Majesty’s virtue, profound and sagacious, whose mind perceives even the subtlest truths. You harmonize the Three Powers in perfect accord, governing all within the Four Seas with boundless inclusivity. In your daily conduct, you embody the Dao; in repose, you cultivate the flourishing of a hundred aspirations. The people cannot name your virtue, yet you personally achieve the perfection of the Nine Virtues. Humble in your governance, you seek to repay the divine blessings, bestowing timely favors like rain and dew, so that even the mist-laden peaks feel the weight of your grace.

Though I have long been distant from the celestial court, I renew my devotion upon receiving this mandate. Thus, I have carved these imperishable words to serve as an eternal guardian of the imperial majesty among the peaks. I dare to hope that Your Majesty will deign to cast your gaze upon them.

I humbly present this memorial for Your Majesty’s consideration. Overwhelmed by the awe of addressing the imperial throne, I am filled with boundless trepidation.

**With utmost reverence, I kowtow repeatedly and respectfully submit this memorial.**
