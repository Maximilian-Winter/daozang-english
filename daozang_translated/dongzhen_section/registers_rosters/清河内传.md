**The Inner Transmission of Qinghe**

I was originally a man of Wu and Kuaiji, born in the early Zhou dynasty. After seventy-three transformations, I repeatedly took the form of scholar-officials, never oppressing the people or tyrannizing as an official. My nature was stern and my conduct scrutinous—unyielding as autumn frost or the noonday sun.

Later, at the end of the Western Jin, I was reborn between the two commanderies west of Yue and south of Jun. In the dingwei year, on the third day of the second month (jiazi, xinhai), I was born. Auspicious light filled the household, and yellow clouds veiled the fields. My dwelling lay near the sea, and the villagers called me the Old Man of Qinghe, saying, "At sixty, you have been blessed with a noble heir."

In childhood, I disliked play and often longed for mountains and marshes. My speech was often cryptic, as if concealing and revealing truths. I recited books voraciously, and at night, I would avoid other children, laughing and rejoicing alone, my body radiating light. When the villagers came to pray, I would scoff and mock them, crying out, "If mere clay and wood can clothe and feed men, receiving offerings and answering prayers, or inviting slander and misfortune, how can I, a man, lack spirit?"

Thereafter, I dreamed strange dreams at night—sometimes as a dragon, sometimes as a king. Heavenly omens appeared, and I was appointed as the Water Bureau’s Transport Commissioner. Though I found it strange, I did not fully believe it, deeming it a good omen.

Later, when the three harvests failed due to drought and no rain came to revive the land, the people performed the *wuyu* dance and prayed to the gods, but to no avail. I thought, "The dream of governing the Water Bureau must now come to pass." That night, I went to the water’s edge and, using the official title from my dream, presented a document to the River Earl. I was terrified and hesitant, but suddenly, clouds gathered, wind and thunder roared, and an official prostrated before me, asking, "Has the Transport Commissioner moved residence?"

I replied, "It is not I. I am the son of Zhang the Elder, named Ya. Later, through the Water Bureau, I gained recognition, so I style myself Peifu."

The official said, "I am here by command to summon you."

I asked, "What of my family?"

The official replied, "They will arrive at the administrative office first."

Anxious and uneasy, I bowed to the official, who then mounted a white donkey and departed. Lowering my head as I passed through the village lanes, I was swept away by the sound of wind and rain, suddenly losing all trace of my homeland.

I arrived at a mountain range where Sword Ridge met the towering halls of the Star Palace, resembling a phoenix perched below. There was an ancient pool, and the official led me into a vast cavern. At its entrance stood several stalagmites, and the official said, "The people’s prayers are answered when they invoke these stones—they are called Thunder Pillars."

As I tucked up my robes to enter the cavern, the official asked, "Do you recall your seventy-three transformations in the Zhou dynasty, how your family’s hidden virtue has been passed down to this day?"

I suddenly awoke, as if from a dream.

The official said, "In the celestial registers, you are listed among the ranks of the gods, though few in the mortal world know this. The Jin dynasty will soon show signs of revival. You may seek a method to manifest your transformation."

I replied, "I thank the celestial messenger for this revelation."

Upon entering the cavern, I felt as though I had fallen into an abyss a thousand *ren* deep, yet my feet did not touch the ground, as if I were soaring in empty space. There stood a palace fit for a king, guarded by attendants, and I entered. Indeed, my entire family was gathered there. Later, I transformed into a scholar and traveled to Xianyang, where I lectured on the deeds of Yao Chang in *The Inner Transmission of Qinghe*. Those who burn incense must remember this.

**Song Dynasty Decree:**
We consider that the utmost in filial piety and fraternal duty communicates with the divine. Thus, one who is a filial son in life becomes a luminous spirit in death—this is certain.

The Divine, Civil, Martial, Peaceful, Blessed, Loyal, and Benevolent King was renowned for his filial conduct, his numinous power shining over western Shu. He warded off disasters and saved the people, and the fame of the Seven Curves Sacred Mountain spread throughout the world. Scholars who took the examinations and passed all turned to him in reverence.

Possessing filial piety and virtue, his illustrious title is fittingly proclaimed. The people’s petition is just, and he should be restored to his former rank. Reverently receiving this august mandate, may he greatly protect our people. Let him be enfeoffed as before: **Divine, Civil, Martial, Filial, Virtuous, Loyal, and Benevolent King**.

Issued on the twenty-ninth day of the third month in the fifth year of Jingding.

**Decree Conferring Titles upon the Sacred Parents:**
The *Records* state: "There are ten principles in sacrifice, revealing the way of serving ghosts and spirits, and the proper relations between father and son." Thus, those who today offer sacrifices to the gods and also honor their parents uphold the ancient intent.

The father of the Numinous Response Temple’s deity is hereby enfeoffed as **Illustrious Prosperity, Benevolent and Protective, Benevolent and Abundant King**. His mother is enfeoffed as **Luminous Virtue, Accumulated Blessings, Compassionate and Gentle, Reverent and Wise Consort**. They gave birth to a sagely son who presides over the flourishing of culture. From Phoenix Ridge in Jian, they settled the numinous governance of Dragon Mountain. The officials, tracing the origins, have earnestly petitioned. Thus, we bestow these sacrificial favors and illustrious titles, upholding the ancient kings’ teachings of filial piety. Let these titles be specially conferred.

In the fifth year of Xianchun, the fifth month, on a certain day.

**Decree for the Additional Ennoblement of the Divine Consort:**
Sichuan, situated in the earthly region of Kun, has long been devoted to serving the gods with goodness. The state observes its constant rites, wherein a wife’s rank follows her husband’s. Now, on the occasion of the suburban sacrifice, we extend these favors of grace and honor. The Divine Consort of the Numinous Response Temple, **Assisting Compliance, Harmonious Response, Virtue and Wisdom, Luminous and August Consort**, embodies dignity in her demeanor and aids with uprightness. She shares in the sacrifices of Dragon Mountain and brings forth the auspiciousness of Phoenix Pavilion. Her embroidered sashes gleam with splendor, surpassing the eight virtues in their perfection. Her illustrious titles, repeatedly bestowed with favor, now bear twofold beauty in their names. May they forever reflect her virtue and manifestly praise her hidden merits. Let her be specially ennobled as **Reverent Compliance, Gentle Response, Virtue and Wisdom, Luminous and August Consort**.

**Decree for the Additional Ennoblement of the Divine Sons:**
The eldest divine son, **Heir Virtue King**, and the second divine son, **Flourishing Virtue King**, once mirrored the two sons of the ancient governor of Shu, whose meritorious deeds were recorded in the sacrifices of Jingji and Tongliang. Thus, the tradition of a father’s virtue benefiting the people has long endured. You, who receive temple offerings in the west, have inherited and perpetuated this excellence. Your sagely wisdom and numinous radiance shine forth. Now, with the suburban sacrifices completed, we bestow upon you additional illustrious titles. As filial piety is the foundation, we follow the people’s wishes. May you continue to receive offerings and uphold our decree. Let the eldest divine son be specially ennobled as **Heir Virtue, Treading Filial Piety King**, and the second divine son as **Flourishing Virtue, Establishing Filial Piety King**.

**Decree for the Additional Ennoblement of the Divine Sons’ Wives:**
The wife of the eldest divine son, **Goodly Assisting, Manifest and August Lady**, and the wife of the second divine son, **Compliant Assisting, Wise and August Lady**, observe the order of the divine in seniority, as recorded in the ritual classics, and honor the sequence of the divine, as chronicled in historical texts. You, who inherit the hidden virtues of the divine and receive temple offerings in this corner, have extended your beneficence from west to east, widely bestowing your grace. Let your illustrious titles now advance in tandem, equally manifesting your virtuous numen. Let the wife of the eldest divine son be specially ennobled as **Goodly Assisting, Manifest and August, Following Filial Piety Lady**, and the wife of the second divine son as **Compliant Assisting, Wise and August, Achieving Filial Piety Lady**.

**Decree for the Initial Ennoblement of the Divine Daughter:**
The **Pure and True, Wondrously Serene Princess**, as We regulate the fundamental sacrifices, reverently honor the divine in the order of father, sons, and their seniority, and have already bestowed ranks and rewards equally. There remains her younger sister, who stands in attendance by her side. The granting of fiefs and emoluments begins here and now. May she uphold the intent of green-clad devotion and righteousness. Let the divine daughter be specially ennobled as **August and Filial Lady**, and her husband as **Reverent Arrayed Marquis**.

**Decree for the Additional Ennoblement of the Divine Grandsons:**
The eldest divine grandson, **Continuing Response, Luminous Numen Marquis**, the second divine grandson, **Inheriting Response, Proclaiming Numen Marquis**, the wife of the eldest divine grandson, **Gentle Response Lady**, and the wife of the second divine grandson, **Wise Response Lady**.

We reflect that Phoenix Ridge in Jian and Dragon Mountain in Kui, where numinous essence gathers and flourishing beauty emerges, are not unique in this regard. Their ancestors and fathers have all rendered meritorious deeds for the people. How, then, could We withhold ranks and titles from their grandsons and daughters-in-law? Let the eldest divine grandson be specially ennobled as **Continuing Response, Luminous Numen, Utmost Filial Marquis**; the second divine grandson as **Inheriting Response, Proclaiming Numen, Compliant Filial Marquis**; the wife of the eldest divine grandson as **Gentle Response, Continuing Filial Lady**; and the wife of the second divine grandson as **Wise Response, Embodying Filial Lady**.

**Decree for the Additional Ennoblement of Baoshao:**
By the sacred mandate of Heaven, the August Emperor decrees: In the manifest realm, there are rites and music; in the hidden realm, there are gods and spirits. The wondrous and the evident are of one thread. In heaven, they are the stars; on earth, they are the rivers and mountains. Their forms and functions operate between the two realms. How much more do they subtly assist in the great Dao? Thus, there must be grand rites to respond and extol them.

The **Lord Emperor of Culture and Literature of Qiqu Mountain, Wenchang Shrine, Zitong**, whose light is divided among the Zhang constellation and whose friendship is praised in the Zhou odes, has aided Our prosperous fortune with loyalty and filial piety, guiding the people. He wields the literary power of Kun, selecting and nurturing many scholars through civil examinations. In every instance of relieving calamities and distress, he manifests responses to encourage and admonish. The edicts for imperial examinations have been issued twice, and the records for evaluations were established first. Though embellishments have been added to the vast decrees, the illustrious titles have not yet fulfilled Our heart’s intent.

Alas! We desire that talents emerge in succession, and you brilliantly manifest the numen of the Jiang and Han rivers. We desire that the governance of culture shine forth, and you dredge and emit the treasury of the Kui and Bi constellations. May these auspicious signs be attained to answer your honored radiance. Let him be additionally ennobled as **Assisting the Origin, Initiating Transformation, Wenchang, Controller of Emoluments, Vast Benevolence Lord Emperor**.

Executed by the relevant authorities.

On a certain day in the seventh month of the third year of Yanyou.

**Decree for the Additional Ennoblement of the Temple Plaque:**
The Ministry of Rites and Ceremonies of the Central Secretariat has determined that the deity of the Numinous Response Temple of Qiqu Mountain, **Divine, Sagely, Martial, Filial, Loyal, and Benevolent King**, is upright in his numinous efficacy, revered by scholars and officials alike. The court has bestowed favors and honors upon him, which is fitting. Yet, no ennoblement surpasses that of "King," and no praise exceeds that of "Divine." The titles "Sagely, Martial, Filial, Loyal, and Benevolent" encompass all virtues the deity possesses—this may be called perfection. When rank has reached its apex, there is no further addition; when titles have attained their fullest splendor, there is no need for alteration. However, to examine the old records and adopt the name "Assisting Culture and Completing Transformation" for the temple plaque would suffice to manifestly honor the divine, respond to the flourishing fortune, and establish a complete and ultimate ritual order, illuminating boundless reverence.

**Proclamation to the Twenty-One Bureaus:**
We privately reflect that Heaven has inaugurated a prosperous governance, enlightening and clarifying all, and the multitudes gather under the mandate of the Lord Emperor of Culture. The hundred spirits assemble in virtue, truly bestowing upon the edict’s favor. The August Ultimate is now bright, and the Great Stairs are level. The harvests are repeatedly bountiful, and weapons are forever stilled. This may be called following the traces of the Three Dynasties’ prosperous paths.

The Earth’s Divine Pivot has long descended to assist and uphold the Qing Dynasty, its radiance like the resplendent Eastern Wall star, vigorously reviving the Daoist arts. Though unworthy, I have been entrusted with the weighty charge of fostering filial piety and fraternal devotion, governing the lands below. Often I reflect on my inadequacy before the Heavenly Mandate, ever mindful of the solemn weight of the divine office. Recently, I have been graced with imperial favor, bestowed with official rank. The Twenty-One Bureaus, each with its appointed duties, and the hearts of countless millions—how could they remain untouched?

Hitherto, we have administered justice in the unseen realms, leaving none, near or far, unaddressed. Now, we proclaim it in the resplendent court, where claws and fangs are bared, robes and caps stand in solemn array, and countenances are dignified. Hear now, O assembled ministers, and receive this command in silence.

We recall that those who stand in the temple halls to govern together are but a few worthy ones. If there be even one who can reverse the tide of decline, then among the multitudes of ten thousand, you, my lords, are the luminaries of past and present, heroes transcending heaven and earth. Your loyalty and filial piety blaze to the skies, steadfast as the pine and cypress that endure the frost. Your civil and martial virtues sustain the age, like salt and plum that harmonize the broth. Long have you borne extraordinary authority, truly the stalwart guardians of the realm. For your meritorious continuance, how dare we delay in bestowing due reward?

Though you serve as our assisting officials, your mandate in truth derives from Heaven. Upright, discerning, and just, no superfluous words are needed. The Nine Offices of the Shen Terrace shall be divided for strict oversight and impeachment. The Six Ministries of the Northern Bureau shall be charged with the exclusive duty of recommending the worthy. Only those of broad renown, whose conduct and knowledge manifest their virtue, may assist in continuing the legacy of *Assisting Culture and Completing Transformation*, and stand as models in the ranks of the Primordial Bureau’s emoluments.

Those who bestow blessings and encourage goodness shall be rewarded, and their encouragement must be thorough. Those who punish evil and chastise deceit shall be punished, and their chastisement must not be evaded. The Golden Register records emoluments—examine their merits and dispense grace accordingly. The Spring Source inscribes descendants—trace their original intent and determine rewards justly. For those who present filial conduct in the *Guiyin* examinations, select them first to report to the Commander-in-Chief. Officials who cultivate virtue and benefit the people shall have their ranks elevated.

Those who oversee fields and silkworms must harbor no deceit. Those who manage finances must not act for private gain. Those who command troops must govern the seen and unseen alike. Those who control rain and sunshine must diligently attend to the mechanisms of abundance and scarcity. Those who judge the merits and faults of merchants, and those who oversee the virtues of Daoists and Buddhists, must order all matters clearly and without negligence.

The Heavenly Register records the destinies of mortals—indeed, it governs life and death. The soaring *feiluan* elucidates transformation—it concerns the rise and fall of the world’s fortunes. Those who oversee the hundred crafts and skills, though their tasks be small, must not be overlooked. Those who supervise miscellaneous trades must enforce strictness in every matter.

Redress grievances and right wrongs, that the people may find justice. Investigate and impeach spectral thieves, that the realm may know peace. The Wenchang Divine Response Bureau shall report morning petitions and dream omens without fail. Within the Grand Commander’s Prefecture, the authority to approve and issue orders shall be absolute.

Each office, each rank, has its appointed reckoning. Above, they correspond to the throat and tongue of the Nine Heavens; below, they inspire awe in the hearts of all nations. The long-serving ministers of former assistance, whose meritorious deeds are recorded, shall be united with the assisting prefecture and still partake in the sacrifices of the new temple. Commanding the profound regions of the Jiang and Du rivers, they shall sit in governance over Min and E, ensuring the encircling bureaus advance in order, and their illustrious insignia be further enhanced.

Only when their hearts are thus aligned can success be achieved. Now, the silver toad shines brightly, the jade clepsydra drips slowly. All sounds are stilled, the court gates silent; the four quarters are tranquil, the dust of clamor leaves no trace. Dragon tallies and tiger tablets have arrived for the temple sacrifices, their splendor redoubling the grandeur of imperial praise.

Reverently receiving this august mandate, we shall reverse the decadence of the age and restore the purity of high antiquity. Go now, fulfill your duties, and do not betray the favor of the Supreme Emperor. Pour forth your sincere devotion, and in homage, extol the gracious mandate of the Son of Heaven.

*Record of the Temple’s Activities*
Composed by Zhao Yanzhi of Taiyuan, former Prefect of Yuzhou, now enshrined in the temple of Biyi.

The Perfected Lord stored his essence, and the stellar ranks descended from the Zhou dynasty. His surname was Zhang, personal name Zhong, courtesy name Xiaoyou. He aided King Xuan in the restoration of the Zhou, and upon his passing became a radiant spirit. Through successive reigns, he rendered great service, ever diligent in loyalty to his sovereign and filial piety to his parents, taking as his duty the support of culture and the refinement of the people’s hearts. Formerly enfeoffed as Divine, Civil, Martial, Filial, Loyal, and Benevolent King, in the third year of the Yanyou era of the sagely Yuan Emperor Renzong, when the imperial examinations were established, the Ministry of Rites deliberated with the Grand Secretariat and revised his temple title, inscribing the shrine as the "Temple of Assisting Culture and Completing Transformation." That autumn, a special edict was issued, ennobling him as the Perfected Lord of Assisting the Primordial, Initiating Transformation, Presiding over Literature, and Vastly Benevolent.

The edict proclaimed: "His light divides the Zhang constellation, his friendship chants the Zhou odes. He aided my flourishing fortune through loyalty and filial piety, and in governing the people, he wielded the power of Earth’s culture through examination ranks, selecting and nurturing many scholars." It further declared: "I desire talents to arise in succession, and you brilliantly manifest the numen of the Yangtze and Han. I desire the governance of culture to shine forth, and you dredge and release the treasury of the Kui and Bi constellations. Thereafter, people increasingly believed that the nature of the spirit inherently aligns with those who assist and glorify the teachings of names, truly manifesting in the state’s sacrificial canon, which cannot be gainsaid. Those who turn toward reverence and admiration, reforming their conduct and advancing in virtue, are like rivers converging and clouds gathering, ceaselessly."

The spirit dwelled at Sword Gate, residing in Shu as the land of his sojourns and regard. He rendered great contributions to the West, yet the temple in Chengdu lacked solemnity. The two or three shrines in the east and west were insufficient to express the people’s reverence. In the first year of the Tianli era, when stars gathered in the Kui constellation, on the *jiazi* day of the third month, I, Yanzhi, accompanied by my attendants, departed from ancient Yu and arrived at Chengdu via Phoenix Mountain. Roaming and lingering, I was moved by a surge of old sentiments. Shu was a forest of many scholars, owing to Lord Zhang’s hidden blessings, his luminous efficacy gathering and elevating them. Those who soared in the imperial examinations followed one another in succession. Moreover, the ancient custom of serving the spirit with sincerity was esteemed. The nobles, great officials, worthy gentlemen, and scholars wished to expand his temple but had not yet succeeded. Since I knew of this, could I remain indifferent? Thus, I followed the people’s desires, subtly aiding their fulfillment. The plans were drawn, and the scale was grand—yet to mobilize the masses for a great undertaking would invite criticism in spring and autumn. In the second year of the Zhiyuan era, Zhao Shiyan, former Grand Academician of the Kuizhang Pavilion, Hanlin Academician, Academician-in-Waiting, Drafter of Edicts, and Compiler of the National History, Silver and Blue Honorable Grand Master, Grand Councilor of the Secretariat, and Duke of Lu, retired to Chengdu. Mindful of past virtues, he was earnestly devoted to Lord Zhang. Upon his arrival, he first paid respects to the spirit and consulted the oracle. I then informed him of the temple construction, saying: "For years, my heart has harbored this wish, yet it remained unfulfilled. If you, my lord, would assist the spirit’s decree, I dare to lay bare my sincerity and exert myself."

On the *jiayin* day of the sixth month, the matter was divined. We traversed the city’s interior and exterior, selecting an exceptional site: the southwest’s majesty, the *kun* trigram’s axis, the primacy of the terrain, and the finest of ducal residences. The temple’s affairs were thus determined. The Duke himself composed several memorials to gather resources. In the spring of the fourth year, during the first month of the royal calendar, Zhao Chengqing, former Participant in Government Affairs of the Sichuan Branch Secretariat, desired to fulfill the grand plan. On the *jichou* day of the third month, Wan Jialü, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Revenue, arrived in Shu. During his administration of governance and royal affairs, heaven moved his heart. He summoned me to consult the oracle, and I recounted Lord Zhang’s comings and goings, his role as the throat of culture, the balance of cassia and emolument, and the temple’s construction. The Vice Minister joyfully bowed and said: "Sichuan has a provincial administration; this should be planned." Three days later, he consulted superiors and subordinates, and all willingly assented.

On the first day of the sixth month, I instructed Wang Yexian, an attendant of the province, to divine the auspices for the matter. The memorial was submitted, and within a month, officials of the provincial administration, guests and aides, subordinate functionaries, and over one hundred twenty clerks all contributed portions of their salaries, totaling over five hundred strings of cash. On the auspicious first day of the tenth month, I commanded Hou Jing Yuanhengji, a chiliarch and grandson of the Grand Preceptor Duke of Qin, and Liu Shou’an, the Marquis of the Hebei Wing of the Ten Thousand Households, to donate five hundred strings of cash to purchase the estate. The temple’s construction thus began. The site measured seventy-three *zhang* in depth, with its left and right wings half that length, curving inward. Thereupon, craftsmen were summoned to level the ground, clear away thickets and obstructions, and apply plaster. A grand gate was erected outside, and a smaller gate stood within.

On the twenty-fifth day, a feast was prepared with music, and the Vice Minister, accompanied by the Participant in Government Affairs and the hundred officials, escorted the Perfected Lord into the temple. On the first day of the eleventh month, the main hall was completed, and the temple plaque was unveiled, inscribed with "Temple of Assisting Culture and Completing Transformation." Side halls were added to house the left and right assistants, and a slanted observation platform was built to enforce the distinctions of rank and hierarchy. A Hall of Assembled Virtues was established, with a place for sacrificial offerings. The structure was resplendent, its ornamentation complete, its grandeur imposing, its scale neither mean nor excessively vast, but perfectly suited to its purpose. Compared to the two or three other shrines, it was beyond comparison.

Alas! Do spirit and matter rely on timing? Do affairs hinge on rise and decline? The one who led the grand vision was the Duke Zhao. The one who swiftly realized the plan was the Vice Minister. The one who toiled morning and night, laboring with his hands, was my attendant Yang Shireng. Those who spared no effort, running errands and enduring hardship, were Wang Jun, Wang Shouyong, and He Shanqing.

In the second month of the fifth year, the worthy gentlemen and good people of Shu, along with the temple’s assistants, filled the ranks of attendants. Thirteen honorary positions were established, and all vied to contribute and rejoice in its completion. The dignified, capped, and robed officials who stood in the center, attended and revered, were now embodied by Zhao Chengqing, the Surveillance Commissioner for Rectitude.

From ancient times to the present, from Sword Gate to the towns and cities, temples were universally established to sacrifice to him. Even in the capital and the eastern regions of Shaanxi, some offered sacrifices, all revering Lord Zhang’s merits—but none matched the splendor of the present temple.

The Lord Emperor is the sovereign of Wenchang, the heart of the people and the pulse of the nation. Through all ages, who has upheld the guiding principles of civilization under heaven? The traces of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu have faded, and simplicity and purity have declined. Thus, Heaven has ordained this to enlighten and initiate—His Lordship, illuminating the Dao and expounding its teachings, shines as brightly as the sun and stars. From this day forward, if lords and worthies revere the temple of the Lord Emperor, they will also honor His Lordship’s Dao and teachings. Those who cultivate virtue and engage in affairs will flourish within the harmony of ritual and music, and thrive under its transformative influence. Thus, they will neither fail their sovereign and parents above nor betray their studies below. Emerging as worthy ministers and chancellors, they will achieve great deeds, their ranks stretching endlessly—how could they merely vie in wielding brush and paper, competing in ornate words, to seek flattery and profit?

As the *Book of Songs* says: *"Those who know me say I am troubled in heart; those who do not know me ask what I seek."* Herein lies what cannot be restrained.

Moreover, as for the one who graces the imperial court with his presence, bestows pure blessings upon the people, ensures abundant harvests, dispels plagues, fosters harmony, and brings forth prosperity—doubling the talents of the world—it is the Lord Emperor of Wenchang, who assists the primordial, initiates transformation, governs official rank, and magnifies benevolence. The construction of his temple began in the *Tianli* year of *Wuchen* and was completed in the *Zhiyuan* year of *Jimao*. Though its towers and pavilions are not newly built, the worthy successors who come after are many. Amidst these affairs, a stele is erected to record this. Pressed by the requests of many scholars and moved by Lord Zhang’s long-standing devotion, I have thus written an outline, including the names of those who presided over its completion, the dates of the temple’s construction, and its origins near and far, so that later generations may have something to examine.

In the first year of *Zhizheng*, the year *Xinsi*, on an auspicious day in the fifth month of summer.

**Exhortation to Respect Written Characters**
All scholars who belong to my register have come from reverence for written characters. For instance, in the Song dynasty, Minister Wang Yi’s father, upon seeing discarded written paper, would always gather and wash it with fragrant water before burning it. One night, he dreamed that the Sage Confucius patted his back and said: *"How diligently you respect my written characters! I regret that you are already old and cannot achieve greatness, but in the future, I shall send Zeng Shen to be reborn in your family to bring honor to your household."* Soon after, he indeed had a son, whom he named Zeng, who later passed the imperial examinations as the top scholar. Though this event is distant, it serves as proof.

I privately wonder at the people of this age, who claim to be learned yet do not cherish books. They regard the texts of Buddhism and Daoism as weighty as ten thousand *jun*, yet treat the characters of our Six Classics as light as goose down. Some use written paper to paste walls, make screens, wrap bedding, or seal windows; they trample it underfoot or use it to wipe filth. Such acts are no better than covering jars with it. Why do they hold Buddhism and Daoism in such reverence while treating our own teachings so lightly? Do they not know that the Three Teachings are fundamentally one, and that they forcibly create such distinctions?

Moreover, our tradition has its own bureaus of good and evil to investigate and act, warning those who disrespect written characters. For example, those who toil in study for years may, in the examination hall, be dismissed by the authorities for a misplaced rhyme or a single erroneous character, never once having their names inscribed on the Tiger Board. This is the divine retribution for their lifelong disrespect of written characters. Yet scholars willingly accept this retribution, oblivious to its cause. Even worse, their descendants may become illiterate, and their entire families may suffer as a result. Though distant examples are not sufficient as warnings, let us speak of recent cases: In Luzhou, Yang Bixing sat on a classic text, and his entire family was afflicted with leprosy. In Chang Prefecture, Xianyu Kun defaced the *Mencius*, and his whole household perished. The retribution is clear and evident to all.

Yet Yang Quanshan, the elder brother of Yang Bixing, buried written characters and saw five generations of his family pass the imperial examinations. Li Zicai buried written characters and rose to high office in his lifetime. If one can heed and cherish such hidden rewards, how can one not stand in awe?

**Exhortation to Scholars**
Those who are intelligent, upright, and depend on others must still make choices. Those who are magnanimous, loyal, trustworthy, and fond of righteousness—these are the ones who carry on the tradition.

Thus, relying on the essence of responsive sincerity, I reveal in silence the teachings of the voiceless transformation. Hearken, all you assembled, to my admonitory words.

I have heard that wealth and honor lie with Heaven, while gain and loss are decreed by fate. Those who understand this rest in naturalness and make no appeals; those who do not grasp it covet certainty and make supplications. Some say that when spirit and essence commune, dreams and waking visions align; that when sacrifices are abundant, the gods and spirits descend; that palaces and towers must flaunt soaring green-tiled roofs; that steps and corridors must boast carved crimson railings—yet in pursuing such trivialities, they lose their fundamental truth. Unaware of when to advance or retreat, their survival or ruin hangs upon the Three Offices and Four Registers; their acceptance or rejection, their rise or fall, are examined by the Five Bureaus and Six Terraces. Though these records exist, how can one calculate and seize them? Yet one must not be bound by predestination, nor may one remain blind to self-cultivation. Thus, those who refine their conduct and strive in virtue shall not lack the hundred blessings, while those who violate the Dao and corrupt their power shall have the five fortunes snatched away. Though the principles are manifest, people remain unaware: when fate and numbers mysteriously align, one may suffer calamity; when baleful stars shine forth, one may yet encounter fortune. Creation’s fluctuations follow this pattern, and the divine luminaries thus add or subtract.

All you scholars, reverently practice the teachings and laws. Do not deceive Heaven by claiming it is distant; do not dismiss the spirits as obscure. Do not say that dark chambers can be deceived, nor that only the bright court must be feared. Do not bully the orphaned and widowed; do not slight the elderly and accomplished. Do not seize wealth that is not rightfully yours; do not lust after another’s spouse. Do not cultivate close ties with outsiders while estranging kin; do not form righteous bonds with strangers while sowing discord among brothers. Do not rely on your strengths; do not attack others’ weaknesses. Do not indulge in arrogance and pleasure; do not give free rein to hunting and wandering. Do not squander your talent and reputation; do not wield official power to oppress. Do not venerate immortals and Buddhists while slighting your parents; do not revere ghosts and gods while disrespecting your teachers.

Should any defy these words, they shall not escape Heaven’s decree. Thus, those of outstanding talent may repeatedly fail in the examination halls, while those of sudden clarity may swiftly pass the provincial exams—all due to hidden affinities, not mere happenstance. Those who secretly slander in their hearts often find pretexts, while those who praise to one’s face yet defame behind their back merely deceive their kin. How could the arbiters of literature act with partiality? The registers of rank and emolument are not arbitrarily bestowed. O multitude of scholars, Heaven may yet oversee you. O towering achievements, I thus affirm them.

Proclaim this widely, that all may hear and know: the selection of scholars through examinations is not confined to a single method. The essential aim is to obtain men who fulfill the people’s expectations. First, hidden merit and filial conduct are paramount; next, modest and harmonious self-conduct is deemed worthy. Those who study diligently shall be rewarded for their labor; those of exceptional talent shall have their aspirations fulfilled. The arrogant and negligent shall not escape demotion; the frivolous shall be shown both encouragement and punishment. Literary works shall determine their advancement or removal, while the divine luminaries shall impartially govern their bestowal or deprivation.

People do not reflect on their own faults, so I now declare these instructive words: I have often said that scholars possess no inherent ability—only diligent study makes them capable. Though poor, how can one not grow rich? To achieve renown is to become rich. Scholars are not divided by noble or base status; what matters is their industry. In every grand examination, moral conduct and learning are first compared, and only then do the examiners assess the quality of their compositions. One cannot claim predestination as an excuse for failing to study diligently, nor may one rely on past affinities to slacken in self-cultivation. Though called scholars, they may lack even an inch of scholarly virtue; though clad in the robes of Confucians, they may merely present an outward appearance of beauty.

They disrespect Heaven and Earth, disbelieve in the divine luminaries, mock the elderly and accomplished, and slight their elders. They defy their parents and idle in pleasure; they neglect their teachers and indulge in dissipation. When they fail the exams, they blame the examiners for injustice; when the results are posted, they call the successful mediocre. Those who demand much of others fail to demand it of themselves; those who criticize others thereby criticize Heaven. Some rely on their own views to suppress others’ abilities; some flaunt their strengths to attack others’ weaknesses. Some boast of their learning while disregarding the world; some cling to a single insight while belittling others. Those who conduct themselves improperly regard greed and avarice as skill; those whose resolve is weak prize cunning and deceit as victory. They compare strengths and weaknesses without fairness; they seize from one to give to another, heedless of others’ words. They praise to one’s face yet defame behind their back, seeking to ingratiate themselves; they speak approval while harboring opposition, leaving no room for tolerance. Though their demeanor may seem kind, they merely craft fine words; though their hearts may brim with cruelty, they delight in secret schemes and hidden plots. They choose friends without discernment, befriending the unrighteous; they sow discord in their households, lusting after others’ spouses. Abandoning their own fields to plow another’s, they lose much; engaging in the useless to harm the useful, what could be more damaging?

Those who pass the provincial examinations grow complacent, believing their ambitions fulfilled, and no longer cultivate themselves further. Those who enter the metropolitan examinations take success and fame as theirs for the spitting, relying on talent to scorn others, flaunting their seniority to bully the solitary. They habitually curry favor with the powerful and boast of their peers, dismissing all equals with a mere couplet or fragment of prose. In the marketplace, they collude in trade to covet gains; before magistrates, they conspire in litigation to satisfy their demands. Disloyal and unfilial, they willingly flout the law and delight in impropriety. Devoid of benevolence and uprightness, they act without restraint. They roam and hunt without measure, squander time on gambling and games, drown themselves in drink to the ruin of their spirit, and wield power only to corrupt their virtue. Repeatedly humiliated in the examination halls, how dare they hope for glory? Having put forth no effort in three years of study, they suddenly entertain the vain hope of passing the imperial examinations. When they fail, they attribute it to fate; when they succeed, they ascribe it solely to prayer. Unaware that Heaven’s decree cannot be evaded, they deepen the delusion in men’s hearts. In every word and silence, action and withdrawal, Heaven observes; in every promotion and demotion, bestowal and deprivation, the gods preside. How can one seize fortune by luck or scheme? Yet if one’s conduct and deeds are worthy of record, why fear failure to ascend?

Of late, the descendants of merchant families, inheriting their forebears’ enterprises, have gained renown, while the heirs of scholarly lineages, who once wore the Confucian cap through generations, have been cast aside. The sons of merchants, content in their station, devote themselves to study without pretense; the scions of scholarly families, however, trusting in their noble lineage, grow arrogant and haughty. The divine and enlightened select impartially, often spurring the frivolous to reform, while the Way of Heaven turns leftward, rewarding the honest and unadorned.

If one can awaken to this truth, conceal one’s light, and bide in obscurity, then with diligent effort and suffering resolve, one may fulfill every act of hidden merit, uphold loyalty and filial piety, and return to the unadorned customs of high antiquity, shunning the degenerate ways of the latter age. Naturally, the transmission of poetry and ritual will endure, and scholarly honors will be restored. Conducting oneself with humility and harmony, one’s bearing will return to its original state. Heaven does not fail those who strive; scholars must apply themselves earnestly. Let all who would be gentlemen take heed.
