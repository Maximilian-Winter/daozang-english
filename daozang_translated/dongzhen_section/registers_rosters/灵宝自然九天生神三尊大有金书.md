The Celestial Treasure Lord is the august deity of the Great Cavern. The Celestial Treasure Venerable One is the ancestral *qi* of the Celestial Treasure Lord. The Venerable One is the *qi* of the Primal Jade Sovereign of the Vast Non-Being of the Chaotic Cavern—nine myriad, nine thousand, nine hundred, ninety-nine billion *qi*. Later, in the first year of the Dragon Han era, it transformed and gave birth to the Celestial Treasure Lord, who revealed the scripture under the title *Supreme Great Existence of the Jade Clarity Palace*.

The Numinous Treasure Lord is the august deity of the Cavern Mystery. The Numinous Treasure Venerable One is the ancestral *qi* of the Numinous Treasure Lord. The Venerable One is the *qi* of the Primal Jade Void of the Crimson Chaos of the Great Origin—nine myriad, nine thousand, nine hundred, ninety-nine myriad *qi*. Later, at the Dragon Han’s unfolding of the cosmic chart, it transformed and gave birth to the Numinous Treasure Lord. After one kalpa, in the first year of the Crimson Clarity era, it revealed the scripture to deliver beings, then titled *Supreme Clarity’s Mystic Capital, the Two Capitals’ Seven Treasures’ Purple Tenuity Palace*.

The Spirit Treasure Lord is the august deity of the Cavern Spirit. The Spirit Treasure Venerable One is the ancestral *qi* of the Spirit Treasure Lord. The Venerable One is the *qi* of the Primal Jade Void of the Dark Stillness and Mystic Pervasion—nine myriad, nine thousand, nine hundred, ninety myriad *qi*. Later, in the first year of the Crimson Clarity era, it transformed and gave birth to the Spirit Treasure Lord. After two kalpas, in the first year of the High Sovereign era, it revealed the scripture, then titled *Three Sovereigns’ Cavern Spirit, Supreme Clarity’s Great Ultimate Palace*.

Though these three titles differ in age and name, their essence is one. They divide into the Three *Qi* of the Mysterious, Primordial, and Origin, governing the Three Treasures. All are the august deities of the Three Vessels’ *qi*, called the Three Generative *Qi*. The Three Titles combine to generate the Nine *Qi*, which emerged before the Great Void, concealed within the hollow emptiness. Without light, without image, without form, without name, without color, without trace, without sound, without voice, the Dao steered the world, opening the mysterious pervasion. The Three Colors of chaos flickered in and out of existence. As the revolving numbers reached their limit, the Three *Qi* radiated light. The *qi* clarified and ascended, accumulating yang to form heaven. The *qi* congealed and settled, accumulating stagnation to form earth. The Nine *Qi* arrayed in order, and the sun, moon, stars, yin-yang, Five Phases, people, and all beings received life and completion. Without the nurturing of the Three Origins or the guidance of the Nine *Qi*, heaven and earth and the myriad transformations could not arise. The Three *Qi* are the honor of heaven and earth; the Nine *Qi* are the root of the myriad things. Thus, their triune union perfects virtue—this is the ultimate of heaven and earth.

When humans receive life within the womb, the Three Origins nurture and sustain them, and the Nine *Qi* knit their form. After nine months, the spirits spread *qi* to fulfillment, and the voice emerges. Once the voice is complete and the spirit fully formed, the Nine Heavens rejoice. The Great One holds the talisman, the Thearch assigns rank, the Registrar inscribes the ledger, the Director of Destinies fixes the allotment, the Five Thearchs oversee birth, the Sage Mother guards the chamber, and the deities of heaven, earth, and the Three Realms stand vigilant. The Nine Heavens’ Marshal faces east in the courtyard and recites the *Nine Heavens’ Scripture of the Generative Spirit Treasure* nine times. If male, the myriad spirits chant "reverence"; if female, they chant "obedience." If male, the Director of Destinies respectfully assents; if female, it respectfully complies—thus, birth occurs. If the Nine Heavens’ Marshal does not issue the command, and the myriad spirits do not chant reverence or assent, birth does not occur.

When a person is reborn into the human realm, their form fears the Great Yang, startling heaven and earth—even the noble find it hard to endure. The celestial perfected, earthly spirits, and the Three Realms all attend, for this is no trifling matter. At the moment of birth, it is no humble event. Thus, one should cherish their form, preserve their spirit, honor their *qi*, and secure their root, so as never to perish but to attain immortality, bones and flesh ascending together, rising to the Three Clarities. This is to unite virtue with the Three *Qi* and align with the Nine *Qi*.

Yet, though born, people often fail to revere their *qi*, honor their form, treasure their life, or cherish their spirit, bringing about their own decay and death, severing their original true nature.

The *Nine Heavens’ Generative Spirit Chapters* are the soaring mysterious *qi* of the Three Caverns, their triune harmony forming sound, congealing into numinous script. They blend the hundred spirits, conceal the inner names in hidden rhymes, and knit the generative *qi* into form—these are the natural chapters. When the Celestial Treasure recites them, they open the light of heaven and earth. When the Numinous Treasure recites them, they illuminate the souls of the Nine Dark Realms’ eternal night. When the Spirit Treasure recites them, they command the myriad spirits. When the Great One recites them, they complete the body’s spirits. When the Thearch recites them, they knit the form. When the Nine Heavens recite them, they give birth to people. When scholars recite them, they ascend to heaven. When ghosts and spirits hear them, they ascend and transmigrate. When ordinary people hear them, they endure. When dark souls hear them, they are delivered. When withered bones hear them, they emit smoke. When infants hear them, they can speak. When corpses hear them, they return to life.

The Three Treasures’ divine mysteries are the root of the myriad beings. Thus, they are not known to ghosts and spirits or heard by ordinary people. Those who study the supreme Dao, yearning for immortality, and attain liberation through the corpse, extinguishing the cycle of rebirth, ultimately return to the immortal Dao. Form and spirit unite, never parting, together entering the true Dao. Without this text, the womb stagnates, the dead *qi* solidifies the root, the true radiance is not preserved, the generative *qi* has no passage, the nine apertures are blocked, the body does not generate spirit, and one merely receives a form, as if borrowing *qi* to move. Those who master this method may sit and attain the natural. The Three Treasures are august and revered; the Nine Heavens’ perfected are most sacred. They are concealed within the Great Existence’s nine-layered golden lattice and the Purple Yang Jade Terrace. Unless heaven and earth are newly opened, this text does not emerge.

This is the Primordial Beginning’s forbidden scripture, not to be heard by ghosts or spirits. Those who steal it will suffer ten thousand kalpas under the wind’s blade, their souls dying without rebirth. Those who follow the precepts and uphold it will unite form and spirit as immortals. Those whose names are inscribed in gold and purple in the Three Origins’ Palace, destined to become immortals of the Three Clarities in their next life, shall receive this text.

When the karmic conditions align, one should present gold and treasures to the master, sincerely follow the precepts, and receive the scripture through the covenant. Seal the heart and practice diligently, taking care never to lightly disclose it lest the wind’s blade examine the body.

The method of cultivation:
Observe a thousand-day fast, disengage from worldly affairs, and extinguish all sensory leaks. Calm the heart and silently recite, offering pure incense while upholding the precepts. Enter the chamber facing east, knock the teeth nine times, regulate the voice and align the qi, then chant the precious scripture.

At the first recitation, the voice reaches the Nine Heavens.
At the second, heaven and earth pay reverence.
At the third, the Three Realms bow in homage.
At the fourth, the Heavenly Kings descend as immortals.
At the fifth, the Five Emperors attend the perfected.
At the sixth, the Demon Kings submit.
At the seventh, the stellar lodges halt their gates.
At the eighth, the darkest night is illuminated.
At the ninth, all heavens descend, and every spirit and deity without exception guards the chariot.

With the first recitation, the womb’s origin is unblocked.
With the second, the earth resounds, and the fetal knots dissolve at the root.
With the third, the spirits pay homage, and the soul’s gate refines the immortal.
With the fourth, the Heavenly Kings descend as immortals, and the gate of the po-soul closes.
With the fifth, the Five Emperors attend the perfected, and the viscera become cool and clear.
With the sixth, the Demon Kings submit in assent, and the stomach’s passage generates essence.
With the seventh, the stellar lodges shine brightly, and the orifices open with keen perception.
With the eighth, the darkest night reveals its light, and the Three Divisions and Eight Radiant Forms fully integrate body and spirit.
With the ninth, all heavens descend, and the Three Passes, Five Viscera, Six Palaces, Nine Palaces, Golden Towers, Jade Chambers, Twelve-Layered Gates, Purple Doors, Jade Pavilions, and thirty-six thousand joints—from root to primordial origin—all simultaneously generate the spirit.

Nine recitations make one full cycle. Upon completing one cycle, the Three Realms record the name, and the Five Emperors acknowledge the adept as a friend, bestowing the title of Perfected.
Ten cycles unify the qi, enabling control over the myriad spirits. The Demon Kings act as guarantors, and the adept is listed among the heavens.
A hundred cycles unify the spirit, allowing one to sit and command the natural. The Taiyi’s talisman is conferred, and the Yuanjun receives new life.
A thousand cycles unify the numinous, enabling one to sit or stand at will. Immortal youths and jade maidens serve at one’s command.
Ten thousand cycles complete the Dao, granting the power to ride the dragon chariot and ascend in broad daylight.

At that time, the Primordial Celestial Worthy dwelled in tranquil seclusion, reclining within the Yellow Chamber of the Cloud Palace, amidst seven-jeweled curtains. Serene and nurturing purity, refining the true in empty azure, savoring profound wisdom, he contemplated the generation of the spirit, governing the subtleties of the Great Primal Chaos, and whistling to illuminate the Nine Heavens.

Then the Flying Celestial Great Sage, the Limitless Spirit King, the Jade Assistant Prime Minister, and the Four Harmonious Attendants of Dawn—having purified themselves and established the standards—stood in attendance. Leaning upon the jade countenance to perceive the marvelous, gazing upon the divine eyes to open compassion, they secretly rejoiced in the sacred scripture, feasting upon the celestial sounds to receive life. Seizing the moment to awaken, they ventured to meet the divine gaze and bare their hearts.

Thereupon, the Flying Celestial Great Sage and the Limitless Spirit King stepped forward, bowed deeply, and addressed the Celestial Worthy: “Your humble servants are fortunate to attend your divine chariot. Though unworthy, we have been cleansed in the dark ford, deeply awakened to the congealed mystery, and elevated to the rank of Spirit Kings. We govern life and death, oversee all celestial immortals, supervise the Seven Awakenings, survey distant lands, observe the Prime Minister, and face the Attendants of Dawn. Now, we must seize the moment, respond to the karmic convergence, tread the Nine Great Suns, penetrate the principles of the Yin Talisman, and guide the multitudes.

The great cycle nears its end, and the reckoning of *jiashen* approaches. The vast currents will scour away filth, and calamities will blanket the heavens. The Three Officials will wield their brushes to assess and separate the destinies of humankind, calculating merits and transgressions, distinguishing good from evil.

From the era of Red Clarity to the first year of the Supreme Sovereign, according to the Primordial Yang Jade Tablet, those who received deliverance numbered 240,000. From the era of the Opened Sovereign to *jiashen*, the celestial ranks have been selected in sequence, leaving the offices of the immortal bureaus vacant. The officials and wandering functionaries all await appointed personnel. According to the Primordial Yang Jade Calendar, three generations must be assessed. Those who have accumulated goodness, built merit, and been commended by the Three Realms and guaranteed by the Five Emperors—whose names are recorded in the heavens—shall number 100,000, to fill these positions. An additional 120,000 shall be selected as reserve officials.

Such examples include those whose names are preordained in the Mysterious Chart, whose bone forms align with immortality, whose karmic conditions turn the wheel of rebirth, who ardently cherish the Three Treasures and whose virtuous deeds reach the heavens, who make offerings to the masters and treasures and are praised by the Three Officials, who observe fasts and uphold the precepts with accumulated merit, who disperse wealth and establish Daoist halls, who rescue the destitute and deliver humans and celestials, or who build merit for the Three Masters to fulfill the celestial records. When the calculations of the ledgers align with the Three Officials, all are retroactively inscribed with their destined names, categorized by rank, with no detail overlooked.

Moreover, the Nine Dark Prisons have received the Nine Dragon Talisman from the Eastern Florescence Azure Palace, commanding the extraction of the Nine Dark Jade Tablets. The souls of the deceased—men and women whose names were preordained for goodness and whose merits are complete—shall number 320,000, to be delivered after the purging of *jiashen* and become the people of the Great Existence.

At this time, life and death will converge, and good and evil will be judged. Those who pass shall truly rejoice. Yet the Three Officials are stringent, their documents voluminous. The Dragon Gate receives the assemblies, the Bird Mother supervises the immortals, and the myriad sages manifest their presence day and night without rest. Merits and transgressions are weighed equally, ensuring no bias in life or death. This tumultuous chaos is also our concern.

The great reckoning is imminent, and every matter risks neglect. We fear that one day, we may be ensnared by the public courts. We have heard that the Celestial Worthy enacts the transformation of great compassion, bestowing mercy upon the multitudes, and opens the mysteries of the Nine Heavens to deliver the people. The luminous precepts contain prohibitions beyond our humble station to comprehend. Yet the great cycle nears its end, *jiashen* approaches, the era of deliverance is urgent, and the great Dharma should be practiced. May those with sincere hearts, even amidst the calculations, hear the Dharma’s sound, receive guidance through sight and hearing, and be exhorted to awaken those yet unawakened.”

Here the petition is laid before the throne, trembling lest we offend the celestial countenance. We humbly pray for compassion and the grace of what we have not yet heard.

Thereupon the Celestial Worthy stroked the armrest, raised his voice in lofty address, composed his spirit in distant contemplation, lifted his gaze to recite the cavernous scriptures, and intoned the resonant jade-like verses. After a long while, he suddenly sighed and said:

The highest model abides in emptiness, its principle too subtle and profound. The Dao reaches the profound mystery of the Double Obscurity; qi crowns the Divine Empyrean. Its ultimate truth is hard to express, its wonder hard to surpass. You, who hold the imperial office, have received the charge of Divine King of the Flying Celestials. You assist the Four Ministers of the Jasper Terrace and support the Bright Wheel. Your gaze spans the farthest reaches, your oversight encompasses the boundless. You harmonize the myriad transformations and govern the care of the multitudes.

Now the great cycle unfolds its appointed time; the Three and Five announce the hour. The Hundred and Six respond to the mechanism, the Yang Nine surges forth. The vast springs churn their waves, myriad calamities assail the heavens, and the Four Palaces select candidates to replenish the seed-people. Three generations have fallen into chaos, and good and evil must be distinguished. You must labor for the multitudes, wearying yourself amid the rise and fall of the Three Offices. Affairs demand capable hands—now I entrust this to you. Strive diligently.

The precious scriptures are wondrous and weighty, the numinous sounds of the Nine Heavens. They are bestowed upon the highest sages, not for ghosts or spirits to hear. The luminous precepts of the Perfected have their standards, enacted once every forty thousand kalpas. Now, transgressing the prohibitions, I entrust them to you in secret. Guard them well and do not transmit them lightly.

He commanded the Marshal of the Nine Heavens and the Jade Gentlemen Attendant Immortals to open the cloud-brocade satchel of the Purple Yang Jade Case and bring forth the *Jade Chapters of the Nine Heavens’ Generation of Spirit*. The Four Assistants took their places, the Five Elders oversaw the Perfected, the Great One summoned the celestial stems, and the Jade Emperor intoned the covenant. All bowed and rose in accordance with the *Illuminated Perfected Canon*, facing south in long obeisance as the text was conferred upon the Boundless Flying Celestial Divine King.

When the ritual was complete, the hosts of heaven returned to their positions. The Celestial Worthy again addressed the Flying Celestial Divine King:

These *Nine Heavens’ Chapters* are the qi of the Three Caverns’ Flying Mystery, the sound formed by the Three Assemblies, the true script condensed into being. They blend the hundred spirits and conceal the inner names in their hidden rhymes. Thus, the Great One tests and observes, gathering life from the ten directions, guiding them to comprehend the Cavernous Void. The covenant is inscribed in cinnabar and azure, and without eons of karmic affinity or one’s name recorded in the imperial register, none may behold them. Those who glimpse their pages will ascend with nine generations of ancestors. You must select those destined for immortality, who for seven hundred years shall purify themselves for a thousand days, pledging with gold and silk, swearing devotion to the covenant before transmitting it. Guard it well, and you shall enjoy blessings; leak it, and disaster will befall. Blessings extend to nine generations of ancestors, virtue as weighty as mountains and seas. Disaster brings judgment flowing for eons, pain sharper than boiling poison, punishment by wind and blade. How can you not be cautious?

**Jade Chapter of the Azure Clarity and Celestial Treasure**
The Primordial Dao dwells in the Cavernous Void,
The three qi refine the gate of supreme essence.
Purple countenance surveys the Great Emptiness,
The Four Illuminations plant the numinous root.
Wondrous transformation blooms in the Eastern Jasper,
Three pinions rise from the Western Kunlun.
Their names resound in the Ninefold Mystery’s purity,
Fivefold blossoms girdle the brocade clouds.
The Net of Separation kindles the spirit lamp,
Sevenfold essences radiate in the Northern Mystery.
Wafting, wafting to the Upper Clarity’s precincts,
Majestic, majestic, the Lord of Unity.
Lofty, lofty, the supreme chapter,
How the feathered lads swarm in profusion!
Flowing fragrance is without color,
Penetrating the myriad immortals’ throng.
Leftward, the Three Kalpas revolve,
Rightward, the Nine Heavens’ gates turn.
Golden blossoms crown the jade lads,
Eight winds dance the wheel of space.
The four seasons never cease their mechanism,
Azure and white are early distinguished.
Nine nines transform the kalpa’s fate,
Three threes pass a single spring.
Heaven and earth have their final meeting,
The secret impulse returns to inversion.
The Cavernous Clarity’s Orthodox Unity is revealed,
The Six Heavens’ scriptures strictly cultivated.
Great Peace reverts to emptiness,
To be offered to the sagely lord who follows.

**Jade Chapter of the Jade Purity and Numinous Treasure**
Numinous wind rises at the Western Gate,
Brocade clouds bloom in the Eastern Jasper.
The three qi illumine the Jade Continent,
Flowing fragrance rides the Eastern breeze.
Jade blossoms scatter in the wind,
Fleeting, suddenly brightening the Nine Clarities.
The soaring forest glows with the crimson sun,
Yellow waters follow the moon’s birth.
Within, the lads who gather magic mushrooms,
Clothed in feathers, crowned with flying azure.
A thousand winds bear the whirlwind’s scene,
Carefree, they feast in emerald chariots.
They govern the Ninefold Void’s wheel,
Unfolding the myriad paths’ journey.
Left, they command the Three Heavens’ scriptures,
Right, they marshal the Six Heavens’ hosts.
Examining qi, they return to the Cavernous Void,
The Six Perfections respond to the turning fate.
Kalpas have their appointed meetings,
Who can fathom defeat or success?
Vast waves turn the numinous force,
The Six Directions leave no form behind.
White corpses drift in the long current,
Lonely souls thereby regain their spirits.
Grieving this cycle of departure and return,
Only then is the Orthodox Dharma’s light perceived.
Devoted study and refined cultivation
Earn a jasper name in the Eastern Flower.
Rejoice in those who bear the white tally,
Together delighting in Great Peace.

**Divine Chapter of the Mysterious Yellow and Great Crimson**
The Cavernous Pass turns the celestial net,
Five qi revolve the Three Subtleties.
The Purple Portal disgorges jasper tablets,
The Golden Gate receives the spirit’s radiance.
Eight Assemblies mingle the true wind,
Brilliant and luminous, the weighty names unfold.
Beyond the Nine Clarities at heaven’s edge,
Lofty, lofty, the high spirits return.
Three hues revert to emptiness,
Four seasons respond to the Jade Precincts.
The River Lord has already raised his brush,
The Five Phases secretly propel one another.
The Six Perfections have no end in kalpas,
When the cycle is exhausted, qi returns.
Ten thousand demons spread across the heavens,
Hordes of fiends vie to display their might.
The multitudes bear the brunt of calamities,
Piles of corpses move one to sorrow.
Wondrous indeed, the Orthodox Dharma’s scripture,
Its governance of kalpas never wanes.
At the appointed time, receive and welcome it,
Its covenant flies in the Nine Heavens.
With you, I pledge Great Peace,
Set your heart free, soar without wings.

Here ends the *Golden Book of the Three Treasures of the Numinous Treasure’s Natural Generation of Spirit in the Nine Heavens*.
