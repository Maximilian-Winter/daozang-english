### **Preface to the *Record of the Auspicious Gathering of the Mysterious Wind***

In former times, the National Preceptor, Perfected One of Eternal Spring, received the imperial summons and, though reluctant, arose in response. He then departed the Central Lands, crossed the Flowing Sands, expounded the Dao and virtue to enlighten the ruler, and halted warfare to succor all beings. Having accomplished his work, he withdrew from the world and ascended to heaven.

Since the Supreme Lord of the Mysterious Origin journeyed west, a thousand years have passed in solitude, and only the Perfected One alone has achieved such a feat. The details of his journey are recorded in *The Record of the Western Journey*, yet I alone received his transmission of the profound and arcane teachings of the Dao. The emperor commanded his attendants to record and keep them secret. After the lapse of years, these teachings were transmitted beyond the court and are now to be published for the world, that all may know of this wondrous gathering of the mysterious wind.

Written on the Winter Solstice of the *renchen* year.

### **Record of the Auspicious Gathering of the Mysterious Wind**

Compiled by Imperial Attendant, Illustrious Martial General, and Vice Minister of the Ministry of Rites, Yilie Chucai, by imperial decree.

By sacred imperial decree, the emperor summoned the eminent Daoist, Perfected One of Eternal Spring. In the year *jimao*, on the second day of the first month of the new era, the emperor issued an edict, and the official Liu Zhonglu, bearing the imperial mandate, sought him out. The search led to Donglai, where, by fortunate coincidence, the Perfected One was found and respectfully welcomed in accordance with the emperor’s will. He did not refuse, though the journey was long.

In the winter of the *renwu* year, on the night of the full moon of the tenth month, the emperor was hunting on the southern slopes of the Snow Mountains in the Western Regions. That evening, at the imperial encampment, torches were lit in the courtyard, and the emperor, setting aside his throne, invited the Perfected One of Eternal Spring to inquire about the Way of long life. The Perfected One said:

“The Dao gives birth to heaven and nurtures earth; the sun, moon, stars, ghosts, spirits, and all beings arise from the Dao. People know only that heaven is vast, yet they do not know the vastness of the Dao.

All my life, I have abandoned my family and left the household to study only this. The Dao gives birth to heaven and earth, and through their unfolding, humanity comes into being. At the beginning of human life, the spirit’s radiance illuminates all, and one’s steps are as swift as flight. The earth produces mushrooms, which have their own savor, requiring no cooking, and people ate them. At that time, fire was not yet used for food, and all mushrooms were fragrant. The nose savored their scent, the mouth craved their taste, and gradually, the body grew heavy, the spirit’s light faded, and this was due to the depth of love and desire.

Those who study the Dao, for this reason, do not love what the world loves, nor dwell where the world dwells. They abandon sensory pleasures to find joy in clarity and stillness, and forsake rich flavors to delight in simplicity and tranquility. Any attachment obscures the understanding of the Dao and virtue.

The eye sees form, the ear hears sound, the mouth craves taste, and the nature follows emotion—thus scattering one’s *qi*. It is like a ball of *qi*: when full, it is strong; when scattered, it is not. *Qi* is the master of the human being. Pursuing things and stirring thoughts scatters the primordial *qi*, just as the *qi* of a ball disperses.

Heaven produces two kinds of beings: the moving and the stationary. Grasses and trees belong to the stationary; though they lack consciousness, they flourish with the dew’s moisture. Humans and animals belong to the moving; though they have emotions, without clothing or food, how can they survive the year? They must engage in labor, rising and resting, their bodies and mouths becoming burdens.

The male is yang and pertains to fire; the female is yin and pertains to water. Only yin can diminish yang, and water can overcome fire. Thus, those who study the Dao first guard against sensual desire.

Laboring for clothing and food wearies the mind and scatters *qi*, though the scattering is slight. Greed and lust for sensual pleasure deplete the spirit and scatter *qi* greatly.

The Dao produces the Two Modes: the light and pure become heaven, which is yang and pertains to fire; the heavy and turbid become earth, which is yin and pertains to water. Humans dwell between them, embracing yang while carrying yin. Thus, those who study the Dao know the arts of cultivation: they abandon extravagance, restrain desire, secure their essence, and guard their spirit. They refine only the yang, causing yin to diminish and yang to be preserved. Then they ascend to heaven and become immortals, like fire rising upward. The foolish and deluded, however, take wine as their drink and falsehood as their norm. They indulge their emotions, pursue their desires, deplete their essence, and harm their spirit. Thus, yang declines and yin prevails, and they sink into the earth to become ghosts, like water flowing downward.

Those who cultivate the true Way are like rolling a stone up a high mountain: the higher they go, the harder it becomes. A single misstep, and all previous efforts are lost—because it is difficult, the world does not pursue it. Those who turn from the Dao and chase desire are like hurling a stone down a steep slope: the lower it goes, the easier it becomes. In an instant, it falls and does not return—because it is easy, the world follows it, and none awaken to the truth.

What I have spoken of regarding the arts of cultivation are the affairs of ordinary people. The teachings for the Son of Heaven differ from these.

Your Majesty is a heavenly being. The August Heaven has entrusted our house with the mandate to eliminate the cruel and remove the violent, to serve as parents to the people, and to carry out Heaven’s punishment. Like a great craftsman wielding the axe, you have overcome hardship and difficulty. When your work is complete and your term ends, you will ascend to heaven and return to your celestial position. During your time in the world, you must strictly avoid sensual pleasures, reduce excessive desires, and ensure the well-being of your sacred body, that your wisdom may extend far and wide.

Even an ordinary man with a single wife harms his body; how much more so the Son of Heaven, who keeps many concubines? Your palace is filled with consorts, and I have heard that Liu Zhonglu and others in the capital have been selecting maidens to prepare for the harem. I have heard the Daoist scriptures say: *Do not see what can be desired, lest the mind be disturbed.* Once seen, restraint becomes difficult. I humbly urge you to take heed.

People mistake the body for the self, but this is merely a borrowed vessel, received from one’s parents. The spirit is the true self, received from the Dao. It is that which thinks and reflects, waking and sleeping. Those who do good and advance in the Dao ascend to heaven and become immortals; those who do evil and turn from the Dao descend into the earth and become ghosts.”

The Dao gives birth to all beings, as gold is wrought into many vessels—melt down the form, and it returns to gold; let a person practice goodness, and they return to the Dao. The sounds, sights, clothing, and food of the human world—people see these as pleasures, but they are not true joy, for they are fundamentally suffering. Worldly people mistake the illusory for the real, take suffering for joy—is this not lamentable? They do not know that the supreme joy of heaven is true joy.

For the sake of studying the Dao, I abandoned my parents and dwelt in mountain caves. At the time, four of us studied the Dao together: Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma. Those three completed their merit and attained the Dao, and now they have ascended and transformed. My allotted span of toil is not yet over; I eat but one meal a day, one flavor in one bowl, content and at ease, awaiting my time. Those who are rich or noble, who aid the people and save the world, accumulating deeds and piling up merit—this is yet another path. But if one can accumulate goodness and practice the Dao, how can one fail to become an immortal?

China has known long peace, and heaven has repeatedly sent down scriptures and teachings to exhort people to do good. North of the Yellow River, in the Western Lands and the lands east of the Yangtze, these teachings abound. In the Later Han, Yu Ji received the *Scripture of Great Peace* in one hundred and fifty scrolls—all methods for cultivating truth and governing the state. If the Daoist people of China recite and practice them, they may gain blessings and attain the Dao. Again, in the first year of Emperor Heng’s Yongshou reign, on the seventh day of the first month, the Most High descended to Shu and knocked at the gate, bestowing upon Celestial Master Zhang Daoling the *Scriptures of the Southern and Northern Dippers*, the *Twenty-Four Stages of the Dharma Record*, and over a thousand other scriptures. In the Jin, Wang Zuan encountered the Most High Lord of the Dao, who arrived in a chariot riding the void and bestowed upon him dozens of scriptures. In the Northern Wei, Celestial Master Kou Qianzhi dwelt on Mount Song, where he received from the Most High and others over sixty scrolls of Daoist scriptures—all methods for cultivating the mind and the Dao, praying for blessings, averting disasters, sweeping away demons, and rescuing people from epidemics. The remaining scriptures and teachings are too numerous to recount. The purpose of sending down these scriptures is to urge emperors, ministers, and common people of past and present to all practice goodness. The essentials of the scriptures are vast, but let me present their gist.

Heaven and earth hold human life as most precious; thus, the human body is as rare as the horn of a qilin, while the myriad things teem like the hairs of an ox. Having obtained this rare body, one should hasten to the path of cultivating truth, do good, and accumulate blessings, gradually approaching the wondrous Dao. This applies from the emperor down to the common people. Though their ranks differ, their nature and life are the same. Emperors are all heaven-sent beings temporarily descending to the human world. If they practice goodness and accumulate blessings, when they ascend to heaven, their positions will surpass their former ranks; if they do not practice goodness and accumulate blessings, the opposite will occur. Heavenly beings with minor merits or meager deeds are sent down to the world again, and only by accumulating blessings and aiding the people do they attain high positions.

In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor was sent down by heaven’s mandate. In his first life, he was a commoner; in his second, a minister; and in his third, a ruler. He saved the world and pacified the people, piling up merit and accumulating virtue, and when his allotted span was complete, he ascended to heaven, where his position surpassed his former one. The method for Your Majesty’s cultivation is no other: outwardly, cultivate hidden virtue; inwardly, secure the spirit. Relieving the people and protecting the masses, so that all under heaven feel secure—this is outward practice. Reducing desires and preserving the spirit—this is inward practice.

For humans, food and drink are fundamental. The pure part becomes essence and qi; the turbid part becomes urine and excrement. Indulgence in desires and lusts depletes essence and exhausts qi, leading to decline and exhaustion. Your Majesty should treasure and conserve them. Even a single night’s indulgence causes deep harm—how much more so for those who give free rein to their desires? Though complete abstinence may not be possible, merely moderating desire brings one close to the Dao.

The spirit is the child; qi is the mother. Qi flows through the eyes as tears, through the nose as mucus, through the tongue as saliva, through the exterior as sweat, through the interior as blood, through the bones as marrow, and through the kidneys as essence. When qi is whole, one lives; when qi is lost, one dies. When qi is abundant, one is strong; when qi is weak, one ages. If qi is constantly kept from scattering, it is like a child having its mother; if qi scatters, it is like a child losing its parents—what then can one rely upon?

Spirit and qi share the same body; essence and marrow share the same source. If Your Majesty were to sleep in stillness for a month, you would surely feel your spirit clear and refreshed, your sinews and bones strong and healthy. The ancients said: *Taking medicine for a thousand mornings is not as good as sleeping alone for a single night.* Medicine is but grass; essence is marrow. To cast aside marrow and add grass—what benefit is there? It is like a bag filled with gold, gradually removing the gold and adding iron. Over time, the gold is exhausted, and though the bag is full, it contains only iron. What difference is there in the principle of taking medicine?

The ancients married and established families for the sake of descendants. The former sages—Duke of Zhou, Confucius, and Mencius—each had children. Confucius was forty and no longer confused; Mencius was forty and his mind no longer wavered. After forty, a person’s qi and blood begin to decline, and thus the warning against lust. Your Majesty’s sagely sons and divine grandsons branch out widely—you should preserve and nurture yourself, abstain from desire, and consider your own well-being.

In former times, the Song Emperor Huizong was originally a heavenly being. There was a divine immortal named Lin Lingsu who led him on a spiritual journey to heaven, entering the palace where he dwelt. On its lintel was written *Divine Empyrean*; there was no hunger or thirst, no cold or heat, only carefree ease and boundless joy. He wished to dwell there forever, with no desire to return to the human world. Lin Lingsu urged him, saying: *Your Majesty was sent to the human world by heaven’s mandate to be the Son of Heaven; your allotted work is not yet complete—how can you remain here?* Thus, he descended to the human world. Later, the Jin state rose, and Emperor Taizu’s general Wanyan Loushi captured Huizong and took him north, where he grew old and eventually died in the northern capital. From this, we know that the joy of heaven surpasses that of the human world a myriadfold, and we also know that if one’s allotted cause is not yet complete, how can one suddenly return?

In my early years, I left home, and four of us studied the Dao together. Those three have already ascended and transformed like cicadas shedding their shells, casting off these mortal bones to depart. They can transform their bodies into hundreds or thousands, with no limit. I have endured countless hardships and have not yet been able to leave this world—this, too, is due to my allotted cause.

When a person has yet to be born, they abide within the Dao—neither cold nor hot, neither hungry nor thirsty, the mind free of thought—truly a state of bliss. Once born and given form, the eyes perceive colors, the ears hear sounds, the tongue savors tastes, and the mind contemplates affairs—thus a myriad concerns arise. The ancients, recognizing that the heart and intent cannot be mastered, likened the heart to a monkey and the intent to a horse, for their unruliness is plain to see. As the ancients said: *"It is easier to tame a fierce beast than to subdue the heart of an inch."* This is the swiftest path to attaining the Dao and ascending to heaven.

The Daoist cultivates truth and refines the heart, thinking of nothing, like the vast emptiness or still water. When the wind over water subsides, it becomes clear and tranquil, reflecting all things in brilliance. When the wind stirs, the water roils and muddies—how then can it mirror the myriad forms? The original true nature is as still as unmoving water. Yet when the eyes see colors, the ears delight in sounds, the tongue craves flavors, and the mind clings to affairs, these senses arise in ceaseless succession, like whirlwinds churning the waves.

At first, taming the heart is exceedingly difficult. With years of practice and deepening effort, one reduces and refines until reaching non-action. Even for a single Daoist, mastering the heart is hard—how much more so for the Son of Heaven, who rules the Four Seas and daily attends to ten thousand affairs? Yet if one can moderate desires, restrain thoughts, and preserve the precepts, one may still gain heaven’s protection and preserve life.

In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor crafted bows and arrows and forged weapons to awe the world. When his work was complete, he sought the immortal Guangchengzi to inquire about the Way of nurturing life. Guangchengzi replied: *"Do not let your thoughts run wild—this single word suffices."* I say that the Way of cultivating the self lies in harmony. Excessive anger harms the body, excessive joy harms the spirit, and excessive thought harms the qi—these three greatly damage the Dao and should be avoided.

Your Majesty already knows that the spirit is the true self, while the body is but an illusory vessel. When seeing forms and stirring desire, one should reflect that the body is transient while the spirit is real—thus the mind can be stilled. Human life is rare and precious. Consider the birds and beasts, which bear young every year, yet most perish in infancy; few reach adulthood or old age, and the same is true for humans. Thus, twenty or thirty years is a short lifespan, forty or fifty a moderate one, and sixty or seventy a long one. Your Majesty has now entered the age of long life—you should cultivate virtue and preserve your health to attain longevity.

Those who leave the household to study the Dao wear coarse clothes and eat simple food, avoiding the accumulation of wealth, for they fear it will harm the body and diminish blessings. Even those who cultivate the Dao while remaining in the world should moderate their diet, dwelling, treasures, and possessions, keeping within proper bounds and avoiding excess.

Beyond the Four Seas, across the vast earth, there are countless lands—myriad in number—where rare treasures and strange jewels abound. Yet none compare to the Central Plains, where heaven has bestowed scriptures and teachings, where the arts of governing the state and cultivating the self are most complete, and where extraordinary individuals have attained the Dao and ascended to heaven.

Shandong and Hebei are the finest lands under heaven, yielding fine grains, vegetables, fish, salt, silk, and hemp to supply the needs of all. Since ancient times, those who have possessed these lands have become great states. Thus, successive dynasties have contended for them. Now, these regions have suffered war and fire, their people scattered and unsettled. It would be wise to appoint capable officials well-versed in local affairs to oversee their governance, granting a three-year tax exemption. This would ensure ample silk and cloth for the state and military, while allowing the common people to recover and find peace—a single measure yielding two benefits, and a means of pacifying the people and seeking blessings. Heaven will surely favor this, and all shall prosper.

Though I dwell ten thousand *li* away, I did not hesitate to answer your summons. I have already spoken of the methods for cultivating the self and nurturing life—how could I withhold the Way of governing the state and protecting the people? Regarding the restoration of Shandong and Hebei, if capable officials are dispatched to implement the above measures, it will surely align with heaven’s will. But if unworthy men are appointed, it will not only be of no benefit but may even cause harm.

When the Jin first gained the realm, they rose from the eastern lands, and the customs of the Central Plains were not yet familiar to them. They enfeoffed Liu Yu in Dongping, governing for eight years before reclaiming it—this was a sound strategy for establishing their rule. I hope Your Majesty will give this careful consideration.

The essential Way of cultivating the self and nurturing life has now been fully transmitted. As for the arts of governing the state and protecting the people, I have briefly outlined their key points. Whether to employ them or not rests with Your Majesty’s judgment.

In the tenth year of Emperor Shizong of Jin’s reign, his excessive indulgence in sensual pleasures left him weak and enfeebled. At court assemblies, two attendants had to support him as he walked. Thereafter, he sought out eminent Daoists and inquired about methods of preservation. He once summoned me to ask about the Way of cultivating truth, and I spoke to him as I have to you. Afterward, his body grew strong again, and he walked as before. He reigned for thirty years before ascending in transcendence.

Throughout my life, I have studied the Dao with a heart free of thought and worry. In a dream, heaven’s intent seemed to say: *"Your merit and conduct are not yet complete—you must await the proper time to ascend and transform."* This illusory body is but a borrowed vessel, like an inn where one briefly lodges—what is there to cling to? The true body can soar and ascend, transforming into hundreds or thousands, with no limit to its manifestations. In heaven, one may dwell for a thousand years or ten thousand myriad—yet when affairs arise, one receives heaven’s mandate to descend to the world, entering a womb and taking form.

After transmitting the Way, I addressed His Majesty, saying: *"I have earnestly imparted these teachings, and you have respectfully received them. These are difficult matters to practice—yet how dare I not follow the immortal’s command and diligently apply them?"* The transmission of the Way was then recorded by close ministers in a book, which His Majesty will personally review. Should any profound meaning remain unclear, he may seek further instruction.

*The Record of the Auspicious Assembly of the Mysterious Wind* concludes.
