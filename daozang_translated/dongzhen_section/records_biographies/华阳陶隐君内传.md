**Preface to the Biography of Master Tao of Huayang**
*By Jia Song, the Hermit of Creeping Vines*

Some ask: Master Zhenbai (Tao Hongjing) already appears in *The Book of Liang* under *Biographies of Eminent Recluses*. Why compile another biography now?

*The Book of Liang* states: "Master Tao’s personal name was Hongjing, styled Tongming, a native of Moling in Danyang. His mother dreamed of two celestial beings holding incense burners, and so forth. When Emperor Gao of Qi became regent, he was appointed tutor to the imperial princes. Though dwelling within the vermilion gates, he remained aloof from worldly affairs. In the tenth year of *Yongming*, he doffed his court robes at the Gate of the Divine Tiger and submitted a memorial resigning his stipend. The imperial edict granted his request. The court officials saw him off at the Pavilion of the Conquered Barbarians, where the banquet was most lavish—none since the lands east of the Yangtze had seen its like. Thereafter, he wandered through famous mountains in search of transcendent herbs. Whenever he passed through valleys and ravines, he would sit or lie among them. He was especially fond of the wind in the pines and planted them throughout his courtyard. When Emperor Wu of Liang ascended the throne, he exchanged letters with the master without cease, sending messengers several times a month. The people of the time called him ‘the Prime Minister in the Mountains.’ He passed away in the second year of *Datong* at the age of eighty-five. His complexion remained unchanged, and his limbs retained their flexibility, and so forth."

The reason for compiling this biography in full is to clarify what was too brief in the earlier account. Here, I have also included the biographies by Zheng Zhang and Shi Jun, collating them together.

It may be said: The biography of the master in *The Book of Liang* is like the *Records of the Historian*’s account of the Old Master (Laozi). Its brevity omits much, leaving the deeds of the immortal sage obscure and tangled. Han Fei was recorded alongside Laozi, and many have debated this pairing. Yet *The Book of Liang* places the master among Shen Lin, Ruan Xiaoxu, Fan Yuandan, and Ma—what a disparity!

The master’s knowledge penetrated past and present; his undertakings illuminated the world. His spirit dwelled in stillness, his essence roamed the mysterious pivot. He established the three ranks to purge falsity, divided the five regions to mirror the threads of destiny, composed the *Secret Instructions* to elucidate the essentials, and expounded the *True Admonitions* to honor celestial transmissions. Beyond the subtle and obscure, he soared through the realm of purity and emptiness—truly the Dong Hu of the Daoist tradition, the Confucius of the Way.

Moreover, he expounded the ancient classics, immersed himself in the hundred schools, plumbed the patterns of heaven and earth and the stars, and mastered the arts of yin-yang and tortoise-shell divination. When comets appeared after the death of whales, when the moon was eclipsed in the land of unicorns, when bronze mountains collapsed and bells tolled in response, when silkworms spun their threads and the strings of the *shang* note snapped, when dragons sang and clouds arose, when tigers roared and winds stirred—these were the mysterious workings of nature, commonly called "resonance." The master analyzed their subtleties, showing they were neither resonance nor mere coincidence.

Could Shu Xiang, Zichan, Jing Fang, or Guo Pu compare to the master’s breadth of learning?

In the tenth year of *Yongming* of Qi, Minister Xie Lun of Wuxing heard that the master had resigned his post to retire at Huayang. On the road, he composed a *Biography*. Minister Xie’s *Biography* states: "The master’s personal name was Hongjing, a native of Danyang. From childhood, he displayed exceptional conduct, keen perception, and vast knowledge. He thoroughly studied the Five Classics, the philosophers, and the histories. Skilled in calligraphy, he mastered the methods of past and present."

In his youth, he harbored ambitions of riding clouds and driving dragons, refusing marriage and officialdom. Yet with no means to sustain himself, he briefly served in a minor post as a tutor to the Prince of Yidu. Though dwelling within vermilion gates, he lived alone in a single chamber, seldom engaging with the outside world. Day and night, he transcribed and studied esoteric texts, dedicating over twenty years to the practice of dietary regimens. Gradually, he penetrated the profound and subtle, though much of his work remained secret. As his arts advanced, he cast off his official robes and settled on Mount Mao.

His bearing was luminous and refined, his gaze radiant; his frame was slender and tall, his neck and ears finely wrought—clearly set apart from the common crowd. Here ends Minister Xie’s *Biography*.

This account, along with that in the *History of Liang*, is exceedingly cursory. I cannot fathom why Minister Xie Lun, having heard of the master’s retreat to the mountains and feeling such admiration, would hastily compose a *Biography* en route, one so lacking in thorough investigation of his merits and deeds.

Tao Hongjing remarked: "The *Biography* Wang Xizhi wrote of Master Xu was much the same." As that account was too sparse to be of use, Tao Yu (Hongjing’s nephew) compiled the *Original Records*. Yet even by the end of the Qi dynasty, many matters remained omitted or incomplete. Though Yu was the master’s nephew, his *Original Records* only approximated thoroughness, marred by a base literary style and excessive trivialities. He himself admitted: "This is not yet a proper *Biography*; it merely records his conduct to prevent its loss." Why it ceased abruptly in the first year of *Yongyuan* remains unknown.

Later, Pan Quanwen, a disciple of the master, continued the work. He wrote: "Tao Yu’s *Original Records* end at the close of the Qi dynasty. For the subsequent twenty-odd years, no further records exist. I have thus compiled these annals year by year, leaving a fuller *Biography* to future scholars." Beginning in the first year of *Tianjian*, he recorded events until the summer of the seventh year, fourth month. At that time, the master changed his name and secretly journeyed to distant mountains. In the summer of the seventh year of *Tianjian*, the master traveled south under his new name, as detailed in the *Biography*. With no one aware of his whereabouts, Quanwen’s account also ends here.

Alas! The two earlier *Biographies*—those in the *History of Liang* and by Minister Xie—are far too brief. The disciples’ compilations, meanwhile, lack coherence, nearly erasing the path of one who withdrew from the world, the traces of his pure cultivation and soaring spirit. Thus, drawing from the *Dengzhen Yinjue*, the *Zhen’gao*, the *Taiqing Jing*, and the master’s collected writings, I have pieced together these events and composed this work in three fascicles.

*Hua Yang Tao Yinju Neizhuan*, Fascicle One
Compiled by Biluo Ruzi Jia Song

The master’s personal name was Hongjing, styled Tongming, a native of Moling in Danyang. The *Original Records* state that his residence lay in Baiyang Alley. His lineage traces back to Emperor Yao. When Yao governed Jizhou, his family dwelt in Pingyang. The Western Han Chancellor Qingdi and the Eastern Han Minister of Works Dun were illustrious figures of this line. During Dong Zhuo’s burning of Luoyang, the thirteenth-generation ancestor, Chao, crossed the Yangtze, becoming a native of Danyang. The seventh-generation ancestor, Jun, served the Wu kingdom as General of the South, as the *Original Records* note: "He was the younger brother of Huang, Inspector of Jiaozhou." He was enfeoffed as Marquis of Jurong. After Wu’s fall, the family moved north. During the Yongjia upheaval, they migrated south again. The *Original Records* state: "Jun was the third son of the founding ancestor. During Yongjia, he served as Marshal to Sima Yue, Prince of Donghai, leading garrison troops to Xuchang. After their defeat, he returned south and became a staff officer under Wang Dun, the Grand Marshal. Dun petitioned to restore his household registration, and later, he was appointed Consultant to the Chariot and Horse General, though he declined. His grandfather, Pi, was upright and spirited, refusing office."

His great-grandfather, Xinggong, served as a clerk in the commandery. The *Original Records* note: "He was versatile and adept at managing property. He was nominated as Filial and Incorrupt, appointed to Guangjin County." His grandfather, Long, stood seven *chi* and five *cun* tall, with a dignified bearing. Skilled in medicine, he devoted himself to healing. He accompanied Emperor Wu of Song in the campaign against Yao Hong and was enfeoffed as Marquis of Yuanfeng in Jin’an. The *Original Records* add: "When Yan Jun sought his residence to expand a temple, he refused and resigned his post. Later, his title was revoked, and he was exiled to Guangzhou, eventually rising to Prefect of Xinhui."

His father, Zhenbao, styled Guozhong, was a renowned figure in Jiangdong. He served as Investigating Censor in the Southern Terrace and later as Chancellor of Xiaochang in Jiangxia. The *Original Records* state: "He was also skilled in archery, understood medicine, and was widely read in the philosophers and histories. His bearing was elegant. He befriended Xiao Sihua, Wang Zhao, and Liu Bing." In the winter of the fourth year of *Yuanhui*, he was sent as an envoy to the northern court to foster goodwill between neighboring states. He composed a travelogue and poems.

Initially, the master’s mother, Lady Hao—the *Original Records* name her Zhi Zhen, a native of Donghai—experienced an auspicious sign before his birth. She dreamed a blue dragon emerged from her bosom and soared into the eastern sky. The *Original Records* describe it thus: "A blue dragon suddenly issued from her body, ascending straight into the heavens." The *History of Liang* records: "She dreamed two celestial beings bearing an incense burner approached her, and soon after, she conceived." The accounts differ. Since the *Original Records* were compiled by the master’s nephew, Yu, how could such details escape the historians’ notice? Upon waking, she examined herself and found no injury. The next day, she told others: "I shall bear an extraordinary son, though he will leave no descendants." Someone replied: "Might he become an immortal?" The *Original Records* add: "Upon waking, she secretly told Zhou: 'I shall soon give birth to a son, one destined for greatness.'" In the third year of *Xiaojian* of Song, on the thirtieth day of the fourth month, at midnight, the master was born. The *Original Records* specify: "The year was *bingshen*, the day *jiaxu*. That year had an intercalary fifth month. The following dawn marked the Summer Solstice."

At dawn, his mother bathed and, feeling a slight discomfort in her body, rose. When the master was first born, he did not cry out in alarm. As soon as he could sit, he showed exceptional intelligence. At five or six, he was deeply fond of writing, and even when playing before the curtains, he would only hold brush and inkstone. By eight or nine, he had read over a thousand volumes and was quite skilled in composition. Upon reading the *Biographies of Divine Transcendents* by Ge Zhichuan of Yibu, he encountered the tale of the Eight Lords of Huainan.

The *Original Records* state: A village elder, the Ju family, lent him the sixth fascicle of Ge Hong’s *Biographies of Divine Transcendents*. He held the scroll to sleep at night, declaring: "To climb the azure clouds and ride the white sun—how distant could it be?" From then on, he became deeply devoted and awakened to a resolve for the life beyond the world. His bearing was lofty and untrammeled, his complexion luminous and refined. Whenever he went out, passersby would gather to watch, all saying: "Young Master Tao is a fallen immortal from the Jade Capital." He would then take up a feather fan to shield himself, never putting it aside, even in winter.

At eleven, he composed a eulogy for Academician Wang Hao. The *Original Records* note: Hao was the son of Sima Zhao, the Chief Clerk of the Minister of Personnel. The master’s written response to Hao was as composed as that of a seasoned scholar.

At fifteen, he returned from the southern provinces. The *Original Records* state: At thirteen, his father followed Liu Bing, the Minister of Personnel, to Huainan. At fifteen, he returned to the capital and lodged at the residence of his maternal uncle, Xu Zhou. There, he composed *A Record of Mountain-Seeking*. The text of this *Record* is preserved in his collected works.

Upon coming of age, the master refused to marry. He maintained purity and renounced desires, for his entire life never drawing near to sensual pleasures. He would say: "I wish to keep my spirit untroubled." He stood seven *chi* and two *cun* tall, with sparse brows and a broad forehead. On his right shoulder was a purple mark the size of a coin. According to the *Later Sacred Register of the Golden Watchtower*, the Azure Lad remarked: "These are all signs of an immortal." On his right thigh were several dozen black moles, arranged in the shape of the Big Dipper. He disliked meat and strong flavors, partaking only of green-grain rice. The *Biography of the Perfected One of Pure Emptiness* contains a recipe with *nan zhu* as the main ingredient—this was the diet of the highest immortals. He was deeply fond of the sound of pines, and wherever he lived, he would plant them himself. Feeling his reading had not yet reached ten thousand volumes, he supplemented it with esoteric texts. Thus, he rarely left the prefecture, declining all official summons.

His father had been close friends with Liu Bing, who served as Governor of Danyang. Bing’s son, Si, was renowned from a young age and deeply devoted to literature. The master befriended him, sharing carriages when they went out and meals when they dined.

At that time, the Song dynasty had lost its virtue, and Emperor Cangwu met his end. The *History of the Song* states: Emperor Yu, the eldest son of Emperor Ming, ascended the throne but ruled with madness and cruelty. He used Qi Gao as a target for archery, and upon Gao’s death, posthumously demoted him to Prince Cangwu. Xiao Daocheng established himself, and Emperor Shun remained in power. Shen Youzhi, the Governor of Jingzhou, raised troops in defiance. Daocheng entered the capital to secure the court. The *History of the Song* notes: Emperor Shun was the third son. As Qi Gao monopolized the power of deposition, half the realm resisted. Thus, Gao entered the capital to take control.

The Minister of Personnel, Yuan Yi, plotted with others at Stone Citadel to assassinate Daocheng, and Liu Bing was involved. They fled to Stone Citadel, taking their followers with them. The master, along with Han Ben and Mi Dan, drafted official documents. Daocheng led troops to crush Stone Citadel. The *History of the Song* records: The Minister of Personnel, Yuan Yi, conspired at Stone Citadel to kill Daocheng but failed and was soon annihilated. The *Original Records* state: At twenty-two, the master followed Liu of Danyang into Stone Citadel to support Yuan Yi’s cause. The master remained steadfast in his loyalty, never abandoning old ties. Even in peril and uncertainty, he did not seek to withdraw.

Afterward, the master was able to leave. Si became a wandering monk. The *Original Records* note: That night, the city fell, and Si, along with his younger brother, barely escaped toward the capital. They were captured, and Si died in the prison of Jiankang. No one dared to look upon his body, but the master wept over it and personally arranged his burial. The *Original Records* add: The master personally collected his remains and buried them, mourning at the old grave.

Earlier, Si had been one of the Four Companions of Emperor Shun, along with Jiang Chi and Chu Xuan, and had composed *Seven Linked Pearls in Praise of Song Virtue*, which was celebrated in his time. The original text was now lost. The master sighed and said: "Whether wise or foolish, all perish within a hundred years. What matters is leaving behind a name to be cherished by later generations. Alas, Liu’s name and works are both lost!" The *Original Records* state: After Liu Si’s flight from Stone Citadel, his writings were scattered. The master wished to compile them but could not recover them.

The following year, Daocheng was enfeoffed as Duke of Qi and granted the Nine Bestowments. The mandate of heaven was seen to have found its rightful recipient. The master, having long been allied with the Liu family, harbored deep unease. The *Original Records* note: After leaving Stone Citadel, the master wished to renounce the world and seek the mountains, but the transition between Song and Qi unsettled the realm. Bound by his ties to the Liu family, he remained anxious and troubled. He then sought an introduction through Ji Zhen to meet at Xinting, where he was warmly received and invited to stay within the tent.

After Shen Youzhi was pacified, he returned to the Eastern Residence and served as tutor to Daocheng’s sons. The *Original Records* state: After Shen Youzhi’s defeat, he returned to the Eastern Residence and was appointed tutor to the fifth son, Ye, and the sixth son, Gui, while also managing the household records. At twenty-three, he was appointed Gentleman Attendant to the Prince of Baling. After Emperor Gao of Qi ascended the throne, he was appointed Gentleman Attendant to the Prince of Yuzhang. The *History of the Liang* states: When Emperor Gao served as regent, he appointed the master as tutor to the various princes. This is incorrect. The master knew he was being sidelined by those close to the emperor and declined the second appointment.

The following year, he accompanied the Prince of Ancheng to garrison Stone Citadel. At the beginning of Emperor Shizu’s reign, he was appointed Gentleman Attendant to the Prince of Yidu, with the title General of Vibrant Might. During the Qi dynasty, the Gentleman Attendants also oversaw the duties of the Secretariat.

The master’s compositions for auspicious and inauspicious occasions, both within and beyond the court—whether formal protocols, memorials, petitions, or official dispatches—surpassed all others. Whenever he dipped his brush to write, his words became the standard for all. *The Record of Origins* states: "The master’s handling of ceremonial forms, memorials, and brushwork for both courtly and external affairs—including memorials, petitions, and dispatches—was unmatched. Several princes’ scribes and record-keepers came to study and adopt his work as their model." The various princes’ attendants seethed with envy and slander, yet the master remained untroubled, his demeanor ever serene.

When the Prince of Guiyang ascended the Double Terrace, he hosted a feast for the imperial clan’s marquises and princes, along with their guests. The master, accompanying the Prince of Yidu, was among them. The Prince of Guiyang announced a poetic theme, drawing ten topics from a vessel. The master drew "Water Immortal" and was greatly pleased. His *Rhapsody* (recorded in full in the collected works) so moved Shen Yue and Ren Fang that they sighed: "It is like gazing upon the autumn sea—one sees only boundless expanse, yet cannot fathom its depths." Such was the reverence he commanded.

Soon after, he was appointed Palace Gentleman of the Left Guard, though contemporary opinion deemed the post beneath him.

Bedao Jing repeatedly spoke of him to Emperor Wu, who replied: "The late emperor once personally held this office. Pei Songzhi was promoted from it to Gentleman Attendant, for I hold it in esteem—how could you not know?" *The Primary Record* states: He was then twenty-nine years old.

As the new halls of the Azure Palace were completed, the emperor was keen on excursions and feasts. The master submitted a memorial with an ode, which was then acclaimed as unmatched. One day at Shitou, he fell into a trance, as if transported elsewhere, remaining unaware of all around him for seven days. When he suddenly recovered, he said: "I witnessed most extraordinary things," but kept them secret, revealing nothing. *The Primary Record* states: At twenty-nine, while at Shitou, he suddenly fell ill, losing consciousness. He took no medicine, nor ate or drank, and after seven days abruptly recovered, claiming to have seen many visions. Thereafter, his complexion grew wan and haggard, and his speech became slow and halting.

That year, Sun Youyue of Shuyang first transmitted to the master the Daoist talismans and charts. Though said to be authentic transmissions, they had passed through many hands in copying, and he found them unsatisfactory. The following year, he journeyed to Mount Mao. *The Primary Record* states: In the year *wuchen*, he first went to Mount Mao. There, he sought out scriptures and methods, yet soon cast off his robes and departed, his quest for the Dao beginning in earnest. He obtained the original handwritten texts of the earlier adepts Yang and Xu from the Xingning era.

According to the *True Records*: In the third year of Xingning of the Jin, the Perfected of Great Clarity, Lord Mao; the Perfected of Purple Yang, Lord Zhou; the Lady of the Purple Tenuity, Consort An of Nine Flowers; and other transcendents all descended upon Yang Xi at Mount Mao, while the father and son of the Xu family likewise received their teachings. Yang and Xu, moved by these revelations, left behind writings of luminous clarity. The master now obtained these texts—truly, Heaven had entrusted them to him. His heart leapt with reverence, as if he had beheld the Perfected in person. He then examined the correspondence of the Three Perfected and learned that much of what he had acquired was still incomplete or lost. He searched far and wide, and thus requested leave to travel east. He visited Lou Huiming at Mount Dahong, encountered Du Jingchan at Mount Taiping, and sought out the monk Zhong Yishan at Mount Chao. With humble words and earnest pleas, he obtained over ten scrolls in the hand of the Perfected.

He wandered for over two hundred days before returning to the capital. *The Primary Record* states: He traveled through mountains and rivers for over two hundred days before returning. Soon after, he set out again, seeking lost writings, and obtained many more. From Changshan in Dongyang to Tianmu in Wuxing, and through the renowned mountains of Yuqian, Linhai, and Sui’an, there was no peak he did not explore. His body was light and agile, and climbing posed no difficulty. When he encountered crumbling cliffs or sheer precipices, he would clamber up with ease. In secluded ravines or deep gorges, he would chant, bathe, and linger, sitting or lying among the flowers and herbs. Even when apes cried or birds roosted, he could not bring himself to leave, often spending nights alone among the deer. He often said: "Though vermilion gates and spacious halls are splendid, I feel no desire to go there. Gazing upon towering crags and vast marshes, I know such places are hard to dwell in—yet I am always drawn to them, unable to explain why. It must be the work of the numinous."

Upon his return to the capital, he was appointed Gentleman Consultant through the recommendation of the General of Vibrant Might. In his youth, the master had often said that the court and marketplace were no place for joy. As he grew older, witnessing the transitions from Song to Qi, he saw the times were not yet ripe, and so remained in a lowly position, drifting between wind and fire. But when he learned of the rising turmoil of war, he shook out his robes, turned eastward, and said: "I depart." He often spoke of how within the great heavens there are thirty-six grotto-heavens. *The Transmission of Mao* states: Within the great heavens lie thirty-six grotto-heavens beneath the earth, and in the eight seas, the divine mountains also have their grotto-palaces, some a thousand *li* or five hundred *li* in extent, not counted among the thirty-six. On the left bank of the Yangtze, Mount Fulong is the eighth, called the Golden Altar Grotto of Flourishing Yang. The Three Lords Mao attained the Dao and dwelt there. "I shall go there for good," he resolved.

Confucius said: "Seclude yourself to fulfill your aspirations; practice righteousness to realize the Way. I have heard these words, but never seen such a man." The master said: "Today, my righteousness is fulfilled, and I have no further direction. Let me follow the path of seeking my aspirations." He then styled himself "Recluse of Flourishing Yang." *The Primary Record* states: In his letters and documents, he used this name in place of his own—just as Shi’an was called "Mysterious Repose" and Zhichuan "Embracer of Simplicity."

This was the tenth year of Yongming. *The Primary Record* states: The year *renshen*, when he was thirty-seven. The day of his departure drew near, and he instructed his attendants to leave the capital first. After bidding farewell at the ministry, he took his court robes and hung them at the Gate of the Divine Tiger, donning a deer-hide cap and walking out alone with a single attendant. He then took leave of Wang Yan, speaking of his plans. Yan said: "His Majesty is most strict in governance and does not permit men to act in strange or lofty ways. If this incurs his displeasure, you will bring trouble upon yourself and thwart your mountain aspirations. What then?" The master fell silent for a long while, then said: "I act for myself, not for fame. If this is a concern, why proceed thus?" He did not go to the ministry but submitted a memorial of resignation alone.

Zheng Zhang and Shi Jun said: In the tenth year of Yongming, the master removed his court robes at the Gate of the Divine Tiger, submitted a memorial to resign his stipend, and was granted leave by imperial decree. They knew the beginning but not the end. The memorial is recorded in full in the collected works.

The memorial having been submitted, an imperial rescript was issued in reply. The rescript’s full text is recorded in the collected works. As he prepared to depart, he took leave of the Prince of Yidu. Both were choked with sobs, unable to speak. Those around them dared not lift their gaze. Someone said to the Prince of Yidu: “Your Highness holds him in such deep affection and esteem—how can you allow him to go?” The prince replied: “This is the finest deed in the realm. The Son of Heaven has permitted him to withdraw from court service. How dare I oppose it?”

He presented a fur robe and a mirror as parting gifts and assigned several officials and servants to attend him in the mountains.

*The Record of Origins* states: The master had formerly served as tutor to the Princes of Ancheng and Yidu and was on familiar terms with all the imperial princes, young and old alike. The Princes of Wuling, Poyang, Guiyang, and Hengyang each received him with exceptional warmth, and whenever he visited, their conversations would last the whole day. During the Yongtai era, he carefully avoided drawing attention to himself, consistently demonstrating his desire for retirement, and thus remained free of entanglement in worldly affairs. The Prince of Yidu, discerning from childhood and having known the master the longest, shared an especially close bond. The master, too, devoted himself wholeheartedly to guiding him. When he learned that the master intended to renounce the world, he repeatedly broke into tears. At their final parting, he spoke as before.

Someone again asked the Prince of Yidu: “How can you let him go?” The prince replied: “Recently, the Prince of Wuling sought to appoint him as a local administrator, but I argued strenuously to prevent it. Out of caution, I did not meet with the Prince of Wuling for three days. Now, this is the finest deed in the realm—how could I, out of personal attachment, delay his long-cherished withdrawal from court?” The next morning, a farewell gathering was held. He presented nine items—a fur robe and a mirror—as parting gifts, along with clothing, books, and a carriage for official travel. Five or six attendants accompanied him personally, seeing him as far as Hushu, while several officials and servants were permanently assigned to manage his affairs in the mountains, with messengers dispatched monthly.

The Princes of Wuling, Guiyang, and Poyang each sent poems and gifts, along with servants and supplies to assist him.

Once the master had boarded his boat to cross the river, the nobles and high officials of the Qi court gathered at the Zhenglu Pavilion to see him off. Raising their cups and waving their sleeves, they all declared: “Nothing like this has been seen east of the Yangtze in recent times—only today do we witness it. Even the Two Shus, who amassed wealth before returning to their fields, cannot be called lofty in comparison.” The master replied: “The First Emperor of Qin, the Founder of Han, Xiang Yu, and Sun Ce—all wielded power that shook the seas and dominated the heavens. Yet when their last breath faded, they became but clods of earth. How much more so for the likes of us? Dwelling high in the clouded peaks, seeking the hidden abodes of the immortals—this is my true purpose.”

As dusk fell, they parted. Even the charioteers rejoiced for him. Those who had come to see him off said to one another: “The solitary swan has soared beyond the heavens, while we remain bound to our grains, leaping and stumbling within the snares of the world.”

The following year, great chaos engulfed the Qi dynasty, and the Marquis of Xichang, Xiao Luan, murdered his sovereign. Only then did they recognize the master’s foresight.

*Inner Biography of Master Hidden-Cinnabar of Huayang, Volume One* ends.
*Inner Biography of Master Hidden-Cinnabar of Huayang, Volume Two* begins.

Master Biluo’s disciple, Jia Song, records:

Initially, the Master sought the Great Mao and Middle Mao peaks at Mount Accumulated Gold, where the land was suited for cultivating the Supreme Dao. As the *True Instructions* states: “The Great Mao and Middle Mao peaks stand connected, with a long ridge between them called Linked Stone, known in ancient times as Mount Accumulated Gold. The place is fit for human dwelling—one should seek a water-adjacent site for a tranquil abode.” There, he settled, for the conditions were ripe for compounding the elixir and pursuing the Supreme Dao. On the western slope of the ridge, he established the Upper and Lower Halls of Huayang. The *Hidden Instructions on Ascending to Perfection* explains: “The Upper Hall is for refining emptiness and preserving the true; the Lower Hall is for concocting the elixir and preparing medicines.”

He wore a purple kerchief and a quilted cloak, and thrice received the *Lai* hempen robes. As the *Collected Scrolls* notes: “Someone once gifted him a red-silk quilt, which the Master rebuked and returned, saying, ‘Recently, someone presented me with three *Lai* robes from Jin’an—those were excellent.’” The hempen robes were woven with striped patterns: nine stripes on the left, ten on the right, following the method of the Two Radiant Ones.

His spirit dwelled in serene stillness, his essence roamed the farthest mysteries. Though he wandered alone in the rustling winds, exalted in his solitary truth, letters from kin and old friends, as well as visitors from near and far, continued to arrive—he could not entirely sever such ties. Once, he inscribed a poem on a paulownia leaf and sent it to the Prince of Yidu. Its closing lines read:

*“Would that I were a pair of white wings,
To sweep forever the dust before me.”*

Soon after, he dreamed one night that the Prince of Yidu had passed, and would be reborn in two years. The Master asked: *“Where shall you go?”*

The Prince replied, *“I do not know.”* He then inquired about matters among the spirits and ghosts. With clasped hands, they parted in sorrow. The Master urged him to stay longer, but the Prince said his finger pained him and he could not linger. The next day, the Master sent someone to the capital to make inquiries, only to learn that the Prince had already been murdered.

*The Record of Origins* states: In the eleventh year of Yongming, the Prince of Yidu was appointed Governor of Nanyuzhou and stationed at Gushu. By the end of Yanxing, his fate was not of Heaven’s decree. On the eighteenth day of the eleventh month, the Master suddenly dreamed of the Prince as before. Awakening from sleep, he was struck with grief and astonishment. The following day, he dispatched someone to the capital to inquire, and learned that the Prince had been put to death on the tenth day of that same month.

When Emperor Ming ascended the throne, he held the Master in deep admiration, sending frequent summons and offering a grand carriage and lavish gifts to welcome him to reside on Mount Jiang. The Master declined, and the matter was dropped.

*The Record of Origins* states: In the third year of Emperor Ming of Song, officials were sent to insistently invite the Master to reside on Mount Jiang. The Master firmly refused, and through Jiang You’s memorial, the request was withdrawn. Thereafter, messengers came and went several times a month, bearing repeated gifts and offerings, granting whatever he desired.

The Master, in every matter, restrained and declined. Thereupon, a multi-storied tower was constructed atop the upper residence. At the beginning of the Yongyuan era, he ascended the tower to dwell in prolonged stillness.

*The Record of Origins* states: In the fourth year, a layered tower was built, designed to sever worldly ties. In the first year of Yongyuan, he moved to reside there, abruptly cutting off all contact with the external world. Even the exchange of letters ceased. From then on, he was entirely secluded, with only one or two attendants for morning and evening service. His hidden radiance and concealed brilliance embodied the principle of "non-action yet nothing left undone." The hall where he dwelled was tranquil, with no overgrowth of brambles. Though he had long lamented the distance to water, suddenly a spring gushed forth, lingzhi mushrooms flourished beneath the lower residence, sweet dew blanketed the Bright Terrace, and furred turtles swam in the front pond. White rats appeared in the medicinal hut—all grand omens of his attainment of the true Dao, and auspicious signs of sagely proximity.

That year, he commanded his disciples Dai Tan, Bing Ce, and Zhi Jian to bestow upon his follower Lu Jingyou of Wu Commandery the governance of Lian Stone Village along with ten *gu*. The world calls these *xi*; immortals call them *sai*. Nine represents the utmost yang, the position of a ruler. Ten signifies the completion of yin, used here as a regulatory measure. Confucius said: "The Zhou possessed great *sai*, enriching the good." Thus, it was named the "Ten *Sai*." The title conferred was "Reclusive Scholar of Tranquil Abode." The text of the document is recorded in full in the collected works.

At that time, the Eastern Wei ruler failed in his duty, and the lands south of the Yangtze trembled in peril. *The Book of Qi* states: The deposed Emperor Donghun Hou, whose personal name was Baoxu, was cruel and savage upon ascending the throne. No precedent in history matched his atrocities—he disemboweled pregnant women, slaughtered commoners, and ventured out nearly thirty times a month, with no fixed destination, driving his retinue northward in chaotic haste. When he was to depart for the suburbs at dawn, he would drive officials and clerks before him, filling the roads with clamor and shouts. Wherever the sound of drums was heard, people fled in terror. Those who offended him were slain on the spot. Craftsmen and merchants abandoned their trades, and firewood-gatherers dared not tread the paths.

Some abandoned their sick and cast aside the dead, leaving corpses unburied. The myriad people wailed in distress, their suffering exceeding even that of those mired in mud and ashes. When General Xiao Yan of the Eastern Expedition encamped at Stone Citadel, the righteous forces within the Eastern Wei’s Baota City wavered in hesitation. Observing the celestial signs, the Master discerned the turning of the times; gazing upon the hearts of the people, he pitied their suffering in the depths of calamity. Thus, he swiftly presented prophetic omens and sent letters to encourage and commend.

*The Record of Origins* states: The Master had long noted the portents since the Yongyuan era. Upon hearing of the righteous army’s westward advance, he awaited its arrival day and night with eager anticipation. When it reached Xinlin, he immediately composed a missive in praise and dispatched his disciple Dai Mengzhi to deliver it by relay. The journey reached Zaojia Bridge, but the messenger could proceed no further. Later, upon ascending Stone Citadel, the Master sent Li Sigong to present a memorial, which was promptly answered. This occurred on the first day of the eleventh month. Though the imperial court remained heavily fortified, many, mindful of the Cui clan’s downfall, hesitated. The Master, however, remained unwavering, and all matters proceeded in orderly succession.

During the investiture and abdication, Fan Yun and Shen Yue rode alongside to assist in the mandate, yet the name of the new dynasty remained undecided. The Master cited Wang Zinian’s *Returning Song*, which repeatedly spoke of "water cleaving wood," and Wang Jun’s *Palindromic Divination*, both of which employed auspicious phrases. He further invoked three poems, all extolling the character *Liang* as the sign of the destined era. Indeed, all the prophetic omens concurred that *Liang* was the symbol of the mandate. When the time came for the proclamation, he again designated the bingyin day of the fourth month.

*The Record of Origins* states: As spring gave way to early summer and the proclamation neared, Shen Yue announced the imperial decree and requested a fixed date. Though the Master had initially proposed a different day, he ultimately settled on the eighth day of the fourth month, bingyin. That evening, rain fell. *The Record of Origins* records: On the night of yichou, clouds gathered and rain drizzled, causing deep concern at court. By dawn, as the Master ascended the altar to kindle the sacred flames and complete the rites of succession, the imperial carriage returned to the palace, accompanied by the jubilant procession of officials. That very night, the rain poured down in torrents. The court sighed in awe, and none doubted the will of Heaven.

After Emperor Wu of Liang ascended the throne, his reverence for the Master only deepened. He dispatched Zhu Sizhi and the palace attendant Huang Lu to the mountain with an urgent summons. The Master drew two oxen: one in the wild, content and free, the other adorned in embroidered robes, followed by a man wielding a knife and holding a rope. The Emperor remarked, "Is this one to learn from the tortoise that drags its tail in the mud? How could such a creature be lured forth?" He then wrote to the Master: "Now that the burden of the imperial throne weighs upon me, I wish to become your disciple in earnest. Might this be possible?" He further inquired about the duration of his reign: "How long will my allotted span endure?"

The Master replied, "Twice the cycle of the celestial stems." Later, he added, "Emperor Guangwu departed after forty-eight years; now, you shall ascend to seventy-seven before riding upon those white clouds." The Emperor reigned for forty-nine years, and all such foreknowledge proved true.

The Master diligently pursued the supreme Dao, mastering its essential principles with such swiftness that even the ascent of a ladder to the clouds or the reins of a chariot could not surpass it. His skill in medicine was unparalleled. He immersed himself in contemplation, with only cinnabar and orpiment as his gateways. In refining the nine-fold elixir of cinnabar, realgar was the chief ingredient. At that time, the Later Wei and Yuwen Tai were powerful, and the roads to Wudu were blocked, making realgar unattainable.

In the third year of the Tianjian era, the Master dreamed of someone saying, "The elixir can still be made." That very night, the Emperor also dreamed of a figure who declared, "With ambition but no tools, how can one act lightly?" The verse echoed that of Emperor Wu of Han. Only after some time did he awaken to its meaning.

The imperial messenger, Attendant Huang Lu, informed the Master: "I surmise that the elixir of the knife-point has yet to be completed, and the three great elixirs remain deficient. It is fitting to speak frankly to a true person of true heart, for there should be no difficulty in doing so." The Master initially demurred: "Would I rather follow the path of Shao Jun?" The Emperor then revealed to him the purport of his dream, whereupon he commanded his disciples Lu Yichong and Pan Yuanwen to open the eastern slopes of Mount Jijin as a site for transmutation and alchemy, carving stone to channel the mountain stream’s eastward flow.

The Master observed that among the ranks of elixirs, the many methods—such as the Nine Tripods and Nine Elixirs of the Yellow Emperor, or those recorded in the *Dengzhen Yinjue* (which notes that this formula derives from the *Taiqing Zhongjing* but has undergone alterations and corruptions, rendering it beyond the grasp of later generations)—along with the Nine Flowers of Zuo Ci (as the *Zhen’gao* states: "Zuo Ci attained the benefits of the furnace fire’s Nine Flowers," referring to this), remain obscure in the world. Others, such as the Five Spirits, Seven Transformations, and techniques for summoning the divine essence and calling forth the soul, number nearly thirty varieties, yet these serve only to restore youth and prolong life, achieving no more than earthbound immortality. Some methods are flawed or incomplete, rendering them unreliable. Others are of low rank and limited scope, incapable of attaining lofty transcendence. The elixirs previously listed are all minor techniques of the Taiqing tradition, not the supreme methods of the Shangqing or Great Ultimate. Even the Guardians of the Void and Controllers of the Luminous Essence do not partake of these.

There are, moreover, two Gold Liquids, though their preparation presents obstacles. As the *Dengzhen Yinjue* records: the first is the Great One’s Gold Liquid, annotated by the *Baopuzi*. This could be achieved were it not for the lack of nitre, and without the true person’s handwritten instructions, its reliability remains uncertain. The second is the Taiqing Gold Liquid, transmitted by Anqi, but it requires brine and refined salt, which are difficult to procure in quantity, and its ritual demands sacrificial vessels, posing further impediments. Among the supreme methods of the loftiest immortals, there are four, yet the four ingredients remain undisclosed.

Though formulas exist in the world, doubts persist of spurious attributions. The *Profound and Weighty* of Langxie, with its annotations in the *Dengzhen Yinjue*, records the scriptures of the Shangqing method. The *Exquisite and Subtle* of Quchen, also preserved in the *Dengzhen Yinjue*, contains the formulas of the Great Ultimate method. These two methods are not only beyond the grasp of lesser adepts, but both further require brine salt and nitre, which are difficult to obtain. Only the minerals and stones used in the Nine Cycles may be readily sought. The structure of its formula is concise, its words neither excessive nor verbose, and its meaning clear and comprehensible—thus one may seal one’s vow and devote oneself wholeheartedly.

The *Dengzhen Yinjue* states: the Nine-Cycled Divine Elixir, the *Ascending Void Scripture*, was transmitted by the Perfected of the Great Ultimate to Master Changli, who in turn transmitted it to Lord Wang, the Governor of All Perfected of Xicheng. Lord Wang then transmitted it to the Perfected of the Grand Prime. In the fourth year, Master Changli took residence east of the mountain range, entrusting Wang Faming with the care of the Upper Lodge, while Lu Yichong resided in the Lower Lodge, accompanied by Pan Yuanwen, Xu Lingzhen, and Yang Chaoyuan. That year, they tended to the furnace and crucible.

The following New Year’s Day, the crucible was opened without success. The *Collected Scrolls* states: In the fifth year of Tianjian, on the first day of the first lunar month, the crucible was opened—only the two uppermost yellow essences had lightly sublimated, while the remaining elixir’s verdant edges had just begun to glow crimson. On the Double Ninth, the furnace was relit, but the process repeatedly failed to align. The *Record of Origins* states: On the ninth day of the ninth month, the furnace was rekindled; from the moment the fire was lit, the crucible developed many fine cracks. Moreover, thunder shook the mountains, raising concerns that the essence might be startled and dissipate. Thus, further refinements were made, and the fire was not dared to burn fiercely. When the allotted time expired and the crucible was opened again, there was still no success. The *Record of Origins* states: At the year’s end, the crucible was opened as the deadline arrived, and the lower crucible had cracked.

In his daily life, the Master maintained a solemn demeanor, as if perpetually in purification. From the moment he began to refine his mind and conduct further alchemy, his vigilance only deepened. When lighting the crucible, he used a yang-burning mirror to kindle fire from the sun at midday—such was the precision of his devotion. By nature, he slept little and never napped during the day. At night, he would often sit until dawn. He was accustomed to reading by moonlight, but by this time, he had been so thoroughly smoked by the fumes. The *Dengzhen Yinjue* states: From the initial firing in the fourth year until the deadline expired, nearly twelve hundred *hu* of husks from Pangu Valley were consumed. At night, the elixir chamber was sealed to prevent the essence from being disturbed by dryness or contact, and thus the billowing smoke can well be imagined. When the fire below made it impossible to see the characters, the Emperor learned of this and sent *bolü* candles. The *Collected Scrolls* states: *Bolü* is the name of a foreign incense; burning it can brighten the eyes.

The Master believed that such an undertaking was no ordinary matter and required absolute seclusion, far from the noise of the world. Yet this mountain lay perilously close to the imperial court and the bustling market, its groves and forests too shallow and near—everyone spoke of it with expectations, which alchemists strictly forbid. The *Dengzhen Yinjue* states: This matter had become widely known in both court and countryside, with everyone harboring hopes—this was the greatest violation of taboo. Thus, he temporarily changed his surname to Yi and withdrew, journeying far to the east. He considered settling in central Jianjin, where the mountains and seas were vast and remote, and the people, unversed in the Dao, would regard his work as inconsequential, paying it no mind. "If I were to feign death and depart," he thought, "it would not be impossible—but that would only serve a minor path." Feigning death and departing refers to the lower method of *shijie* (corpse liberation), which would prevent him from returning to his homeland and preclude any further refinement of the elixir. Yet if he were to vanish abruptly, it could not serve as a teaching for posterity.

Thus, he petitioned Emperor Wu of Liang with his intentions, but the Emperor found it difficult to comply. The *Collected Scrolls* contains the Emperor’s reply, acknowledging his desire to relocate and seek a secluded site, consulting oracles and divination to determine whether the move should be carried out by men or by spirits. Yet even then, the Emperor hesitated, bound to the land, unable to let go. The Master, however, resolved to proceed directly, harboring no further doubts. Only in his heart did he calculate the way forward—no one else was aware.

Having maintained stillness in his retreat for fifty days, he severed all ties. Then, at midnight, he departed from the mountain—so dark was the sky that no one could see him. With two attendants bearing his belongings, he altered his name and rank to Wang Zhengguan, styling himself "External Soldier." The actions of a Perfected One are beyond the discernment of ordinary minds; these names and titles must surely carry some profound significance.

Initially intending to travel to Kuaiji or perhaps cross to Tiantai, he reached the Zhe River, where the tidal waves were fierce. Thus, he turned upstream to Shuyang and stayed briefly at Changshan. Hearing that the southern route was plagued by maritime raids, he advanced to Chiyan, lodging in a stone chamber by Quxi Stream. There, he dreamed of a voice saying: *"If you seek the returning elixir, seek it between the Three Yong."* Reflecting upon this, he realized it referred to Yongjia, Yongning, and Yongkang. Earlier, when he first established his foundation at Zhuyang, it had been during the reigns of Yongming, Yongtai, and Yongyuan. The dream’s message must point to this very place. Yet if it meant Yongjia, Yongning, and Yongkang, why had his efforts there yielded no fruition? Setting out to investigate, villagers all told him: *"Beyond this chamber, a hundred li uphill lies Lanzhong Mountain in Yongkang—its peaks are the most secluded and lofty."* The next morning, he went to survey the site. The mountain was indeed habitable, though the fields were sparse and gathering husks for fuel would be impossible. The *Collected Scrolls* notes: *"The locals here must husk rice daily to sustain themselves, leaving no chaff to spare."*

Later, he entered Qingzhang Mountain in Nanxi, drawn by its rice fields, and settled there. Yet famine and banditry plagued the land for years, disrupting his plans. The *Collected Scrolls* records: *"This journey of his met with no fortune. Though he had traversed several coastal commanderies without incident, in recent years, no mountain was free of bandits. He tilled his own fields, only to face years of famine."* He then declared: *"I once read in the* Five Marchmounts Atlas *that Mount Huo is the Bureau of Destiny, surely a dwelling place for immortals."* The *Record of Famous Mountains* states: *"Mount Huo lies in Luojiang County, rising 3,400 zhang, its summit spanning 800 li. Here, the Eastern Minister of Destiny, Lord Mao, resides."* Thus, he set out by sea, passing Niucen and emerging at the river mouth. Gazing east toward Fusang, he sighed deeply: *"As the saying goes, ‘Having seen the sea, all other waters seem small; having met a sage, all other words seem shallow.’ All my life, I have pursued every learning—today, I abandon it all."*

Mount Huo stretched six or seven hundred li, its peaks shrouded in clouds like ranks of soldiers. Its cliffs were jagged and towering, unlike any other place. The Master’s steps trod upon this sacred ground, his heart fixed upon the Mysterious Pass, and profound spiritual responses arose—yet these matters remain unrecorded. The land was sparsely populated, and again, the lack of husks posed a problem. The *Collected Scrolls* observes: *"He traversed the region thoroughly, finding nowhere to settle."* He then returned by sea to Yongjia, reaching Tailiu, where the terrain seemed most auspicious. The *Hidden Instructions on Ascending Perfection* notes: *"In the renchen year, sixth month, he sailed back to Yongjia’s Muliu Islet, where ancient fields lay abandoned. The islet stood alone in the sea, uninhabited, yet ideal for refinement."*

Just then, the imperial envoy, Minister of Works Huiming, arrived to summon him back to his former mountain. The *Hidden Instructions* records: *"By the eighth month, he reached Muliu, saw its potential, and began building a hut ashore. In the tenth month, Minister Huiming arrived. The Master wished to remain at Muliu temporarily to discuss matters, but after days of deliberation, Huiming refused. Thus, he accompanied him back."* Along the way, bandits were rampant, and the court pressed for the Master to proceed to the capital. Upon reaching Jinling, he pleaded illness and returned to Huayang. The court ordered the construction of Zhuyang Lodge for his residence, but he declined three times. The decree remained firm. The *Hidden Instructions* states: *"In the jiawu year, he purchased the former residence of Prefect Xu and the Changsha Lodge of the Song, then had Pan Yuanwen and local officials oversee the construction of Zhuyang Lodge. Within the lodge, he built an eastern elixir chamber and a stillness courtyard, claiming to follow the traces of the Mysterious Continent."* The *Hidden Instructions* further notes: *"Long ago, Li Ming refined the Nine-Cauldron Elixir here. Excavating the foundation revealed fragments of old pottery—his former implements."*

Since his return from southern Huo, he had repeatedly attempted the cauldron work, but none succeeded. Yet it was not entirely without resemblance: each time he opened the cauldron, frost-like flowers appeared. His disciples believed this signaled success, but the Master, consulting alchemical texts, explained: *"When the Langgan Elixir is complete, its flying flowers display thirty-seven hues; when the Quchen Elixir is complete, its flying flowers shimmer with a hundred chaotic colors, their radiance flowing and dazzling, dark and profound. When the Great Clarity Golden Liquid Elixir is complete, its flying flowers resemble shooting stars or the moon’s descent, their nine-colored clouds embroidered, their vapor like purple blossoms under the sun, their essence like azure mist in the light. When the Nine-Transmutation Elixir is complete, its flying essence gleams in nine colors, its radiance brilliant—otherwise, it is not yet achieved."* Over the years, what he obtained were only light, frosty flowers, their edges sharp as frost or snow, devoid of mixed hues. In the eighteenth year, he produced a substance of stern hardness, its brilliance surpassing previous attempts—yet it resembled only the fifth or sixth stage of flowering, like a sword’s edge or a vulture’s fang. The residue below was dry and black, crumbling like stars, burning with crimson and yellow smoke. The fire’s intensity varied, sometimes weak, sometimes fierce, and the crimson-yellow never ascended to form script.

At this time, Deng Yu lived on Mount Heng. The *Hidden Instructions* records: *"A native of Yidu in Yiling, he was brought to the capital by Yang Gongze, Governor of Xiangzhou, in the fourth year of Tianjian. He resided temporarily on Mount Jiang and was later granted the implements for the Nine-Transmutation Elixir, ordered to return to the mountain to refine it."* The court provided him with the tools for the Nine-Transmutation Elixir. When the time came to open the cauldron, it contained stalactites, frost, and snow—its radiance dazzling, utterly free of杂色.

Deng did not offer it in tribute but consumed it himself. The *Elixir Canon* states: *"In the first month of the yiwei year, the cauldron was opened."* Above it were stalactites and frost-like snow, while the residue below formed nine layers of purple-black hue. Most who ingested it did so, yet the flying blossoms were given to no one, nor were they offered in tribute. He alone took them to the Southern Cliff to inquire, then concealed them all. Soon after, he fell ill. For eight days, he ailed, and on that evening, the winds and snows of Mount Heng suddenly cleared, revealing a momentary brightness.

The *Hidden Instructions* records: *"At first, Master Deng’s complexion remained unchanged, but after three days, he lay still as if in repose, and over time, his body did not decay."* The *Elixir Formula* states: *"When the elixir is complete and free of杂色 radiance, it is a toxic elixir—ingesting it causes a temporary death, from which one revives after a moment."* The *Elixir Canon* says: *"If the elixir’s cycle is incomplete or its color imperfect, it is called a toxic elixir."* Thus, the *Great Clarity* warns: *"Even a single liang, taken all at once, will cause a temporary death."* In ancient times, Wei Boyang and his disciples compounded an elixir, and one who consumed it died. The others departed, and upon their return, he had already gone. The Master harbored the heart of one who rides clouds and mounts dragons.

He once said: *"At the age of twelve, while perusing the scriptures in the archives, I chanced upon a text copied on yellow silk by a certain Jun Xi, detailing the various elixir methods of the Great Clarity. From that moment, my resolve was firmly set."* When he reached eighteen, he received the supreme Dao and beheld the methods of the Supreme Clarity and Great Ultimate. He then scorned them and did not practice, so why would he now consume a toxic elixir to escape? All he had accumulated over the years, he buried and concealed.

Yet after eighteen years, though the flying blossoms bore no杂色, their radiance was extraordinary. He wished to test them by transmuting base metals into gold and silver to verify their efficacy. The *Elixir Canon* states: *"Take ten jin of lead, place it in an iron vessel, and heat it fiercely until it boils thrice. Then add one zhu of the transmuting blossom to the lead and stir—immediately, it will become gold."* That evening, as he focused his mind in prayerful entreaty, he suddenly saw someone approach, shrouded as if in mist and clouds, who spoke: *"Do not test it. Even if you do, you will not succeed. People today are too greedy—the moment they hear of gold and jade, they seek to make them, violating heavenly prohibitions. This is indeed a success, but it is not yet complete."* The figure then sighed and said: *"Are there still those in the world who ascend to heaven in broad daylight?"* Gradually, he added: *"You will know through your own ingestion."* With these words, the figure vanished like a gust of wind. Thereafter, the Master did not attempt the test.

The Master often said: *"The day of my departure will be like Mao Taiyuan’s departure from Xianyang."* The *Biography of the Perfected of Great Primordial* records: *"When the Perfected departed from Xianyang, he arranged to meet his relatives and fellow villagers on that day. Precious feasts and wondrous music descended from the empty sky, and he then ascended with a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, visible to all in the south."* And like Zhao Guangxin’s ascent at White Cliff. Ge Zhichuan’s *Biographies of Divine Transcendents* states: *"Zhao Guangxin ascended to heaven in broad daylight at White Cliff Mountain in Kuaiji."* He wished to awaken the deluded and leave his name forever in the bamboo annals. Yet he lamented: *"From the beginning, I feared that fate might be unkind and my aspirations unfulfilled."* At last, he sighed and said: *"I once heard a secret teaching that there are nine obstacles to transcendence, and my name is among them. If I do not ascend at dawn in broad daylight, is it because my reputation in the mortal world still lingers?"*

The Southern Perfected, the Venerable One, did not ascend lightly—for the Southern Perfected is the Lady Wei, Purple Void Primordial, who dissolved her form at midnight. As for the minor karmic ties, Xiao Miao’s transformation was also a dissolution. Xiao Ju, the son of Director Xu Yufu, transformed only after paying homage. The old path of the Mystic Master is truly one to be revered and followed.

In the fifth year of Putong, he again applied cinnabar to the cauldron and kindled the fire. On New Year’s Day of the following year, the jiazi day, the cauldron was opened. Its black radiance illuminated all, startling the heart and dazzling the eyes. The substance resembled the earlier one but was adorned with rainbow杂色. From the fourth year of Tianjian, when he first set his mind to this, until now, he had refined it seven times before it was complete.

Earlier, the Minister of Personnel, Xie Lan, dreamed that someone told him: *"The Master of Huayang has attained the Dao. Soon, his office will be to oversee the registers of immortals."* Not long after, a female relative named Qian, who also dwelled in Huayang, became the Master’s disciple, receiving scriptures and talismans. One day, she suddenly took leave. The Master asked where she was going, and Qian replied: *"To become an honored guest in the Golden Towers."* The Master said: *"Several of my disciples have already preceded me."* Qian said: *"You will be the Supervisor of Waters for Penglai."* The Master then crossed the ridge to see her off and presented her with a poem.

In his later years, the Master’s pupils suddenly became square.

*The Record of Master Zhou of Ziyang* states: The Master once encountered Huang Tai in the marketplace and, seeing his square pupils, knew him to be an immortal. He thus sought the transmission of the arts of longevity, whereupon Huang revealed himself as Lord Su of the Upper Realm of Xuanzhou. Some say that those with square pupils live ten thousand years. His gaze and voice were accompanied by strange and wondrous radiance. His literary style and bearing grew ever more refined and transcendent. Though he dwelt in a tower, even his disciples were forbidden to peer inside. He lived in the world for eighty-one years and departed this life on the twelfth day of the third month, the *guichou* day, in the second year of Datong of the Liang (536 CE). That morning, he composed a farewell address to announce his passing, which he presented to his disciples—the text is preserved in the collected works. At the *si* hour, he departed in perfect serenity, his limbs supple, his complexion unchanged, while rare fragrances and numinous vapors filled the mountains and valleys. When his disciples prepared to enshroud him, they found only his empty robes. In the initial stages of his transformation, his body appeared intact, but before long, only his cap, sword, and empty garments remained. On the fourteenth day, his empty coffin was interred at Leiping Mountain. Emperor Wu of Liang posthumously honored him as *Master of Integrity and Purity*. The Master designated his nephew Songqiao as his heir, who continued to reside in Huayang.

During the Qi and Liang dynasties, hundreds of marquises, kings, dukes, and high ministers sought to study under the Master, yet he rejected them all. Only Xu Mian, Jiang You, Qiu Chi, Fan Yun, Jiang Yan, Ren Fang, Xiao Ziyun, Shen Yue, Xie Lun, Xie Lan, and Xie Ju—those who had early in life offered him the homage due a master—continued to receive his guidance even after his retreat from the world. Once, when Shen Yue fell ill, he resolved to resign his office and withdraw from public life. Upon recovering, however, he lingered on in his official post. The Master sent him a letter to rekindle his resolve, to which Shen replied: "My superiors have not granted my request to retire." The Master sighed and said, "This man is truly shallow and insubstantial. Those who delight in bells and tripods regard mountain valleys as places of exile, while those who cherish forests and streams see caps and sashes as fetters and shackles. If one probes to the subtleties, it is clear that bells and tripods cannot compare to mountain valleys. To cringe on the path of honor and disgrace, to tread within the snares of the world—how can this be mentioned in the same breath as roaming freely through groves and marshes, chewing on magic herbs and trees? Even with Shen Xiwen’s exalted rank, the Master still deemed him shallow, for he knew the true value of the

**Imperial Edict of Enfeoffment from the Xuanhe Reign of the Song Dynasty**

We, having received the radiant mandate of the Jade Empyrean and grasped the sacred talisman of the Dragon Han, shall now propagate the numinous decree, exalt the transformative power of the Dao, elucidate the profound teachings of the subtlest doctrines, and extend felicitous destiny to the ranks of the perfected. The Overseer of Waters of Penglai, Tao Hongjing, has long adorned the frontier with his honorable silken robes, his essence refined at the gate of splendor. Though his spirit communes without entanglement, and though he dwells near in the mountains, his sincerity has long since resonated in the unseen, and his poetic gifts have already rendered him immortal upon the seas. How could one, gazing upon his virtue and renown, dare forget the sublime devotion that binds him? Thus, to bestow upon him the glory of a resplendent title and to perpetually bless his life with celestial grace, he shall be specially enfeoffed as **Zongyuan Lingjiao Perfected Realized One**.

**Inscription on the Stele of the Unbinding of the Realized One**
*Composed by Xiao Lun, Prince of Shaoling*

For luminous jades and lustrous greens are not the common treasures of fat-laden baskets, just as soaring wings and leaping scales are not the mere playthings of garden ponds. How could one confine the heart to the narrow and the near, when it knows not the reason for its own boundlessness? Thus did the lofty hermit of Yingyang wash his ears in the Tang court’s stream, and thus did the steadfast recluse of Hanyin erase his traces in the Zhou era. The noble virtue and flowing influence of such men have long had their origins. And he who answers the call of the times to manifest his essence—is he not here before us?

The Master’s name was Hongjing, his courtesy name Tongming. He was originally from Pingyang in Jizhou. His ancestors descended from Emperor Yao of the Taotang clan; when Yao governed Pingyang in Jizhou, his lineage settled there. The dragon-horse appeared bearing the five-colored talisman, and the radiance of reverence displayed the eight auspicious hues. His light illumined all under heaven, and his just governance extended to every office. The wellspring of his lineage was vast and far-reaching, its threads long and unbroken.

When the Han arose, his forebear served as the Right Marshal to Emperor Gaozu. His son, Qingdi, rose to the position of Chancellor. During the late Han, the family crossed south and first settled in Danyang. His seventh-generation ancestor, Jun, served the Wu kingdom as General Who Pacifies the South and Governor of Kezhou. His grandfather, Long, was a Military Advisor to the Southern Commandery under the Song. His father, Zhenbao, was Gentleman of the Palace to the Prince of Jian’an, both men of pure and frugal conduct, widely learned in literature and history.

The Master embodied the harmonious qi of primordial essence, nurturing a refined and profound nature. He encompassed the seven virtues and cultivated the nine powers, practicing benevolence and treading the path of righteousness. Like a mountain, he stood firm; like an abyss, he remained still. His towering integrity could not be glimpsed, his purity and depth could not be fathomed. His Daoist aura soared as high as the Milky Way, his transcendent spirit stretched as far as mist and clouds.

At six, he could read and compose essays. At seven, he recited tens of thousands of words from the *Classic of Filial Piety*, the *Mao Odes*, and the *Analects*. Even the young Yan Zhuang, who studied the ancient canons, or Liu Zhen, who read poetry and rhapsodies in his youth, pale in comparison to him. Thus did his reputation spread like the echoes of Qixi, and thus did the Yellow Emperor’s hymns find voice in him.

A villager once obtained Ge Hong’s *Biographies of Divine Transcendents* and showed him the tales of the Eight Immortals of Huainan. He sighed and said, “Reading this book fills one with the spirit of soaring clouds.” From then on, he recited it day and night without cease.

At twenty-seven, he became the Literary Companion to the Prince of Yidu, overseeing all matters of record.

The court sought the Dao and pursued worthies, while the imperial forest summoned scholars—though the age made selection difficult, all agreed the right man had been found. Could Ruan Ji’s literary records prop Rang’s balance? How might Sun Chu’s rhetorical talents support the chariot’s hub? In the Qi era, the court favored palace construction, and as the old gardens of Green Creek were renovated and new halls erected, he submitted memorials and composed eulogies, his words and matters both surpassing excellence. His *Ode to the Joyful Office* outshone its predecessors, and his *Rhapsody on the Auspicious Blessing* clarified the imperial edict. The emperor perused them at length, praising them ever more, and appointed him Gentleman Attendant at Court.

In office, he was diligent day and night, observing the spring audiences and autumn petitions—such was the discipline of cangues and flogging. Yet the master had never sought glory; he often wished to resign, writing to kin and friends: “My long-held desire was to avoid the world of men. By forty, I would have fulfilled my resolve in the mountains and marshes. Now I am thirty-six, and time does not wait—does one not know the divine subtleties of the moment? To endure hardship for oneself is bitter indeed.” The following year, he submitted a memorial to resign, withdrawing his hairpin beyond the capital’s gates and untying his sash at the northern slopes of the mountains. Like Jiqu’s reclusive dwelling or the Marquis of Liu’s grain-abstinence, he emulated the ancients in transcending his age. Boarding his boat, he set forth eastward. The court bestowed inquiries, and eminent men saw him off. Compared to the two Fus, he embodied the four recluses, rising lightly as if across eras.

Staff in hand, he journeyed afar, traversing famous peaks. Arriving at Jurong, he ascended Mao Ridge. Seeing this place as the palace of divine transcendents and the abode of numinous marvels, he never looked back and chose to dwell there. The master said: “The Master once said, ‘Live in reclusion to seek one’s resolve; practice righteousness to fulfill the Dao.’ I have heard these words but never seen such a person. Now that my righteousness is fulfilled, I no longer seek direction—let me join the pursuit of resolve.” Thus he called himself a recluse, like Ge Hong embracing simplicity or Huangfu Mi’s *Xuan Yan*. Leaning on cliffs and casting his shadow, he concealed his traces among the forests. Branches intertwined to form his hut, and he carved a path for his gate. Overhanging cliffs faced cascading streams, and the wind sighed through the trees. Deep ravines and sheer ridges wove mist and clouds. Pillowing on stone and rinsing his mouth with flowing water, mountain birds did not disturb him; gathering herbs, he met wild beasts that did not scatter. Carefree and unburdened, he roamed the hills. Serene as if lost, steadfast and unshakable.

As the Qi dynasty neared its end, Heaven’s mandate faltered. The southern lands and Luoyang valleys trembled in the *jiachen* year’s earthquake. The master, meditating on hidden patterns, foresaw its omens. Thus, he severed all correspondence near and far. What was once heard of Xia Fu was now witnessed in the master. When our Great Liang’s prosperous destiny arrived on schedule, receiving Heaven’s bright mandate, the Three Luminaries shone clearly, and the Four Seas grew tranquil. The master submitted a memorial in celebration, and thus trust and inquiries resumed.

Since the *Tianjian* era, imperial decrees had often been issued, providing medicines and supplies without fail through the seasons. Such profound grace and favor were unmatched. After seven years, he briefly visited the Southern Marchmount. This mountain was the axis where the winds of fame gathered, the celestial pillar like Kunlun’s heavenly bastion. The Eight Pillars stood nearby, and the Nine Pure Ones were arrayed around it. Trees bore jade-like leaves, and grasses grew like chariots and cavalry. Leaving the world behind, he forgot to return.

In the eleventh year, an imperial edict dispatched the Left Minister Huiming to summon the master back to Mount Mao, granting him a separate residence. Even the descent of the Lord of the Gourd to the Celestial Elder or the Han emperor’s courtesies to the Old Man of the River could not surpass this day’s honor. Nurturing his resolve in the mountain’s embrace for many years, he cultivated life well, and numinous blessings descended. Fierce beasts did not lurk, and demons did not appear. His courtyard was free of brambles, much like Confucius’s neighborhood. Steps flowed with sacred springs, and nearby trees flourished. Then feathered transcendents wandered about, immortals ascended and descended, phoenixes and simurghs gathered, and magic mushrooms grew lush.

In the second year of *Datong*, the cyclical year *bingchen*, on the twelfth day of the third month (a *guichou* day), he departed this life at the age of eighty-one. The Son of Heaven mourned, and the Crown Prince grieved. An edict praised his virtues, posthumously appointing him Grand Master for Palace Attendants and conferring the posthumous title *Master of Integrity and Purity*. Such was the ritual.

On the fourteenth day of the same month, he was interred at Leiping Mountain in Jurong County, Danyang Commandery—like the Yellow Emperor’s burial of his robes and cap or Wangzi Qiao’s concealment of his sword in the crow, this day matched those precedents. The master’s bearing was profound and composed, his thoughts refined and rich. He embodied hidden virtue and upright fortune, yet did not cultivate mere propriety. Nearing middle age, he was no square confined by its rules. His brows and eyes were clear, his appearance fresh and pure. He neither forgot encouragement nor discouraged others, often practicing kindness and favor. He treasured time and loved ancient texts. His resolve was steadfast, his integrity enduring to white-haired age.

As for the *Hongbao* secrets of Huainan, the seismograph of Longxi, the *Taiyi Dunjia* texts, the *Nine Chapters* of calendrical calculations, the swift brushwork of Kong Rong, the marvelous *Fengjiao* divination of Zihua, the *Suwen* formulas of the Grand Granary, and the *Qin Cao* melodies of the Central Dispersed Master—he sought them all and mastered each. Even Yi’s archery, Xun’s *Fen* divination, Su’s oracle bones, and Guan’s milfoil—he grasped them at a glance without effort. Zhang Hua’s encyclopedic knowledge, Ma Jun’s ingenuity, Liu Xiang’s subtlety, and Ge Hong’s life-nurturing arts—he combined the talents of these worthies in one person.

His disciples, including Huan Famin, admired the distant winds of the Hou clan and cherished the lingering thoughts of Qiao Yang. They carved a dark stele to record his essence, spreading his fragrant reputation through the crimson clouds. Thus an inscription was composed:

The crow’s departure marks transformation,
The abandoned sword congeals spirit.
Wandering the purple empyrean,
Illuminating the cinnabar groves.
His traces remain,
His winds may yet be followed.
Who shall inherit this profound legacy?

A man of virtue, his conduct surpasses all,
His great power renews daily.
Bright as a hanging mirror,
Lush as pure bamboo.
His person embodies the Dao,
His actions never stray from benevolence.
Once he roamed the court,
Adorning the girdles of officials.
Weary of governance,
Laboring to guide the lost.
Having untied his sash,
He donned a mountain kerchief.
Far he sought valleys and peaks,
Loftily transcending the dust.
His heart held no worldly ties,
His reclusion did not sever truth.

Amidst towering cliffs he built his abode,
In verdant grasses made his steadfast retreat.
Like ice and jade, his years endured,
His essence preserved, defying age’s blight.

Thus arose his noble renown—
A life of vigor, longevity, and ease.
White waters flowed past his courtyard,
Steep peaks loomed o’er the ravine.
Dew adorned the orchid steps,
Clouds wreathed the cassia beams.
As the sun slanted o’er the bamboo mat,
Blossoms drifted past the window jar.
Shang Ping never returned,
The noble scion tarried not.
Seas and mulberries shift their bounds,
Hills and valleys alter their form.
Yet this sturdy stele stands firm,
His fragrant legacy enduring ten thousand years.

**Inscription on the Reverse of the Stele**
By Sima Daoyin Zimiao of Huanè, White Cloud Daoist of Huafeng, Tiantai

Great is the Dao’s origin—
The myriad spirits draw sustenance from its womb.
Its spontaneity is elusive, unfathomable;
Its generation and completion, veiled yet discernible in misty qi.

As for those who study scriptures and methods,
Who refine their thoughts to stir profound resonance,
Who harmonize and transmute the elixir,
Refining body and spirit into unity—
Though they may ascend the Three Clarities,
Few since antiquity have attained perfection.
Yet one who gathers and embodies these,
Who discerns and distinguishes them,
Who dwells in stillness,
Who practices with diligence—
Was he not the Venerable Zhenbai?

Born with numinous qi,
He dreamed of a dragon’s ascent while still in the womb.
His bearing was noble, his spirit radiant,
His bone-record marked with the crane-immortal’s sign.
His mind was a luminous mirror,
Penetrating all without omission.
His vessel was like a great bell,
Receptive and responsive in its emptiness.

Thus the celestial scriptures’ true transmissions
Were fully gathered at Zhaotai;
Arcane meanings and subtle words
Were all entrusted to his numinous mind.
He compiled and categorized texts,
Expanding them into comprehensive works.
He amplified the phoenix-script of golden writ,
Enriched the dragon-seals of jade tablets,
Revealed hidden mysteries of the past,
Dispelled ignorance in later learners.
As a teacher to the host of perfected,
He became a guiding light for a hundred generations.

Beholding his painted likeness,
The Dao is present at a glance;
Perusing his writings,
His spirit shines through the words.
Though a thousand years may pass,
His essence may yet be grasped in a single morning.

As for the marvels of mystical resonance in meditation,
The safeguards of refining form and transcending mortality—
These I do not know,
For their principles defy detailed recounting.

Yet in cultivating his person and virtuous deeds,
He mastered the full spectrum of Daoist arts.
By the standards of the celestial ranks,
He far surpassed the true stages.
Though his destiny followed a singular path,
His manifest and hidden ways diverged.
He responded to the dissolution of shadows,
Never striving for dawn’s ascent.
Mysteriously ascending to the Upper Clarity,
His course remains beyond all measure.

Yet as he vanished like clouds at his desk,
His reed chamber still stands;
His sword of transcendence has not yet flown,
The hidden mound remains sealed.
Revered in Dao, noble in virtue,
His legacy endures through all ages.
Though we may seek his form through his writings,
He is no longer visible today.
Dynasties have changed in succession,
Mountains and eras have grown estranged.
Ever cherishing his immortal spirit,
We are moved to profound lament.

As Zimiao prepared to journey to Mount Heng,
He briefly sojourned at Maoshan,
Where he gathered with fellow practitioners of the Dao.
Shaoling composed a eulogy in his honor,
And now I inscribe these words to preserve his deeds.
Thus I wield my clumsy brush,
Briefly recounting the true path,
Recording it on the stele’s reverse,
To illuminate the age for posterity.

Written on the thirteenth day of the ninth month, the year *jiazi* of the *Kaiyuan* reign, the twentieth year of the Great Tang.

**Epitaph**
Composed by Prince Zhaoming of Liang

In the second year of *Datong*, the year of *jingshen* in the cyclical calendar,
In the third month, the twelfth day after the new moon of *renyin*,
At the hour of *sichou*,
Master Tao of Huayang Cave shed his cicada-shell at Zhuyang Lodge on Maoshan.
The Master’s personal name was Hongjing, his courtesy name Tongming,
And he lived eighty-one years.
His limbs remained supple, his complexion unchanged.
By imperial decree, he was posthumously appointed *Zhongsan Dafu*,
And granted the posthumous title *Zhenbai Xiansheng*.
A court emissary was dispatched to oversee the funeral rites.
On the fourteenth day, at the hour of *sichou*,
He was interred at Mount Leiping.

For the true Dao, returning to emptiness is beauty;
The Way finds its truth in boundlessness.
Unattached to life, he embodied great virtue;
Unfearing of death, his valley spirit never perished.
Wondrous indeed—
His transformations between concealment and revelation,
Beyond all mortal comprehension.

Then the mountain cleft parted,
A jade coffin descended from the heavens.
Silver script ceased its whispering,
Flowing pearls stilled their glow.
A nine-jointed turtle gleamed in the sky,
A thousand harmonies burned beneath the earth.
The immortals rejoiced in finding a companion,
While his disciples mourned in the empty valleys.

I once dwelt in the dust of the world,
Early encountering the arts of the ruined wall;
Now, as tutor to the crown prince,
I have repeatedly received the teachings of Fuqiu.
Clutching the talisman of his departure, I grieve;
Longing for his transformed staff, I ache with sorrow.
Thus I compose this inscription:

The Dao without name,
The immortal who does not die—
There were Yuanfang of old,
And Zichuan who shared his renown.
Escaping form, dissolving transformation,
Such has ever been the way.
How splendid was the Master—
Enrolled among the immortals, he returned to the origin.
His pear-like writings were passed by a hidden scribe,
His books conveyed by a merchant’s vessel.
His tiger chariot illumined the shadows,
His cast-off shell brushed the clouds.
The lingering blossoms gleam in the spring ravine,
The murmuring streams flow lushly through Maoling.
Oh, the boundless grotto-heaven—
When shall the three white cranes return?

---

**Shen Yue’s Response to Master Huayang**

The Three Clarities may not be coveted,
Yet one realm still endures in emptiness.
I wish only to turn back the light,
To rescue the imperiled and redeem the lost.
If granted the gift of the nine elixirs,
What fear would I have of the six dragons’ flight?
Long have I desired to seek the famed mountains,
But must wait until my children’s marriages are complete.
Though these two matters are now settled,
Countless others remain unresolved.
Suddenly I hear the dragon chart has arrived,
And see the dragon’s radiance overflowing.
At dawn, the Eight Primes open the earth,
And a thousand households compose their odes.
Never once has he shown his cap or tassels,
Nor combed his hair through wind and rain.
The jade chime resounds at the grotto gate,
The golden cicada gleams in the morning sun.
Though no petty man repays his kindness,
I have presumptuously received the rank of prefect.
How could I forget my lifelong aspirations?
Yet with no leisure to attend to them, I am filled with remorse.
I have heard the superior man say
That a single *chi* of wood can soar to the heavens.
Cloud carriages do not touch the earth,
And the immortal’s abode is rich with kindling.
He awaits the blossoming of the three sacred fungi,
Sitting as a hundred spirits pay homage.
His letters are borne by blue crows,
His honored guests arrive on dragon bridles.
Not only do the divine peaches bear fruit,
But the great pillars of the earth wither.
Feasting on jade, he halts the march of years,
Swallowing auroras, he restores his youthful visage.
Dimly I recognize the trees of Qingqiu,
And once more behold the sun of Fusang.
Resplendent, the shimmering mirage unfurls,
Towering, the mountains and seas emerge.

**Su Chang of Houlu’s Eulogy for Master Tao’s Portrait**

The marvelous words of the alchemical pearl
Illuminate the pages of his writings.

Amid the haze of the three halls, his person recedes into the distance.
As the age declines and the Dao is lost, those who preserve their integrity are few.
His lament at life’s end became a *he* and *bian* for the world.
Here concludes the second scroll of *The Inner Biography of Master Tao of Huayang*.
